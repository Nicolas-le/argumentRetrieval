#### Abstract
>Relying on the background of document retrieval systems, this paper presents an argument retrieval system. It uses state of the art python libraries to automatically process a data set of arguments from the args.me corpus and store them in a custom index. The system can perform the process of ranking and ordering a list of relevant documents in response to a user's query by comparing the request to the produced index of documents. The special focus is on the use of several NLP-based analyses, including topic signal modeling, stylometric analysis, and primarily bias detection. These methods will be used to influence the ranking of the search engine.

#### Use

`git clone https://github.com/Nicolas-le/argumentRetrieval.git`

`cd argumentRetrieval`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 main.py --i <source> --o <output-file>`

**source:** Link to directory, has to be structured in the same way as the args.me corpus [https://webis.de/data/args-me-corpus.html]

**output-file:** Link to directory with run.txt file existing in it.

**example:** `python3 main.py --i ./code_base/corpus --o ./code_base/run`
___

#### Elastic Search

Elastic Search has to be running as a service before starting the retrieval process. If it's not starting automatically use this command:

`sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service`
