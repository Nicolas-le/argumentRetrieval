            "conclusion": "Ex-felons who commited minor crimes or crimes at a early age should be allowed to vote",
            "premise": "Intro: Voting is a right that everyone should have, voting allows people to express how they feel and different opinions and this is a belief that is an important American value to have. Since ex-felons are citizens and since they have served their time and went through all the requirements to get out of their punishment they have every right to vote. Also not allowing criminals to vote will not change the way they act or help them become productive citizens so there is no benefit from it anyway. 1.Broadness of a felon/some committed crimes as kids A felon could be a man who raped and murdered someone in cold blood, but also could be a young man who, after crashing his car into another, drove off out of fear. A felony conviction doesn't automatically make someone so bad of a person that they shouldn't be allowed to vote. Also some committed a crime or action as a kid or teenager and since then they have changed or learned from it, so their right to vote should be given back. 2.Taxation without representation \"If you are free and required to pay taxes, which funds the salaries of government officials, then you should have the right to vote for those who will receive those salaries. \"America was founded on the concept of no taxation without representation. If felons have paid their debt to society and did the time for their crimes, they should be allowed to vote. They shouldn't be required to pay sales tax and income tax without the ability to influence governmental policy through the ballot. 3.Some claim that some ex-felons go back to jail \"Justice.gov shows that 50% of felons who could not secure any employment during the time of their supervised release (generally two-to-five years) committed a new crime or violated the terms of their release and were sent back to prison. However, an astonishing 93% of those who were able to secure employment during the entirety of their supervised release were able to successfully reintegrate back into society and not return to prison. \"So the clear solution is to help ex-felons returning to the society find jobs and again not all return to jail anyway. 4.Benefits of ex-felons voting \"According to Think Progress: 21 out of 45 countries surveyed have NO restrictions on felon voting at all. Only 5 out of 45 countries bar felons from voting after they've served their sentence. These countries are doing quite well with felons being able to voice their opinions in politics. IF we really want to remain status as a free country as a country you can have opportunities in we shouldn\"t limit freedom of speech. \"Returning the vote to ex-felons promotes re-integration and gives them representation not only in presidential and state elections, but in the evolution of the laws governing the criminal justice system, which most of us can agree is imperfect also the best way to see problems and issues with the criminal justice system is from people who have experienced it themselves. 5.Racial felon disenfranchisement laws/ racist voting \"In America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. Although well over a century has passed since post-Reconstruction states used these measures to strip African Americans of their most fundamental rights, the impact of felony disenfranchisement on modern communities of color remains both disproportionate and unacceptable. Throughout America, 2.2 million black citizens \" or nearly one in 13 African-American adults \" are banned from voting because of these laws. This is way more than the amount of white individuals affected by the same laws in the same states, thus creating an imbalance at the ballot box. This creates discrimination against minorities, especially when they have the potential to change the outcome of a race. According to the Georgetown Law Journal: Felon disenfranchisement has tremendous effects on the political landscape - leading researchers report that felon disenfranchisement \"may have altered the outcome of as many as seven recent U.S. Senate elections and one presidential election.\" Conclusion: the main point however is the fact that no harm comes from letting a ex-felon, even a felon vote. I am not arguing for felons but I am just trying to point out something here. Felons/ex-felons are just as ignorant to politics as most Americans so they have the overall similar political knowledge, since both ex-felons and Americans harm voting by overall being ignorant of the voters they are voting for, both should be allowed to vote. Response to what my opponent said: Since most of the felons/ex-felons who commit these crimes as a kid tend to be in poorer/ghetto areas they do not have any knowledge whatsoever over the privileges lost when doing something, they do not realize they will lose the right to vote.",

            "premise": "Thank you to the person who accepts this debate. I wish you luck and hopefully one of us will be able to convince the other. Felony disenfranchisement or in simpler terms \u2013 denying the right of a felon to vote, has been a long practiced throughout many parts of the world. People who agree with this say that the felon in question has broken their 'social contract' with society and therefore should not be allowed to vote. First off we have to consider the people who this law affects. Many people get convicted in high school of minor crimes that still fall under the heading of a felony. An example of this would being stealing street signs. Then many years later that person who by now has presumably learned their lesson and paid their debt to society wants to take part in one of the greatest and most important acts they will ever do - voting. But because of their past crimes they will be denied their right to do so. What if someone is convicted for a crime like drug possession, but they and many other people think that it shouldn't be a crime. Because of laws that prohibit them from voting you are denying perhaps their only way to disagree with the system that got them in trouble in the first place. It is because of examples like the ones above that Felony disenfranchisement falls under the category of 'cruel and unusual punishment'. We have prison sentences and fines handed out by the courts for a reason, which is to pay your debt to society. To add onto this by denying people the right to vote, by saying because of something that you did in your past and now regret you will never be allowed to vote again is heinous.",

            "conclusion": "Felon Voting",
            "premise": "Five point three million Americans are denied the right to vote, simply because of their criminal records. If these convicts were able to vote it may amount to the difference in who our country's own president may be. It could have a huge impact on the laws that are in affect as well. This is why I stand in firm affirmation of the resolution; Resolved: in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Jeremy Travis, stated that, \"In more than a dozen states, a convicted felon loses the right to vote-for life. Thirty-two states prohibit offenders on probation or parole from voting.\" \"In states with lifetime bans, the consequences for democratic participation are deeply disturbing.\" Before we discuss the topic any farther I would first like to establish and clarify some key definitions and terms. Democratic:pertaining to or characterized by the principle of political or social equality for all Society: a highly structured system of human organization for large-scale community living that normally furnishes protection, continuity, security, and a national identity for its members Felon:one who has committed a felony Retain:to continue to use, practice Right to Vote:a legal right guaranteed by the United States Constitution Contention 1:Convicts and Ex-convicts are treated like any other average citizen in every other aspect of their lives. Felons are expected to follow and obey the laws just the same as you and me. Why should we not give them the right to help choose the leaders they have to follow and vote on the laws that they are expected to obey? If felons are responsible to uphold the standard set by society, they should have the same rights and privileges as others. Steve Chapman stated, \"We let ex-cons marry, reproduce, buy beer, own property, and drive. They don't lose their freedom of religion, their right against self-incrimination, or their right not to have soldiers quartered in their home in a time of war. But, the assumption in most places is that they can't be trusted to help choose our leaders. If we thought criminals could never be reformed, we wouldn't let them out of prison in the first place.\" In some states, Maine and Vermont, felons are allowed to vote even while being incarcerated. How can one justify this being fair to a convict in Missouri. It should be a standard all across the board that everyone's voting rights are treated equally, even a felon's(see Equal Protection Clause, Contention 3). Allowing one felon to vote and not allowing another to is creating a double standard based on location, which has no legitimate effect on voting rights. Contention 2:Felons are serving or have served the punishment they were sentenced for their crime. A judge is a highly trained professional. They make decisions to determine punishments and consequences accordingly. When they sentence a felon they sentence them to a punishment that is adequate to the crime they committed. There is no reason for society to think of themselves above a felon and impose further regulations. It is not our place to judge others when we ourselves could just as easily be in their place. By denying a felon this right we are demoralizing them and depriving them of their basic human rights. We are alienating them from society. A felon has already been given a punishment for the crime they committed so why should we make them keep suffering for something that happened in the past and was already dealt with? We are taking away the capability for a felon to fix their life and reform into the \"average Joe.\" By doing this we are putting society in a susceptible position. Contention 3: The right for everybody to vote is protected by the constitution. Amendment VIII of the Constitution states, \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted.\" Also according to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, \"Congress finds that the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right.\" Contrary to the beliefs of many that voting is a privilege, Congress itself wrote that it is a right that ALL United States citizens have, regardless of any discriminatory factor. Lastly, there is this little part of the Constitution that is referred to as \"The Equal Protection Clause.(Amendment XIV, Section 1).\" It states that, \"No state shall enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" This makes it clear that any ordinance outlawing a citizen's right to vote is unconstitutional. The United States was established under the values and morals of our country's founding fathers. As I have shown with my three points of contention, they clearly had the intent of allowing all citizens the right to vote, no matter what the circumstances may have been. Felons, as I stated in my first contention, are expected to follow the same laws. Taking away more basic human rights separates them from society. If citizens expect laws to be followed, everyone needs equal input on the making of these laws. Not only do we need to follow through with the resolution because of the hypocrisy and double-standards involved, but also because it is protected constitutionally. The VIII amendment to the constitution, The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Equal Protection Clause all reference that disenfranchisement is wrong. Also, Making a felon pay for their mistake even after completing their sentencing completely violates my second point of contention. They were given an appropriate sentencing. Taking away the right to vote was not included in it. For the reasons I have stated above I know the affirmative side is the right side. This is why I urge you to return a negative ballot today. Thank You.",

            "premise": "Though my opponent's profile says he lives in India, this debate is about felons and the right to vote in a democratic society. I am unfamiliar with Indian laws and societal expectations, as well as their standards for democracy, and under the assumption that most debat.com members are from the US I will address this issue from an American standpoint, unless my opponent can show me a reason to do otherwise. Also, standards for felonies are no longer applied in other common law countries as they have been replaced with \"summary offences\" and \"indictable offences\". In modern democracies, a felon is someone convicted of a felony. Felonies under the US Criminal Code are generally offenses that mandate a prison term of one year or more. Anything less is generally a misdemeanor or civil offense. (http://www4.law.cornell.edu...) Because of the different gravity of different crimes which may be considered felonies, it is impossible to lay out a blanket ban on voting by convicted felons. Punishment for crimes in the US and other democracies is generally considered \"correction\" or rehabilitation, and the goal is to re-integrate rehabilitated criminals into society. The deprivation of life, liberty, and/or property is generally considered appropriate punishment for various felonies, and an assigned timeframe is allotted that is generally considered befitting the crime. The basic use of punishment and reward is the basis of all criminal theory. Ordinary crime is not a threat to the social order, and society needs criminal behavior and the legal responses to it to function properly. (http://www.criminology.fsu.edu...) Putting aside the fact that all 50 states allow felons to vote to some degree(http://www.ncsl.org...), I personally believe that to fully integrate a rehabilitated criminal into society he/she must first believe he/she will be allowed that opportunity. Indeed, living in a democratic society, the right to vote is an essential part of full integration into a democratic society. So unless felons are executed or jailed for life, the right to vote should be an incentive of completing rehabilitation when rehabilitation is an option. Now on to my opponent's contentions... My opponent's first contention is based on retribution to prevent chaos and despair. I point to the US where, again, all 50 states and DC allow felons to vote to some degree- some states only through a pardon, and the US has not devolved into chaos and despair. The US has stiff penalties for crimes such as murder, espionage, treason, and other felonies for which a criminal's voting rights may never be restored, and it has lesser penalties for, say, possession of more than one ounce of marijuana which is a felony in most states, and constitutes an average of 1 year in prison(www.norml.org). I assure you this crime is not grievous enough for society to devolve into chaos should it continue, and a person convicted of this crime is not necessarily too \"untrustworthy\" to be involved in electoral politics. My opponent's second contention, unfortunately, does not make much sense to me. I cannot imagine a democratic society NOT made up of people. In a democratic society of a few or millions of people, it would be up to those people to decide how felons should be treated. The former Assistant State Attorney General for the State Elections Division of Alabama says: \"Under the longstanding system, a felon may apply to regain his right to vote after serving his sentence and paying all fines and restitution that may be due. This is a sound practice. It ensures that only those criminals who have met their obligations to their victims and who have enough civic pride to apply for renewed voting rights can play a role in selecting our community, state and national leaders.\" (http://www.al.com...). I don't contend that felons \"should have the right to vote in every circumstance and situation\", and it is both unreasonable and unrealistic to take an absolute position on an issue that will have varying degrees of circumstance, ie. a murderer vs. an old lady who assists inmates with legal issues without realizing she was breaking the law (http://www.ahrc.com...). My opponent's third contention only addresses murder. Even with murder there are several degrees. My opponent affirms that one right violation allows another rights violation to exist, but in the same paragraph he states that individuals in a society may not violate others' rights in a society. This is a contradiction, but I will nonetheless address the issue. The deprivation of rights for violation of rights is part of the criminal theory. It is necessary for the proper function of society, but the deprivation of rights should (in most cases) be employed as rehabilitation. Once all faults are corrected, fines paid, and punishment completed it should be recognized as such. The continued disenfranchisement of a convicted felon who has put effort into reintegration is unjust, and goes against the fundamentals of both the correctional system and democracy itself. My opponent's fourth contention is based on semantics, but he wrote the resolution, not me. In recognition of this clever trap, let's define \"ought\" in the context of the resolution and the debate: ought: \u2014used to express obligation , advisability , natural expectation , or logical consequence All points can be argued for pro successfully, but please choose one so as not to turn this into a wasted debate about semantics. Should society be \"obligated\"? No. My personal opinion is that a society attempting to be just will at least to some degree allow felons to vote based on established law, which would imply obligation to do so. Because it is my personal opinion, I would use my vote to \"advise\" society to allow felons to vote to some degree. It is a \"natural expectation\" of many criminologists as cited in my previous sources. It is also the \"logical consequence\" of laws already in place in the US. Thank you.",

            "conclusion": "Convicted ex-felons should be able to vote in all US elections.",
            "premise": "An excellent opening argument put forth by my opponent. My opponent's contentions were P1: Many felons return to prison within 3 years for the same or a different crime P2: It would not be fair to citizens who have never been convicted of a felony P3: Felons should gain the right to vote, by proving that their judgement is valid I'll start by refuting them. P1: Many felons return to prison within 3 years for the same or different crime It may be true that many ex-felons are convicted again, however, my opponent fails to realize that a felon is usually put on parole and/or probation for 3 or more years after being released from prison. These felons are allowed to vote if and only if they are released from all kinds of probation/parole. P2: It would not be fair to citizens who have never been convicted of a felony My opponent claims that giving citizens and ex-felons on even ground is somehow unfair to the group that did not commit a crime (normal citizens). However, the whole point of letting a felon out of prison is to try and let them blend back into normal life, so to speak. But how can they blend back if they forever have a black shadow looming over them? It would not be \"fair\" to hand a prisoner a lifelong sentence if they've already served their time, but this is what my opponent wants to do. P3: Felons should gain the right to vote by proving that their judgement is valid The main point here is \"gain the right to vote\" not HAVE the right to vote. By serving their sentence and fulfilling their civic duties, felons gain their full rights. Also, I'd like to request that my opponent provides evidence for this point and put forth a more detailed solution. How will they earn the right to vote? Having refuted all my opponent's points, I'll move on to my own: P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. P3: Ex-felons deserve the right to vote. P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. I've proven in the previous round that not just one, but multiple amendments are violated. 1. The 8th Amendment -- Disenfranchisement for LIFE falls under the category of \"excessive sanctions.\" The prisoner has already served his sentence. He's supposed to be free now, right? But the government still sanctions him on the right to vote. This is clearly a violation of the felon's 8th amendment rights. 2. The 15th Amendment -- Disenfranchisement after release from prison/probation/parole is like denying the citizen the right on account of \"previous condition of servitude.\" The main point here is PREVIOUS condition. It is (quite obviously) true that a ex-felon has been in prison, and I'm not arguing for them to be allowed to vote FROM prison. But after they're out, logically their right should be returned to them by the 15th amendment. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. When so many people of a minority race are not allowed to vote, this clearly creates an imbalance between races. America is known as the \"Great Melting Pot\" of diversity, but how can we continue to boast this if one minority is a million people down at the ballot box while others go on almost like normal? An overwhelming majority of ex-felons are African American or Hispanic. Not only is this unfair, it actually bolsters crime later on -- it backfires, doing the opposite of what it's supposed to do. According to USA Today: The right to vote helps people get more educated on issues they care about. Also, people who can't voice their opinion in the law might resort -- AGAIN -- to breaking it. Sentencing Project: An overwhelming 78% of all repeated offenses had been disenfranchised. This creates an endless cycle: person commits crime, person can't vote, person commits crime again, person still can't vote. We need to prevent things like this from happening by allowing ex-felons to vote. P3: Ex-felons deserve the right to vote. A felon is essentially a person who makes a mistake. True, a BIG mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. They are still human beings and part of our society, like it or not. They could be limited on the issues they are allowed to vote on, like bills and laws, but they should be allowed to vote in elections. Ex-felons are still affected by the next President. They are still affected by their next Senator. If they're going to follow the law, they should have a say in who makes the law. People can't be persecuted for the past. This concludes my argument for this round. Thank you, I look forward to my opponent's response :)",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote.",
            "premise": "Legislatures in 16 states have loosened voting restrictions on felons over the last decade, according to a new report, a trend hailed by some rights advocates as a step toward democratic principles and fairness, especially for black Americans. What voting restrictions, if any, should be placed on felons? Because of their high incarceration rate, blacks are most affected by the voting bans that vary widely among the states, with many barring current inmates and parolees from voting until they have fulfilled their sentences, and some barring felons for life. In recent years, Iowa, Nebraska and New Mexico have repealed their lifetime bans on voting by people who have been convicted of felonies, and several other states made it easier for freed prisoners or those on probation to vote, according to the report, issued yesterday by the Sentencing Project, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. The recent changes have restored voting rights to more than 600,000 individuals, the report said. But because the country's prison population has continued to rise, a record number of Americans, 5.3 million, are still denied the vote because of criminal records, it concluded. \"It's good news that many people who'd been disqualified from voting are being re-engaged as citizens,\" said Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a leader of the movement to smooth the re-entry of prisoners to society. \"I think people are realizing that the country had gone too far in marginalizing a large group of people who have been convicted of felonies,\" Mr. Travis said. \"This has had profound consequences for our democracy and the participation of minorities.\" But some conservatives remain philosophically opposed to any wholesale loosening of voting restrictions. \"If you're not willing to follow the law, then you shouldn't't claim the right to make the law for someone else,\" said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative advocacy group in Washington. Mr. Clegg, who was a senior Justice Department official in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, said that those convicted of felonies should be given the vote only case by case, when they have proved to be constructive members of society. Some restrictions on voting date to the early years of the country or to the post-Civil-War period, while others were tightened during the \"get tough on crime\" era of the 1980's. By federal law, voter rules are mainly set by the states. As a result, even in presidential elections, former prisoners can vote in some states but not others. Only two states, Maine and Vermont, have no restrictions, even permitting inmates to vote. At the other extreme, three states, Florida, Kentucky and Virginia, still have lifetime bans on voting by felons. Nine others bar selected groups of offenders for life. New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, like most states, do not allow current inmates or parolees to vote. In a ballot initiative in Rhode Island this November, voters will decide whether to restore voting rights to prisoners on parole or probation, who far outnumber inmates. Early polls show public support for the measure. Advocates of change emphasize broad arguments about democratic process, but the racial disparities give the issue a special resonance and raise questions about the representation of minorities in politics. In 2004, one in eight black men were unable to vote because of a felony conviction, the report said, a rate many times higher than that for other groups. Felony convictions have left one in four black men barred from voting in five states: Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Virginia and Wyoming, said Ryan S. King, author of the report and a policy analyst at the Sentencing Project. But Mr. Clog argued that the voting restrictions were applied evenhandedly, and that just because they had a disproportionate impact on one group, that did not make them racially discriminatory. Though data on felon voting patterns are murky, a large majority of former prisoners are believed to lean Democratic. Even with a low turnout rate, their participation could make a difference in close races, experts say. Florida's rules, for example, might have been a factor in the 2000 presidential election. Most black voters in Florida say that the state should overturn the law that prevents a half-million people of all races from casting a ballot because they are convicted felons, a St. Petersburg Times poll shows. The survey says that nine of 10 black voters in Florida think that felons who pay their debt to society should automatically have their voting right restored. Florida is one of nine states that deny the right to vote to all convicted felons who have served their time. Felons can have their rights restored by appealing to the governor and Cabinet, often a lengthy process. Support for a change to the state law is uniformly high among men and women, Republicans and Democrats, and all age groups, according to a survey of 600 African-Americans conducted by Washington-based Schroth and Associates for the St. Petersburg Times. Florida's law has been part of the state's political landscape since the 1800s and has spurred a federal class-action lawsuit against the governor and spawned several legislative efforts to overturn it. The law disproportionately impacts blacks, who tend to vote Democratic. Indeed, some research suggests that ex-felons of all races lean toward the Democratic Party. Some experts contend a change could have a big political effect in a state that was shown during last year's presidential race to be closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law estimates that 500,000 felons in Florida are affected by the law. Of those, 139,000 are black people, according to the center. Christopher Uggen, a University of Minnesota sociologist who has studied the political consequences of felon disenfranchisement laws, contends that Gore would have won Florida if felons would have been allowed to vote last year. He also speculates that Florida's retired U.S. Sen. Connie Mack probably would not have won his close 1988 election if felons had been allowed to vote. However, lawyers for Gov. Jeb Bush's office have argued that the number of people who can't vote because of the law is much lower than the 500,000 cited by opponents. State Rep. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, has filed two bills that would give felons their voting rights one year after they satisfy all sentences. Four similar bills are filed in the Senate. All are assigned to several committees -- a sign that they might have tough going in the GOP-controlled Legislature. But Smith said House Speaker Tom Feeney has floated a compromise that would allow ex-felons to apply to a local judge for clemency. Feeney was not available to comment. House Majority Leader Mike Fasano said he was unaware of any compromise offers, adding that he thought the state's present clemency process is adequate. The Republican caucus has not taken a stance on the bills though, Fasano said, and he expected vigorous committee discussion on them. Whether the bills make it to the floor of the Republican-dominated body depends on the committee chairs, he said. Gov. Bush's Select Election Task Force also has identified the issue as critical and referred it to the Legislature for review and possible action.",

            "premise": "My opponent brings up some new argument at first about how he is trying to focus on a new generation and show kids/younger people the harmful effects of alcohol and committing crimes. However there is already a program that trys to decrease the demand of drugs which is called DARE and so far it hasn't been that successful. I am not saying it's not a good program to have I am just saying that as long as Americans continue to demand illegal drugs, drug cartels and other organizations will keep sending them here. Also my opponent must realize that most felons who commit crimes like theft, which is the most common one, do a lot of these crimes due to what they are exposed to, or because they are poor and need food. So you can't just tell them \"drugs are bad\" and expect them to listen. You have to improve there economic conditions and give them a replacement for drugs, something more appealing that isn't dangerous. This logic is the same reason why the war on drugs doesn't work, you can't just remove all the drugs and except them to stop, the reason why fights increase after the drugs are removed is because they still have a desire for the drugs, and therefore will do whatever it takes to get them. My opponent try's to attack my contention saying taxation without representation, but he mentions the argument and goes completely over it. The argument is just saying that since they pay certain taxes to the government and for some of the people who work in the government they should be able to vote for people in the government. It's just a logical argument that has no holes in it. He skips over the argument he trys to make and again says that 5.83 million people don't matter. He is dismissing American citizens. That is like me saying \"oh forget about the unemployed they only make 5% of the American population lets focus on most Americans who at least have a job and can actually benefit the economy.\" He claims that my ex felons contention helps him but it doesn't actually, it shows that 90% of ex-felons who get jobs don't go back to jail so why punish those and not allow them to vote if they are proper citizens? The contention is pointing out that not all ex-felons go back to jail. Main argument against my opponent: is how he is basically saying that we should leave ex-felons alone and let them go with punishments some that last forever just to show people what happens when they don't listen? First of all it is common sense that when you commit crimes you can end up in jail, and a lot of people realize that a year sentence or so results in a Felony, they don't need extra things to know this. The main argument against this idea is that ex-felons can be primary sources with or without voting. What I mean by this is that ex-felons can share their stories so society will still learn the consequences of actions from ex-felons themselves. Giving them the right to vote will still leave the other punishments they have and still make felony a popular sentence well known among Americans. Conclusion: The reason why I win is because my opponent never really goes by the resolution, he try's to broaden the debate and he hasn't shown why ex-felons shouldn't be allowed to vote. He also how voting can't provide any of the benefits he mentions that would help society. Also my case structure overall was better then his as well. In conclusion vote for me because I followed the resolution, and proved that there is no reason not to allow ex-felons to vote.",

            "premise": "NEGATIVE I negate: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote [Definitions] (1) Democracy: a government by the people in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by their elected officials (2) Felon: a person convicted of a serious criminal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year (3) Retain: to keep in possession or use [Observations] (1) Because America is a democracy, a society, and should not allow felons the privilege of voting, the United States complies with all restrictions in the resolution, thus implied by the resolution (2) The resolution clearly states \"felons\" versus \"ex-felons\". An ex-felon is somebody who has completed their sentence, and a felon, as stated in the resolution, is somebody currently serving their sentence. Therefore, my opponent must prove how letting felons vote in prison is upholding a just democracy [Value/Value Criterion] Value: Justice Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness The Negative values justice. Justice is implied by the resolution because it deals with the punishment of felons. In order for a society to be democratic, all punishment must be fair and just. If punishment is not fair and just, a democracy cannot prosper. In this debate, I will show why this punishment is perfectly just. I will show my value of justice through the maximization of fairness. Democracy is a majority rule. Currently, the United States is comprised of over 98% of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens, versus the less than 2% of society that are murders and rapists. 98 to 2, who should get the rights? To prove my point, I make the following arguments (1) Retribution. Retribution is giving punishment that is deserved, or punishment that fits the crime. When somebody commits a felony, say rape, they treat their victim as a moral non-entity. An entity is a human being, so treating somebody as a non-entity is treating somebody less than human. So, the government has an obligation to punish this criminal. Does the government then in turn rape the felon? Of course not. This would be treating the felon as a moral non-entity, just as he did to his victim. This is cruel and unusual punishment that would make the government no better than the felon. But, the government still has to punish the felon. What is the government to do? The government must treat the felon as a political non-entity, in order to punish the criminal, yet not be cruel and unusual. Treating a felon as a political non-entity includes revoking the privilege of voting. 2) Legal Consistency. When felons are incarcerated, they are essentially removed from society \u2013 both for the punishment of the criminal and for the safety of the rest of society. In their removal from society, they lose certain rights that they would normally possess; they lose their social rights and the freedom of activity, occupational rights and the freedom to engage in the workforce, parental rights and the freedom to raise children, etc. Why, then, should criminals be allowed to maintain their political rights and the freedom to vote? There are many rights which are more basic taken away from the individual during his imprisonment; if we are to uphold some level of legal consistence and be uniform and fair in the level of punishment afforded to prisoners, then there is no reason why we should afford felons the privilege of voting and every reason not to. 3) Double Standard. By affirming the resolution, you are essentially condoning violent acts, which, as a democratic society, we are morally obliged not to do. By affirming the resolution, you are giving felons superior rights. You are not only treating felons as equal, but you are giving them rights that make them superior to normal, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens. You make the law-breakers into the law-makers. By affirming the resolution, you are saying that people who brake the law in the most brazen way, by committing a felony, would be better than a law-abiding citizen because they broke the law and still have the same amount of rights. As you can see, this is simply wrong. Thank you, and it is for those reasons that I negate the resolution [Rebuttal] Value: Equality I have 3 responses --> equality (of rights) is impossible during incarceration. If felons were to be equal (in rights), then there would be no punishment. For example, the government puts you in jail. Right there, the government automatically takes away your right to liberty, pursuit of hapiness, and countless other rights -->My opponent is dejustifying all forms of punishment. If incarceration is unjust in and of itself, than there is no way for society to punish criminals --> This creates a 'double standard' (3rd contention) VC: Democracy I have 2 responses --> Democracy, as a form of government, must exhibit the ability to protect society. My opponent then must prove how dejustifying all punishment would help protect society --> Maximization of Fairness better upholds justice. For a government to be just, it must exhibit fairness to its consitituents. However, a democracy is not always just, and a just government is not always a democracy [Contentions] (1) Enfranchising felons is directly proportional to the increase of democracy My opponent is saying that letting these parasites of society vote will have more democracy I have two responses --> you cannot have 'more democracy' --> you can have more people participate in democracy, say children, but this would not uphold my value and value criteria (1a) Felon Disenfranchisement hurts democratic values and rights I have 2 responses --> democratic values include protecting society by way of just punishment. I have already proven how I have met that burden. Let's also not forget how they became a felon: by committing a felony. A felony inherently hurts society, and therefore government --> he brings in race towards the end. This is not resolutional. Because the court of law deals with punishment, you are essentially saying that the court is racist and corrupt. Because the court is racist and corrupt, then any punishment given by the court is corrupt, thus dejustifying all forms of punishment (1b) Restoration of the right to vote enables rehabilitation and reintegration into (a) democratic society I have two responses --> If you agree with my opponents logic, then the opposite (disenfranchising) felons automatically destroys the opportunity to rehabilitate them. Yet, this is false. Many people can become a member of society without having the right to vote. Look no further than Ted Stevens, the Alaskan senator who was found guilty of a felony, yet he serves the best nation in the world --> Once a felon re-enters society, they are considered an ex-felon by society, therefore, anything dealing with an ex-felon is not resolutional (In a democratic society, FELONS....) Cont 2: Allowing felons to vote, once released, is consistent with the return of other rights --> not necessarily. For example, the government revokes the right to bear arms, the right to serve on a jury, the right to privacy, ect. --> Once again, when a felon re-enters society, they are considered an ex-felon by said society, therefore not resolutional and or pertaining to the resolution Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and that is why I negate the resolution",

            "premise": "I will first reply to his comment that only 2% of American population is not allowed to vote, he is saying that that isn't enough Americans worth fighting for, there are a total of 316.13 Americans in the U.S. Just 2% is a big chunk. Also what my opponent is clearly saying is that if lets say only 5 million Americans lets say, had any sort of rights violated, or needed help it doesn't matter. My opponents next argument is about prioritizing companies hiring the ex-felons rather then voting rights, I agree that getting them a job is important, so why not do both? All we have to do to allow them to vote is get a law passed or a bill or whatever may be needed to get them to vote, there is no reason why you can't prioritize both. Again in my case I specifically talk about how some felons go back to the economy and find jobs so of course that is on my side and has no impact onto he round. Here is part of the contention I posted earlier for reference. an astonishing 93% of those who were able to secure employment during the entirety of their supervised release were able to successfully reintegrate back into society and not return to prison. His main point however is that we should teach them a lesson not to break the law, and I agree with that, but I don't see how removing voting rights will make them better citizens or effect them heavily, yes they would love to vote but removing voting rights isn't as sever a punishment as going to jail or being fined. The punishments already set for a felony are more then enough to teach them a lesson. \"Nineteen states \"may terminate the parental rights of convicted felons. \"In twenty-nine jurisdictions (includes states and the District of Columbia) being convicted of a felony is \"legal ground for divorce.\" \"In twenty-five jurisdictions, convicted felons can never hold public office. \"In six states a felon can never hold public employment. \"Federal law forbids felons from holding many government jobs or receiving federal contracts. \"In thirty-one jurisdictions convicted felons are permanently barred from serving on a jury. \"Federal law forbids all convicted felons from owning a firearm. \"Forty-six jurisdictions require former felons to register with local law enforcement. \"All sexual offenders must register with local law enforcement officials for at least ten years after release from prison; longer times for certain offenses. The names of those registered are made available to any member of the public. \"People convicted of a drug felony can be denied all forms of federal assistance, including food stamps. Although states can opt out or narrow the focus of these penalties, only twelve states have entirely rejected them; slightly more than half have narrowed the scope of these rules. \"Everyone convicted of a drug-related felony, and indeed, many former felons, can be denied access to federal housing. \"The Higher Education Act of 1998 suspends their eligibility for student loans for at least a year, even for simple possession; longer, for second offenses and for selling drugs. This loss of benefits may be reinstated if the person goes through an \"approved\" drug treatment program. The scope and significance of these collateral consequences show that the real world of punishment is far different from the one most people imagine. In this world a felon's debt to society is rarely paid in full. For these felons the Mark of Cain is permanent. The current punishment is just like my opponent wants it, deadly, strict, and hard to resolve, he wants to add even more punishments for felons in general and keep them restricted instead of helping them develop the qualities of a proper citizen to ensure crime is less. Felons have more then enough punishments so why not give them the right to vote? Also the only reason some felons are repeat offenders is because lack of job opportunities , \"Justice.gov shows that 50% of felons who could not secure any employment during the time of their supervised release (generally two-to-five years) committed a new crime or violated the terms of their release and were sent back to prison. However, an astonishing 93% of those who were able to secure employment during the entirety of their supervised release were able to successfully reintegrate back into society and not return to prison. So since some find job opportunities and become citizens they should be allowed to vote, again I agree if we provide more job opportunities for ex-felons this method will be even more effective. So the clear solution is to help ex-felons returning to the society find jobs and again not all return to jail anyway. 4. Racial disfrenchment laws are still a big problem as I pointed out \"In America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. I also pointed out that if these people were allowed to vote it would have effected as much as seven recent U.S. Senate elections and one presidential election. Conclusion: I agree that some level of punishment must be set for actions in order to ensure order and tranquility continute to be established, however I believe the current punishments are more then enough and that crimes committed at a order age, either due to the influence from their environment or stealing food because they are poor and hungry shouldn't make them lose the right to vote in the future.

            "premise": "I'll respond to my opponent's defenses of his main points. P1: Many felons return to prison within 3 years of the same or another crime. Does it make sense to take away the rights of a citizen just because of something they MIGHT do? Why not give all of them life sentences while you're at it? Obviously the answer is that they don't deserve a sentence for life. It's too big a punishment, However, isn't this what disenfranchisement is? It's inability to vote -- for LIFE -- just because of something they might or might not do. Is this fair? P2: It would not be fair to citizens who have never been convicted of a felony. Citizens are not on even ground with felons. For example any person with a criminal record (ex-felons fall under this category) will get heavier fines and punishment than a normal person if they were caught shoplifting or exceeded the speed limit. It's also harder for convicts to get a job, because (admit it) no one wants to hire a criminal no matter how changed they are. P3: Felons should gain the right to vote by proving that their judgement is valid. If disenfranchisement is a punishment, then the disenfranchised convict is not an ex-felon. Since we're debating ex-felons, the point about disenfranchisement being a punishment is invalid. My opponent also argues that a felon needs to prove that his/her judgement is valid, however, voting is very subjective and varies from person to person. There is no such thing as a \"valid\" vote in an election. No politician is going to go up there and say, \"We should legalize all types of drugs and drop the smoking age completely.\" We all know that's completely crazy and the millions of non-felons in the US are going to vote against it. A felon's vote won't cause something really crazy to happen, but their vote will matter when it comes to something like the Affordable Care Act. Now I'll defend my main points. I will be splitting the defenses into A), B), C), etc. since my opponent made multiple refutations to each point. P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. A) \"If a US citizen commits a felony, isn't that sufficient means to revoke the right to vote?\" Actually, I do agree that a convicted felon shouldn't be able to vote from prison, jail, or while on parole or probation. But after the sentence is over, the right should be returned along with the felon's liberty, freedom of speech, etc. However, since we're debating ex-felons here, my opponent's point is invalid. B) \"Also, restricting a person from voting does not seem to be a cruel or unusual punishment...\" I never said this. I said ex-felon disenfranchisement violated the part of the 8th amendment about excessive sanctions. C) \"As for the 15th amendment, I would interpret it to mean that a right should not be refused as a result of a previous condition of servitude, but would the right be refused as a result of the felony committed?\" Again, we're debating ex-felons, not convicted felons in general. Perhaps disenfranchisement could be a form of capital punishment, but once the felon is free and served all sentences, he/she can't have the right to vote taken away. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. A) \"...African Americans and Hispanics already make up a minority in this country, and so your claim that felon disenfranchisement \"creates an imbalance between races\" would be true regardless.\" The problem is that even though these races make up a minority of the country's total population, they occupy the majority of prison cells. If felon disenfranchisement didn't exist, the imbalance would be gone. B) \"It's not as if white people vote for one thing and minorities vote for another, so I see it as one million people simply not voting, and do not assume that most of them would have voted for X person due to the color of their skin.\" It's not just race, it's class and socio-economic status. Race and class are inseparable because minorities make up much of the lower income class, more so than the majority race. Overwhelmingly, the people who commit crimes are from the lower income class, and these are also the people who tend to vote for Democrats. Wealthier people tend to vote for Republicans. Indirectly (please note this statement is not trying to discriminate) Caucasians tend to vote for one candidate while minorities vote for the other. C) \"...If they would break the law a second time because their individual opinion was not heard, then they probably should not have the right to vote.\" Then how do you explain the countries that do not disenfranchise ex-felons? These countries have a way lower crime rate than the US and other ex-felon disenfranchisement countries. Obviously, a felon's right to voice his/her own opinion prevents him/her from breaking the law. D) \"I'd like to point out that although ex-felons cannot vote, they are still able to do a lot of other things such as organize a peaceful protest, or petition for change, etc.\" Remember, the topic states ELECTIONS. Not laws or policies. Felons need to vote on who leads their country for the next 4 years of their lives. Felons can't petition for a new president. How do you suggest to replace the right to vote in elections? P3: Felons deserve a right to vote. A) \"I don't believe that they deserve this right until they can prove that they can handle the right responsibly\" My opponent seems to think that if felons are allowed to vote, they'll somehow vote to legalize marijuana or something, but again the topic states elections not issues. The most felons will base their vote on is ObamaCare and other extremely controversial issues because no candidate is going to come out and say they want to legalize marijuana. B) \"Assuming that felons could influence the outcome of an election, which is very unlikely, wouldn't it be detrimental to the majority?\" My opponent has asked me a direct question. My answer is that no, it will not be a detriment, because again I'm arguing for them to vote in elections, not on bills or policies or issues. They make up part of the population and their voices need to be heard. This is actually better for the majority as there are more opinions on the election rather than just one group.

            "premise": "I will attempt to construct my arguments in a similar fashion in order to keep the format consistent Contentions: P1: Many felons return to prison within 3 years for the same or a different crime P2: It would not be fair to citizens who have never been convicted of a felony P3: Felons should gain the right to vote, by proving that their judgement is valid Definitions: Recidivism- Measured by criminal acts that resulted in the rearrest, reconviction, or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release. P1: With many felons returning to prison within three years, how are we to be able to have faith in their good judgement? These are obviously not simple crimes, and if so many return to a life of crime as soon as they get out, then why should they have the right to vote? The effectiveness of our criminal justice system is for another debate, but as it is now, its not actually correcting anybody, its simply detaining them. Here is some interesting data: \"Released prisoners with the highest rearrest rates were robbers (70.2%), burglars (74.0%), larcenists (74.6%), motor vehicle thieves (78.8%), those in prison for possessing or selling stolen property (77.4%), and those in prison for possessing, using, or selling illegal weapons (70.2%).\" This would allow all of these felons, most of which return to prison within several years for the same crime, to vote in elections. There is more information on Recidivism rates here [1]. P2: Why should citizens who have been convicted of a felon have the same right as those who have never been convicted of one? Certainly they are not of equal value to society when one was thrown in prison for being a danger to society. If these felons are at risk of recidivism, of which many of them are, then I don't quite think their judgement is valid enough to allow them to vote in elections that could effect the rest of society. P3: Perhaps there should be a system in place for convicted felons to earn the right to vote. I feel that this would be a lot better than simply giving them the right to vote once they had served their time. This would ensure that we do not have voters with compromised judgements, and that they cannot vote before proving that they are able to be productive members of society. Otherwise, they may base their vote on a topic of interest, such as the legalization of a certain drug, etc. [1] http://www.bjs.gov...",

            "conclusion": "Convicted ex-felons should be able to vote in all US elections.",
            "premise": "First I will begin by responding to your refutation of my main points P1: Many felons return to prison within 3 years of the same or another crime Although I was not able to find data for the rate at which ex-felons return to prison after 3 years, I'm sure it is still a significant percentage, especially after being let off of parole or probation, where they are no longer monitored. The simple fact that many ex-felons are convicted of another crime should be proof enough that all ex-felons should not be allowed the right to vote. P2: It would not be fair to citizens who have never been convicted of a felony You are correct in your statement that \" the whole point of letting a felon out of prison is to try and let them blend back into normal life, so to speak\". However, by refusing ex-felons the right to vote, are we really hindering their ability to assimilate back into society? I don't think so because this right does not define who is a member of society and who is not, nor does it prevent an ex-felon from doing other things such as getting a job, or driving a car. So the daily interactions involved in \"normal life\" are not effected by an ex-felons inability to vote. P3: Felons should gain the right to vote by proving that their judgement is valid By serving a full sentence in jail, should an ex-felon really regain the right to vote? Who is to say that serving a full sentence in prison is only a part of the punishment committing a felony, and that an ex-felons inability to vote serves to remind him/her that a life of crime is not worth it, and that they will have to prove that they are productive members of society to regain this right. I think that once a felon gets off of probation or parole that he/she can choose to be evaluated by a psychologist to see whether or not his/her judgement is valid in order to regain the right to vote. However, this would be something that our lawmakers would decide upon so I'm sure a reasonable solution could be agreed on. Now I will move on to your arguments and refute them P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. If a US citizen commits a felony, isn't that sufficient means to revoke the right to vote? Also, restricting a person from voting does not seem to be a cruel or unusual punishment, because it does not prevent them from performing daily functions of life. So as I mentioned earlier, the right to vote does not effect an ex-felons ability to function in society and in no way directly harms him/her (indirectly perhaps). As for the 15th amendment, I would interpret it to mean that a right should not be refused as a result of a previous condition of servitude, but would the right be refused as a result of the felony committed? P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. Well I would like to point out that African Americans and Hispanics already make up a minority in this country, and so your claim that felon disenfranchisement \"creates an imbalance between races\" would be true regardless. Its not as if white people vote for one thing and minorities vote for another, so I see it as one million people simply not voting, and do not assume that most of them would have voted for X person due to the color of their skin. That is almost like saying that if we let all prisoners vote, the minorities would have helped Obama win and therefore we are restricting their ability to vote in an attempt to sway election results. Simply not true, for all we know, half of them supported Obama and the other half Romney, so skin color does not determine how a person will most vote. You claim that \"people who can't voice their opinion in the law might resort -- AGAIN -- to breaking it.\" Relating to my first point, if they would break the law a second time because their individual opinion was not heard, then they probably should not have the right to vote. That would be like if I smoked weed even though its illegal because I support its legalization (I don't smoke, but the war on drugs is expensive and ineffective). My individual opinion about the legality of weed was not heard, but does that mean that I can proceed to break the law? Absolutely not. I'd like to point out that although ex-felons cannot vote, they are still able to do a lot of other things such as organize a peaceful protest, or petition for change, etc. This would still allow them a chance to voice their opinion. P3: Felons deserve a right to vote I don't believe that they deserve this right until they can prove that they can handle the right responsibly (as I have pointed out in my third point). You are right, the next president will effect the lives of them as well. However, the president is meant to make decisions in the best interest of the majority, with the goal of producing a solution that satisfies both if possible. Assuming that felons could influence the outcome of an election, which is very unlikely, wouldn't it be detrimental to the majority? It just does not make much sense for people who have made a \"BIG mistake in life\", as you put it, to be able to influence the outcome of an election that will effect all of us.

When looking at the basis of the resolution, we read in the first prepositional phrase \"in a democratic society,\" therefore the resolution assumes that felon disenfranchisement is taking place in a democratic framework. Even if some people would view those preferences as \"bad\" society, a procedural view of democracy would hold that there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected and equality of all is the implied value.

Democracy (root of democratic) - Of, characterized by, or advocating democracy, Of or for the people in general; popular, Believing in or practicing social equality The value for this round will be equality, and my criterion will be democracy. This means that whoever allows for the equality by the ways of democracy, will win this round. This is a fair value and criterion because the resolution is talking about what is best for a democratic society, ergo my criterion; and equality is essential to a democracy, ergo my value. Moreso, a democracy is defined as in having or practicing social equality and inversely, without equality, a full democracy cannot be established. CONTENTION ONE: ENFRANCHISING FELONS IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE INCREASE OF DEMOCRACY A. FELON DISENFRANCHISEMENT HURTS DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND RIGHTS Mauer, Marc, assistant director of The Sentencing Project, \"Felon Disenfranchisement: A Policy Whose Time Has Passed?\" American Bar Association, http://www.abanet.org..., accessed September 9, 2008 Regarding individuals who complete their sentence, it is difficult to develop a compelling argument for the denial of voting rights. Americans long have professed that once you \"pay your debt to society,\" you are free to rejoin the community. But a felony conviction may continues to deny these rights of citizenship decades after a sentence has been completed, even for a one-time, nonviolent offense. (Regrettably, policymakers in recent years enacted a series of collateral consequences of conviction, many tied specifically to drug offenses, that also extend after sentence. These include bans on receiving welfare assistance, living in public housing, and obtaining financial aid for higher education.) But serious questions can be raised as well regarding the loss of fundamental rights for people currently serving a felony sentence, whether in prison or on probation or parole. Our legal system generally makes a distinction between punishment-the loss of liberty whether in prison or on probation-and the loss of rights. The only exceptions generally conceded by law and policy are those exercises of speech that might conflict with public safety concerns. If we think of voting more broadly, as a fundamental expression of speech, then disenfranchisement becomes an even greater challenge for a democratic society. Suppose, for example, a legislator proposed a bill to make it unlawful for a probationer to write a letter to the editor or to participate in a protest rally. Surely few policymakers or citizens would find this an appropriate consequence of a conviction. Yet in the twenty-nine states that currently prohibit probationers from voting, such restrictions on political expression are firmly in place. The traditional goals of sentencing also leave little justification for disenfranchisement and most other collateral consequences of conviction. Other than serving a retributive function, disenfranchisement certainly does not meet the goals of incapacitation or deterrence. Individuals who are not already deterred from crime by the threat of incarceration are unlikely to be swayed by the prospect of losing their right to vote. Placing a character test on voting eligibility also is reminiscent of past practices that run counter to modern notions of democratic procedure. Once we begin to impose character requirements, voting slips back from being a right for all Americans to a privilege granted by the powerful. The racial impact of disenfranchisement policies is sometimes justified as an inevitable if unfortunate aspect of a race-neutral criminal justice system: if members of a particular racial or ethnic group are more involved in crime, the consequent disproportionate loss of voting rights is merely a result of their activity. Such an argument, though, ignores the compelling evidence of discriminatory racial dynamics in the criminal justice system-racial profiling by law enforcement agencies, the racially disparate prosecution of the war on drugs, and glaring inequities in adequacy of counsel as a function of both race and class. Affirming the resolution allows for reenfranchisement, which changes how felons function in the electoral system. B. RESTORATION OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE ENABLES REHABILITATION AND REINTEGRATION INTO DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY Mauer, Marc, assistant director of The Sentencing Project, \"Felon Disenfranchisement: A Policy Whose Time Has Passed?\" American Bar Association, http://www.abanet.org..., accessed September 9, 2008 In a more positive vein, the restoration of voting rights can be seen as being in harmony with the rehabilitative goal of sentencing. If an objective of sentencing is to encourage offenders to become less antisocial, then it is in society's interest to engage offenders in productive relationships with the community. Voting is clearly one means of doing so. Such a rationale is employed by the many nations (and the states of Maine and Vermont) that do not relate voting rights to criminal punishment and permit even prisoners to vote. By the standards of most democratic nations, American disenfranchisement policies are extreme, as is our excessive use of imprisonment. No other democratic nation disenfranchises former offenders for life; some countries deny voting rights to citizens after they have completed a prison sentence, but this generally is for a limited period of time and for specific offenses. During the past decade, constitutional courts in Canada, Israel, and South Africa have affirmed the fundamental right of all citizens, including prisoners, to be part of the electorate. The Israeli case is particularly intriguing because it resulted from a challenge to the voting rights of Yigal Amir, the man convicted of killing former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Reintegration is a key step to achieve a truly democratic society, which increases the legitimacy of democracy. Democracy impacts to providing the most social justice through the protection of rights, both on a domestic and international scale. CONTENTION 2: Allowing felons to vote, once released, is consistent with the return of other rights. Jeffrey Reiman, \"Liberal and Republican Arguments against the Disenfranchisement of Felons,\" Criminal Justice Ethics, 2005 Technically, disenfranchisement is not considered part of an offender's sentence but only a \"collateral consequence\" of conviction. Consequently, one rarely sees judges defending disenfranchisement as punishment. With regard to imprisoned felons, the argument implied in this rhetorical question has some force. Because the idea of Felon Disenfranchisement does not promote the best for society in the form of the preservation of democracy and the creation of justice, the reverse must also be true. If Felons were re-enfranchised It would strengthen the democratic process and would be the most just solution because it preserves democracy by means of marketable ideas being expressed.",

            "conclusion": "In a Democratic Society, Felons Ought to Retain the Right to Vote",
            "premise": "Because I support the VALUES set forth in the Preamble to the United States Constitution, the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, I affirm. The CRITERA I advocate for your ultimately deciding this debate are: (1) OBJECTIVITY: This debate should not be decided on the basis of preexisting personal opinions, bias, or prejudice. (2) LOGIC: This debate should not be decided on the basis undisciplined emotionalism. (3) TANGIBLE, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE: This debate should be decided upon documented facts, not upon abstract, unverifiable, hypotheses. MY RESOLUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND FRAMEWORK: (A) The United States of America is a democratic society; indeed, it is the most prominent democratic society in the world today. (B) Of all the democratic societies in the world today (and I believe that there are 119 countries which identify themselves as such), the United States stands almost alone in automatically disenfanchising (revoking the right to vote of) felons. The consensus of experts in the fields of law, criminology, and political science is that - today - appromiately 2.5% of the American adult population (5-6 million people) in this country is denied the right to vote because of \"felon\" and/or \"ex-felon\" status. CONTENTION ONE: The American policy of revoking the right to vote felons (which I will now consistently refer to as \"felon disenfranchisement\") is illogical and haphazard. There are many reasons for this: A. Many of the people who commit felonies are never arrested, so they are never identified as \"felons.\" Either the crimes go unreported, or the investigations fail to locate a suspect. (For example, remember the \"anthrax killings\" which occurred after 9/11.) B. Many of the people who are arrested for committing felonies are not prosecuted. The charges them are dropped - or reduced to misdemeanors - for a variety of reasons, most of which have nothing whatsoever to do with the suspect's guilt or innocence (i.e., prosecutorial discretion (including the prosecutor's political agenda), court-clog, and/or jail-prison overcrowding). C. Many of the people who are arrested for committing felonies, and who are prosecuted, \"plea-bargain\" down to a misdemeanor, and therefore retain the right to vote. D. Many of the people in this country who are convicted of felonies (the expert estimates range from .5% to 14%) are actually INNOCENT! E. Even if our criminal justice system were perfect (which it certainly isn't), there is no logical reason to believe that felons - as a group - would be \"worse voters\" than untreated alcoholics, untreated drug addicts, psychotics (treated or untreated), the homeless, illiterates, morons, grade-school dropouts, moral perverts, petty criminals (as noted before, unlike \"felons,\" people who commit \"misdemeanors\" retain the right to vote), and/or lawyers... and yet only felons are the only adult citizens singled out under American law for disenfranchisement. Indeed, a good case can be made for theory that the only real justification for felon disenfranchisement in America is ulterior desire to perpetuate racism and/or material elitism. CONTENTION TWO: The American policy of felon disenfranchisement actually HARMS the American democratic society. I assert this for two independent reasons: A. Felony disenfranchisement increases crime. (If you prefer debatespeak and/or legalese, \"felony disenfranchisement encourages criminal recidivism.\") Disenfranchisement (which, by the way, has historically be referred to as \"civil death\"), by definition and design, alienates the felon from society, severely damages the felon's chances for rehabilitation, and gives the felon a greater incentive to commit even more crime when he or she is ultimately released from prison (assuming he or she is sent to prison in the first place - many felons are not - instead, they are placed on \"probation\"). Empirical studies - including some conducted right here in the good old USA - demonstrate that in those jurisdictions in which felons retain the right to vote, they are 50% less likely to commit another crime than in jurisdictions which deny felons the right to vote. B. Felony disenfranchisement laws backfire - they disenfranchise non-felons. (If you prefer debatespeak or legalese, \"felon disenfranchisement is counterproductive.\") In our democratic society, the right to vote is regulated, in large part, by State governments. Each of America's 50 states has it own laws concerning felony disenfranchisement. Two - Maine and Vermont - have no restrictions whatsoever on the voting rights of felons - the position supported by the resolution; Two other States - Kentucky and Virginia - have automatic lifetime felon disenfranchisement. The remaining 46 States - and the District of Columbia - have created a veritable Rubik's Cube of rules, regulations and requirements which almost no one - expect perhaps a full-time election law attorney - can decipher. As a result, the mere existence of felony disenfrachisement creates three inherent problems for non-felons who wish to exercise their right to vote. All of the following three problems have been empirically verified in the American elections that took place in 2004 and 2006, and the evidence also empirically demonstrates that they are occurring in 2008: A. VOTER CAGING: Lists of the names of convicted felons are cynically manipulated by partisans of one party or another to attack innocent voters - and literally hundreds of thousands of innocent voters are \"purged\" from voter registration lists, or are \"challenged\" at the polls on election day, or both. This is known as \"voter caging,\" and it's anti-democratic to the max. (For example, my name is Michael Miller. I have never committed a felony, but they are -at least - hundreds of people named \"Michael Miller\" who have committed a felony. Because of this, I may be challenged at the polls any time I try to vote, and it is quite possible that someday I will be denied the right to vote.) B. INNOCENT MISTAKES: Even well-meaning election officials are confused by the American maze of felon disenfranchisement laws. As a result, they often make mistakes and refuse to allow bona fide citizens to register to vote. In some States (i.e., South Carolina), mistaken interpretation of voter eligibility laws - by completely honest election officials - runs as high as 61%! C. SELF-DISENFRANCHISEMENT: Most Americans are not constitutional lawyers, nor are they experts in the field of election law. Thousands of honest, law-abiding Americans mistakenly believe that because they were arrested at some point in their lives, they have lost the right to vote, even though the charges against them were dropped, or they were found not guilty at trial. Thousands of others - who have very minor \"criminal histories\" - mistakenly believe that convictions for minor infractions, juvenile offenses, and/or misdemeanors disqualify them from voting. CONCLUSION: Like the disaster known as \"Prohibition\" in the America of the 1920's and early 1930's, felon disenfrachisement is a classic example of an arguably-noble theory that just doesn't work in the \"real world\" of American democracy. In addition, in the \"real world\" of American politics and elections, the policy of felon disenfranchisement - no matter how scrupulously it is applied - causes much more harm than to our society than it prevents. I support felon enfranchisement - not because it's the right thing to do for felons - but because it's right thing to do for YOU - and all the rest of America's democratic society.",

            "conclusion": "In a Democratic Society, Felons Ought to Retain the Right to Vote",
            "premise": "Because I support the VALUES set forth in the Preamble to the United States Constitution, the 14th Amendment to the United States Constiution, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, I affirm. The CRITERA I advocate for your ultimately deciding this debate are: (1) OBJECTIVITY: This debate should not be decided on the basis of preexisting personal opinions, bias, or prejudice. (2) LOGIC: This debate should not be decided on the basis undisciplined emotionalism. (3) TANGIBLE, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE: This debate should be decided upon documented facts, not upon abstract, unverifiable, hypotheses. MY RESOLUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND FRAMEWORK: (A) The United States of America is a democratic society; indeed, it is the most prominent democratic society in the world today. (B) Of all the democratic societies in the world today (and I believe that there are 119 countries which identify themselves as such), the United States stands almost alone in automatically disenfanchising (revoking the right to vote of) felons. The consensus of experts in the fields of law, ciminology, and political science is that - today - appromiately 2.5% of the American adult population (5-6 million people) in this country is denied the right to vote because of \"felon\" and/or \"ex-felon\" status. CONTENTION ONE: The American policy of revoking the right to vote felons (which I will now consistently refer to as \"felon disenfranchisement\") is illogical and haphazard. There are many reasons for this: A. Many of the people who commit felonies are never arrested, so they are never identified as \"felons.\" Either the crimes go unreported, or the investigations fail to locate a suspect. (For example, remember the \"anthrax killings\" which occurred after 9/11.) B. Many of the people who are arrested for committing felonies are not prosecuted. The charges them are dropped - or reduced to misdemeanors - for a variety of reasons, most of which have nothing whatsoever to do with the suspect's guilt or innocence (i.e., prosecutorial discretion (including the prosecutor's political agenda), court-clog, and/or jail-prison overcrowding). C. Many of the people who are arrested for committing felonies, and who are prosecuted, \"plea-bargain\" down to a misdemeanor, and therefore retain the right to vote. D. Many of the people in this country who are convicted of felonies (the expert estimates range from .5% to 14%) are actually INNOCENT! E. Even if our criminal justice system were perfect (which it certainly isn't), there is no logical reason to believe that felons - as a group - would be \"worse voters\" than untreated alcoholics, untreated drug addicts, psychotics (treated or untreated), the homeless, illiterates, morons, grade-school dropouts, moral perverts, petty criminals (as noted before, unlike \"felons,\" people who commit \"misdemeanors\" retain the right to vote), and/or lawyers... and yet only felons are the only adult citizens singled out under American law for disenfranchisement. Indeed, a good case can be made for theory that the only real justification for felon disenfranchisement in America is ulterior desire to perpetuate racism and/or material eliteism. CONTENTION TWO: The American policy of felon disenfranchisement actually HARMS the American democratic society. I assert this for two independent reasons: A. Felony disenfranchisement increases crime. (If you prefer debatespeak and/or legalese, \"felony disenfranchisement encourages criminal recidivism.\") Disenfranchisement (which, by the way, has historically be referred to as \"civil death\"), by definition and design, alienates the felon from society, severely damages the felon's chances for rehabilitation, and gives the felon a greater incentive to commit even more crime when he or she is ultimately released from prison (assuming he or she is sent to prison in the first place - many felons are not - instead, they are placed on \"probation\"). Empirical studies - including some conducted right here in the good old USA - demonstate that in those jurisdictions in which felons retain the right to vote, they are 50% less likely to commit another crime than in jurisdictions which deny felons the right to vote. B. Felony disenfranchisement laws backfire - they disenfranchise non-felons. (If you prefer debatespeak or legalese, \"felon disenfranchisement is counterproductive.\") In our democratic society, the right to vote is regulated, in large part, by State governments. Each of America's 50 states has it own laws concerning felony disenfranchisement. Two - Maine and Vermont - have no restictions whatsoever on the voting rights of felons - the position supported by the resolution; Two other States - Kentucky and Viginia - have automatic lifetime felon disenfranchisement. The remaining 46 States - and the District of Columbia - have created a veritable Rubic's Cube of rules, regulations and requirements which almost no one - expect perhaps a full-time election law attorney - can decipher. As a result, the mere existence of felony disenfrachisement creates three inherent problems for non-felons who wish to exercise their right to vote. All of the following three problems have been empirically verified in the American elections that took place in 2004 and 2006, and the evidence also empiracally demonstrates that they are occurring in 2008: A. VOTER CAGING: Lists of the names of convicted felons are cynically manipulated by partisans of one party or another to attack innocent voters - and literally hundreds of thousands of inocent voters are \"purged\" from voter registration lists, or are \"challenged\" at the polls on election day, or both. This is known as \"voter caging,\" and it's anti-democratic to the max. (For example, my name is Michael Miller. I have never committed a felony, but they are -at least - hundreds of people named \"Michael Miller\" who have committed a felony. Because of this, I may be challenged at the polls any time I try to vote, and it is quite possible that someday I will be denied the right to vote.) B. INNOCENT MISTAKES: Even well-meaning election officials are confused by the American maze of felon disenfranchisement laws. As a result, they often make mistakes and refuse to allow bona fide citizens to register to vote. In somes States (i.e., South Carolina), mistaken interpretation of voter eligibility laws - by completely honest election officials - runs as high as 61%! C. SELF-DISENFRANCHISEMENT: Most Americans are not constitutional lawyers, nor are they experts in the field of election law.

            "conclusion": "Convicted ex-felons should be able to vote in all US elections.",
            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for accepting. I look forward to an interesting debate. My three main contentions are: P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. P3: Ex-felons deserve the right to vote. Definitions: Felon = an individual who has committed a felony. Felony = a crime punishable by heavy fines, jail/prison time for more than 10 years, and/or death. Disenfranchisement = restriction of an American citizen from voting. FRAMEWORK: The topic strictly states ex-felons, meaning felons released from prison, parole, and/or probation. P1: Restricting ex-felons from voting violates the Constitution. Voting is a right given to all US citizens by the Constitution. Since an ex-felon has been fulfilling their duties as citizens, they must be able to enjoy the full rights of citizens, which includes the right to vote. Also, ex-felon disenfranchisement violates the 8th Amendment. According to the 8th Amendment: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" According to the Atkins v. Virginia Supreme Court case: The 8th Amendment \"succinctly prohibits excessive sanctions.\" Disenfranchising an ex-felon is an excessive sanction in the sense that it extends the punishment beyond the felon\"s sentence. Furthermore, the 15th Amendment is violated by ex-felon disenfranchisement. According to Section 1 of the 15th Amendment: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Since ex-felons had already been released from prison, according to the 15th Amendment, they cannot be denied the right to vote. We can conclude that ex-felon disenfranchisement is unconstitutional. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. A disproportionate percentage of convicted felons are a minority race. According to the Guardian: The people overwhelmingly affected by felony disenfranchisement laws are minorities. Only 2.5%, 5.8 million people in the voting age population were made ineligible to vote by felon voting laws in 2010. That percentage tripled to 7.7% among African-Americans. Another way of putting this is that 38%, 2.2 million, of all those stopped from voting by felon restrictions are African-American. About a million African-American ex-felons are disenfranchised. According to the Washington Post: In Virginia, Kentucky, and Florida, 1 in 5 African Americans are affected by felon disenfranchisement laws. This is way more than the amount of Caucasian individuals affected by the same laws in the same states, thus creating an imbalance at the ballot box. This creates discrimination against minorities, especially when they have the potential to change the outcome of a race. According to the Georgetown Law Journal: Felon disenfranchisement has tremendous effects on the political landscape - leading researchers report that felon disenfranchisement \"may have altered the outcome of as many as seven recent U.S. Senate elections and one presidential election.\" When P3: Ex-felons deserve the right to vote. A felon is only released from prison, parole, and/or probation after they have abided by the law, paid off their fines and/or served their sentence. Ex-felons have already paid off their debt to society. Inflicting disenfranchisement upon them is unfair. They deserve the right to vote, no matter what they've done in the past. Emphasis on the PAST. Many other countries allow felons to vote. According to Think Progress: 21 out of 45 countries surveyed have NO restrictions on felon voting at all. Only 5 out of 45 countries bar felons from voting after they've served their sentence. These countries are doing quite well with felons being able to voice their opinions in politics. According to the 2012 Sentencing Project: Nearly 6 million Americans are barred from voting due to their previous conviction. This means that 1 out of 40 adults in this country cannot vote. America is supposed to be a democracy, but how is it democratic when so many otherwise eligible citizens can't vote due to crimes they've committed and have already been punished for? These people deserve their full rights. They deserve to vote. Thank you, this concludes my argument. The spotlight is now on my opponent, to whom I wish the best of luck.",

            "premise": "Resolved: In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote Value: democratic society Value Criterion: Maximizing political participation Contention 1: A democratic society can not be legitimate if the people in it are not voting. This is because the definition of democracy dictates that we let every competent adult vote. If we bar felons from voting then we are not truly a democracy. Contention 2: Furthermore if we continue to disenfranchise felons then not only are we undemocratic but we are also racist. This is because in America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. Therefore as one can clearly see felon disenfranchisement excludes a whole class of people from the voting process. As stated in my previous statistic the two major minorities that make up the majorities of felons in America are blacks and Hispanics. Due to this the voices of these two groups of people is not generally heard. So if one were to vote neg. this could in effect lead to the genocide of minorities as their voice would be stifled in the government. This proves that supporting felon disenfranchisement supports racism. Contention 3: Not only does felon disenfranchisement supports racism but it can change the result of important elections. Blacks and Hispanics generally vote Democratic. As these minorities make up the majorities of felons felon disenfranchisement favors the white dominated Republican party and skews the results of elections. An example of this would be my state of Florida in the 2004 election. If felons had been allowed to vote there is no way that George Bush would have won the presidency. Though Gore had the popular vote Bush had more electoral votes which enabled him to win. However if felons had been allowed to vote Gore would have had not only the popular vote but the electoral votes necessary to win. Contention 4: Additionally felon disenfranchisement is not truly a punishment. Disallowing felons from voting does nothing correct their behavior or to prevent them from committing a crime again. If anything it further separates them from society. This is injustice for if a man committed a felony in his late teens and is kept from voting from every election each time a new political figure come to power he will have to remember the mistake he made as a teen. He may be a reformed and upstanding member of society yet he will still be unable to vote. For these reason I support the affirmative of this resolution.",

            "premise": "I will begin with defending my case, and then move on to my opponents -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NC-------------------------------- Observation 1) --> my opponent did not attack this argument, thus you can extend this through the round. America can be used Observation 2) --> The UN does in fact define a felon in its database, accessible through their website, as \"a person who has been tried and found guilty of a serious criminal offense through a fair legal court and is currently serving their incarceration.\" The United Nations also goes on to clarify what makes an ex-felon different from a felon. An ex-felon is \"one who has successfully completed their sentence and re-enters society.\" The negative makes no argument against ex-felons, for ex-felons are not implied or stated in the resolution. The negative argues why felons, as stated in the resolution, ought not retain the right to vote --> Not one definition online or any dictionary I have found defines the word 'retain' in the future tense. For example, merriam webster defines retain as \"to keep in possession or use\", therefore implying not only the present tense but the constanst keeping of a right. This, along with the wording of the resolution and my first argument with the UN, points to the conclusion of an incarcerated felon Value: Justice --> His only argument to my value is that it is 'not inherent to the resolution'. Therefore, as long as I prove that it is implied by the resolution, then my value is extended through the round. The resolution deals with how we should deal with punishment and what rights are maintained or denyed in incarceration. (Turn)--> You can actually turn this against my opponents inferior value of a democratic society, because the resolution specifically deals with the punishment of prisoners, and for a society to be truly democratic, all punishment must be fair and JUST (justice) Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness --> As I already have stated, the resolution states a felon. I have already proven why it deals with incarcerated felons, just look to my defending of my second observation. Just as the affirmative made no attempt of arguing incarcerated felons, the negative makes no attempt in arguing an ex-felon because it is not inherent to the resolution. Contentions: 1) Retribution: --> a) Because a felon, by definition, is one who is serving their incarceration, once they re-enter society and thus the contract, they are no longer a felon, thus not inherent to the resolution --> b) Taking away the right to vote and influence government is perfectly proportionate, for when one commits a felony they physically, mentally, or financially take or restrict someone else's rights, and thus inherently hurts the government. A felon hurts society, which is why society (as part of the jury) sentences a felon to imprisonment. Because a felon also hurts the government, the government has a right to restrict or take away a felon's rights, such as political rights and the freedom to vote --> c) this is simply wrong and furthermore proves my opponent's poor logical reasoning. Let's take kidnap, for example, because my opponent brought it up. The Free Dictionary defines kidnap as 'to seize and detain unlawfully'. Because the government's incentive is not to cause pain (as a kidnapers is) but rather to protect society, as well as the fact that the government is not breaking any laws ('unlawfully'), this argument is dropped. Once again, the government does not rape rapists or steal millions from people who commit fraud, because the government cannot treat a felon as a moral non-entity, and thus must treat the felon as a political non-entity (because the government still has an obligation to punish the felon) 2) Legal Consistency -->a) He says that we do not have legal consistency because of the length of incarceration, but I do not argue that. Let's take parental rights, for instance, because I argue them as an example. You do not lose your parental rights while incarcerated in Texas and retain them in New York. I am arguing that for a government to be fair and just, it must uphold legal consistency via rights during incaraceration. Because 48/50 states, or 96%, disenfranchise during imprisonment, the government should be able to disenfranchise in all states (the remaining 4%) --> b) Once again, when a felon re-enters society, they are now considered an ex-felon by society, because the payment to society (imprisonment) is over and repaid. However, because a felony inherently hurts the government, the government now has an obligation to punish the felon. The government then takes away the felons say in said government. 3) Double Standard --> a) This is nothing new. The government also restricts rights of ex-felons through the violation of the right to bear arms, violation of the right to serve on a jury...(etc) Still, however, this deals with ex-felons, versus felons. My opponent essentially agrees with the negative when he says that I am \"undoing the balance incarceration achieves.\" My opponent then in turn agrees that disenfranshisement is justified while incarcerated, and because felons are CURRENTLY serving their sentence, he agrees with the negative ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AC---------------------------------- Value: Democratic Society --> As I have proven, justice is the 'higher standard'. Both are implied by the resolution, but for a society to be democratic it must uphold justice through punishment VC: Maximizing Participation --> Not inherent to the resolution. My criteria is better to uphold justice because the negative argues how a nation with less participation can be equally, if not, superior on a justice scale to a nation with more 'participation'. --> Also, letting children (who are citizens) vote would increase participation. As you can see, however, this would not increase justice or lead to a strong democracy Observations: 1) Felons and ex-felons --> a) when a felon commits a felony, the government, because the felon has not fully repaid his debt to the government (he repaid his debt to society during imprisonment) aknowledges the felon as a felon. However, the resolution implies how society should punish this criminal, and upon re-entry of society, society essentially views the felon as an ex-felon, thus anything pertaining to an ex-felon is not resolutional. -->b) All felonies are committed in the 'past tense'. For example, you would not be on trial for \"is killing\", but rather \"have murdered\". My opponent is saying that you cannot punish a felon for a past occurrence. But, because all felonies are committed in the past tense, my opponents logical reasoning is to dejustify all punishment, because all felonies have already been committed. (Turn)--> My opponent is dejustifying all punishment, and for a democratic society (his value) to exist, there must be punishment to insure the protection of said democratic society Contentions 1) Society uses disenfranshisement in order to prevent contestation of existing values --> My opponent is essentially saying that we cannot force felons to be second class citizens. This is wrong for 3 reasons: 1) Becoming a second-class citizen means losing some rights. If felons did not lose any rights in jail, then punishment could not exist. Once again, my opponent is saying that all punishment is unjust, which goes against his value 2) Felons have brought this on themselves. By comitting a felony, they treat their victim as a second class citizen. 3) (Turn) This goes against my opponents observation of felons being felons for life. If we are to not make them second class citizens upon re-entry, then we would not be treating them as felons for life",

            "premise": "alright, I will be Neg then.... Neg/Aff CV: Justice: giving each person his or her due VC: Social Contract The Social contact is a mutual agreement between the Government and the governed instituted to protect the rights of individuals in society. In exchange for the protection of Natural right the governed must accept restrictions of certain rights and must assume certain duties. When a society follows and preserves the social contract justice is created. When a society moves away from or abandons its social contract man shall right man, protecting the rights of none and creating no justice. This is relevant to the resolution because the idea of democracy is based on the social contract Observation: My opponent Must prove, in order to win, that ALL felons must vote. 1st \u2013Social Contract A. Locke believed that the violation of the social contract negated the contract between the parties and entered them in a sort of state of war in which no rights were preserved. One of the things required of the governed in to uphold the laws and regulations put in place by society, So in this resolution the felons violated the social contract by not upholding the laws of Society so they are essentially allowing for the violation of their own rights and removal from society because, humans, being rational beings, made a conscious choice to not uphold the duties given to them by the government acknowledge that the government is not obligated to protect those rights. As said by philosopher Emmanuel Kant\" if a man makes himself a worm he must not complain when he is trodden on\" So By violating the Contact felons have essentially removed themselves from society and therefore must be considered as non-citizens to that society. Non-Citizens do not have the right to vote in a foreign country and that is how Felons ought to be treated. They are equal to non-citizens in that regard because just as the felons removed themselves from society non-citizens have not entered into the social contract. B. By allowing Felons to we would not only be giving them all of the rights of law-abiding citizens but would be elevating them above them by saying, even though you violated the contract you are equal to everybody else. By doing this you are creating a situation when felons ,who have broken the contract and essentially said the law doesn't apply to them, can make Laws for those who obeyed the laws. This is allowing for an attempted double-freedom which is plainly unjust. 2nd \u2013 Impact on society Under the social contract a government is only as strong as its people a government were many of the people have shown a disregard for society is not a strong one. So by eliminating those from voting you are creating a stronger government. Felons, because they have broken the social contract show that they have a disregard for society. Also In cases of small local election felons could have a massive impact on elections. The effect of this is apparent in small communities where felons may represent a majority. In this situation you get the Felons actually potentially silencing the law abiding which is unjust. Also look to such felon that have committed Voter Fraud or Insurrection and so advertise a blatant disregard for society and should not participate in governmental decision-making. If we allow even those who have actively worked to destroy society to decide how that society is run we will destroy that society. Conclusion: I have proven that the social contract is the best Criterion and that felons have broken it and therefore should not vote. If one instance is given in which felons should not vote a urge a negative ballot. Aff Case Cv: the Value of relevant impacts is inferior to the value of justice. This is because the resolution clearly states a democratic society and the goal of a democratic society is justice. Also my opponent defined his value by saying that a minor theft should not have the same consequence as a murder. This is true, there is more ail time for a murder and often times $150 is not a felony. Also if you are to say a thief should not be disenfranchised but a murderer should then my opponent has agreed with my stance and a negation is in order becuase, in this resolution it is the burden of the Aff to prove all felons should vote, not just a select group. VC: Patriotic duty does not make or break a society, infact it is not even relevant because many people are not-patriotic. A democratic society cannot exist without a social contract therefore making SC the most relevant. 1st contention A) people who receive a misdemeanor are not inside the parameters of this debate. Also this contention is rather non-topical. it is a felony, therefore society has deemed to be a dangerous crime. Also if degree mattered, sat Murderers could be disenfranchised that automatically negates the resolution. B)Also it does not matter what is a felony or not, as a said before if the Aff supports the disenfranchisement of rapists,murderers or anyone else then the resolution MUST be negated. C: Cross apply my other arguments against this contention here. 2: They have broken the social contract, and should therefore lose the political liberties guaranteed under it. If we allowed them to vote it would elevate them as I say in Contention 1 Subpoint B. This is not dehumanization but justice. 3. What about people voting in prison? They are still felons. Also felons have sacrificed the right to vote by committing a felony. Also even in states without disenfranchisement the recidivism numbers are just as high. 2nd Contention It may have BEEN something but it is not know. the system is color blind. If someone commits a felony they are a felon, it doesn't matter what race they are. Silencing minorities? it may just be that statistically they commit more crimes I don't know but it seems that this is an over generalization. and in itself in unequal becuase it is saying we should abolish it becuase one group does it more? THAT is racist.",

            "premise": "Here are some links to the rules. It is for ld of Lincoln-Douglas debate. http://www.nflonline.org... http://www.neisd.net.... (Page 9) 1: First let us see what everyday people have to say. -\"People need to stop thinking about themselves Of course prisoners should have the right to vote! A convicted criminal or not, they are still members of our society. To say they no longer deserve a voice is not only inconsiderate but selfish. Give me one good reason why prisoners shouldn't be able to vote? I guarantee ever answer will be an selfish excuse. Just because their opinion may not align with yours, doesn't mean that it should be stripped from them. Prisoners are put under the protection of the government and therefore have the full right to be able to have a say on who protects them.\" -\"YES They Should!!!!!! Some are good they just made a mistake, so why shouldn't they decide on their future when they come out?If they don't vote it would be very unfair. After all, they are human no matter what they have done they are still citizens. They have human rights and two wrongs doesn't make a right! If you do let them vote, when they come out they will probably not commit to a crime or break the law because they respect their prime minister! They have their rights and we have ours too! They should because its like saying you cant play this board game because you cheated in one 10 years ago!\" -\"YES In regards to the person's statement saying \"they broke the law, therefore they don't deserve the law\" argument... if that is the case, do you suggest that we don't provide them with lawyers, judges, jury, etc. in which to try and convict them? Your argument suggests that we should simply throw people in jail, swallow the key, and let them rot. This, while these people may violated human rights and law, deserve the equal right to be judged under our culturally unique system of law... and pay for their crimes dearly.\" Read more of what others have to say @ http://www.debate.org... 2: Here are top 10 reasons why inmates should be allowed to vote. A: \"We let ex-convicts marry, reproduce, buy beer, own property and drive. They don't lose their freedom of religion, their right against self-incrimination or their right not to have soldiers quartered in their homes in time of war. But in many places, the assumption is that they can't be trusted to help choose our leaders... If we thought criminals could never be reformed, we wouldn't let them out of prison in the first place.\" B: \"In many states, felony disenfranchisement laws are still on the books. And the current scope of these policies is not only too significant to ignore \" it is also too unjust to tolerate... And although well over a century has passed since post-Reconstruction states used these measures to strip African Americans of their most fundamental rights, the impact of felony disenfranchisement on modern communities of color remains both disproportionate and unacceptable. Throughout America, 2.2 million black citizens \" or nearly one in 13 African-American adults \" are banned from voting because of these laws. In three states \" Florida, Kentucky, and Virginia \" that ratio climbs to one in five.\" C:\"There are three potential constitutional bases for Congress's authority to enfranchise non-incarcerated offenders for federal elections : - Congress's supervisory power over federal elections, rooted in Article 1, Sec. 4; - Congress's enforcement power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and - Congress's enforcement power under Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment.\" D: \"It is plain to anyone reading the Voting Rights Act that it applies to all 'voting qualification[s].' And it is equally plain that [New York Election Law] \" 5-106 [which denies the vote to incarcerated felons and felons on parole] disqualifies a group of people from voting. These two propositions should constitute the entirety of our analysis. Section 2 of the Act by its unambiguous terms subjects felony disenfranchisement and all other voting qualifications to its coverage. The duty of a judge is to follow the law, not to question its plain terms. I do not believe that Congress wishes us to disregard the plain language of any statute or to invent exceptions to the statutes it has created. The majority's 'wealth of persuasive evidence' that Congress intended felony disenfranchisement laws to be immune from scrutiny... includes not a single legislator actually saying so. But even if Congress had doubts about the wisdom of subjecting felony disenfranchisement laws to the results test of \" 2, I trust that Congress would prefer to make any needed changes itself, rather than have courts do so for it.\" E: \"The Eighth Amendment 'succinctly prohibits 'excessive' sanctions,' and demands that 'punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense'... Thus, the states that continue to exclude all felons permanently are outliers, both within the United States and in the world.\" F: \"[T]he argument that allowing prisoners to vote would be costly and impractical is ethically unjustifiable. Similarly, the fact that prisoners lose many freedoms does not imply they should lose all their civil rights. Denying prisoners the right to vote is likely to undermine respect for the rule of law... Allowing prisoners to vote, by contrast, may strengthen their social ties and commitment to the common good, thus promoting legally responsible participation in civil society.\" G: \"I believe that the commission of a crime must have a tough and just consequence... I also believe that once an offender has fully paid his debt to society, he deserves a second chance... It is a mark of good government to restore felons' rights and provide them the opportunity to succeed and become law-abiding citizens again... Therefore, I am amending the criteria used to adjudicate non-violent felons applications for restoration of rights. With these changes, Virginia will have an automatic restoration of rights process...\" H: \"People should not be barred from voting solely because they are unable to pay back their fines, fees and interest. If we truly want people convicted of felonies to re-engage with society, become rehabilitated, and feel a part of a broader community (thus creating incentives not to recidivate) then our State should do everything possible to re-incorporate these individuals into mainstream society. In terms of being a just and even handed society, it is not fair if thousands of people are unable to re-gain their voting rights because they are poor... People who are wealthy or have access to money are able to repay their financial debts and poor people (the vast majority of people who have felony convictions) are not. This is an unjust system.\" I: \"Despite its initial attractiveness, the use of social contract theory to defend felon disenfranchisement is in fact specious. Under a regime of disenfranchisement, an individual who breaches the social contract continues to be bound by the terms of the contract even after being stripped of the ability to take part in political decisions. However, contract doctrine does not allow an injured party to force the breacher to perform its contractual duties without the injured party performing its own. The contract can be terminated or the injured party can accept the performance, but the injured party cannot simply pick and choose which terms will remain and which will not... Social contract theory and the objectives of punishment fail to provide a satisfactory explanation for the denial of one of the most fundamental rights to millions of citizens.\" J:\"[In New York] ex-felons who are registered overwhelmingly register as Democrats. Of those discharge records that match to at least one voter file record, 61.5 percent match only to Democratic voter records. In contrast, 25.5 percent match only to voter records with no affiliation or an affiliation with a minor party, while 9 percent match only to Republican voter records... ...[R]egistered ex-felons in New Mexico tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat: 51.9 percent match to only registered Democrats, 18.9 percent match to only registered Republicans, 21.7 percent match to only individuals registered neither as Democrats nor Republicans, and 7.5 percent match to multiple individuals who affiliate with different parties...\" http://felonvoting.procon.org... 3: Many countries restrict the right of those sentenced to imprisonment to vote in elections. For example, convicted prisoners are automatically banned from voting in Armenia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Luxemburg, Romania, Russia and the United Kingdom. In Australia, prisoners are only entitled to vote if they are serving a sentence of less than three years. Eighteen European states, including Spain, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, place no formal prohibition on prisoners voting. In practice http://wwww.idebate.org... 4: During 2002 Canada gave prisoners the right to vote. On January 4, 2010, a federal appeals court ruled that Washington State prisoners should be allowed to vote to ensure that racial minorities are protected under the Voting Rights Act, as African Americans make up 3% of Washington's general population, but are 28% of its prison population. The lawsuit that was ruled on contended that as non whites make up a large percentage of the prison population, the State law prohibiting inmates and parolees from voting is illegal as it dilutes the electoral clout of minorities. The Sentencing Project estimates that due to their legal status, 5.3 million Americans who would otherwise be entitled to vote do not have that right. laws barring prisoners and parolees from voting violate the Voting Rights Act. http://www.change.org...

            "conclusion": "Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote.",
            "premise": "When you go against society, and commit a felony, you lose this societies trust. We don't let children vote, or the mentally incompetent vote, because we cannot trust there decisions. The same comes with felons. We cannot trust them, because of their poor judgment to commit a felony, therefore they cannot vote. People who commit serious crimes have shown that they are not trustworthy. When they decided they were going to go against society, they also decided they are going to lose their right to vote. Value: Justice It is not fair to give an equal voice in society to someone who has been a law abiding citizen, and a felon who has gone against society all together. When someone commits a felony, they should lose there right to vote. If a person wants a say in a Democracy, and wants to be able to vote in a Democracy, they must not go against it and commit a felony. Now why would we, as citizens, as non-felon citizens, want felons helping to pick our representatives? If you're a convicted felon, convicted of a violent crime, you have bad judgment. Why would we want people with that judgment picking our representatives? Criterion: just deserts Just deserts is basically giving people what they deserve. It is doing wrong and taking action for your wrong doing. In this round, you will see that people don't deserve the right to vote after they have committed a felony. My first contention is that it in not fair or equal to give a felon who has gone against a democratic society and a law abiding citizen equal voting rights. My second contention is felons being used by candidates running for office. My third contention is the public opinion rejecting felon voting rights. Contention 1: By committing a very serious crime, ex-felons demonstrate disrespect for the law. Therefore, they should have no input in determining who writes these laws. Felons shouldn't have the same voting rights as regular, law abiding, hard working Americans. In 2000 the Supreme Court affirmed the district court's interpretation that our constitution does not protect the right of all citizens to vote, but rather the right of all qualified citizens to vote. This means it is the state legislature's power to decide who is qualified. If you are a citizen over 18 you are automatically qualified. If you are considered mentally incompetent, or commit a felony you are disqualified. This is about being disqualified from voting. The same comes with gun rights, if someone abuses guns; we take that right away from them. So if a felon abuses a society, the society takes away the felon's right to vote. The American citizens who make up the democratic society are the people who should be the ones deciding who there leader is going to be, not the felons that have become outcasts of this society by going against it. The felon made their choice when they decided to go against society. Contention 2: There are currently 5.3 million felons in the United States who have lost there right to vote. Say these 5.3 million felons could vote and one of the candidates was going to be extremely less harsh against criminals. These extra 5.3 million votes would almost surely give a candidate a victory. Do we, law abiding American citizens want our representatives to be decided on by felons? No. If you are a convicted felon, convicted of a violent crime, you obviously have bad judgment, so why should a society let you use your judgment to pick out the better candidate? The voting is not only voting for a presidential candidate, but also the local elections. In a city in California, called signal hill, the vote for mayor came down to one vote. In a school board election in Alaska, it was a dead even tie, bringing it to a coin flip. If there would have been one more person voting, a felon, they would have decided who was going to win. Do we really want felons deciding who a mayor or a school board member is? Contention 3: Much of the American public supports the disenfranchisement if felons. To be exact 81.7% of Americans believe that felons should lose their right to vote. Less than one-tenth of people surveyed believed that felons should keep there right to vote. These people believe that felons should lose their right to vote even after serving prison time because they still cannot be trusted. According to the Florida Department of Correction, over 40% of offenders commit another crime within 3 years of there release; and for those under 18 this number skyrockets to 73%. Furthermore a 2003 Department of Justice report found that more than 70 percent of arrestees tested positive for drugs. The American public has spoken, and the outcome was that most do not want felons to be able to have any part in voting. A democracy is a government made by a society's people. So if the American people think that felons should not be able to vote by this much of a margin, felons should not be allowed suffrage. In my first contention I proved that felons don't deserve equal rights because the have gone against the law, and in my second contention I showed that felons could get used by candidates, and I gave facts about them not being trustworthy. In my third contention I spoke about how the American public doesn't want felons voting, and they are the democracy. With the evidence I have brought up and the case I have given I would urge your ballot toward the negative side.",

            "premise": "I will be debating against the topic, \"Resolved: In the United States, Felons should not be allowed to vote upon release from prison.\" Now, to jump right in. Sorry about that last round; I was a little bit busy, but I would like to provide constructives and rebuttals in this round. I would first like to point out one statistical discrepancy in the proposition\"s case. He has stated that 5.9 million people, or 6% of our country\"s population cannot vote, but this is clearly an incorrect statistic. According to the most recent statistics from 2014, our country\"s population is 318.9 Million. 5.9 million people out of 318.9 Million is just under 2%, not 6%. This brings us to question all of proposition\"s evidence and empiric. Now, to get on to constructive assertions. 1: Allowing these felons to vote is not a federal issue and cannot be decided by the U.S. Government or the Supreme Court to encompass the entire United States, as proposition is arguing. According to the Bill of Rights, this issue is decided by the states. Most prominently, the 14th Amendment makes felon voting a state prerogative, not a federal one. If voters choose to change state laws regarding felons and voting, it's their prerogative. Federalism allows for such state-level experimentation, and it's at the state level where the consequences of new felon-voting laws will best be judged. This assertion itself negates proposition\"s whole case. Proposition is arguing that we should make a law encompassing the entire United States to allow these released felons to vote. This is not legal, according to the 14th Amendment of our Bill of Rights. 2: The reason we don\"t let children vote in the United States is because they have not developed proper judgment and cannot decide which party to vote for. These felons are not allowed to vote for this same reason. If someone has gone to jail for over one year, then they have committed a fairly bad crime such as assault, they have shown that they are not trustworthy and their judgment is not good. I will now strengthen my case with rebuttals. As pointed out earlier, we come to doubt Pro\"s evidence because of the discrepancy. Rebuttal to 1a: A change of an election outcome is not enough reason to base changing the law on. If children were allowed to vote, the result of elections would drastically change, but they are not allowed to vote. A change in outcome has nothing to do with the positive or negative values of Felon voting. Many things may cause a change in the outcome of elections. That doesn\"t mean they are good. Rebuttal to 1b: In fact, punishment, more often than not, does not end after a prison sentence is over. Parole is a punishment that is given to the majority of felons coming out of prison, which means their punishment is being continued to make sure that they have learned their lesson. Rebuttal to 1c: Pro has provided no solid evidence for this point, just that it \"seems to be excessive\" to not let these felons vote. But we have these punishments for a reason. Rebuttal to 2a: This point is invalid to this debate, because this debate is about felons, and tampering with crab traps is not a felony, its only major punishment is a fine. A felon is someone who has been convicted to death or one or more years in prison for a crime. Rebuttal to 3: It is not racist that these felon voting laws are not allowing these felons to vote. The laws are the same for all races. If the laws specifically didn\"t allow African Americans to vote, then they would be racist. But the fact that minorities can\"t vote because of these laws doesn\"t prove the laws to be racist, it just proves that these minorities commit more than the average amount of crimes. Rebuttal to 4: This argument about other countries having felon voting as a law is invalid because the fact that other countries have instated these laws doesn\"t prove they are good. Pro has provided us with no statistics to show that with these laws, these other countries were benefited, and all he says is that America \"would maybe gain more international respect.\" First of all, America doesn\"t need any more international respect. And second of all, it is not gain respect in the eyes of other countries if we go against our own constitution. I have refuted all of Pro\"s points and added two points to this debate. I strongly urge a vote for Con in this debate.",

            "conclusion": "Convicted ex-felons should be able to vote in all US elections.",
            "premise": "I'll begin by responding to refutals P1: Many felons return to prison within 3 years of the same or another crime. You asked \"Does it make sense to take away the rights of a citizen just because of something they MIGHT do?\". To that question, I respond by saying that this right would be taken away because of something an ex-felon has done in the past and is LIKELY to do again (according to statistics, I know that not every ex-felon is going to be convicted again, but a majority are). I believe that the punishment of disenfranchisement lasts for life simply because its meant to prevent citizens from committing a felony, and thus give them an incentive not to become a felon. P2: It would not be fair to citizens who have never been convicted of a felony. I think that it is perfectly justified to implement bigger consequences for those who have broken the law in the past, in an attempt to prevent them from doing so again. However, if a criminal is determined to start a new life as a law abiding citizen (who would not be shoplifting or anything of the sort anyways), then who is to say that they are not able to find work? Sure, it may be more difficult, but not impossible, and that is just one of the social consequences of breaking the law the first time. If you wanted to become the next CEO of a major corporation, you probably should not have committed a felony. So obviously ex-felons are barred from high ranking positions, and that's because of society, but there are plenty of jobs out there if one is looking for them and is determined to work hard. P3: Felons should gain the right to vote by proving that their judgement is valid. The life long consequences of breaking the law do not mean that a felon cannot become an ex-felon, that's absurd. Once a felon is released from prison, he/she can pursue anything he/she wants, and the inability to vote will not directly effect that freedom (once again, perhaps indirectly). Clearly somebody who has committed a felony has at one time had an invalid judgement, and so, should we really be required to allow them to vote if they are still in a similar state of mind? Would we want a mentally ill person voting? Not an irrelevant comparison, as both may have distorted views of what is right and wrong. Thus the implementation of some sort of psychological evaluation would be enough to confirm a certain level of mental stability and reasoning that is acceptable. Clearly somebody with a reasoning that its ok to kill or steal should not be allowed to vote in elections that influence all of us as a whole. Their judgements and by extension opinions are invalid. Now on to refuting your points P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. A) I meant that if a US citizen commits a felony, it is justifiable to revoke their right to vote for life (I'll explain why later) B) Although revoking the right to vote lasts forever, I do not believe it to be an excessive sanction either. Once again, individually, the right to vote does not effect normal life in society, and you can function perfectly fine without it. C) Here I was saying that an ex-felon's right to vote was revoked simply because they broke the law, not because of the previous condition of servitude itself. The mere fact that they were in prison does not effect the right to vote, its the felony that was committed. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. A) Your statement that minorities \" occupy the majority of prison cells\" is correct. However, even if they could vote, the imbalance would still very much be there. Also, just because many prisoners are minorities does not make it acceptable to give them the right to vote, based merely on that fact. They did something wrong, and the color of their skin has nothing to do with that (although it may be linked to socio-economic background). This is implemented across the board, so even though many ex-felons are minorities, white ex-felons do not have the ability to vote either, and so the law does not discriminate against race. B) You said \"Overwhelmingly, the people who commit crimes are from the lower income class, and these are also the people who tend to vote for Democrats\". While this may be true, we cannot assume that they would vote for any one candidate, and so revoking an ex-felons ability to vote cannot be seen as an attempt to suppress Democratic voters. That would be openly admitting that most ex-felons are Democrats due to the fact that they are minorities. C) You asked \"Then how do you explain the countries that do not disenfranchise ex-felons?\" Well I have found no data that would suggest that crime rates and disenfranchisement have any correlation at all. If I had to guess, I would say these countries have a lower crime rate because of their social safety nets and superior public education systems, but I honestly do not know. D) I did not suggest that ex-felons replace the right to vote, I was simply implying that there are other ways to express an opinion other than voting. According to your argument, ex-felons resort to breaking the law if their opinions are not heard, but expressing your opinion can be done through many other ways, and not just through voting. P3: Felons deserve a right to vote. A) How are we supposed to gauge whether or not an ex-felon is capable of using this right responsibly? He/she may vote for a candidate with many flaws because he/she does not have the judgement necessary to see or even weigh these things against possible benefits that the candidate may provide to him/her specifically. B) By voting for the next president, ex-felons indirectly decide which policies and bills are implemented or signed into law. Although they do provide a larger group that is voting, are every single one of their opinions valid enough to be able to effect us all? This is why some kind of evaluation should first be done to ensure that ex-felons are able to reason, and subsequently weigh pro's and con's of candidates in elections. Those were some very strong arguments you put up, I look forward to the final round :)",

            "premise": "1. Under LD debate rules, the definitions have to be made at the outset. However, this is not a debate under LD rules. For a debate.org debate to be made under LD rules, the proponent has to declare that unambiguously in the challenge. That was not done in this case. There are also LD rules pertaining to officially declaring and challenging values and value criteria. Those rules do not apply either. It is free form debate, the intellectual equivalent of a cage match. However, there is no escape from semantics, logic, and verification of facts. Those are inherent to debate. 2. I don't have a problem with Con's definitions as far as they go. The meaning of \"democratic\" is separately contested below. I also dispute Con's definition of \"felony.\" Note that we are only dealing with convicted felons. Felons who haven't been convicted retain the right to vote. 3. I reject Con's thesis that the pre\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdminent value at issue is or ought to be democracy. The value at issue is and ought to be good government. If democracy were the pre\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdminent value, then the Founders would have specified a democracy in the Constitution rather than a republic. Moreover, if democracy were the most important thing, then non-citizens and even small children would be afforded the right to vote. We have a republic, and we restrict voting in the interests of good government. All democratic governments do the same, all in the interests of good government. 4. I challenge Con to say whether or not he favors extending the vote in all elections to non-citizens and small children? If he does not, then I challenge him to explain the principle at work that he uses to override the extension of democracy. 5. Con asserts, \"Clearly there exists no standing relationship between disenfranchising and a criminal act.\" This assertion is false, because there is clear data that convicted felons are likely to continue exercising poor judgment by continuing to commit criminal acts. The primary interest of career criminals when voting is to undermine the justice system, and therefore that is good reason to withhold voting rights. It is true that some convicted felons will reform and vote according to the general interests of American society. It is also true that some non-citizens and some under-age citizens will exercise the judgment to vote along with the general interests of American society as a whole. The exclusion of those classes of voters is based upon the considerable probability that they will not. The case is as strong or stronger that a convicted felon will not vote with the interests of society considered in the way that non-felons will consider them. Felons can be relied upon to vote overwhelmingly to undermine the justice system. 6. Con rebuts \"the thing is the resolution states democratic society. it does not state one certain democratic society such as the U.S. so this argument can be dropped.\" So can a society be \"democratic\" without being a strict democracy in which everyone votes and every law is put to a direct vote of the people? The definition of \"democratic\" is http://www.answers.com... 1. Of, characterized by, or advocating democracy: democratic government; a democratic union. 2. Of or for the people in general; popular: a democratic movement; democratic art forms. 3. Believing in or practicing social equality: \"a proper democratic scorn for bloated dukes and lords\" (George du Maurier). A government need not be a strict democracy, as Con supposes, to be characterized by democracy. None of the definitions support Con's strict definition. Moreover, if Con's definition were accepted, then people would truthfully say things like, \"There are no democratic governments anywhere in the world.\" The opposite is quite clear, people recognize that many governments are characterized by democracy without being the strict democracies that Con supposes. 7. Con asks, \"If it [is] said all men were created equal then why are felons disenfranchised?\" The short answer is that they may have been created equal, but felons went astray after their creation, and their demonstrated lack of judgment resulted in their disenfranchisement. The long answer is that the quoted \"created equal\" is in the Declaration of Independence, which is not a governing document. Clarification of the implications of \"created equal\" lies in the Constitution. The Constitution establishes the classes under which discrimination under law is prohibited, and there is nothing that prohibits discrimination for felony conviction. If the Constitution prohibited discrimination for felony conviction, then felons could not be imprisoned. None of the other protected classes (race, religion, ethnicity) can be imprisoned solely for being a member of the class. 8. Con asks, \"what is the difference between felons and citizens, aren't the both citizens?\" They are both citizens, but so are small children. Citizenship alone provides no guarantee of a right to vote. 9. Con claims, \"my oppent [opponent] states that 'Convicted felons are an identifiable target for politicians', this argument cant be upheld or proven true, because there is no evidence to prove this claim.\" It is fair in a debate to call upon the common sense of the audience (or judges). The assertion follows from (1) The main purpose of voting is that citizens may look out for their interests, (2) politicians appeal to the interests of citizens to get votes, (3) criminals have a strong interest in weakening the justice system, and therefore (4) politicians will target criminals with positions that favor weakening the justice system. There is supporting evidence from cases in Florida, cited, wherein Liberal politicians clearly believed they could win the criminal vote. 10. Con claims, \"as we can clearly see if we vote for the PRO. we will be punishing criminals twice by taking away the right to vote and by making them serve a sentence.\" First, there is nothing wrong with punishing someone in two different ways. We punish many felons by both imprisoning them and later putting them on parole, and sometimes also making them register and wear a tracking device. Second, Con agreed that a purpose of imprisonment is not only punishment, but to prevent the criminal from doing further harm. Denying the vote is a proper and reasonable way to prevent the criminal from doing further harm by voting for candidates that promise to weaken the justice system. 11. Con asserts \"he [Pro] states that letting felons vote will hurt our economy and justice system. this is not true because there are such felonies that are minor such as J-walking and repeated speeding.\" This is incorrect. There are three classes of crimes infractions, misdemeanors, and felonies. J-walking is an infraction. Repeated speeding is usually and infraction, but might rise to a misdemeanor depending upon the state and the circumstances. Felonies are only the most serious crimes. For example, felony drunk driving generally involves killing someone. A felony is \"One of several grave crimes, such as murder, rape, or burglary, punishable by a more stringent sentence than that given for a misdemeanor.\" http://www.answers.com... Summary Con's rebuttal is an artificial construct that supposes that democracy is a supreme value that ought to trump good government. There is ample evidence that virtually no one believes that have more democracy leads to better government. To the contrary, the Founders preferred a republic, and minors and non-citizens are not allowed to vote -- all in the interests of good government. Felons have proved poor judgment and so the interests of good government should prevail. The resolution is affirmed.",

            "conclusion": "In a Democratic Society Felons ought to Retain the Right to Vote",
            "premise": "Ok. I will first reattack my opponents case/his defense of my attacks. Then go through some key voter issues and show why each of these swings in favor of the Negative side. So with the Values/Value Criterion. Sorry I though my opponents value was Equality in the broad sense of the term, not specifically political equality. I completely agree with my opponent, that political equality is important in a democratic society and everyones votes in society have to be held equally. Actually let me rephrase that, everyone should have the equal opportunity to vote. And felons did have the equal opportunity to vote, until they violated societies rights. Now the question is do felons belong to society? I will get back to this later I would first like to answer his attacks on my Value. My opponents attack on my value was that it was not topical, and that justice is the foundation of communism. However that is not the case. I have 3 responses to this 1- He said that justice is contradictory to democracy because a knowlegable voter deserves to vote more than an ignorant voter. This might be the case in some societies, but not DEMOCRATIC societies were everyone IN society is \"due\" the equal opportunity to vote. 2- He said that justice lead to communism. This is not true. Infact because communism is based off the belief that everyone is equal, and everyone is given equal property, equal pay... Take China for example, while China is not communist because communism requires the cooperation of the entire world and all other countries to be communist, it is commonly refered to as communist, and probably the closest thing we have to communism. Everyone in China is given equal everything. 3- A democracy must uphold justice. If it does not chaos ensues. You cannot allow a murderor to run around society killing people. Because he is a murderor he is no longer due the right to liberty, and in order to protect society, liberty must be taken away. Justice must be valued over equality in this debate because as I have said before equality of any kind only exists as long as people believe they are equal. Felons who have murdered/raped/and commited heinous crimes against society don't abide by societies laws and should not be given the benefits of belonging to society. The way in which we ensure that people believe they are equal is by upholding justice. If you are the President of the U.S. and you kill someone, you are due no more or no less than the punishment given to a stoner who commits the same crime. Removing a felon's right to vote is one way in which society send the message that commiting a serious crime will have a serios consequence regardless of who they are. As for his observation 1 There's really no point in bring it up now because I don't really believe I've broken any of them, but if I have and my opponent brings it up, I will have no way to defend myself, as his rebuttal will be the last one. As for his observation 2 What we have to ask ourselves in this debate is not whether or not felons should be able to vote, It is whether or not felons should RETAIN the right to vote. So lets take that felon from 1960, it's true he is still a felon in 2008, but he might be able to vote because(lets say he was imprisoned for 10 years) during those ten years he did not keep the right to vote, and therefore did not retain them, he did however regain the right to vote. A felon is still a felon regardless of whether or not that felon has the right to vote. The right to vote and being a felon are two completely different things, you can have someone who commits a felony but is able to vote be considered a felon as you can have someone who commits a felony who doesn't have the right to vote be considered a felon. Secondly I do not have to advocate that felons loose the right to vote forever, I have to advocate that they should loose their right to vote for a period of time because that would mean that that felon did not retain the the right to vote which would still be negating the resolution, which is the burden on the Negative side. Observation 3 Yes of course felons don't deserve the right to vote. They have commited a heinous crime against society, they have voilated rights. A felony isn't some petty misdeameanor, it is Murder/Rape/Assualt/Fraud/Treason/Embezzlement/Grand theft. They have shown that their judgement is flawed and if they cannot govern their own lives without violating society, they cannot be expected to govern society. In fact felons are law breakers, and therefore they can have no hand in making the laws the rest of society abides by. When you hold a ballot in your hand, you hold the fate of your entire country in you hand. Now ask yourselves this do we really want a felon, someone who has shown that their judgement is so flawed to the extent they have voilated societies right, to hold your fate in their hands? Observation 4 Yes commiting a crime does remove you from society to a certain extent. But it does not create a biopower. For example are non-citizens part of our society? Not really. Are we going to be able to kill them without facing repercussions? No. Or children. are they in society? yes (meaning they live in society) but are they out of society(can they vote?)No. Are we going to kill them without facing repercussions? No. So removing a felon from society for a certain period of time, does not create a biopower. Furthermore during the holocaust the races who were being oppressed did nothing to provoke their removal from society, whereas felons have violated societies rights have made that choice to remove themselves from society. Now to 1a and 2a My opponent seems to be thinking that everyone out there is perfect(obviously not true otherwise we wouldn't have felons) and they will automatically vote for whatever is good for society. Lets say we are voting on a preposition to outlaw the manufacturing of tobacco. Are tobacco companies going to be happy? Are they/ or anyone affiliated with tobacco(i.e smokers, employees...) going to vote for this proposition? No Is it obviously for the good of society? Yes. In fact what is good is different to a lot of people, and the outcome of an election can change if felons vote because EVERY vote matters. Felon voting does have harms, it would basically lessan the severity of commiting a felony, because the punishment would not be as severe. It would allow people who have no respect for society, and who have shown a blatant disregard for societies laws to have a hand in making those laws. Democracy-Government by the people; that form of government in which the sovereign power resides in the people as a whole, and is exercised either directly by them (as in the small republics of antiquity) or BY OFFICERS ELECTED BY THEM.(OED) Therefore a democracy does exist if it has elected officials voting on your behalf. P.S. OED stand for Oxford English Dictionary, just FYI. Again with the felons out of jail voting. Negating the resolution doesn't mean that all felons can't vote. It means that all felons should lose their right to vote for a certain period of time. My opponent seems to want to force me to say that Felons should lose the right to vote indefinitely. But that is not what I am saying. I am saying felons should not retain the right to vote. There is a difference. Now for some voter issues. Will allowing felons to vote harm society? Yes as I have already said felons believe they are above society, and felons do not abide by societies laws. Should people who believe themselves above society vote? No, a democratic society is run by the people in society. For example children aren't allowed to vote beacuse most of them don't pay taxes, and they son't really contribute to society. They can't serve in the army, and they are held to a different regard than the rest of the people in society. Actually I have 89 letters left, so because I have negated all my opponents points, I urge for a Neg Vote",

            "premise": "A felony is a serious crime in the United States and previously other common law countries. The term originates from English common law where felonies were originally crimes which involved the confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods; other crimes were called misdemeanors. Most common law countries have now abolished the felony/misdemeanor distinction and/or replaced it with other distinctions such as between summary offences and indictable offenses. Crimes commonly considered to be felonies include, but are not limited to: aggravated assault and/or battery, arson, burglary, illegal drug abuse/sales, embezzlement, grand theft, treason, espionage, racketeering, robbery, murder, rape, kidnapping and fraud. People have the right to vote to form a democracy. A democracy is run by the people and for the people. The people vote on there leaders, there laws, and many other important issues. If the people think that felons should not be given suffrage, then in order for a democracy to be kept they mustn't vote. In some cases like maine and vermont voting is allowed by all felons because they have so many prisons in such little area that they make up much of there population in these states. Is this who we want to be voting? or should we have the hard-working americans who actually abide by the laws that felons help make?",

            "premise": "Do the names Carrie Lenz or Cindy Brown ring a bell? Probably not. They were 26 years old when Tim McVeigh stopped them from ever voting again by bombing the Oklahoma City Federal building. Carrie and Cindy were in good company. There were 166 others in that one felony crime. The Bureau of Justice lists over 847,000 homicides since 1960. If all those people had lived out their normal lives, that would affect over 9 million presidential votes and over 18 million municipal votes. My value is justice. Justice, according to the Encarta Dictionary, is fairness or reasonableness, especially in the way people are treated or decisions are made. There is nothing fair that felons like these are allowed to vote while many victims cannot. My criterion is upholding the equal treatment of citizens. Equality in a democratic society is never reached when you subtract victim voices while adding felon voices. The ONLY way to achieve equal treatment of citizens is to negate the resolution that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain their right to vote. A felon, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is someone who has been convicted of a serious crime. They may be currently incarcerated or released. ---------- Contention 1 Felons have chosen not to vote. Committing a felony requires premeditation and intent. The consequences of felony convictions are widely known to include no firearms, no elected offices, no jury duty and no voting. My opponent agreed in cross examination that a vote could not be changed once cast - so, in order to treat a felon like other members of society - the felon's decision not to vote should be honored by society.",

            "premise": "To my respected opponent, El Edward, thank you for starting this debate. I hope it will be a good one. >Friedrich von Schiller once said that \"votes should be weighed, not counted.\" I agree with him, and it is because I believe in a social contract with the government that I choose to negate the resolution: >Negated: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. >For clarification of the round, I would like to offer the following definitions (in addition to yours): >Felon: a person who has been convicted of a felony, which is a crime punishable by death or a term in state or federal prison >Felony (elaboration): a crime sufficiently serious to be punishable by death or a term in state or federal prison, as distinguished from a misdemeanor which is only punishable by confinement to county or local jail and/or a fine >Murderer: One guilty of murder; a person who, in possession of his reason, unlawfully kills a human being with premeditated malice. >Social Contract: Implied agreements by which people form nations and maintain a social order. Such social contract implies that the people give up some rights to a government and other authority in order to receive or jointly preserve social order >I would also like to offer the following observations: :: Observation :: >Due to the wording of the resolution, the felon may or may not be jailed at present. Also due to the wording of the resolution, the affirmative has the burden of proof and must prove the resolution true in all cases. :: Value :: >My value is Human Rights. All humans are given fundamental rights in a democratic society. These rights allow the members of society to freely exercise their views. If, however, the members of society were to break the social contract with the government, then they would not deserve the same rights as others. Having its contract with the individual broken, the government is not longer obliged to allow the felons any right to alter its processes, and thus can revoke the right to vote. :: Value Criterion :: >My value criterion is a Social Contract. Social contracts are vital in every society, democratic or not, because they allow the citizens and the government to give each other power, but also to limit one another. This is fundamentally vital to the legislative processes. Once a citizen has committed a felony and become a felon they have shown that they no longer respect the social contract having committed a high crime. This principle means that the government is no longer responsible to represent the felon as the felon has misrepresented it. It is then under the government's discretion whether or not to re-grant privileges such as the right to vote back to the individual. :: Contention 1 :: >My first contention is that felons do not deserve to decide an election. When felons break the social contract with their government their government is no longer obligated to let them choose its members. If felons were given suffrage and actually did decide an election then an unfit candidate would probably be elected, having a negative impact on society and ultimately showing the poor decision making that caused the felons to become felons in the first place. This will then adversely affect all members of society for the worse of the people. This in itself is a far greater crime than a felony is. :: Contention 2 :: >My second contention is that once felons commit a crime against a society they no longer deserve to be a part of that society. They have violated the social contract with the government as so many other citizens have not. They do not deserve equal treatment to the rest of society because they have made an anti-societal gesture in committing a felony. It is rash to believe that felons have truly changed and become more productive members of society after committing such a high crime. It is an assumption that a society cannot make because it will then endanger itself by allowing convicted felons equality in an unequal world. :: Sub-point A :: >My sub-point A is that all people are created equal but they all make different decisions and do not stay equal. Felons are not chosen to be diverse than the rest of society, they make that choice themselves when committing a felony. They are asking to be valued above the rest of society when they ask to be given the same right to vote. They have committed a high crime and do not deserve the same societal rights as those who have not. That teaches felons that it is permissible to commit a felony and in addition to voting they would even commit a felony again, thus making society much less safe. :: Sub-point B :: >My sub-point B is that equality cannot be achieved in the case of murderers. Having \"[killed] a human being with premeditated malice\" the murderer has taken the right to vote from their victim. Being deceased, that person can no longer vote or voice their values. The murderer then cannot be granted the right to vote in the interest of equality because they have then created an unequal system by killing off a person and effectively their voice while still retaining their won. :: Conclusion :: >In conclusion, the stipulation of this resolution is which rights felons do and do not deserve. The resolution is correctly negated because felons are not deserving of the right to vote after breaking their social contract with their government. They do not deserve equality to the rest of society because they have committed a high crime (felony) which most of society has not. To treat felons like all others within the society would be endorsing the idea of committing felonies; implicating that despite committing a felony, felons will still be treated like the rest of the society, which should not happen. >I will now move on to my opponent's case. :: Value :: >I agree with my opponent that a main goal in a democratic society (hence the name) is to be democratic. I believe that my opponent does not realize that even democracy has limits. If the democracy would allow its members to go around committing felonies then the society would not survive very long. The democracy needs to be realistic about how much it limits felons. :: Value Criterion :: >Basically the same as my argument against my opponent's value; there must be limits in any society. :: Contention 1 :: >The first thing I would like to bring up is that references to the Founding Fathers and the United States Constitution are not valid in this debate because the resolution refers to a democratic society, not to a republic as is the United States. My argument against you contention is this: felons have made the choice to commit a felony or high crime in their society. Is it really correct to allow them the same rights as good law-abiding people? :: Contention 2 :: >The first thing that I would like to say is that my opponent did a brilliant job of saying his second contention and he deserves a great deal of credit for it. Sadly, though, he is not entirely correct. Though disenfranchisement does not fit any of your reasons for punishment, it is not a punishment so much as it is stopping the felons from poorly influencing the processes of the government. :: Contention 3 :: >My attack against my opponent's third contention goes back to my observation. My observation states that \"due to the wording of the resolution, the affirmative has the burden of proof and must prove the resolution true in all cases.\" Felons do not become normal civilians in all cases. Repeat offenders exist. These repeat offenders are not deserving of the right to vote while they keep committing crimes. :: Contention 4 :: >In his fourth contention my opponent referred to many different countries around the globe where felonies are not the same. That is very true; however, the resolution refers to a hypothetical democratic society, not to any one of those countries.",

            "premise": "I affirm the resolution: in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. This resolution not only deals with the United States, but with all democratic societies in the world. Before moving on to the values, I will proceed to clarify definitions. Democracy: a form of government where the supreme power is held by the people;. Felon: a person currently convicted of a felony and not yet completely served their sentences \u2013whether it is imprisonment, probation or parole. Felony: a serious crime (such as murder or arson). My value premise is Democracy; because this resolution deals with felon disenfranchisement in a democratic society, our main goal is to be democratic. Because a democracy is a form of government where the power is held by the people, maintaining the rights of the people is essential to having a democracy. The people's rights must be protected so that they may maintain the supreme power that they hold over the government. Therefore, my value criterion is protection of human rights. There are certain rights that people are entitled to, and that they must have in order to have a functional democratic society. My first contention is that voting is a right in democratic societies that cannot be violated. All people reserve the right to vote and let their opinions be heard in a democratic society. Because a democracy gives power to the people, we cannot choose who has the right to vote. A clear example of a democracy is the United States. Although it is not a pure democracy, it is as close to one a nation can be without being impractical. The United States has a population approximately of 305,559,149. A pure democracy would have to count every one of these votes \u2013 therefore a democratic republic is the best way to handle a large population while maintaining a democracy. The Founding Fathers founded this nation upon the idea that everyone is equal and that everyone is entitled to equal rights. The First Amendment of the Constitution includes many rights \u2013 one of these is the right to free speech. If a normal civilian's voice is heard through their vote, and a felon is not, we have violated their right to free speech by limiting the impact of their opinion. Even though this resolution does not specifically deal with the United States, it can be agreed that a democratic society tries to give everyone the right to have a say in the government to uphold the concept that the supreme power is held by the people. The sentencing of a felon violates no other rights than the right to liberty \u2013 which is why imprisonment is such a severe sentence. Every person has a right to have their voice heard in the government and by letting felons retain their RIGHT to vote, we protect their human rights in a democratic society. My second contention is that disenfranchising felons does not fulfill any of the recognized penal goals. These are retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation and incapacitation. Felon disenfranchisement does not fulfill any of these reasons to punish someone. Felon disenfranchisement does not deter felonies and it does not incapacitate the felon from doing any more crimes. It is clear and quite obvious that felon disenfranchisement does not deter crimes, because a felon undeterred by the chance of being caught and sent to jail won't be deterred by the threat of disenfranchisement, and it also does not stop them from committing future crimes. Violating someone's right to vote is not a suitable method of retribution because it is not proportioned to the offense. My third contention is that by taking away a felon's rights to vote you are counter-productive because you hinder the rehabilitation process. When felons are trying to become normal civilians once again, they need to receive the same benefits as a civilian would. This includes the right to vote. Because a democracy aims to be fair and just it gives power to the people. When you let felons retain the right to vote, you understand that violation of this inherent right is not a suitable method of retribution and you also realize that you help the rehabilitation process by giving them that right. Certain prison facilities are named \"Rehabilitation Centers\" because they realize that part, and maybe even most, of the reason for imprisoning felons is to rehabilitate them. Through this we can see that rehabilitation is a goal of the justice system and needs to be valued when punishing a felon for crimes. By helping the felons merge with society and become a civilian again, you protect their right to be assisted in the rehabilitation process, and by stripping them of the right to vote, you hinder that right. My fourth contention is that felons aren't necessarily irrational, mentally unstable, and against society. By not letting felons retain the right to vote, you assume that there would be a negative impact on society by giving them the right to vote. However, felonies aren't universally agreed upon, so it is an unfair assumption that felons would negatively affect society. Clear examples of this are sodomy laws everywhere in the world. Sodomy is a felony in places like the state of Virginia, Algeria, Botswana, and Nicaragua, just to name a few. These laws aren't the same in different democratic societies throughout the globe; therefore any statement saying that felons are against society is invalid. Because felonies are not agreed upon globally, there is a blurred line between choice and the right to do certain actions. Therefore, we can agree that we not only protect certain people's rights on the level of doing what they want, but we also protect the right of felons to not have the label of counter productive toward society.",

I will now rebut my opponent's contentions. \"Contention 1: A democratic society....\" A democratic society can also not be legitimate if the people's rights are not protected. Among these rights are the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If one man is to strip another of these rights he too should be punished for his actions and have some of his privileges and rights inhibited. \"Contention 2: Furthermore if we continue...\" Unfortunately, it is not the fault of the government that more minorities are criminals than whites. Supporting felon disenfranchisement, in no way supports racism. You're comparing apples and oranges. If a felon is disenfranchised, they are disenfranchised color - blind. Whether they are Asian, White, Hispanic or Purple does not matter, if a felony is committed, all felons should be punished in the same manner - because if they weren't that would be undemocratic as well. The point about the voices of the two minority groups being stifled is a baseless conjecture, Barack Obama is president. Despite what can be assumed about there being a smaller voting base many hispanic - Americans don't vote due to lack of citizenship. \"Contention 4\" - Basically continuation of Punishment restate his sentences \"This is injustice for if a man committed a felony in his late teens and is kept from voting from every election each time a new political figure come to power he will have to remember the mistake he made as a teen.\" Actually, that is justice. It's like telling a toddler to sit in the corner and think about what he did;it forces them to pay for their mistakes for the rest of their life. People don't change, and a felony is serious. No matter how good a felon's life is after prison, a felony is serious and they should have to live with a \"dumb\" or regrettable decision for the rest of their life. By not having a say in the way the country is run, they are reminded of their faulty reasoning. They proved by committing a felony that they don't deserve a say seeing as they are incapable of deciphering between right and wrong. Reinforcement of my points: -- Due to the fact that voting is a privilege and not a right, felons should be stripped of this privileges due to their poor decisions and unreasonable actions. --Felons have proved that they are not entirely capable of making a rational decision and therefore could harm the will of the people. Felons have destroyed the social fabric and infringed upon another man's rights. They should be severely punished for doing so and if disenfranchisement is a beneficial and workable policy then it should continue in existence. Furthermore, due to the fact that my opponent has not clarified if he is advocating for the suffrage of incarcerated felons, ex - felons/paroled felons one can assume that he is advocating for the voting privileges for all of the above. It is unfortunate that AnimeFanTony forfeited in the previous round. I look forward to the next round and further rebutting my opponent's points.",

            "premise": "Do the names Carrie Lenz or Cindy Brown ring a bell? Probably not. They were 26 years old when Tim McVeigh stopped them from ever voting again by bombing the Oklahoma City Federal building. Carrie and Cindy were in good company. There were 166 others in that one felony crime. The Bureau of Justice lists over 847,000 homicides since 1960. If all those people had lived out their normal lives, that would affect over 9 million presidential votes and over 18 million municipal votes. If you include those brain damaged by a felon, that number would be much, much higher. (Pause.) My value is justice. Justice, according to the Encarta Dictionary, is fairness or reasonableness, especially in the way people are treated or decisions are made. There is nothing fair that felons like these are allowed to vote while many victims cannot. My criterion is upholding the equal treatment of citizens. Equality in a democratic society is never reached when you subtract victim voices while adding felon voices. The ONLY way to achieve equal treatment of citizens is to negate the resolution that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain their right to vote. A felon, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is someone who has been convicted of a serious crime. They may be currently incarcerated or released. ---------- Contention 1 Felons have chosen not to vote. Committing a felony requires premeditation and intent. The consequences of felony convictions are widely known to include no firearms, no elected offices, no jury duty and no voting. My opponent agreed in cross examination that a vote could not be changed once cast - so, in order to treat a felon like other members of society - the felon's decision not to vote should be honored by society. Contention 2 Felons are not silenced by not voting. The affirmative wants you to believe if a felon cannot vote, he cannot participate in the political process, but Felons CAN actively campaign for issues or candidates if they so desire. Think of Carrie and Cindy or the thousands of brain injured victims of felony crimes and contrast their loss of rights to that of the felons. Then ask yourself if that is equal or just. Contention 3 Permanently keeping felon's from voting serves equality and justice. According to FBI Homicide Reports from 76 to 2005, over 90 percent of homicide victims were old enough to vote, yet were silenced by a felon. Over 81 percent of homicides had multiple victims, meaning that one felon silenced more than one voter. According to the National Child Abuse Center, felons injured over 900,000 children in 2003 alone. Over 700,000, or 80% of abused children are left with a psychiatric disorder by age 21. These disorders, including severe brain injuries, can disqualify them from voting, too. Face it, felons are savagely stealing votes from their victims while fleecing the public for voting rights in the name of democracy. Are you going to find this FAIR? To recap, felons chose not to vote, they are not silenced from politics, and not allowing them to vote serves equality and justice. Therefore, I negate the resolution. Now, let's look at my opponents case and see why it doesn't hold up.",

            "premise": "Intro: Abraham Lincoln once defined America's democracy as a government \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" The \"people\" in this quote refers to American Citizens. In this quote, it says that the citizens control the government. Since the way that the citizens control the government is by voting, I urge you to affirm the resolution: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. For clarity I would like to give the following definitions: Felon: a person who has committed a felony, which is a grave offense against society, such as murder or burglary, and commonly punished by imprisonment of more than a year, or death. Democratic Society: an organized group that is characterized by the principle of political or social equality Disenfranchisement: To deny the right to vote of a person. Vote: To express or signify will or choice in a matter Retain: To keep hold of Value: My value in this round will be a democracy. A democracy is a form of government in which the supreme power is held completely by the people under a free electoral system. This means that the people have all the power. My value criterion is maintaining equality. Equality is the idea that all people should be treated the same, with the same rights. Equality can achieve democracy because in an ideal democracy, the people hold the power, which is evenly distributed throughout the people. Thus, equality is the way to democracy. Body: 1)Since all citizens should vote, and all felons are citizens, therefore all felons should retain the right to vote. The 26th amendment of the Constitution states that all citizens over 18 years old have the right to vote. Also, the resolution says that \"felons ought to retain the right to vote. This implies that voting is a right, because in order to retain something, it has to be already there. All felons are citizens. Just because they have committed a felony doesn't mean that they immediately lose citizenship. Disallowing the felon's right to vote would not be possible because denying the citizenship of a person just because he committed something as simple as burglary is completely insensible. This relates to my VC because it talks about voting. Equality means that everyone has equal rights, and since voting is a right, everyone should have equal rights to vote. 2)My second contention is that disallowing a felon to vote is showing prejudice towards the person. The 15th amendment of the US Constitution states, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" Since statistics show that some types of people are more affected than others by felon disenfranchisement, which is prohibiting felons to vote, my contention relates to the resolution. a)Felon disenfranchisement is prejudiced on social classes. In a book review by Jason DeParle, which was published on the New York Times, he stated that, \"everyone is affected, but not equally\u2026Whites with only a high school education get locked up twenty times as often as those with college degrees.\" Since the wealth of a family will often determine whether their children go to college, and which college they will go to, felon disenfranchisement clearly discriminates against poorer families. b)Also, denying felons the right to vote makes them second class citizens. Since all US citizens should be equal, as shown in the Declaration of Independence \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\" No one can claim superiority over their own siblings. In the same way, no one can claim superiority in rights over any other person, because scientists have proven that all humans came from the same peoples. Since all humans are equal, there should not be second-class citizens, so felons should not be denied the right to vote. c)This supports equality, because prejudice is an example of inequality. By allowing felons to vote, we can maintain equality of the people, and thereby achieve democracy. 3)My third contention is that felony is an opinion. it is not always the same. Since the resolution does not state that the democracy has determined the person to be a felon, it is possible that a person who creates a democratic society can be a felon from a dictatorship that had happened before the democracy. a)This can be shown in the country of Maldives, in Southeast Asia, which is currently a democratic society. This democracy is currently headed by a man who was placed in house arrest for speaking out against a brutal government. This shows that although he was considered a felon to the previous government, he is now still part of a democratic society. b)Since the act of felony is an opinion, it will differ by people, and therefore, we have no right to disallow a felon to vote, when his act of felony might be anything from drug abuse to burglary to serial murder. Therefore, felon disenfranchisement is wrong because it restricts the rights of citizens. 4)My fourth contention is that voting can be for anything. It could be a vote for a preferred lunch, or a vote for the name of an adopted pet's name. Thus, felons should have the right to express their own feelings about a certain thing through voting. Conclusion: Disallowing felons to vote will lead to a downfall of a democracy. In the book, Democracy in America, by Alexis de Tocqueville, it states \"Once a people begin to interfere with the voting qualification, one can be sure that sooner or later it will abolish it altogether. That is one of the most invariable rules of social behavior.\" This means that disallowing some types of people to vote can be continued to completely abolishing the concept of voting. Since a democracy needs voting to occur, disallowing felons to vote will eventually destroy the democracy. I would also like to remind you that all citizens have the right to vote, as determined in the Constitution, which is the basis of American government. Therefore, I urge to affirm the resolution: In a democratic society, felons should be allowed to vote. Thank You!",

            "premise": "Thank you, Caseyuer, for posting this debate. I feel this is a topic that I can argue persuasively and, at the very least, a pleasure to compete with another new member. I would flip your statements on you. Felony disenfranchisement is a necessary evil to provide us with a just society. Roger Clegg, of the General Counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity wrote, \"We don't let children vote, for instance, or noncitizens, or the mentally incompetent. Why? Because we don't trust them and their judgement. [...] so the question is, do criminals belong in that category? And I think the answer is clearly yes. People who commit serious crimes have shown that they are not trustworthy.\" While there might exist special circumstances that might be deemed unjust; there are just as many examples of felons who express a pathological hatred for justice. http://www.youtube.com... The episode I provide, produced by gonzo documentarian Louis Theroux, gives insight into the thought processes of prisoners who are currently moving through the justice system. Technically, the people contained have the right to vote. Already, a majority of them have a sense of sudo-honor, a vigor for throwing \"piss-bombs\" and public masturbation (usually pointed at female guards). Members of the public can reasonably come to the conclusion that these people would not vote in favor of the public good. Instead, they would vote, lobby and manipulate our judicial and election system to their own corrupt means. And these inmates depicted are FIRST time offenders. You point out that former felons could possibly be in these circumstances because society has not given them the opportunity to give their opinions. While this sounds like a good point, you could also say the reverse. In that if you give them the capacity to vote their opinions to the legislative branch, you would have a chunk of society who would be in a state of permanent dissent. That, being said, I hold a similar premise to the voters of Massachusetts in 2000. In one of the most liberal states in the country, they collectively voted to bar inmates from voting. This showed, even in liberal circles, that public opinion is against serious lawbreakers from electing representatives. My final point regards the constitutionality of barring voting rights. I acknowledge that the eighth amendment bars excessive sanctions and demands that punishment be to the scale of the crime. However, this amendment is ultimately refuted by the following particulars of the constitution: *Article 1, Sec. 4; *Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and *Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment. Overall, this legislation provide states the right to strip criminals of their voting rights. So, because of the examples I've provided, Felony disenfranchisement falls under the category of just punishment. Vote Con Thank you.",

Value: Democratic society Value Criterion: Maximizing political participation Definitions: Democracy:government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system Felon:a person who has committed a felony Ought:used to express duty or moral obligation Contention 1: A democratic society can not be legitimate if the people in it are not voting. This is because the definition of democracy dictates that we let every competent adult vote. If we bar felons from voting then we are not truly a democracy. Contention 2: Furthermore if we continue to disenfranchise felons then not only are we undemocratic but we are also racist. This is because in America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. Therefore as one can clearly see felon disenfranchisement excludes a whole class of people from the voting process. As stated in my previous statistic the two major minorities that make up the majorities of felons in America are blacks and Hispanics. Due to this the voices of these two groups of people is not generally heard. So if one were to vote neg. this could in effect lead to the genocide of minorities as their voice would be stifled in the government. This proves that supporting felon disenfranchisement supports racism. Contention 3: Not only does felon disenfranchisement supports racism but it can change the result of important elections. Blacks and Hispanics generally vote Democratic. As these minorities make up the majorities of felons felon disenfranchisement favors the white dominated Republican party and skews the results of elections. An example of this would be my state of Florida in the 2004 election. If felons had been allowed to vote there is no way that George Bush would have won the presidency. Though Gore had the popular vote Bush had more electoral votes which enabled him to win. However if felons had been allowed to vote Gore would have had not only the popular vote but the electoral votes necessary to win. Contention 4: Additionally felon disenfranchisement is not truly a punishment. Disallowing felons from voting does nothing correct their behavior or to prevent them from committing a crime again. If anything it further separates them from society. This is injustice for if a man committed a felony in his late teens and is kept from voting from every election each time a new political figure come to power he will have to remember the mistake he made as a teen. He may be a reformed and upstanding member of society yet he will still be unable to vote. For these reason I support the affirmative of this resolution.",

            "premise": "In ordor to better form a flowing argument, I will boldface quotations from previous arguments and leave a line \"---\" to clarify a natural pause. If readers can recommend a better way to quote previous arguments then please leave a comment explaining the technicalities or a guide that details this.---\"Thank you for the link to the documentary, I watched it (parts one and two) and found it very insightful and although it did reinforce a few of the points you made I do find it disturbing that you are willing to form opinions off the basis of one documentary showing one situation.\"This video is the most recent, valid source I could find of people that showed a mentality that fundamentally opposed organized law. Whats more--A lot of these men were unconvinced, thus they still, technically, retained the right to vote. Citing this video was a way for me to express the prison culture of violence that is embedded into the minds of many ex-felons.Overall, There are many reasons for me formulating this opinion. This video does not encapsulate my entire morality foundations. Also, personal rational is not on debate. The legitamacy of stripping felons of their rights is the topic of this debate.---\"The people in that documentary are pre-trial, meaning that despite the fact that many have been there for years they have not yet served their debt to society. The purpose of being sentenced and serving time in prison is to over come these issues that they have dealing with normal members of society. Is it true that many of these felons will be released with the same immaturity shown here? Absolutely, but more than anything this points to a flaw in our justice system and our ability to rehabilitate our citizens. This is not grounds for denying them the right to vote.\"I cited grounds for denying them voting rights in my previous argument:*Article 1, Sec. 4;*Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and*Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment.These are cited example in our legal code which enable states to strip citizens of their voting rights. I would flip your argument on it's face.It is more immoral to strip states of their rights, which are documented on the books at the federal levelthen it is to strip citizens of their voting rights. I'm sure there are judges out there that calculate the stripping of these rights into their final judgment. (Example: A judge sentencing a felon to 35 years in prison, and later being stripped of their voting rights rather then a more sever length of sentence with retained voting rights.)If Felons object to a lose in voting rights in that state, then they should move to another state that allows them to vote. Nobody is demanding that they stay; As long as it doesn't break their probation.There is a historic president for this. After the Civil War, many confederates left the southern states for the Great American Southwest. There, these traitors could remake themselves, elect representatives and build a society they wanted.---\"You also said that we do not let children vote. This is true and we do this for very good reasons. But we do let them vote when they no longer are classified as children. This is similar to having been released from prison. Upon serving your sentence it is assumed that you have taken the time in prison to think about your mistakes and learn from them, which is very similar to a child turning eighteen. After serving in prison you are supposed to be released and join society. Part of this means taking on the responsibility's that children face when turning into adults, including the responsibility of voting.\"You claim to care about children growing up and conducting themselves in a democracy. Wouldn't this contradict your account on the rights of citizens to retain full rights after they \u2018serve' their time in jail?Rational: How do you feel about pedophiles rights? Is a judge saying, \"We need you to stay away from children\" outside his sentencing procedure? You can see the necessity in keeping pedophiles away from Middle Schools and Elementary Schools, right? But, in your legal system, a judge would not be allowed to do that. That sort of bias against pedophiles would be unconstitutional by your standards.And, as a reminder, it is constitutional to strip felons of their voting rights according to the article and two amendments I cited in my earlier argument:*Article 1, Sec. 4;*Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and*Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment.---\"Another point you made was that released inmates would 'manipulate our judicial and election system to their own corrupt means'. By saying this you are bringing up a point you had made earlier about felons having a 'pathological hatred for justice' which is simply not true. The majority of inmates do not 'hate' justice. When released many felons become one hundred percent normal citizens, with political opinions formed similar to the way that you and I form ours. And another point to be made about them 'manipulating' the justice system is that it would be virtually impossible. Released felons account for somewhere around two percent of the United States, so even if all of them had this hatred for justice that you mentioned (which they don't) it would simply not make a dent in our elections.\"The fact that felons, as you admitted, account for two percent of the United States population just means that the stripping of voting rights is good deterrent for people to not commit crime. You said that the majority of inmates do not \"\u2018hate'\" justice, but you have nothing to cite otherwise.---\"My final point for this round is I think my most important. One of the ideals that this country was founded on was 'No taxation without representation'. Upon being released from prison, felons are supposed to incorporate themselves into society, find a job, and pay taxes. One of the reasons that slogan exists is so the citizens could have a say as to where their tax dollars were being directed. Taxing felons and denying them this right is unconstitutional and immoral.\"Why should the American tax payer pay for the incarceration of these felons, but then be on an even keel with them when they are released.

If readers can recommend a better way to quote previous arguments then please leave a comment explaining the technicalities or a guide that details this.---\"Thank you for the link to the documentary, I watched it (parts one and two) and found it very insightful and although it did reinforce a few of the points you made I do find it disturbing that you are willing to form opinions off the basis of one documentary showing one situation.\"This video is the most recent, valid source I could find of people that showed a mentality that fundamentally opposed organized law. Whats more--A lot of these men were unconvinced, thus they still, technically, retained the right to vote. Citing this video was a way for me to express the prison culture of violence that is embedded into the minds of many ex-felons.Overall, There are many reasons for me formulating this opinion. This video does not encapsulate my entire morality foundations. Also, personal rational is not on debate. The legitamacy of stripping felons of their rights is the topic of this debate.---\"The people in that documentary are pre-trial, meaning that despite the fact that many have been there for years they have not yet served their debt to society. The purpose of being sentenced and serving time in prison is to over come these issues that they have dealing with normal members of society. Is it true that many of these felons will be released with the same immaturity shown here? Absolutely, but more than anything this points to a flaw in our justice system and our ability to rehabilitate our citizens. This is not grounds for denying them the right to vote.\"I cited grounds for denying them voting rights in my previous argument:*Article 1, Sec. 4;*Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and*Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment.These are cited example in our legal code which enable states to strip citizens of their voting rights. I would flip your argument on it's face.It is more immoral to strip states of their rights, which are documented on the books at the federal levelthen it is to strip citizens of their voting rights. I'm sure there are judges out there that calculate the stripping of these rights into their final judgment. (Example: A judge sentencing a felon to 35 years in prison, and later being stripped of their voting rights rather then a more sever length of sentence with retained voting rights.)If Felons object to a lose in voting rights in that state, then they should move to another state that allows them to vote. Nobody is demanding that they stay; As long as it doesn't break their probation.There is a historic president for this. After the Civil War, many confederates left the southern states for the Great American Southwest. There, these traitors could remake themselves, elect representatives and build a society they wanted.---\"You also said that we do not let children vote. This is true and we do this for very good reasons. But we do let them vote when they no longer are classified as children. This is similar to having been released from prison. Upon serving your sentence it is assumed that you have taken the time in prison to think about your mistakes and learn from them, which is very similar to a child turning eighteen. After serving in prison you are supposed to be released and join society. Part of this means taking on the responsibility's that children face when turning into adults, including the responsibility of voting.\"You claim to care about children growing up and conducting themselves in a democracy. Wouldn't this contradict your account on the rights of citizens to retain full rights after they \u2018serve' their time in jail?Rational: How do you feel about pedophiles rights? Is a judge saying, \"We need you to stay away from children\" outside his sentencing procedure? You can see the necessity in keeping pedophiles away from Middle Schools and Elementary Schools, right? But, in your legal system, a judge would not be allowed to do that. That sort of bias against pedophiles would be unconstitutional by your standards.And, as a reminder, it is constitutional to strip felons of their voting rights according to the article and two amendments I cited in my earlier argument:*Article 1, Sec. 4;*Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, and*Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment.---\"Another point you made was that released inmates would 'manipulate our judicial and election system to their own corrupt means'. By saying this you are bringing up a point you had made earlier about felons having a 'pathological hatred for justice' which is simply not true. The majority of inmates do not 'hate' justice. When released many felons become one hundred percent normal citizens, with political opinions formed similar to the way that you and I form ours. And another point to be made about them 'manipulating' the justice system is that it would be virtually impossible. Released felons account for somewhere around two percent of the United States, so even if all of them had this hatred for justice that you mentioned (which they don't) it would simply not make a dent in our elections.\"The fact that felons, as you admitted, account for two percent of the United States population just means that the stripping of voting rights is good deterrent for people to not commit crime. You said that the majority of inmates do not \"\u2018hate'\" justice, but you have nothing to cite otherwise.---\"My final point for this round is I think my most important. One of the ideals that this country was founded on was 'No taxation without representation'. Upon being released from prison, felons are supposed to incorporate themselves into society, find a job, and pay taxes. One of the reasons that slogan exists is so the citizens could have a say as to where their tax dollars were being directed. Taxing felons and denying them this right is unconstitutional and immoral.\"Why should the American tax payer pay for the incarceration of these felons, but then be on an even keel with them when they are released. I say that you are the one trying to strip people of their rights. You are the one advocating the stripping of states rights, as guaranteed by the constitution, but then asking them to catch the bill of these felons. That is the true definition of taxation without representation.---\"There are many people in the United States who did some regrettable act when they were young, served time and upon being released found a job, and for dozens of years have been respectable members of society including paying their taxes.

            "premise": "uuhhh i'm just trying out my cases. this is my first online debate. I affirm. Resolved:In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. \"Nothing is unchangeable but the inherent and unalienable rights of man\"- Thomas Jefferson Value:relevant impacts In this crazy world we have crazy impacts. A murderer will be silenced forever like the poor guy who had to steal $150 to support his family. Would a same impact make sense?-no Value Criteria: Patriotic Duty The point of voting is to serve/fulfill patriotic duty. We already limit felons so much, that by taking away this duty we are literally just having them age in the corner and not try to make things square with society. Definitions: Democratic-pertaining to or characterized by the principle of political or social equality for all Society-a body of individuals living as members of a community Observation 1: The resolution just says democratic society, meaning that this resolution does not just pertain to one country. Contention 1: What's a felony? A)Felonies actually differentiate country from country and even state from state, so basically the argument that if a criminal commits a crime, that criminal deserves an equal punishment does not exist. Seeing the fact that countries and even states within countries have different ideas on what a felon is, there is no black and white way to label someone as a felon or someone who deserves to get their rights taken away. This also means that one person can be seen as the scum of the world in one country, and then the other can be seen as a person who made an honest mistake and just receives a misdemeanor. B) In Maryland, for instance, criminals cannot vote for the rest of their lives if they are twice convicted of a felony (or what the state calls \"infamous crimes\"). Yet, many of the 149 offenses so categorized--such as inserting slugs into a slot machine or using a false identification card are regarded in other states as misdemeanors. Another example would be that any resident of Florida who stops payment on a check of more than $150 with intent to defraud commits a felony; so does the teenager who is caught with an ounce of crack cocaine, but the recreational user who is nabbed for cocaine (in powder form) possession is guilty of a misdemeanor. Even in some states just stealing over $150 dollars is considered a felony, do they deserve a punishment? Yes. Do they deserve to be silenced forever by not being allowed to express their free opinion through voting? No. There aren't many felons that would be considered felons if they were caught in a different state, when it even comes to more serious issues like murder and rape, much, much less than 10% are even categorized under this. C) Not letting felons vote have three impacts The first one is that since the word felon can not be used universally for some crimes and can be used the same for other crimes in every state, then there can not be a universal impact for every felony. Does a person that stole $150 dollars deserve to be silenced for life like a mass-serial murderer? By voting Negation on the resolution and not letting felons vote we would be making completely unfair decisions that silence people who aren't even considered felons in other parts of the world or even country. Therefore there is no \"concrete\" social contract, there are always loop holes in it, some will get a slap on the hand through misdemeanors and little fines, and others will be silenced forever. The second one would be the dehumanization of human voices. Voting represents thoughts, and your own voice. If you can't vote, you can't speak, is there a point to think if you can't speak? Felons already have their lives limited after they get out of prison, they can't have any government employed jobs, and even privately owned jobs are hard to find. They already are living a life with actions cut short, but stopping the voting process would completely stop thinking. By not letting felons vote, we will support dehumanization of an ordinary person. The world can't even define him as a felon in every country, none the less in every state. The third is the whole point of prison itself. Prison is meant to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners through a process of punishment until they are able to walk back into society. By cutting out something as important as voting, we are putting them in their own world rather than society's world, not being able to vote is the fuse to repeating crimes. They can't get a city job, private establishments frown upon hiring such people, and now they can't even vote to change things, they can't use their own voices to let people hear their struggle because we smother them. Their dawn to midnight life in the fast food business leaves them hundreds of dollars short to pay rent, and no one wants to hear their problems. They rob and steal to make ends meet. If society spits on you, won't you spit back? Contention 2: What started it? What feeds the fire today? A)Many disenfranchisement laws were enacted as far back as the Civil War period. Many historians have clarified on the fact that the reason this all started was because of White supremacy. The whole idea of disenfranchising was made on racist roots. Now disenfranchising is used as a way of shaping the voting pool. By not letting certain people vote, an outcome of a state's election will be different. B) Now the funny thing is, if disenfranchising was such an obvious moral choice to make why did it almost take a century for it to be triggered? Many of them were triggered right around the time African Americans were allowed to vote. The purpose? To stop African Americans from voting. Back then and even now, many felons are of this race. Laws disempowering blacks were pivotal, historian Morgan Kousser explains, because they provided southern states with \"insurance if courts struck down the more blatantly unconstitutional clauses.\" Now it's not so much of racist terms that make politicians keep this law up, but the issue of curving the voting pool. For example Even in the present era, according to Florida State Sen. Daryl Jones, \"The state legislature attempts to classify more and more crimes as felonies so it can eliminate more people from the voter rolls.\" In 2000, Jones reports. the Republican legislature proposed a bill that would have increased from 365 to 366 days the jail sentence for anyone who cashes two welfare checks after gaining employment. What is the purpose of adding one more day? The offense then becomes a felony, and \"You take one more person off the voter rolls. It's a fact that over one-third of felons are African Americans. It's another fact that only 14% of African Americans in total vote republican. By having more crimes become felonies, more African Americans can't vote. C) This has a few impacts By keeping this disenfranchisement around we are having something started out of unjust means stick around, meaning that our own society doesn't care that we have a law that was purely based on racist means and that civil rights mean nothing. The second one is that we are silencing minorities. The worst thing is that we are silencing them off of unjust means, those means are that politicians just want to silence them because of voting rates. The third is that we don't care how we stop them, we just want to stop them, meaning that we don't care how ridiculous we make laws, as long as we stop certain people from voting. Meaning that none of the movement for disenfranchising is even out of just motives, but just motives of wanting to win elections.",

They were 26 years old when Tim McVeigh stopped them from ever voting again by bombing the Oklahoma City Federal building. Carrie and Cindy were in good company. There were 166 others in that one felony crime. The Bureau of Justice lists over 847,000 homicides since 1960. If all those people had lived out their normal lives, that would affect over 9 million presidential votes and over 18 million municipal votes. My value is justice. Justice, according to the Encarta Dictionary, is fairness or reasonableness, especially in the way people are treated or decisions are made. There is nothing fair that felons like these are allowed to vote while many victims cannot. My criterion is upholding the equal treatment of citizens. Equality in a democratic society is never reached when you subtract victim voices while adding felon voices. The ONLY way to achieve equal treatment of citizens is to negate the resolution that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain their right to vote. A felon, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is someone who has been convicted of a serious crime. They may be currently incarcerated or released. ---------- Contention 1 Felons have chosen not to vote. Committing a felony requires premeditation and intent. The consequences of felony convictions are widely known to include no firearms, no elected offices, no jury duty and no voting. My opponent agreed in cross examination that a vote could not be changed once cast - so, in order to treat a felon like other members of society - the felon's decision not to vote should be honored by society.",

            "premise": "Negative- I stand in negation, \"Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote.\" I offer the following definitions for clarification of the resolution: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Democracy- the political orientation of those who favor government by the people or by their elected representatives. (If argued in CX, state that felons do not favor the government because they cannot abide by the rules that the government has set forth.) \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Felon- Someone who commits a felony; A Felony is a level of crime that is higher in comparison than a forfeiture or a misdemeanor. A felony can include things like murder, treason, grand theft, robbery, kidnapping, and rape. (Forfeiture- minor crimes that at one point or another we are likely to commit (i.e. \u2013 speeding, staying in a parking stall after your meter has expired.) (Misdemeanor- a misdeed, or illegal deed (i.e.- vandalism, disorderly conduct) \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Ought- Used to indicate advisability or prudence. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Retain- To keep or hold in a particular place, condition, or position. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The right to vote- a formal expression of preference for a candidate for office or for a proposed resolution of an issue. Or, \"The Franchise\". Subsequently, the taking away of that right would be known as \"Disenfranchisement\". \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The obvious value for the negative in this round must be democracy, as stated by the resolution. The optimal criterion for democracy must be Locke's social contract, which articulates that governments are instituted to protect the most fundamental rights. Examples of these rights are: life, liberty, and property. People in society then follow basic rules in exchange for the protection of these rights. When people violate these rules, people are punished in some fashion. One section of their punishment MUST be disenfranchisement because since they cannot abide by the laws that society has set forth, they cannot vote on said laws. Another reason that disenfranchisement is important in the punishment of felons is that a felon has committed a crime against another citizen's fundamental rights and should not be a part of society because they are a risk to those fundamental rights. My final reason that disenfranchisement is important is that if they are not disenfranchised, these individuals have a vested interest in voting for candidates and policies that are going to be light on crime. This may introduce some derogatory incentives into our political system that we do not want. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Contention 1: Felon disenfranchisement is consistent with the Lockean social contract First, felon disenfranchisement laws are justified on the basis of the Lockean notion of a Social contract: as Judge Henry Friendly once put it, someone \"who breaks the laws\" may \"fairly have been thought to have abandoned the right to participate\" in making them. Furthermore, \"it can scarcely be deemed unreasonable for a state to decide that that perpetrators of serious crimes shall not take part in electing the legislators who make the laws, the executives who enforce these, the prosecutors who must try them for further violations, or the judges who are to consider their cases.\" That same reasoning motivated Massachusetts then-governor Paul Celluci in 2000 to support a ballot initiative stripping incarcerated felons of the right to vote after prisoners began to organize a political action committee. A Massachusetts state legislative leader commented about the State's now-abolished practice of allowing incarcerated felons to vote: \"It makes no sense. We incarcerate people and we take away their right to run their own lives and leave them with the ability to influence how we run our lives?\" Therefore, since not following the social contract ultimately brings down democracy in society, you must look to my standard of the Lockean social contract because it upholds democracy. Contention 2: In order to achieve democracy, it becomes incumbent on society to uphold the social contract. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd SubPoint A: We cannot allow felons to be destructive of society in any way. A justification offered is the purity of the ballot box.George Brooks from his article on Felon disenfranchisement: law, history, policy, and politics; from the Fordham Urban Law Journal states that: \"A State has an interest in preserving the integrity of her electoral process by removing from the process those persons with proven antisocial behavior whose behavior can be said to be destructive of society's aims.\" Critics respond by arguing that being convicted of a felony does not necessarily diminish one's \"moral competence\" and that in any event, the result is to fence out groups of minority voters. The Green court found that denying felons the right to vote was reasonable, in light of the Lockean conception of the social contract as well as on more practical grounds . This is especially so when account is taken of the heavy incidence of recidivism and the prevalence of organized crime. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd SubPoint B: Locke's social contract theory has withstood the test of time; it served as a rationale for the enactment of felon disenfranchisement laws in the past, and remains a compelling argument today. When someone commits a crime, he commits it not just against the victim, but against our entire society. Protests that time served is enough, and that society should prioritize the rehabilitation and reintegration of felons should fall on deaf ears. Opponents of disenfranchisement claim that the inability to vote stymies felons' \"remittance into a law-abiding society.\" Yet they neglect to explain why the tonic of voting did not curtail felons from committing crimes initially. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Thus you should negate because Locke's social contract is optimal in upholding democracy and in preventing the downfall of democracy.",

            "premise": "Cheers! I will argue that by default, felons should not have voting rights, except in some cases where they have proven themselves reformed. ------------------------DEFINITIONS-------------------------------- felony= (1) a felony as a crime which involves a potential punishment of one year or longer in prison.[1] (2) in general, a \"serious crime\" [2] felons= people who commit or have committed felony democratic society= a society based on majority rule; a society where supreme political power lies with the people [3] right = an abstract idea of that which is due to a person or governmental body by law or tradition or nature [4] vote= express one's preference for a candidate or for a measure or resolution; [5] -----------------------MAIN ARGUMENT---------------------------- First, I will mention that voting is NOT an inalienable right. In a solitary state, a human does not possess any quality that entails the right to vote. Rights to life, liberty etc. might be inalienable and follow from human nature, but the right to vote is alienable and is contingent upon society. Remember Locke's Social Contract theory? Society grants the right to vote on the promise of good behavior, and can suspend it when people break that promise. Having established that society can curtail the right to vote, I will show society ought to curtail the felons' right to vote. There are 2 main arguments why felons don't deserve their right to vote: (a) Punishment: A serious crime deserves a serious punishment. Being stripped of voting rights is a fitting punishment because it emphasizes that voting, which is the basis of a democratic society, is a right that is contingent on keeping the Social Contract. Only law-abiding citizens who uphold the Contract have the right to vote; felons, who have expressed contempt of their fellow citizens by breaking the law are deprived of their right to vote. In combination with being incarcerated, it impresses upon the felons the magnitude of their crimes. (b) The integrity of voting: Ask yourself: would you want your policemen, your judges or your politicians to be elected by those who have committed atrocities such as rape? In many cases, these felons' ideal of society differs from the commoner's ideal, and we must accept this. Given their inappropriate ideals and motivations, felons should lack the right to vote. I also realize that some felonies are accidental and/or less severe than others. There are some felons that reform. For such felons, I propose that we set up a Pardons Commission to determine whether the felons are worthy of receiving the right to vote. All felons will have the right to apply to the Commission for a hearing. This Commission might meet every quarter year, and precedent for such a Commission already exists in some USA states. This will allow the one-time criminals to retrieve their right to vote. -------------REBUTTALS IN ADVANCE--------------- 1) Some argue that the felon will undergo double punishment: after serving his jail time and fulfilling his debt to society, the felon will be made to undergo a 2nd punishment because of not being able to vote. However, this argument commits the fallacy of begging the question [6]. It assumes that the jailtime adequately punishes the felon, and that the lack of voting rights is a 2nd punishment. However, the jailtime and the lack of voting rights can be viewed as 2 parts of a single punishment. Just like drunk driving can lead to both jailing you and depriving you of your driver's license. 2) Some argue that the policy of depriviation of felon voting rights originated in the Civil War - blah blah blah. Basically, they argue that because this policy originated to promote racism or whatever, it must be bad. But this is committing the genetic fallacy. [7] 3) Some argue that the policy is racist because there are many colored felons who get stripped of rights. But, this is really a red herring. If it is a fact that more men of color are felons or something; so be it! These charges of resulting racism are irrelevant as to whether felons should have voting rights.

And upholding my value of democracy will be my criterion of equality. For clarity I would like to define the following terms from my case: Vote: a formal expression of choice. Felon: one who has committed a felony. Equality: evenly balanced. Democracy: a government by the people as so governed. because my opponent didn't offer any definitions my definitions will be the ones that stand for this debate. Before I go on I would like to explain the thesis of my case: it's that if you take out votes in an election it would be undemocratic, and contradicting of a democracy. This was once stated by Paul Ricoeur \"the law is one aspect of a much more concrete and encompassing relation, then the relation between commanding and obeying.\" Where Ricoeur says law I would like to place the law of democracy. So basically even though felons have committed felonies, we must uphold a democracy with equality, by letting the whole democratic society vote. Ricoeurs quote links to my first contention: the practice of disenfranchising would erode the foundational principle of our democratic society. Clearly there exists no standing relationship between disenfranchising and a criminal act. Like I stated in my definition of democracy it's a \"a government by the people as so governed.\" Meaning for the democracy to effetely work every person must have a voice in the vote. In the resolution it clearly states \"democratic society\". The \"democratic society\" is looked upon as a whole; one can't take out individuals from the vote and still think they have the whole \"democratic society.\" My impact for this contention is only with the whole \"democratic society\" could we get the fair decision in an election. my oppenet argues that \"age limitation demonstrates that voting rights may be restricted when there is reason to doubt the potential voter's good judgment.\" this is true but the fact of the matter is we are speaking on felons, he goes on to say \"convicted felons are likely to be contrary to the interests of citizens as a whole who want to be protected from criminals.\" I agree that it is contrary to citizens interests, but only in the \"whole\" that in presented in my case \"democratic society\". It is contrary like he said on interests because we are not respecting the \"democratic society\" that the resolution is talking about. my opened trays to bring in the U.S. Constitution by saying it \"does not grant individual citizens the right to vote for president.\" the thing is the resolution states democratic society. it does not state one certain democratic society such as the U.S. so this argument can be dropped. William Shakespeare once said: \"if you prick felons, do they not bleed? If you tickle them, do they not laugh? If you poison them, do they not die?\" When felons leave prison there released back into the society, and thus still affected by it. All people of the \"democratic society\" are all still citizens. There still affected by whatever congress or the government passes, so denying them the right to vote wouldn't't be equal. If it said all men were created equal then why are felons disenfranchised? Once again felons are affected by the society because 1: they pay taxes and 2: they can buy government owned property like everyone else. he also argues that non-citizens are also excluded from voting, this is true but it is a non topical argument because it doesn't pertain to the resolution stating \"felons.\" he says \"The convicted felon ought to have the obligation of establishing that his interests have become aligned with those of ordinary citizens and contrary to those with a criminal lifestyle.\" but what is the difference between felons and citizens, aren't the both citizens? now my opponent brings up the fact that felons commit felonies again. but does committing a crime and taking the right to vote away connect? by this I mean: why should we take away the right to vote if the committing of a crime doesn't affect voting? my oppenet brings up the U.S a lot in his case but as already pointed out the resolution doest acclaim say the \"U.S democratic society\" by saying only two U.S states let felons vote (Vermont and Maine). my oppent states that \"Convicted felons are an identifiable target for politicians\", this argument cant be upheld or proven true, because there is no evidence to prove this claim. he also says \"Criminal rights advocates claims that in the 2000 election in Florida, that felons would likely have swayed the presidential election to John Kerry and away from George Bush. They claim that preventing that was undemocratic.\" there was no reason to put that in his case because it only hurts the PRO. by proving that taking out votes is undemocratic. as we can clearly see if we vote for the PRO. we will be punishing criminals twice by taking away the right to vote and by making them serve a sentence. he states that letting felons vote will hurt our economy and justice system. this is not true because there are such felonies that are minor such as J-walking and repeated speeding. in contrary it doesn't hurt the justice system, it stegthens it for the chance to let the system work and take a shot at prosecuting it., I do agree with this sentence in his case \"A completely separate reason for imprisoning criminals is to keep them from doing further harm.\" but even though they have committed felonies and there in prison they should have the right to vote in the \"democratic society\".",

            "premise": "I affirm the resolution, Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. In order to clarify the resolution, I offer the following definitions. (Webster's New World Dictionary) Democracy (root of democratic) is defined as a \"government by the people either directly or through elected representative.\" This includes \"acceptance and practice of the principle of equality of right, opportunity and treatment.\" A Felon is defined as a person guilty of a major crime that is punishable by more than one year in prison. It is important to note that the majority of felons who are denied the right to vote are no longer in prison. My value for the round is democracy. By confining the round to a democratic society, the resolution implies that democracy should be valued. The value criterion is maximizing rights. A democracy is grounded in the fact that all citizens have equal rights under the law. When rights are violated, this degrades the democracy. The most important right in maintaining a democracy is the right to vote and participate in government. That is the fundamental principle of a democracy. As written by Steven Earl Bennett in the American Journal of Political Science, \"the most fundamental criterion of a fully functioning democratic system is citizen participation.\" Therefore to ensure that we have a stable democracy we must maximize people's rights, especially the right to vote. Contention One: By banning felons from voting, we set the stage for others to be disenfranchised as well. Felons are a unique part of society. Most felons are part of poor minority groups. They have unique experiences and a unique point of view. If we allow this minority group to be disenfranchised, what is to stop us from doing it to others? As Alexis Tocqueuille wrote in his book Democracy in America, \"Once a people begins to interfere with the voting qualification, one can be sure that sooner or later it will abolish it all together.\" By denying felons the vote, we make it possible for other minority groups to be disenfranchised as well. This is bad because it can multiply to violate the rights of many more people. That goes against democratic values which are to maximize rights for everyone. Contention Two: To ensure that rights are not violated, it is important to restore ex-felons the right to vote and to reintegrate them into society. Sub point A: Ex-felons are trying to rejoin society. By denying them rights, we alienate them, making them more likely to commit another felony. As outlined in the Democracy Restoration Act of 2008, \"allowing people to vote after release from prison encourages participation in civic life and helps rebuild ties to the community that motivate law-abiding behavior.\" Without the restoration of this right, ex-felons are more likely to commit another felony, violating the rights of other. Whether it is right to life property, or some other right, this hurts a democracy. This kind of violation of rights is bad and contributes to destabilizing a democracy. Sub point B: By denying ex-felons the right to vote, we continue to violate their rights. Ex-felons have already served what courts deemed to be a just sentence and have already paid their debt. There is no reason to continue punishing them. As U.S. Senator Russ Feingold said, \"For a nation that depends on the participation of its citizens, it is fundamentally un-American to deny the vote to people who are living and working as law abiding citizens. Furthermore, the more doors we close on people trying to rejoin society, the more likely it is we will drive them back to the behaviors we want them to leave behind.\" Ex-felons are hard working, newly law abiding citizens. By denying felons the vote, we not only violate their rights as a citizen but undermine our democracy. In order to have a good democracy, we must maximize the rights of everyone, including felons and stripping ex-felons of the right to vote does not achieve this. Contention Three: By banning felons from voting, we cripple our democracy. For a democracy to work all views must be taken into account. Felons belong to the group of lower class minorities that are least represented. If these groups do not cast many votes, they have little influence and it becomes likely their rights will be violated. In the American Journal of Political Science David Resnick writes, \"Nonvoting is said to skew policy in the direction of participants because politicians and officials are under no compulsion to pay much heed to classes and groups of citizens that do not vote.\" Banning felons from voting quiets the voice of minorities with high percentages of felons. According to Resnick, this will make it unlikely that politicians will pay them much attention and more likely that politicians will violate their rights. This goes against what we strive for in a democracy, maximization of rights, and weakens the democracy as a whole. For all these reasons, I affirm.",

            "premise": "I too thank you for this debate. It has been a good one with a direction of a good finish. Good luck! Value Clash: My opponent made a claim that the values are the same thus it is a tie here. But this is not true at all. They ARE the same, but only CON achieves it. This is because throughout the process of a person being a citizen, and a person being a citizen with a felony, people are equally treated. All citizens can be felons; however, we only take the right of voting away from those who actually commit a felony. Therefore, the CON side achieves the value of Equality/Fairness. Criterion of Just Deserts: Here, you assume that the court's sentence means that they are off scott free. This is not true. There can be (an is) more than one punishment for being a convicted criminal/felon. Just like a convicted sex offender must register as such, a felon can't vote. Just like a restraining order can be issued against someone who commits a crime against someone, a felon can't cast a vote FOR society when he/she has already gone against it. The criterion serves its purpose as such: If you commit a felony against our society, you lose the right to have your voice (vote) heard on how the society is run. And thus, we are FAIR (equal) in our system. Since the resolution talks about a theoretical situation, I must admit that we are not being fair/equal to the people as of now (states Maine and Vermont vs. Mississippi). However, in each of these states, one another ARE treated equally to each other. Furthermore, I advocate that ALL felons should not get the vote back. Therefore, I urge that the government recognizes everyone as equal by having additional punishments of not being able to vote after committing a penalty. The value still stands on the CON side. Here, you make two interesting points worth addressing. 1) You assume that all of these elections are only federal elections. But the right to vote goes beyond just the national level it also has state and local elections. In one city, the mayor race was won by one vote. In another election, a school board race was tied and decided by a coin flip. What if instead of a coin flip, it was a felon who decided. Has the felon really earned that right? 2) Also, you assume that 2% of the vote and 2% of the population are the same. For example, you say that the closest presidential race was 2% so that means it's 2% of the vote. 2% of the vote very well could be substantially under the 5.3 million people that have committed a felony. --> Besides this, the biggest question you have to be asking yourself is \"Have these felons earned the right to vote? The answer is no. Contention 1: To be honest, a crime against society = a person not deserving to be a part of that society. But since that isn't a political option, removing their right to help run society (through their vote) is the best way to say \"If you commit a crime against society, you can't decide how society is going to be run.\" Therefore, they do get what they deserve. Perhaps they do deserve to be exported after committing a felony, but that is non-resolutional. So for now, let's just take away their right to vote. Contention 2: I think you misinterpret the point of my argument. You see, felons wouldn't ALWAYS be the swing vote, however, sometime they will be (whether local, state, or federal election). And when they are, you must ask yourself, do they really have to right to have a say in the same government and society that they go against, the answer is NO. Contention 3: You do not have to qualify in order to vote, but you can't be unqualified. The law states that the \u2018right of voting can not be denied because of' (several things). This means that it can be denied for other reasons such as felonies. And as long as this law has been around, no abuse has been created. You can't vote if you're not 18 (excluding some rarities in state laws) and you can't vote if you're a felon (also excluding some rare state laws). These are ways to be able to lose your vote, but you don't have to qualify by passing tests or having money, it is guaranteed unless you're not registered, not 18, or not a felon. I see no abuse in the system and my opponent has not pointed out any abuse so this argument must be flowed to the CON side. HIS CASE: Contention 1: Again, felons wouldn't control all of the elections, but they will be the swing vote in several of them. Once again, they do not deserve this right. Contention 2: Woah woah woah, where is your evidence that says that felons that can vote have a 50% less chance of committing a crime. This claim is abusive and unrealistic. Other than that, my opponent claims that felons have the right to have their voice heard. Even though he doesn't say why they deserve to have their voice heard (I have proved the opposite (crime against society = no voice in society)). Contention 3: This argument is completely abusive. Amendments talk about why rights CAN'T be taken away, not who we guarantee them to. Felons are not one of the reasons to be able to take it away, so legally, CON wins. Even though they're minorities by definition, everyone is capable of being one and no one is born one. Becoming a felony is a CHOICE, and they are assumed to know the consequences of making that choice particularly in the states that outlaw a felony from voting. Analysis: Democracy STILL exists whether pro or con wins. This criterion is thus useless. However, when you vote CON, you gain the criterion of just deserts (by them getting what they deserve) AND both of the values (taking away the right of felonies voting is fair and equal among the states). NO amendment says that felonies MUST be given voting capabilities, so this argument is useless. There is no substantial reason to give felonies a right to vote but I give you plenty of reasons as to why to take away the right to vote (crime against society = no voice for society). Therefore, I urge a CON vote. I eagerly await your speech and good luck!",

            "premise": "And Here is my rebuttal and conclusion. I will refute my opponents points and then defend my own. CV: My opponent calls the core value of justice non-topical and contends the goal of democracy is to maintain democracy not create justice. However, the reason for democracy once again is justice. Saying that Democracy=Democracy is a circular argument. Why is a Government a democracy? Because they seek to create justice, saying the goal of democracy is democracy is once again a Logical Fallacy in which the premise is only true if the conclusion is and vise-versa. VC: Now as I can read it, the first attack on my criterion states \"the very point of the social contract is to limit individual rights and ensure that certain rights are protected in order to maintain societal stability.\" This is exactly the point I am trying to make, in order to preserve the society we must limit some rights. My opponent also contends that \" If there is no social contract present the individuals within the society fall into a \"war of all against all\" in which all rights are taken.\" So as is agreed without a social contract society will fail. Felons have violated and voided the social contract between them and to allow them to vote would move against the social contract. Moving against and changing the terms of the contract for a select group would then destroy it and would cause this \"state of war\" so therefore we must not allow felons to vote. Second social contract does indeed support the concept of rights, this is infact of the reasons for its implementation, if we lose a social contract we lose all rights. Therefore we must preserve the Social Contract and allow these felons to be disenfranchised. So my Criterion must be seen as superior because in order to have individual rights we must have a Social contract. So in this debate we must evaluate of of the social contract. 1st: I am not quite sure of the defense of subpoint A as it appears to have been cut off. So I will merely restate my original attacks. \"A) You must keep in mind that these felons have knowingly violated the social contract and have in essence removed themselves from society. They have then shown a blatant disregard for the state and should not participate in deciding the laws for the law-abiding. This bring me back to my Contention 1 Subpoint A, If you allow the law makers to become the law breakers then you are creating an unequal stage and are devaluing the vote of the law-abiding citizens.\" B) The idea proposed by my attack was that a punishment cannot be evaluated off of its rehabilitative effects because no punishment is seen to have rehabilitative effects. So if we were to evaluate everything off of its rehabilitative effects we would stop any form of criminal justice which, undoubtedly would destroy society. So it must be assumed that rehabilitation is not relevant 2nd: The idea of a devaluing a vote was mis interpreted by my opponent which may have been my fault. What I am contending is that by allowing felons to vote we are putting allowing them to be the law-makers and the law-breakers. It would be establishing a double standard in which the Law-abiding populace is put below the felons because felons have violated the social contract and can STILL vote while non-felons did not take advantage of society and have the same right to vote. This if you look at it is not just and not equal. The fact that felons cannot get the same jobs is wholly there fault. By committing a felony they removed themselves from society. Also there are cases of people who have been able to do things such as join the police and the military without voting rights(here is an example-http://www.nytimes.com...) Besides if you look to my first contention I say felons are equal to not citizens and non-citizens have to pay taxes... Allowing non-citizens to vote would also inevitably destroy society. Moving on to defend my case CV: now first you remember I say that justice is created when a society preserves its social contract and in doing so preserves society. Also this term was defined as giving each his due and felons must be given thier due. Also I fully understand justice is the core of my case. Justice is what everything hopes to achieve, including the justice system and democracy. VC(and 1c subpoint A): Now in his attacks my opponent agrees that felons have violated the social contract. And As I say in my 1st contention A) the Social contract does allow for disenfranchisement and B) allowing them to vote would be unjust because it elevates them. Also the idea of just punishment as proposed by the Affirmative can be discarded. The Prison system itself does not rehabilitate felons thus the recidivism. So disenfranchisement cannot be judged based on its rehabilitative value but rather on whether is is warranted by the social contract which I have proven it is. 1c B) in this my opponent brings up the concept of equal treatment and how felons are to be denied it so we should not disenfranchise them. First felons choose to commit a felony and second, the right to vote can be put into the idea of equal treatment. Also the point about gun's. Now I will directly link this to felons who have committed voter fraud, just as one who has committed Murder should not own a gun or a pedophile can't serve as a teacher why should one convicted of voter fraud be able to vote? the answer is they shouldn't. SO because felons move against society and essentially say they don't think the rules apply to them why should they be granted the right to vote and make laws for others?? this seems pretty unequal and directly supports my original point. 2nd contention. The Affirmative contends that if the majority says something it is so. well first of all the felons do not represent a national majority, and second in a case where they do represent a majority why should they be able to decide the lives of the law abiding and essentially override their vote in this propose Majority rule system in which the felons dictate the Policy of the others? Conclusion and Voters I have proven the Social contract to be superior because in order to have individual rights, my opponents criterion we must have the social contract. I have also proven justice to be the most applicable because it is the goal of every society to create justice. Also my criterion best upholds democracy because without a Social contract there will be no democracy just anarchy. Voters: My Contention 1 ---This contention proves the social contract indeed allows for disenfranchisement and so proves the Negative case. The idea about Voter fraud/voting As my opponent stated felons should not own guns because they violated the right to have them, So felons convicted of voter fraud should not voe because they, above ALL other felons abused that privilege Now if you look at the resolution it says that \"In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote\" This implies ALL felons and those convicted of voter fraud are felons, they have violated the right to vote and therefore must have that right removed. Therefore Negation is in order. I ask that all my points be considered not just these singled out those are just some specific points I would like looked at. Because Social contract is the best criterion and it fulfills both core values and because felon disenfranchisement is warranted under the social contract I can see no other ballot besides one in favor of negation.",

            "premise": "Voting is a right, but not an unconstrained one. The right to vote is not granted to those under the age of eighteen. That age limitation demonstrates that voting rights may be restricted when there is reason to doubt the potential voter's good judgment. Resident aliens are excluded from voting on the grounds that their interests are not necessarily coincident with the interests of ordinary citizens. Convicted felons are another class of citizens whose judgment is reasonably called into question. The interests of convicted felons are likely to be contrary to the interests of citizens as a whole, who want to be protected from criminals. The U.S. Constitution does not grant individual citizens the right to vote for president. The electors for the President are determined by state legislators *by any means*; Clearly, the Constitution does not make voting in a preeminent right. The Constitution defines a republic, which generally subordinates the right to vote upon legislation to voting for legislators. There are clauses granting equal rights based based upon race and religion, and equal voting rights based upon gender, but there is nothing that prevents voting restrictions based upon other criteria. Non-citizens are also excluded from voting. That is because the interests of non-citizens are likely to diverge from those of citizens on some important issues. The argument that the interests of criminals diverges from that of ordinary citizens is stronger than that for non-citizens. Convicted criminals have demonstrated where their interests lie, but for non-citizens it is only a reasonable supposition. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall claimed that once a prison sentence is served, that felons have \"fully paid their debt to society\" [1] However, being a jurist qualifies one to interpret laws, not to make them. Whether or not felons have fully paid there debt is a matter to be determined by law, and ultimately of the values of society as reflected in the lawmaking processes. For example, convicted sex offenders must register with the government and are restricted from certain interactions with children. The \"three strikes and you are out\" laws identify career criminals and remove them from society. The justification for both sex-offender registration and \"three strikes\" is that convicted felons are more likely to commit additional crimes than persons without a criminal record. One can argue what the correct level of continuing debt to society ought to be, but the fact that convicted felons are more likely to commit crimes is unquestionable. The U.S. Bureau of Justice reports that \"over two-thirds of released prisoners were rearrested within three years\" [2]. Note that the two-thirds only reflects released felons who where caught within three years. It does not count those who committed crimes but were not arrested. Overall, only about 45 percent of violent crimes are solved, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics [3] Factoring in the criminals not caught, we may reasonably suppose that the true recidivism rate is in the neighborhood of 85 or 90 percent. Because recidivism rates are so high, the debt to society at the heart of this issue is not with respect to serving a sentence for a particular crime, it is in having adopted a criminal lifestyle. The convicted felon ought to have the obligation of establishing that his interests have become aligned with those of ordinary citizens and contrary to those with a criminal lifestyle. For example, that might be established after ten years without an arrest for a felony. It is not established by release from prison. Only eight states currently prohibit convicted felons from voting for life. Two states (Vermont and Maine) permit felons to vote while in prison. Thirty-three states remove the franchise while convicted felons are on parole. Thus even if one accepts Thurgood Marshall's argument that voting rights should be restored after felons have paid their debt, it is not mainly about criminals who have done so. The issue is mainly about criminals who are in prison or on parole and have not paid their debt. Criminal rights advocates claims that in the 2000 election in Florida, that felons would likely have swayed the presidential election to John Kerry and away from George Bush. They claim that preventing that was undemocratic. There is no doubt that in a close elections the votes of those with an established criminal lifestyle voting for someone they feel to be in their interests could determine the outcome of an election. That, however, is a powerful argument that justice demands that election not be determined by such people. Criminal rights advocates claim that fencing off a certain voter demographic is a fundamentally unjust principle. In reality, it depends upon the reason for fencing off the demographic. People under the age of 18 are fenced off on the reasonable grounds that in general they lack the knowledge and experience to cast an informed vote. Note that this is done despite some seventeen-year-olds being more informed than some citizens who are fifty or sixty. The fencing off is justified because the odds are so heavily against it. Similarly, not all convicted felons remains committed to the criminal lifestyle. But with about 85% recidivism, the odds are much against it. Therefore, it is reasonable and just to identify the demographic and exclude them. Convicted felons are an identifiable target for politicians, who can seek votes by making various promises to tilt the justice system in favor of criminals. Politicians are clever enough not to go to prisons to make the appeal directly, as that would alienate other voters. They would use surrogates who espouse \"improving\" the justice system by weakening it. Even if no targeted appeal were made, criminals would figure out for themselves which candidate was most likely to facilitate their criminal lifestyle. Crime victims are also an identifiable demographic. However, victims are less likely to vote based upon the single issue of weakening the justice system. For example, victims are citizens who worry about the health of the general economy because a good economy facilitates their making a living. A criminal lifestyle, however, is only facilitated by weakening the justice system. The issue has frequently posed as one in which removing the right to vote is either punishment or retribution. This a false dichotomy. A completely separate reason for imprisoning criminals is to keep them from doing further harm. That is why convicted felons should not be allowed to vote. We should not want people whose primary interest is in pursuing a criminal lifestyle determining the outcome of close elections. 1. http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu... Richardson v.

The negative panel believes in a democratic society, felons should not retain the right to vote. The negative panel accepts the burden of proving that a democratic society can function properly if felons are disbarred from voting. The negative panel has the moral high ground in this battle. To not stand for the negative you stand for ideology that is immorally inferior and of substandard value. Before I present the negative panel's case, I will define key words that will help set the parameters of the debate; Democracy: government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system. Society: a highly structured system of human organization for large-scale community living that normally furnishes protection, continuity, security, and a national identity for its members. Felons: A person has committed a felony. Right: Laws that are upheld by the society that has ratifies and respects the sovereignty of the laws Government: System design to provide resources and protection for it society. Felony: an offense, as murder or burglary, of graver character than those called misdemeanors, esp. those commonly punished in the U.S. by imprisonment for more than a year. The negative panel's core value is democracy. To stand for the negative panel you value democracy. The affirmative panel does not value democracy as highly as the negative panel. To value democracy in this case is taking the moral high ground. It is morally inferior to not value democracy in this case. The negative panel values democracy because it is essential to the society the resolution scenario implies. Democracy further allows the societies longevity. The negative panel's value criterion is strengthening the power of voting. The negatives value criterion up holds and achieves its core value of democracy. Democracies work with people voting for representatives and public officials in their government. Strengthen the people's vote you strengthen the government. By allowing the most qualified citizens to vote and the proper candidates to run for public office a society strengthens it power of voting. My first contention for my case is felons that lose the right to vote will not become a detriment to the society. By granting the privilege of voting to all people, it allows the people to choose how they wish there government to govern them. In a democratic society the populace must vote for the governors and officials. It goes without saying but it must be brought up that some people must vote for the government's officials. So in a democratic society the people automatically have the right to vote, but not all the people. Essentially a democratic society needs the general populace to vote for the governing officials. The negative panel would argue that in a democratic society of one million people, 10% of that population can only have the right to vote, and the society will still function correctly. The topic of the debate is whether felons ought to retain the right to vote in a democratic society. The topic is not in a democratic society all the citizens ought to have the right to vote, nor is the topic is it morally correct to allow all citizens the privilege of voting in a democratic society. The resolution questions the affirmative panel and negative panel if a democratic society can function if certain members of the society can not vote and present the selected members as felons. The negative panels would answer to the questions; that a democratic society will function with only a few people voting in elections and if the non-voting individuals were felons that it is morally correct to not allow them to vote. My second contention for my case is it is just to revoke the privilege of voting as a deterrent for felonies in a democratic society. To prevent citizens from committing felonies, societies have two major options. The first is creating welfare programs dedicated to research of why people commit felonies and the prevention of people committing felonies. The second is enforcing deterrents to prevent people from committing felonies, such as the death penalty and revoking the privilege to vote. The two methods above prevent the actions of felonies and essentially keep the peace in a section of the society. It is just to revoke the privilege of voting to further insure the safety of the citizens in a society. A democratic society can function if not all of its citizens can vote. Negative panel suggest that citizens that commit felonies are labeled felons by that society and must enjoy fewer privileges than non-felons. This is a strong deterrent to crime and strengthens punishment over crime. The negative panel suggests that the judge consider the idea of in a democratic society, felons should not retain the right to vote. The frame work of the negative panel's case was built upon a core value of democracy. The negative panel upholds their moral of democracy by implementing our value criterion of strengthen the power of voting. The negative panel's first contention is a convicted Felon has committed gross violations of an established legal system and therefore relinquished any rights and privileges granted by that established system. The negative panel's second contention is it is just to revoke the privilege of voting as a deterrent for felonies in a democratic society. I draw the end of the negative panel's case by urging the judge to vote neg for the win in the debate.",

            "premise": "I negate: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote For clarity I offer the following definitions: 1. Democratic society: government dictated by the populous 2. Felons: people who have committed a felony 3. Retain: to keep and secure for future use For analysis of the resolution I offer the following observations: 1. The resolution specifies felons. This includes people in jail and those who have finished their time of incarceration. This is true for 2 reasons: First, when a person commits a felony it remains on their permanent civil record. Thus, the government considers you a \"felon\" Second, the definition of a felon implies this observation. The definition states \"people who have committed a felony.\" The \"have\" indicated past events. 2. The affirmative burden is thus to prove that felons in society ought to retain the right to vote. The affirmative values a democratic society. Since the resolution explicitly states a democratic society, this should be the superior value. This value is achieved by the criterion of Maximizing Participation. The resolution assumes that felon disenfranchisement is taking place in a democratic framework. Democracy is unique as a system of government because it allows people to rule themselves, and it is generally viewed that democracies that give more power to the people are better than democracies that give less power to the people. While there are many definitions of democracy, most would discourage felon disenfranchisement.If democracy is a procedure for individuals to aggregate their preferences to make policies, then any disenfranchisement is anti-democratic because it excludes the preferences of one group of individuals. Even if some people would view those preferences as \"bad\" society, a procedural view of democracy would hold that there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected. If democracy is based on participation and consent, felon disenfranchisement is wrong because felons cannot give consent to the laws that govern them because they cannot express their preferences through voting. Contention I: Society uses disenfranchisement in order to prevent contestation of existing values Whether or not they are rooted in a similar insecurity, it is clear that the justification for disenfranchisement and Rawls's reliance on punishment as a stabilizing device both follow from the impulse to protect society's standards from contestation. In Rawls's case, one's ability to contest society's standards is closed off by the imposition of the label \"unreasonable\"; in the case of disenfranchisement, this labeling is complemented by the explicit loss of one's political status.The criminal, in each instance, is created as the \"other\" to ward off the potential contestation of society's norms.' For Rawls, the assumption of strict compliance and the emphasis on consensus lead citizens of his well-ordered society to view the criminal as a \"bad character\" deserving ofpunishment, even if such punishment is illiberal from the standpoint of justice itself. With disenfranchisement, the act of creation is even clearer: The revocation of the right to vote itself differentiates the criminal as abnormal-it is a permanent mark of a lower status. \"The process of making the criminal,\" Frank Tannenbaum writes, \"is a process of tagging, defining, identifying,segregating, describing, emphasizing, making conscious and self- conscious; it becomes a way of stimulating, suggesting, emphasizing, and evoking the very traits that are complained of. The emphasis on the individual nature of the criminal's act or character makes it appear as if the criminal brings this process and the resulting lower status on himself, but society imposes it, acting to prevent a threat to the maintenance of its established standards. [Rebuttal] \"The resolution clearly states \"felons\" versus \"ex-felons\". The United Nations defines an ex-felon as somebody who has completed their sentence, and a felon, as stated in the resolution, as somebody currently serving their sentence. Therefore, my opponent must prove how letting felons vote in prison is upholding a just democracy\" --> This is wrong for three reasons: First, my opponents definition of a felon contradicts this observation on the fact that his definition implies past action. Meaning that his definition implies the fact that convition is after the fact. I.e. he is back in society Second, he never provides a definition of retain, thus we must to look to my definition which implies future use. Third, my opponent is wrong on the UN definition. The UN never makes a distinction between the two. Value: Justice --> Not inherent to the resolution, thus my value is superior. Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness --> (Turn) Use my opponents criteria against him. Fairness implies a fair action. When a felon returns to society, it is only fair that he retains his right to vote, since he has paid his debt to society. 1. Retribution --> My opponents point of retribution is no longer retribution for 3 reasons: First, retribution implies a contract. Once a felon has served his time of incarceration he returns to society, thus reentering the contract. Second, retribution implies proportionality. I.e. the punishment must fit the crime. Take away the right to vote is not proportionate because it is not a sufficient mechanism in the action of balancing the scale of justice. Third, my opponents argument is contradictory to itself and dejusitifes incarceration. For example, someone kidnaps. In turn the government puts them in jail. According to my opponenet this is unjustified because it is making the government a kidnapper. 2. Legal Consistency --> This is wrong for two reasons First, this is contradictory to my opponents observation 1 (US specific observation). This point may be true in a non-federal government, like in France. However in the US this doesn't hold water because we have a federal system. I.e. the state and national government share power. This impacts my opponents contention 2 because in the US we do not have state consistency. For example, a rapist in NY may receive 15 years in prison, while a rapist in Texas may receive 45. Cross apply this to disenfranchisement. Maine and Vermont do not disenfranchise, while Arizona and New Mexico do. Turn this against my opponenet. His logic leads the conclusion that disenfranchisement is unjust because it is not consistent. Second, when felons enter society, this is the governments stamp on the pay back to society. According to my opponents logic, we should keep them in jail forever, or just kill them to make a more consistent legal system. This is obviously unjust, and thus contradicts his value. 3. Double Standard Simply turn this argument against my opponenet. By taking away a felon's right to vote is undoing the balance that incarceration achieves. When felons reenter society after incarceration, they are on on equal terms once again. However, when you disenfranchise them you are devaluing them compared to the rest of society. Therefore, it is the negative which is creating the double standard. Thank you ladies and gentlemen",

            "premise": "I affirm: Felons ought to retain the right to vote in a democratic society. Definitions: Democratic society: society where the government is decided by the people, either directly or through representatives Felon: one who has committed a felony Retain: to keep in use. Observations: 1) The resolution states felon. All ex-felons are essentially felons as they have been convicted of a felony and therefore the negative must prove that all felons should lose the right to vote. 2) The definition of \"felon\" states one who \"has\" committed a felony. This indicates past events and thus it is the burden of the affirmative to prove that felons in society should retain the right to vote. My value for this debate is A Democratic Society, which is the inherent value indicated by the resolution. The resolution specifically states a democratic society, thus is should be the highest value. The value of a democratic society is upheld by the value criterion of protection of rights Since in a democratic society the government exists solely for the people, then therefore it is only logical that a democratic society's government ought to protect its citizens' rights. Contention 1) Right of self-determination. This is the right to shape the conditions of one's own existence and pursue one's own happiness. Underneath the classic inalienable rights, a democratic government ought to ensure people have this right, otherwise the government would not be just. Without the right to vote one has no say in government and control of the state that they are forced to live under and abide by the laws of. Therefore, they cannot possibly control their own life when they have no say in the government that controls their life. Additionally, granting felons the right to vote infringes neither on anyone's right to vote or right of self-determination. Contention2) The negative is punishing the person's crime already through incarceration, yet at the same time taking away their right to vote. In terms of felon disenfranchisement, the government is punishing twice; once in jail, and once out of jail. This is known as double jeopardy, or punishing a crime twice. The 5th Amendment states \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" Also, we do not give people a lifelong ban on marriage or freedom of speech, so why would we give them a lifelong ban on voting? It is excessive punishment to incarcerate someone and at the same time take away all their political influence and right of self-determination. ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((REFUTE))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) --Value: Social Contract- This is not specifically stated by the resolution, however mine is and thus should be looked at above his. ---VC- Societal Welfare Link this back to my VC. It is not possible to uphold societal welfare unless you protect of the citizens' rights and thus if you are even to look at his VC you must look at my VC first. Additionally he provides no link between this and his Value and C1. --Contention 1: \"By breaking the social contract, citizens have forfeited their right to vote. By granting any felon the right to vote would contradict the purpose of the social contract.\" However, a) When a felon commits a crime, yes they break the social contract, which is why they are incarcerated. However as I show in my second contention it is unjust to punish them additionally by taking their right to vote away. b) Also, it is feudal to continually deny felons a place in the social contract. Once a felon exits prison, although still a felon they should then re-enter the social contract. Should we not allow them a chance to become one of society once more?",

I am simply using the definition of social contract that I previously defined. If you compare my definition to those of the men my opponent speaks of, it is closest to the Hobbes theory. :: Observation :: >My opponent has highlighted what I have and have not proved. What he has not done is related his statement to my previous statements which expressed the merits of the decisions that felons made. In my own words (R1), felons will \"[show] the poor decision making that caused the felons to become felons in the first place. This will then adversely affect all members of society for the worse of the people. This in itself is a far greater crime than a felony is.\" This, in his words, is \"why the Government SHOULD take away the right to vote.\" :: Value :: >See above. :: Contention 1 :: >Please note in addition to the Founding Fathers that I did mention the Constitution which I assume my opponent has forfeited as he has failed to mention it. The reason that a republic is not a valid form of democracy (because of my opponent's request) can best be noticed in the United States Court System. If there are twelve jurors and one of them votes innocent, then even versus eleven votes for guilty there will not be a guilty verdict. In a democracy one vote versus eleven would mean that the eleven (majority) wins. This means that the government values an innocent vote differently than a guilty vote. It is just like this with felon disenfranchisement, the innocent vote is always worth more. :: Contention 2 :: >See Observation. :: Contention 3 :: >As previously stated (R1), the affirmative must prove his case true in all cases. Not all rehabilitation is successful and not all felons rehabilitate. Therefore, rehabilitation is invalid because it is not true in all cases. :: Contention 4 :: >As I have stated pretty much all of the time, felons are counterproductive to society. I am predicting that I would be asked for elaboration, so I will simply say that felonies are not productive because committing felonies is not productive. :: My Contention 1 :: >Please note that I never said the word president in all of R1. Though my assumption is an assumption which is not always a good thing to make, it is a logical assumption because by following a logical trend of what the felon has done in the past (commit a felony mainly), they are likely to make another bad decision in the future. :: My Contention 2 :: >To my respected opponent: what other right do you propose we take away from felons? None of them work except for the right to vote. To name a few, the right to freedom of religion (as my opponent also mentioned) simply cannot be revoked because it is not possible to truly control what another individual believes. Another right, the right to freedom of speech (again mentioned by my opponent) being revoked would make the felon a less productive part of society, which, as my opponent suggests, is not the goal. Last right, freedom of assembly, would do no good to be revoked because it would just make life harder for the felon, which, again, is not the goal. :: Sub-point A :: >Voting is actually not an inalienable right because as my opponent has already admitted \"[I] can prove that the government has the power to strip a felon of the right to vote\", proving his own statement invalid and contradicting himself. By definition the right to life, in fact, can be taken from a felon: \"Felon: a person who has been convicted of a felony, which is a crime punishable by death or a term in state or federal prison... Felony (elaboration): a crime sufficiently serious to be punishable by death or a term in state or federal prison, as distinguished from a misdemeanor which is only punishable by confinement to county or local jail and/or a fine.\" I have previously stated why speech and religion cannot be stripped for a person: \"To name a few, the right to freedom of religion (as my opponent also mentioned) simply cannot be revoked because it is not possible to truly control what another individual believes. Another right, the right to freedom of speech (again mentioned by my opponent) being revoked would make the felon a less productive part of society, which, as my opponent suggests, is not the goal.\" :: Sub-point B :: >Please note that my Observation states that \"due to the wording of the resolution, the affirmative has the burden of proof and must prove the resolution true in all cases.\" Murderers are felons; therefore, being exclusive to murders is perfectly valid. According to the definition of felon (\"Felon: a person who has been convicted of a felony, which is a crime punishable by death or a term in state or federal prison... Felony (elaboration): a crime sufficiently serious to be punishable by death or a term in state or federal prison, as distinguished from a misdemeanor which is only punishable by confinement to county or local jail and/or a fine.\") murderers can be killed. Additionally, rapists (felons in this case) can be killed as well due to the definition of felon, which I believe is worse than rape. To follow my opponent's \"eye for an eye\" lead, it is legal to not just go eye for eye, but eye for life in this case. In the case of a murder who murders twice, they cannot be killed twice, but they can be killed once in a more painful and/or humiliating way. This is like (different value of eye) two eyes for two eyes and an ear (you may value parts or you body differently than I, but my point still works). To my opponent: may we please abandon this overly elaborate metaphor? >On my opponent's last categorized remark, the negativity (as stated in R1 and R2) is which a person gets elected due to the extra votes from the felons.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: In the United States, Felons should be allowed to vote upon release from prison.",
            "premise": "Today I stand to affirm the resolution: \"resolved: In the United States, Felons should be allowed to vote upon release from prison.\" Not only are American felon voting laws outdated, they work against the democratic process, and they slow rehabilitation back into society. 1. One of the foundations of democracy is that everybody should vote, and that those elected into the United State's government are those who are supported the majority of the population. By not allowing released felons to vote, it is taking the vote away from up to 7% of the adult population in some states (1). In fact, in 2010, 5.9 million people in the United States were left unable to vote (2). Because of this, up to 6% of the United States (5.9 million people) are left without a vote, and their voices are not heard as loudly in government. This takes away from the democratic process, as despite the fact that the United States is built off of giving everybody a voice, these felons are left with none. So, not allowing felons to vote is taking away from the democratic process, and is making electoral decisions not truly represent the views of the people. 1a. Restricting felon voting rights can change the results of elections. If felons in Florida were allowed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, it would have affected the result. Ex-felons have been seen to almost always vote democratic, and the 527 vote margin of victory of George Bush would undoubtedly be wiped out if the 600,000 felons barred from voting could have exercised their opinions (3). So, it is clear that not allowing felons to vote can change the results of elections, and by not allowing felons to vote, elections clearly do not always represent the people's true views. 1b. Taking away the right to vote does not make logical sense. A fundamental of the American Justice system is that once you complete your prison sentence, your punishment is over. Not allowing felons to vote for extended periods after their release from prison is extending their punishment, and by not allowing felons to vote, it makes rehabilitation into society even harder. This claim is supported by former Attorney General Eric Holder, as he said that taking the right away from felons \"Defy[ies] the principles of accountability and rehabilitation that guides our justice system\" (1). So, taking away a felon's right to vote is unethical, and unnecessarily extends punishment. 1c. The bill of rights in the constitution of the United States \"prohibits excessive sanctions\", and reads \"punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense\". Not allowing felons to vote for decades seems to be \"excessive,\" as it is a fundamental right of being an American Citizen. So, not allowing felons to vote for decades is going against the concepts of excessive sanctions, and is an unnecessary right to remove. 2. Allowing felons to vote would help with their transition back into society. Felons without voting rights often feel fed up with the slow pace it takes to be fully re-admitted into society, and because of this, they are often three times more likely to re-offend than those with full rights upon release from prison (1). So, if felons were allowed to vote upon release from prison, not only would they transition more smoothly back into society, they would also be less likely to re-offend. 2a. Small offenses, like even tampering with crab traps illegally can trigger over 7 years without voting rights is some states (3). This simply does not make sense, as these criminals are clearly non violent, and have no intention of hurting anybody. Furthermore, these criminals usually show nothing that hints towards an inability to vote. 3. Felon voting laws are racist, and take the voice away from racial minorities. According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, up to 20% of adult black males are left unable to vote in some states due to felon voting restrictions (2). African Americans are already a minority, with a relatively small voice in government. By taking the vote away from up to 20 percent of adult male African Americans, the voice of a relatively unspoken minority is being further quenched, as less of them can vote. This gives them even less of a say in elections, and is thus making them further under-represented in government. This also gives white people, the majority, an even larger voice in government. So, felon voting laws take voice away from already overshadowed minorities. 4. Felon Voting laws in the United States are outdated. In most other industrialized countries, felons are allowed to vote, sometimes even while still in prison (1). Additionally, they are even encouraged to do so, in promotion of the democratic process (1). In comparison, American felon voting laws, which take away voting rights until long after prison release seem incredibly restrictive, and outdated, while the laws in these other countries are innovative and modern. If American felon voting laws were loosened to this level, the United States would appear to be a modern, innovative country in one more way, and it would maybe gain more international respect. So, it has been shown that felon voting laws defy the democratic process, make elections seem not to fully represent the people's views, are unconstitutional, harm rehabilitative processes, take the voice away from under-spoken minorities, and are outdated. As such, it seems that felon voting laws need to be changed to become less restrictive. Sources 1- http://www.nytimes.com... 2- http://www.startribune.com... 3- http://america.aljazeera.com...",

            "premise": "Since this is the last round I will illustrate why the negative panel's reasoning is far superior to the affirmatives by deeply explaining my case in a summary. I will not attack my opponent because this is the last round and it would not be fair to him, nor I because I could not respond to his attack in the third round. So I will not motivate any more attacks upon my case. The resolution implies a society with a government that is a democracy. It does not matter if the democracy is a direct or representative. The only thing significant about the democracy is that the citizens in the society vote for their governors and officials. In this society certain citizens have committed harsh crimes. We know this from the mentioning of felons. The significant portion of felons is that the citizen has committed a brutal crime. We interpret the brutality of the crime from the American legal system definition of a felony. We also figure out that in this society that there is a legal system that prosecutes and punish citizens that commit crimes. No where in the resolution does it implies the American or any other democratic society. With the scenario the resolution implies illustrated above the resolution poses the question that should a felon retain the right to vote. Therefore we understand that the felon has already lost his right to vote. The question is asked because the society the felon dwells in has a democracy for a government where the citizens must vote for their governors. The negative panel will answer to the question that the felon should not retain the right to vote. The negative values democracy and will achieve are value through strengthen the power of voting. A democracy must have the populace vote, so by strengthen the power to vote the negative upholds the strongest facet of a democracy. The negative will strengthen the power of voting by only allowing certain individuals vote in elections. To vote one must not commit a felony. A democratic society can function if not all of its citizen's vote. The governors in the government purely must have gotten their through an election by the people. Strengthening the power of voting in a democratic society by disfranchising felons is morally correct. This is a debate of theory. The affirmative has the burden of proving that it is morally correct to allow all citizens in a democratic society to vote. The negative has to prove that it is morally correct to not allow all citizens the right to vote in a democratic society. When the minority that is disfranchised are only because they are felons it is morally correct. Any gender, race and age can be a felon, but they commit a felon. That ideology keeps others from being disfranchised because of sexism, racism or ageism. The negative panel presents contentions to why disfranchising felons is morally correct because a felon that loses the right to vote will not become a detriment to the society and it is just to revoke the privilege of voting as a deterrent for felonies in a democratic society. The felon in the society the resolution implies loses their right to vote because they have harmed the society and the society has endorse the lost of voting rights as a deterrent to prevent other non-felons from becoming felons. I have properly explained the negative reasoning and urge the judge to vote neg because the negative panel's reasoning is superior the affirmatives.

            "premise": "I took the core value assumed by Pro to be achieving justice. Pro claimed, \"The creation of justice, by preserving the democratic society, is the pathway towards the achievement of the perfect democracy.\" Now Pro seems to claim that justice should be defined as whatever democracy produces, no matter how unjust. The vote of cannibals provides a simple example of the fact that democracy does always achieve justice. Moreover, the fact that democracy does not achieve justice is reflected in the U.S. Constitution by its establishing a republic, by using a system of electors chosen by state legislators \"by any means,\" and by having a Bill of Rights that protects individuals from unfettered democracy. Moreover, the exclusion of minors and the exclusion of non-citizens is done to foster justice at the expense of unfettered democracy. Pro made no argument that justice would be achieved by expanding democracy. In his opening statement Pro asserted \"If all of these Voters were re-enfranchised and 1726 more of those voters cast ballots in favor of Al Gore Rather than George Bush the presidential election would have turned another way.\" then in rebuttal he contradicts himself by asserting \"Also felons are only 2% of the population not enough to win an election.\" Pro was correct in his first assertion, and the numbers Pro recited prove that 2% more than enough to swing an election. Pro asserts that recidivism rates are \"mere speculation.\" It is not speculation that convicted felons still have a substantial interest in preserving a criminal lifestyle. When about 60% are rearrested and more are not caught, that is solid proof that they maintain that interest. It would be a fine idea to exclude felons who have never been caught from voting, but the lack of a practical way of doing that does not mean we should honor the judgment of those we know to have interests in weakening the justice system. Pro asserts that the only purposes of imprisonment are punishment and rehabilitation. I refuted that at the outset. An additional purpose is to prevent the offender from committing additional bad acts upon the public. Denying the vote to a convicted felon prevents the felon from committing the bad act of fostering criminal interests through the voting process. That can, fortunately, be prevented without imprisonment. Note that the proposition restores the vote to felon who are in jail or on parole, yet Pro seems to insist that the issue is solely about those who have completed their sentences. The fundamental error in the Pro position is the assumption that greater democracy always means greater justice. Clearly it does not. I therefore urge a vote against the proposition.",

            "conclusion": "All Felonies should be treated equally",
            "premise": "Felonies, decribed in lawinfo.com as \"any crime punishable by more than one year in prison or by death for capital offenses\". In this debate, it should be argued wether or not all Felonies including, but not limited to Assult, Rape, Murder, and Illegal Possesion of Narcotic Paraphernalia should be \"treated\" equally. Meaning that they should recieve the same attention in court, and that no matter the size of the felony, it should be looked as the same as the worst felony. For example, if a entity is found guilty of Murder, asn is sentenced to 50 years prison, someone whom has commieted aggravated assault should recieve the same penalty. In order to participate in this debate, you must understand and comnform to a group of variables, which are established to avoid any \"what if\" situation, and to best avoid biased or personal argument. they are as follow: 1. Any entity which isused in the debate by either the Contender or Instigator must not be looked at or treated differentl because of Race or Sex, therefore, the debaters should not look at the accused or condemned as different type of people, but simply as a human beings. 2. The debaters MUST assume that any entity used in teh debate is guilty of whatever crime it is being accused of. No exceptions. 3. The debaters CANNOT try to justify a felony by stating that it was a matter of honor or passion, or that it was an unintentional action. therefore, the debaters MUST assume that the entities which commited the felonies did so in a intentional, concious, and malicious manner. No Exceptions. This being said, i will officially begin the debate. Being the Pro in the topic, i shall present my argument first. Over 54% of crimes in the U.S. are felonies. Felonies include a wide spectrum of crimes from assault to Murder. Many felonies are treated quite differently and most have differencces in priority and in the punishment presented to the felon which commited the felony. I believe that all felonies, no matter their size or graveness, should be treated in the same way, as a serious crime with malicious intent. There are several reasons to why I argue this point. 1. Equal and sistematic punishment will discourage people from commiting crimes other than murder and rape, as they will fear life imprisoment or the death penalty as a result for their actions. this is just how the death penalty affects the community. It has been proven that countries which use the death penalty have less criminals than countries whom do not use the death penalty. 2. Treating all felonies as equal will make the justice system more swift and efficient. In trials, most of the time, Judges must determine how much penalty should be given to a felon, and how. If all felons were given the same penalty for commiting a felony, the \"Justice sytem would not have to waste so much time questioning what penalty to impose on the felon. In conclusion, treating all felonies as the same will not only discourage possible felons, but will help the justice system to more efficiently deal with current felons. I wish my opponent, whomever it may be, the best of luck.",

            "premise": "Before I begin, I want to thank my opponent for an interesting debate idea. Look forward to a great confrontation in round 3!BOPNow, my opponent's case is that felons should be able to vote; logically, this means we should restore voting rights for all felons, and that future felons would not be penalized by removing their right. My opponent bears sole BOP, which means he is responsible to prove that felons should be able to vote. If he fails to do so, or I demonstrate any situation where a felon should not be allowed to vote, I would win.Contention 1 - Government is just, and its powers derive from societyThomas Jefferson says it best in the Declaration of Independence, \"All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\". The idea of God-given rights form the cornernstone of American justice and a key part of traditional American values. Jefferson continues: \" That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\". That is, government exists to protect rights. Its powers, when derived from and held by the people, are just. This includes, by nature, the power to punish those who violate rights.Contention 2 - Punishment consists of revoking of rightsWhat does punishment entail? In general, the idea in common law is that punishment should fit the crime - that is, the more severe the crime, the more severe the punishment. The most common methods of securing punishment - those society has, throughout our history, deemed most just - are through fines, community service, and imprisonment. Outside of a governmental context, these all would be crimes. If I were to forcibly take money from you, require you to work without pay, or lock you in a small room and make it impossible for you to leave, I would be arrested. But, for governments, this is fine. Why? Because when you violate the law, you forfeit rights. Essentially, by refusing to respect the rights of others, you lose some of yours. Loss of voting privileges is just another way to punish people. It's serious nature connotes the seriousness of the crime. Roger Clegg of the Center for Equal opportunity says \"It makes sense that felons should lose their right to vote. You don\u2019t have a right to make the laws if you aren\u2019t willing to follow them yourself. To participate in self-government, you must be willing to accept the rule of law. We don\u2019t let everyone vote \u2013 not children, not noncitizens, not the mentally incompetent. There are certain minimum and objective standards of trustworthiness, responsibility, and commitment to our laws that we require before people are entrusted with a role in the solemn enterprise of self-government. Those who have committed serious crimes against their fellow citizens don\u2019t meet those standards.\"[1]Contention 3 - Voting rights should only be revoked for violent criminals. One area of common ground might be that there are many people who are felons that do no deserve that connotation. Felonies should be limited to the most serious crimes - things like arson, sex crimes (rape, child rape, incest), murder, and treason. In the past and presents, states have been too loose in regards to drug crimes. People can become felons for what should be minor drug crimes, if they should even be crimes at all. The definition of 'felon' should be reduced to violent or treasonous crimes - the most despicable and terrible of actions. It is on firm ground to say a convincted child rapist, murderer, or rapist has forfeited his right to decide laws for others through his actions. These violent criminals have rejected society and its laws, and society is well within its rights to reject them.Contention 4 - Rights could be restored through an arbitration committeeAfter a felon has served their time, it might be reasonable to consider returning their right to vote. This would not be automatic - it might be handled in a similar way to how we handle parole - there might be a voting board, which would thoroughly vet the person to determine if they are truly sorry for what they have done and are committed to living by the laws of society. This would provide incentive for felons to reform - they will be accepted back into society if they are willing to accept the laws that the government of the people has made.ConclusionIn short, there is nothing wrong with restricting voting rights for felons. It works with the American legal tradition, and is a reasonable way to punish those who have decided to reject the laws of society. While the definition of 'felon' might need to be smaller, and a system to allow restoration of rights might be reasonable, there is no reason a pedophile or murderer should be allowed to decide the laws of a society he plainly rejected.References:1. http://www.ceousa.org...;",

            "premise": "Countries like our own are succeeding with letting their felons vote Half of all the European countries allow all current inmates to vote, and virtually all former inmates in Europe have full voting rights. Take Ireland for example. For elections in the Republic of Ireland, there is no disenfranchisement based on criminal conviction, and prisoners remain on the electoral register at their pre-imprisonment address. Prior to 2006, the grounds for postal voting did not include imprisonment, and hence those in prison on election day were in practice unable to vote, although those on temporary release could do so. In 2000 the High Court ruled that this breached the Constitution, and the government drafted a bill extending postal voting to prisoners on remand or serving sentences of less than six months.However, in 2001, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court ruling and the bill was withdrawn.After the 2005 ECHR ruling in the Hirst case, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 was passed to allow postal voting by all prisoners. Also, judge, we have Germany, in which the law even calls on prisons to encourage prisoners to vote. Only those convicted of electoral fraud and crimes undermining the \"democratic order\", such as treason are barred from voting, while in prison. However, as soon as they are released from prison, they regain their voting rights! Now judge, i would like to mention how these countries are going in their criminal ways. According to a 2004 study done by Oxford Univ., former prisoners who vote are half as likely to re-offend, and so far, half of these European countries, whom are letting their felons vote, are having their repeating felons reduced by half. Judge, this shows that with letting their felons vote, these countries are not having repeated crimes! This is reducing the amount of crimes committed by ex-felons by HALF, Lets also think about this logically. these countries are both democracies, and their governments are very similar to ours. and yet, they are letting their felons vote. while letting their felons vote, they are not only reducing the amount of crimes occurring in their countries, but they are also letting more people have a say in who gets to govern over the people. How judge, how can this be harmful to anybody? and judge, as i will state in my 2nd cont., giving people a second chance does not hurt, and in some cases, it even provides benefits.",

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting my debate. Keep in mind that this is not a debate of whether it is illegal for prisoners to vote, but of whether they \"should\" be allowed this right. Therefore, referencing a policy/law such as the Supreme court decision of 2000 for the disenfranchisement of voting rights is likely to be deemed as irrelevant in the context of this debate, so debate with caution. Opening Arguments:Felony disenfranchisement: excluding people otherwise eligible to vote from voting (known as disfranchisement) due to conviction of a criminal offence (Wikipedia). Also this is a general issue, but I will be referring to the US frequently, since US polices condone felony disenfranchisement for the most part. Felony disenfranchisement varies in degree in some circumstances sometimes based on the type/degree of the offence or what state they were located in when serving their sentencing.Prisons are generally seen as a punishment for some convictions while for other convictions, they are seen as a means for rehabilitation. This perspective usually varies depending on the viewpoints of the outside parties. Arguably, punishment is the subjective perspective while rehabilitation is the objective perspective. The same case can be likened to voting disenfranchisement. Many prisoners (especially those with minor offenses), contrary to popular belief, strive to better themselves and rejoin society. Felony disenfranchisement is often an overly excessive punishment for certain prisoners.Prisoners already have their liberty take away, including their rights to be with their family and friends or occupy a job whilst in prison. It is certainly justified for them to serve a court's sentencing, but why should their right to vote be taken away as well? Especially considering that there are prisoners serving relatively short-term sentences and who had committed minor offenses.Prisoners would be less likely to be involved in criminal activities if encouraged to participate in the politics as part of their rehabilitation. -Enfranchisement not only bestows self-esteem and a sense of purpose in society, but encourages research and participation with contemporary political issues. \"To deny this right is to force the disinherited (to) sit idly by while others elect his civil leaders and while others choose the fiscal and governmental policies which will govern him and his family\" (Parris). Felony disenfranchisement conveys to prisoners that not only they committed a crime, but that they committed that crime because they were incapable of acting in a manner fit for society. Granting them the right to vote would likely be consistent with the American tradition of making our democracy more and more inclusive. Arguably there would be reduced re-offending rates and perhaps a society with fewer criminals as a long term effect. Felony disenfranchisement distorts the total voter turnout.-In 2012, all the various state felony disenfranchisement laws added together prevented \"an estimated 5.85 million felons\" from voting, \"up from 1.2 million in 1976\" (Wikipedia). \"This comprised 2.5% of the potential voters in general; and included 8% of the potential African American voters.\" The estimated population for Florida in 2010 was\"18,804,623\" (US census) and it had the highest disenfranchised voters for any state, with \"1.5 million\" disenfranchised from voting. That is roughly a calculated 12.5% of the total population that was not represented in Florida. It would virtually be an inaccurate representation in our society, a largely democratic society that prides itself for representing the general populace rather than a select few. The equal protection clause can also come into play if it is recognized in the courts that prisoners who are colored are not represented and are racially discriminated against in terms of voting.Prisoners are not treated as \"civically dead\" when it benefits the government.- Prisoners remain liable for taxation on any earnings and savings that they have. This is virtually taxation without representation. Many convicts have difficulty finding employment when put on parole after serving a sentence, and so this would be an unfair and excessive punishment when taking that into account. The support of felony disenfranchisement is largely based on subjective values of furthering justice against those convicted, rather than objective values concerning what would really function well in terms of rehabilitation and voter representation.Sources Utilized:-http://quickfacts.census.gov...-https://en.wikipedia.org...-http://archive.fairvote.org...-http://insidetime.org...",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: in a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote",
            "premise": "1. Suppose a missionary and four cannibals are stranded on an island. Does justice demand that the issue of what's for lunch be settled democratically, with a vote granted to each of the five residents of the island? Pro argues that democracy is the preeminent value of justice, that no one can be excluded from the society, and that fencing off any demographic, in this case the cannibal demographic, is clearly wrong. If these arguments are true, then the missionary is not only in the soup, he should be pleased that justice has prevailed. I argue that such is not the case. 2. I accept the definitions offered by Pro. I note, however, that the definition of a \"right\" does not tell us what is and what is not a right. Moreover, there are inevitable conflicts among rights which must be resolved. The U.S. Constitution grants no right to vote for president. The electors for the President are determined by state legislators \"by any means.\" Clearly, the Constitution does not make voting a preeminent right. The Constitution defines a republic, which subordinates the right to vote upon legislation to voting for legislators. There are clauses granting equal rights based based upon race and religion, and equal voting rights based upon gender, but there is nothing that prevents voting restrictions based upon other criteria. The right to vote is not granted to those under the age of eighteen. That limitation shows that voting rights may be restricted when there is reason to doubt the potential voter's good judgment. Convicted felons are another class of citizens whose judgment is reasonably called into question. Resident aliens are excluded from voting on the grounds that their interests are not necessarily coincident with the interests of citizens. The interests of convicted felons are likely to be contrary to the interests of citizens as a whole, who want to be protected from criminals. That is stronger grounds for excluding convicted felons than the grounds for excluding resident aliens. 3. Pro cites Thurgood Marshall as evidence in supporting the proposition. Justice Marshall is a distinguished jurist who is an expert on interpreting laws. However, being highly qualified to interpret laws does not qualify one as an expert on making laws. The good justice claims that once a prison sentence is served, that felons have \"fully paid their debt to society.\" Whether or not they have fully paid there debt is a matter of law, and ultimately of the values of society as reflected in the lawmaking processes. For example, convicted sex offenders must register with the government and are restricted from certain interactions with children. The \"three strikes and you are out\" laws identify career criminals and remove them from society. The justification for both sex-offender registration and \"three strikes\" is that convicted felons are more likely to commit additional crimes than persons without a criminal record. It is arguable what the correct level of continuing debt to society ought to be, but the fact that convicted felons are more likely to commit crimes is unquestionable. The U.S. Bureau of Justice reports that \"...over two-thirds of released prisoners were rearrested within three years\" http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov.... Note that the two-thirds only reflects released felons who where caught within three years. It does not count those who committed crimes but were not arrested. Overall, only about 45 percent of violent crimes are solved, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics http://www.ncpa.org.... Factoring in the criminals not caught, we may reasonably suppose that the true recidivism rate is in the neighborhood of 85 or 90 percent. The \"debt to society\" at the heart of this issue is not with respect to serving a sentence for a particular crime, it is in having adopted a criminal lifestyle. The convicted felon ought to have the obligation of establishing that his interests have become aligned with those of ordinary citizens and contrary to those with a criminal lifestyle. For example, that might be established after ten years without an arrest for a felony. It is not established by release from prison. Only eight states currently prohibit convicted felons from voting for life. Two states permit felons to vote while in prison. Thirty-three states remove the franchise while convicted felons are on parole. Thus even if one accepts Thurgood Marshall's argument that voting rights should be restored after felons have \"paid their debt,\" it is not at the heart of the issue. The issue is mainly about criminals who are in prison or on parole and have not paid their debt. 4. Pro claims that in the 2000 election in Florida, \"The fact that these voters were disenfranchised caused a serious lapse in democracy, and therefore did no justice. Because Disenfranchisement restricts the democratic process the resolution is a just principle.\" I agree that in close elections the votes of those with an established criminal lifestyle voting for someone they feel to be in their interests could determine the outcome of an election. That is a powerful argument that justice demands that election not be determined by such people. 5. Pro claims \"It must be agreed that fencing off a certain voter demographic is a fundamentally unjust principle.\" I do not agree. It depends upon the reason for fencing off the demographic. People under the age of 18 are fenced off on the just grounds that in general they lack the knowledge and experience to cast an informed vote. Note that this is done despite some sixteen and seventeen year olds being more informed than some citizens who are fifty or sixty years old. The fencing off is justified because the odds are so heavily against it. Similarly, not all convicted felons remains committed to the criminal lifestyle. But with about 85% recidivism, the odds are much against it. Therefore, it is reasonable and just to identify the demographic and exclude them. Convicted felons are, I agree, an identifiable demographic. That makes them an identifiable target for politicians, who can go to prisons to seek votes by making various promises to tilt the justice system in favor of criminals. (Note that the proposal is to for convicted felons to retain the right to vote, with no criteria that they even have been released from prison.) Politicians are clever enough not to make the appeal directly, as that would alienate other voters. They would use surrogates who espouse \"improving\" the justice system by weakening it. Even if no targeted appeal were made, criminals would figure out for themselves which candidate was most likely to facilitate their lifestyle. Crime victims are also an identifiable demographic. However, victims are less likely to vote based upon the single issue of weakening the justice system. Victims are citizens who worry about the health of the economy because a good economy facilitates their making a living. A criminal lifestyle, however, is only facilitated by weakening the justice system. Therefore, the fact that criminals constitute a single-issue demographic is just grounds for excluding them from voting. 6. Justice is not served by having cannibals voting democratically on the fate of missionaries. The interests of justice are best served by subordinating democracy to human rights. We should not want people whose prime interest is in pursuing a criminal lifestyle determining the outcome of close elections.",

If many of them return to prison, even after they have been let off on parole, it can be said that these people have invalid judgements and are not capable of making informed and educated decisions. Therefore they indirectly effect citizens who are able to weigh the consequences of their decisions, and should not be afforded this right unless they can prove that their judgement is valid. Once a person commits a felony, it should not be assumed that he/she is of a stable mental state when he/she is released from prison, and as such the right to vote is no longer a right but a privilege.

Rebuttal R.3 B) Final Neg. Rebuttal I follow this modified LD format to conform to the website. Obviously, no new arguments in the 2AR/2NR and all the other rules. I affirm. I offer the following definitions to clarify the round: Felon: a person who has committed an act deemed illegal by that person's government Democratic Society: Society governed by all citizens using the system of voting Democratic: the ability to have a say in what action is occurring Right: an ability or state you can maintain because a government enforces that ability or state Equality: the quality of being the same in measure, value or status Observation: The resolution states \"felons ought to retain the right...in a democratic society\" This does NOT mean any society we currently are residing in or know of today. The resolution does NOT state that United States felons ought to retain the right to vote, nor that any other specific members of specific societies are relevant to this debate. The value for the round is Human Rights as defined by the UN Declaration of Human Rights. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations released said declaration, setting a standard for all democratic and non-democratic nations everywhere. It has 30 total articles, but for this debate I will focus on the following: \"Article 21, Sub Point 3: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures\" To put it simply, all people should have the right to vote in any governmental election. This also has been clearly acknowledged as a human right. The Criterion is Equality. Democracy is founded upon the principle of equality, since equality shows that all people are of the same value. Democratic acts allow all people to have an EQUAL say in what is occurring. This proves a direct relation to the resolution and therefore is the clear, best choice for today's criterion. Contention 1: \"Felons are still citizens\" Therefore, we cannot rightfully discredit a felon's input on government simply because they have committed a crime. The basic purpose of voting is to gather input from citizens on the issues of their society, and if even one member of that society is a felon, they should still have the right to vote because they are still a citizen, they still are counted in the population and they still experience the results of the election. Furthermore, the commission of a felony does not render a felon incapable of having opinions on other social issues, thus a felon's opinion is still relevant to the society and therefore the felon should retain the right to vote. Because of this, equality is better upheld on the affirmative. Contention 2: \"The Prison system is a punishment system\" All people that are convicted of a felony are given a proper punishment based on the severity of the crime committed. If we were to add a separate and additional punishment to a punishment that they already have served, we are destroying the very system used to judge felons. Adding an addition punishment is destructive of a democratic society because it is neither equal nor democratic, as not all felons have committed the same crime. If we were to negate the resolution, we might as well stick all felons in prison for the rest of their lives because we aren't trusting them to do anything after they have been labeled a felon. Because negating is NOT proportional, equality is better upheld by affirming the resolution. Contention 3: \"Rational Choice Theory\" Rational Choice Theory is the basic process that a person does all the time. It basically shows that citizens only do something that is more beneficial to them than not. In this case, Rational Choice Theory can be applied in the way citizens vote. There is the intense (primary) benefit that each citizen has in an election, (like gay marriage for a homosexual voter or banning abortion for a pro-life voter,) an intrinsic (secondary) benefit, (meaning an issue that the voter has a stance on, but is not high priority) and a voting cost. (Like taking the time to register, standing in line or even filling out the ballot.) Citizens will only vote when the benefits outweigh the costs. The warrants and impacts for this are as follows; affirming allows all voters who have the moral and social standards to suffer the costs of voting in order to cast their vote. Negating however decreases the number of good voters (felon or not) by not retaining their right to vote. Equality is better upheld by the affirmative because all voters are given the ability to cast an equal vote if they choose to. (Meaning any non-voters are creating by choice, not force)",

            "premise": "I'd like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I accept all definitions but with a question against \"Social Contract\". Social Contract is a theory set forward by multiple people and there are different takes on it. Which Social Contract is my opponent using? (Locke, Hobbes, etc.) Observations: Although my opponent can prove that the government has the power to strip a felon of the right to vote, he still has the burden of proving why the Government SHOULD take away the right to vote. (What negative effect is there of letting felons vote?) Values: First of all, I'd like to bring up Social Contract again. My opponent's framework is based on this idea, and without specifying which social contract he is using in this debate, I have no idea what he values. Affirmative Defense: 1C: My opponent says that referencing the Founding Fathers is invalid because the resolution does not refer specifically to the U.S. However, as I stated before the United States IS still a democratic society (making it a valid example for this resolution) and I have also proved that a democratic republic is the best form of democracy with a large population. My opponent does not state why a democratic republic is not a valid form of democracy - something he needs to do in order to make my example invalid. Against the question that my opponent asks: The reason that we allow them the same rights is to help them merge with society once again (elaborated on in my later contentions). A Democracy aims to give the supreme power to the people - once we start limiting who gets to have this power, we stray away from a democracy. My opponent has yet to prove that voting is not a right. 2C: My opponent has yet to prove why letting felons vote would negatively affect our government. His statement of \"...poorly influencing the processes of the government\" falls without a warrant for why there would be a poor influence. (I will address this on my attack) 3C: As my opponent seems to imply, I wasn't arguing that felons would become normal civilians. I was arguing that felons are entitled to the right to be rehabilitated and an attempt must be made to merge them with society once again. By letting felons retain the right to vote, we encourage the rehabilitation process. The names of certain prison facilities clearly show the goal of the facility - to rehabilitate. 4C: My fourth contention was an argument against any argument that felons would be counterproductive to society. Negative Case: 1C: My opponent assumes that felons would make a bad decision in voting for president. However, we must understand a democracy values the majority. Felons do not make up the majority in any society. Also, if a felon were to vote for someone that a normal civilian were voting for, do we consider them both as \"negatively influencing\" our government? We cannot assume that a felon would vote for someone against society. This is proven in my fourth contention - because felonies aren't agreed upon universally, we cannot assume that all felons are against society. 2C: My opponent makes an argument that felons ought to be stripped of their rights because they have committed a felony. However, the only right stripped when incarcerating a felon is their right to liberty. Because they are felons, do we strip them of the right to free speech? religion? Stating that felons should have their rights stripped just because of a felony is absurd because my opponent bases this argument on the idea that only the right to vote should be stripped. SA: Although people may not stay equal based on the actions they choose, voting is an inalienable right. My opponent again bases his argument on the idea that rights can be stripped if people commit felonies. My opponent does not state why voting is the specific right that can be stripped, but why the right to life/speech/religion is not or cannot. SB: My opponents subpoint B is exclusive only to murderers. Also, my opponent bases this argument on a \"eye for an eye\" type of principle. Because the murderer took away the right to vote by killing, they cannot have the right to vote. First of all, I'd like to point out that using this type of logic, the murderer would have to be killed anyway. Second, this principle implies that we should rape rapists. Or for someone who killed two people, kill them twice. It is impossible to run a justice system on the principle of eye for an eye. I'd like to point out that my opponent doesn't point out any sort of negative effect on society (except for the implication in contention 1 that I already addressed) from letting felons retain the right to vote.",

            "conclusion": "in a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote",
            "premise": "I will begin by addressing my case and then my opponents. Many great philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Paine have all believed that every individual has inalienable or in other words natural rights. There are 2 types of rights humans are indebted to. The first type of rights is legal rights which are rights created by a society and natural rights which are rights that are consistent in any society. Legal rights can be changed, however inalienable rights are consistent in all situations. By preserving inalienable rights, I will affirm the resolution that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. I would like to clarify the following definitions from the Merriam-Webster's dictionary. Grant- to bestow or transfer formally Ought- used to express obligation; Retain- to keep. My value for this case is equality. My value criterion is preserving Natural rights. I have 1 observation in this case. The resolution must be consistent with both felons who are currently serving their punishment and felons who have finished their punishment. I have 1 observation in this case which is the way of determining who is eligible to vote in any democratic society. My first contention is by not allowing the felons to be granted voting rights, we are oppressing them. According to the widely accepted Doctrine of Inalienable rights, Article II states that Humans are granted liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. If we do not believe that every human has inalienable rights, then we cannot have: 1)A democratic society because democracy depends on every member of society to have a way of voting for what they want. However, if some people who contribute to society do not get these rights, then it is contradictory democratic ideals because the felons are not being granted equal representation. 2) Equality among humans because the lack of inalienable rights would give some humans a greater intrinsic value than other humans. Without equality among humans, that it would be okay for slavery to exist. It would also be okay to disrespect a felon because they are less in value. Clearly, by not owing the felons the right to vote, we oppressing them from having a say on what direction they would want a certain government to run. Is it fair that you as an individual be deprived of these rights? Would that allow you to disrespect felons? Felons are no less than you if you cannot treat them with proper respect. My second contention is that by not giving the felons a right to vote, then we are not allowing them to have a second chance at redemption. Currently, we are in a world in which it is natural to make mistakes and faults, however we must be able to learn from those very mistakes and prosper as humans. By taking away their rights to vote after they have served their term you are not allowing redemption in that democratic society. Even convicted felons can still contribute to society. Gandhi and Malcolm X had been considered felons for they served time in jail, however they revolutionized his nation. So such figures like them cannot be treated right just because they are felons? My third contention is that by not giving felons the right to vote, we are encouraging the felons to commit another felony in the future. For example, say a person commits embezzlement and is on probation as a punishment. Now, say the person, who contributes to society, is denied from this society which does not welcome the person back. However the person is expected to follow all of the rules again however, loses his/her rights. Should the person continue to be less than all of the individuals in the society? NO! By taking away the felon's rights you are saying its okay to disrespect the individual. Empirical studies supporting my reasoning have been conducted which show that in those societies in which felons retain the right to vote, they are 50% less likely to commit another crime than in places which deny felons the right to vote. With natural rights in mind, we cannot allow felons to be valued as less of humans than others. Felons are people just like me and you. In William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, this quote holds true to this situation \"If you prick felons, do they not bleed? If you tickle them, do they not laugh? If you poison them, do they not die? From the contentions above it can safely be stated that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. Now i will address my opponent's case. My opponent's value and criterion are both controdictory because punishment's purpose is redemption. When you give felons punishment, the goal is for them to rehabilitate. So if they are rehabilitated, they should be welcomed back with open arms. My opponents first contention is that Felons are considered less trustworthy. Full rights are often not completely restored following conviction. however, it is not true because felons are rehabilitated after they serve punishment. Remeber felons are people too. So this contention does not stand My opponents seconds contentions is that Under the affirmative they have to say felons who have committed voters fraud should be able to vote. However, i have proven why they should within my case so this contention is not pertainant. My opponent's third contention is that voting needs requirements. However, the resolution suggests a purely democratic society in which everyone can vote; it does not specify whether kids can vote or not. With this inconsistency this contention does not stand. I have proven how every part of my opponent's case does not stand while my case is the best resolution.",

            "premise": "Resolved: In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote Value: democratic society Value Criterion: Maximizing political participation Contention 1: A democratic society can not be legitimate if the people in it are not voting. This is because the definition of democracy dictates that we let every competent adult vote. If we bar felons from voting then we are not truly a democracy. Contention 2: Furthermore if we continue to disenfranchise felons then not only are we undemocratic but we are also racist. This is because in America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. Therefore as one can clearly see felon disenfranchisement excludes a whole class of people from the voting process. As stated in my previous statistic the two major minorities that make up the majorities of felons in America are blacks and Hispanics. Due to this the voices of these two groups of people is not generally heard. So if one were to vote neg. this could in effect lead to the genocide of minorities as their voice would be stifled in the government. This proves that supporting felon disenfranchisement supports racism. Contention 3: Not only does felon disenfranchisement supports racism but it can change the result of important elections. Blacks and Hispanics generally vote Democratic. As these minorities make up the majorities of felons felon disenfranchisement favors the white dominated Republican party and skews the results of elections. An example of this would be my state of Florida in the 2004 election. If felons had been allowed to vote there is no way that George Bush would have won the presidency. Though Gore had the popular vote Bush had more electoral votes which enabled him to win. However if felons had been allowed to vote Gore would have had not only the popular vote but the electoral votes necessary to win. Contention 4: Additionally felon disenfranchisement is not truly a punishment. Disallowing felons from voting does nothing correct their behavior or to prevent them from committing a crime again. If anything it further separates them from society. This is injustice for if a man committed a felony in his late teens and is kept from voting from every election each time a new political figure come to power he will have to remember the mistake he made as a teen. He may be a reformed and upstanding member of society yet he will still be unable to vote. For these reason I support the affirmative of this resolution.",

            "premise": "Value- Justice Value Criterion- John Locke's Social Contract \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Martin Luther King Jr. a famous American states here bluntly that injustice anywhere in the world is affecting the rest. In the resolution, \"In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote,\" my value will be justice. According to Random House Unabridged dictionary, justice is the quality of being just; righteousness or moral rightness. Making sure justice is served, we must uphold everyone responsible for their actions. My value criterion is John Locke's Social Contract. This contract is based on giving the government our rights to have the them make choices for us, but when the contract is broken( I.E by breaking the law) you no longer are in the contract, and will automatically loose such rights. In other words, once a person commit's a crime, Locke states that the person has put they're self at war with the entire order of the contract. Locke also states that once they break the law, the person must face retribution from a higher power as a consequence for their actions. Locke emphasizes that truth and justice are the common ties of society. In the resolution, it talks about felons, which are people who have been convicted of a felony. Such people should not be allowed to vote. C1- Knowingly breaking the law, is disrespecting the law itself. When a felon commit's a crime, they know are doing so and are gambling that they won't get caught. They are knowingly breaking the law, showing right away that they have no respect for society or the law in general. Showing no respect for society also goes to show that they don't know how to act responsibly, therefore they should not have the right to vote. Such people obviously have a lack of good judgment to begin with, so why let them vote, when they can't make civil decisions for their selves, let alone their society. Giving felons the right to vote is similar to giving a young child candy after hitting their sibling. You are showing them that it's okay to do so. It is not. Another daily example is a teenager refuses to do his chores. They should automatically get privileges taken away for their actions. The same concept applies to this resolution. Taking away their right to vote is the only way they will learn that taking part in such ways is wrong, and will not be accepted in society. Affirming this resolution is rewarding felons for their actions, which is plainly going against justice and Locke's contract. Negating the resolution is agreeing with Locke that such people are no longer part of society and results in loss of rights preserved for citizens that do so. C2- Disenfranchisement is not too severe. Felons are people who have committed serious crimes. Not something minor like running a stop sign, but a felony. A serious crime such as murder, rape, or robbery, should not be rewarded with the rights everyone else gets. As far as justice goes; making sure justice is served is making sure that people are getting the punishment they deserve, as Locke agrees in his contract. Denying these people their right to vote is one of the only ways we can truly show them that taking part is such ways is wrong. They're taking away other people's human rights such as voting, by committing felonies. Disenfranchisement is the way we should show felons that taking actions upon someone else's rights in any society is wrong. They need to learn, and by taking away their right to vote, we are doing so. For example, a man goes and murders his wife; he is considered a felon. That man should not be allowed to vote in any kind of society. Taking such actions proves that he isn't responsible to begin with. He, not only took his wife's right of life, but he's violating the laws that were laid down for him. If felons cannot be trusted to follow laws already set out for them, they should not have any say so in the laws that are being created. A felon takes away someone else's rights, so they shouldn't have theirs, and should be treated with retribution. This is the only way that justice will be served, is if we hold everyone accountable for their actions and punish them for their doings. Doing such a high costly crime automatically makes them do the time, and loose rights that are saved for law abiding citizens. Dis affirming this resolution is the only way we will achieve equality throughout the world. Jock Locke shows us that in his contract, along with negating this resolution. attack on opposition contention 1; It is hard to say that one is competent when they go against the values that their own society bestowed upon them. Contention 2 attack; In a just democratic society race is never a criteria when determining felons. Also this would leave out an entire class of people, i agree with my opposition but this class is not determined by race, it is determined by actions and this negating this resolution provides a deterrence from committing felonies. Attack on contention 3. My opponent would be one to advocate that if Hitler was convicted that he could also vote because he may have been able to vote for the Nazi party. the simple fact is that they did something wrong to get their punishment. Contention 4 attack. It is a punishment to provide deterrence",

Any given society is better off under a full democracy.\" A democracy is a government where the people of a society choose their own leaders, and laws. So if this sociaty says they don't want felons to vote shouldn't feons not vote. This is part of democracy. Majority rules. To be exact 81.7% of Americans believe that felons should lose their right to vote. My oppenent also spoke of discrimination in that blacks lose their right to vote more than other races.

            "premise": "I apologize for not posting in video/audio form, but i don't have access to a camera at the moment and I promise that my AC is in time. I affirm. I offer the following definitions to clarify the round: Felon: a person who has committed an act deemed illegal by that person's government Democratic Society: Society governed by all citizens using the system of voting Democratic: the ability to have a say in what action is occurring Right: an ability or state you can maintain because a government enforces that ability or state Equality: the quality of being the same in measure, value or status Observation: The resolution states \"felons ought to retain the right...in a democratic society\" This does NOT mean any society we currently are residing in or know of today. The resolution does NOT state that United States felons ought to retain the right to vote, nor that any other specific members of specific societies are relevant to this debate. The value for the round is Human Rights as defined by the UN Declaration of Human Rights. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations released said declaration, setting a standard for all democratic and non-democratic nations everywhere. It has 30 total articles, but for this debate I will focus on the following: \"Article 21, Sub Point 3: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures\" To put it simply, all people should have the right to vote in any governmental election. This also has been clearly acknowledged as a human right. The Criterion is Equality. Democracy is founded upon the principle of equality, since equality shows that all people are of the same value. Democratic acts allow all people to have an EQUAL say in what is occurring. This proves a direct relation to the resolution and therefore is the clear, best choice for today's criterion. Contention 1: \"Felons are still citizens\" Therefore, we cannot rightfully discredit a felon's input on government simply because they have committed a crime. The basic purpose of voting is to gather input from citizens on the issues of their society, and if even one member of that society is a felon, they should still have the right to vote because they are still a citizen, they still are counted in the population and they still experience the results of the election. Furthermore, the commission of a felony does not render a felon incapable of having opinions on other social issues, thus a felon's opinion is still relevant to the society and therefore the felon should retain the right to vote. Because of this, equality is better upheld on the affirmative. Contention 2: \"The Prison system is a punishment system\" All people that are convicted of a felony are given a proper punishment based on the severity of the crime committed. If we were to add a separate and additional punishment to a punishment that they already have served, we are destroying the very system used to judge felons. Adding an addition punishment is destructive of a democratic society because it is neither equal nor democratic, as not all felons have committed the same crime. If we were to negate the resolution, we might as well stick all felons in prison for the rest of their lives because we aren't trusting them to do anything after they have been labeled a felon. Because negating is NOT proportional, equality is better upheld by affirming the resolution. Contention 3: \"Rational Choice Theory\" Rational Choice Theory is the basic process that a person does all the time. It basically shows that citizens only do something that is more beneficial to them than not. In this case, Rational Choice Theory can be applied in the way citizens vote. There is the intense (primary) benefit that each citizen has in an election, (like gay marriage for a homosexual voter or banning abortion for a pro-life voter,) an intrinsic (secondary) benefit, (meaning an issue that the voter has a stance on, but is not high priority) and a voting cost. (Like taking the time to register, standing in line or even filling out the ballot.) Citizens will only vote when the benefits outweigh the costs. The warrants and impacts for this are as follows; affirming allows all voters who have the moral and social standards to suffer the costs of voting in order to cast their vote. Negating however decreases the number of good voters (felon or not) by not retaining their right to vote. Equality is better upheld by the affirmative because all voters are given the ability to cast an equal vote if they choose to. (Meaning any non-voters are creating by choice, not force)",

If you agree that we must start inferring things from the resolution (i.e things that are not implied), bad things start to happen. For example, he says 'post resolution'. If we have to structure debates on things after the resolution, then you must also have to structure such debates on 'pre resolution'.

Before that, they were babies. Does my opponent want to extend the privilege of voting to babies? If you share his reasoning, then you would [Contentions] Cont 1: Retribution \"Felons will...perform their actions in a different society or framework that does not impact... -->This goes directly against his opening arguments. He stated, and I agree, that this action of revoking the freedom to vote is in a democratic framework. Anything else, would be simply unresolutional \"For example, if a felon was convicted of rape, that does not necessarily mean the government has to rape the felon back.\" --> Thank you, that is exactly what I argue. Because my opponent agrees with me, you can extend this contention throughout the round. Because the government cannot treat a consitituent as a moral non-entity (i.e rape them), they must furthermore treat them as a political non entity so the punishment fits the crime and it is not cruel and unusual Cont 2: Legal Consistency \"First off, the first sentence implies that maintaining political rights and the freedom to vote is of utmost greater magnitude than any of the implied correlative comparisons.\" --> Nope, not true. I argue that any system is better of under a perfectly consistent system. We must be uniform and fair in the punishment that is dealt to felons, and voting negative better achieves that. I argue that more intrinsic rights are being taken away, and taking away politcal rights are justified through the uniformity of punishment afforded to prisoners \"As long as there is a net loss of the right to society, the felon is being shunned or punished for their activity\" -->There is no right to society in incarceration. The government puts you in jail BECAUSE you hurt society, and in order to protect society, must restrict all influence of the felon to society, for example, the right to vote Cont 3: Double Standard \"By not upholding the right to vote by the majority of the people and practicing social equality (definition of democracy) you are condoning tyrannistic autonomy\" --> Because my opponent did not attack my first observation, America can be used. So, I argue, would not letting these less than 2% of people vote, still be upholding the right to vote for the 'majority of the people'? Of couse, 98% is a majority --> The definition of democracy is not social equality. Although it is portrayed here in America, the two terms do not go hand and hand. Also, it is impossible to give social equality through incarceration. There is no punishment without rights being taken away. Besides, doesn't communism have more social equality than, I don't know, democracy? \"Not all of what felons convict are 'the most brazen way'. Poor Generalization\" --> Yes, they have defied society, the government, and everything society and the government has put forth. Because there are only two types of crime, misdeamenors and felonies, someone who commits a felony would be breaking the law in a more brazen way I will now move on to attack my opponents case Value: Equality --> Justice is implied by the resolution, and higher on a resolutional scale. Because we are dealing with the punishment of felons, we must be just (giving each their due), not necessarily equal. For example, raping somebody does not warrant equal punishment as insider trading does. Thus, justice is the 'higher standard' VC: Democracy --> implied more by the resolution than his value, however, a just government is not always democratic and a democratic govenrment is not always just. Because I have proven his Value Criteria to be categorically untrue, then mine is superior. Maximizing Fairness is vital to a just democracy [Contentions] \"Great way to dehumanize them by calling them parasites\" --> Do I even dare argue this, for he defends his whole contention with me using an anology. But, because I deserve to win this debate, I shall --> a parasite is anything that impedes a necessary process. While felons are incarcerated, they become a burden to the State. Because they impede the process of the state trying to progress the rest of society, they are, indeed, parasites. \"A felony inherently hurts society and therefore government\" --> I stand by this argument. Any felony committed causes pain to a member of society (society). The government is also hurt, because one of its constituents was inflicted pain upon. A governments job is to promote hapinness to its constituents, anything on the contrart would then inflict pain Thank you, and it is for those reasons that I negate the resolution",

            "premise": "Thank you for the challenge and good luck. Before beginning, there is a piece of evidence of his that needs updating. It is actually 5.3 million people that can not vote because of felonies, not 3.9 like stated in his last speech. However, this is 2006 and the number may be even greater now. http://www.time.com... My case/his case\u2026 I oppose: Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. I. Value- Fairness Within this round, you will see how it is not fair to give equal voice to someone who has kept their trust with the society, and someone who has not. In essence, when someone commits a felony, they deserve to lose the right to vote. Also, you will see that in order to get a FAIR decision, you must eliminate the felon vote. Please cross apply his point about how there 5.3 million felons who do not have the right to vote. Do you really want that overwhelming factor to decide most every election for the rest or your life? II. Criterion- Just Deserts Just Deserts is basically giving people what they justly deserve. In this round, you will see that people don't deserve the right to vote after they have committed a felony. Why? Because a right is something you have until you lose it (like gun rights)\u2026 And since voting decides who will run our country, it is too important to put in the hands of felons (5.3 MILLION). Give not only the felons, but also the society what they deserve and vote CON. ============================================= Since my arguments go so well against his, I'm just going to attack his case right now. Against Value- Equality --> I immediately challenge my opponent to say when we treat any felons any differently than a regular citizen. EVERYONE was given citizenship and the FELONS lost it. If a regular citizen committed a felony tomorrow, then he/she would be treated EQUALY and would also lose his/her right to vote. In other words, HIS value is flowed to the CON side! Against Criterion- Democracy --> Democracy still exists whether or not you vote pro OR con. However, on the con side, it exists in a much better form\u2026 Take for example, the 5.3 million that currently can not vote. Let's say that a candidate was up that was willing to be EXTREMELY less harsh against criminals. The extra 5.3 million votes that he would get would create would be enough to change ANY election in his/her favor. But is that what we want to be deciding our elections? Another angle to look at is the fact that more candidates would begin to be more persuaded toward being nice to criminals since there would be much more votes that they could get (since politicians are nothing without the voters). Definitions seem fine\u2026 I will just use common knowledge from the judges for definition unless abuse comes from my opponent (or even from me). Against Contention I: His first contention is completely useless because we will always have a democracy regardless of if felons can vote or not. A democracy is something that gives people a choice, and the felons already made their choice of going against our society, and because of that, they do not deserve the right to vote for people who help (or hinder) our society. Against Contention II: 5.3 MILLION voters would put the election into the hands of not only criminals, but FELONS!!!!! Politicians would inevitably reach out to these voters by crafting their views to be likeable by them. Against Contention III: The problem with his quote is that we're not dealing with voting qualification, but DISqualification (which is two totally different things). Then he goes on to say that this will lead to a lot of people not being able to vote. Well, this law has been around for a long time and it hasn't been blown out of proportions. It still only restricts felons. No discrimination at all, men, women, white, black, Republican, Democrat, all felons can't vote. And as far as the amendments go, realize that it says that we can't DENY these people the right to vote if (then it lists various things) but NONE of them have to do with laws they have broken. In the end, felons ought to NOT receive the right to vote because they broke a serious enough law to lose the right. If someone abuses a gun, we take it away from them for good reason. If someone abuses society (through becoming a felon), then we take away their right to vote. It's only fair because we DON'T want felons to run our society. Please vote con\u2026 Thank you!",

An ex-felon is \"one who has successfully completed their sentence and re-enters society.\" --> I have two responses: First, my opponenet never provides a direct link for this site, and from my research the UN does not define it. Second, even if you don't buy this response, simply use logic. It is impossible for the UN to define the word \"felon\" because most nations have abandoned the use of the word, and ergo make no legal distinctions between felons and misdemeanors, such as the US. Not one definition online or any dictionary I have found defines the word 'retain' in the future tense. For example, merriam webster defines retain as \"to keep in possession or use\", therefore implying not only the present tense but the constanst keeping of a right. --> I have two responses: First, turn this against my opponenet. If he believes this should be the definition of retain for the round, he himself does not uphold it because he never categorically proves the resolution false under this pretense. Second, under LD this definition is null and void isnce it was put into the round not as a formal definition (i.e. in the case) but in a rebuttal. Therefore, my formal definition is superior. V: Justice --> Fine, I concede this value. However, if he does not achieve the \"democratic society\" burden within the resokution, he should fail for the debate. Value Criterion: Maximization of Fairness --> My opponent makes a crucial mistake with this VC First, he never defines what fairness is. Second, I will use Rawl's understanding of fairness which is the idea of the first principle, which implies maximizing rights for everyone. Ergo, maximizing the right to vote. 1. Retribution a - This point is flawed because I have already shown why there is no distinction. Furthermore, if you don't buy that argument, ex-felon is still a sub-category of a felon, thus can be an implied burden of the resolution. b - My opponent never warrants what he just said. However, lets go back to my point about proportionality. It would only be proportionate if it effected someones voting rights. For example, a felon commits insider trading, obviously this felony does not hurt anther's voting right, thus it is not proport9ioante to disenfranchise. c - My opponenet doesn't get my argument. I am saying that he dejustifies all punishment because all punishment treats someone else as a moral non-entity. Furthermore, my opponenet never warrants once in his case why \"moral non-entities exist\" and why it impacts a decision of the resolution. 2. Legal Consistency a - My opponent doesn't understand my argument. Even if it is 48/50 states, there still would be no legal consistency because all states have di8fferent disenfranchisement laws. [My case] Value: Democratic Society --> Basically my opponenet argues that his value is superior. However, given that I conceded his value, he still needs to achieve a democratic society because it is a burden in the resolution. He also brings up children. That's the point, no democratic society is the ideal democratic society, however the aff's case reaches that standard better then the neg. 1. Contestation of existing values --> Drop all my opponents responses since I am not arguing that they are being stigmatized. I am arguing that disenfranchisement is a mechanism for not allowing contesting values within society. Basically, it oppresses other peoples views. --> Since he didn't attack the idea of my point, extend it for the entire debate. If he tries to respond drop his attacks immediately. [Clash] 1. The only main clash is the definitions. I.e. felons and retain. However, I clearly win this debate from my above responses.",

            "premise": "My sincere condolences are extended to opponent, as surely only a crisis of major propositions would have prevented him from typing the word \"Continued\" some time within the three day response period. Proponents for felons retaining the right to vote often suppose that withholding the right must be either punishment or retribution. Such is not the case. We imprison serial killers not only on grounds of punishment or retribution, we imprison them to prevent them from committing similar bad acts. Depriving a felon of the right to vote is unlikely to be a significant punishment to discourage criminal behavior. Even as retribution it would be trivial. However, removing the right to vote prohibits the felon from committing the bad act of voting for a candidate because the candidate is likely to weaken the justice system. As an example, consider the famous Willie Horton case http://forerunner.com... that came up during the 1988 presidential campaign. Michael Dukakis opposed George H.W.Bush. Willie Horton was a convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. However, as governor of Massachusetts Dukakis permitted Horton to be let out of prison on a furlough program that Dukakis thought would aid rehabilitation. During a furlough, Horton murdered another person. As governor, Dukakis commuted so many sentences for first-degree murder that the time actually served for life without parole was 19 years. (op. cit.) I have no doubt that Governor Dukakis was sincere in his belief that leniency leads to rehabilitation. However, felons will certainly want leniency regardless of whether rehabilitation occurs or not. The recidivism rate proves that most often it does not occur. We may therefore suppose that allowing felons to vote would sway close elections to the side of leniency, particularly when issues other than the justice system dominate the campaign. Felons should not have the right to vote in the interests of pursuing a life of crime. Suppose that there are no criminal justice issues evident in a campaign. We know that many convicted felons are characteristically averse to working for a living. They are therefore likely to vote for whichever candidate promises the largest amount of unqualified government benefits. This is also contrary to the interests of ordinary voters, who are likely to be willing to help the poor, but unlikely to want to support criminals. For these reasons, the resolution should be rejected.",

There is no act more wretched than stealing. Where when dealing with a democratic society which strives for justice by means of considering its consequences one must negate the following resolution resolved: In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote. Ones sole value is that of punishment supported through a value criterion of retributive justice. The following definitions need be offered to earn weight in the round: steal, retributive justice, and punishment. Where steal is defined as the deprivation of something, in this case steal refers to the taking or depriving of others rights. And retributive justice is defined as a matter of giving those who violate human rights law and commit crimes against humanity their \"just deserts.\" Punishment is thought to reinforce the rules of international law and to deny those who have violated those rules any unfair advantages. Together with restorative justice, retribution is concerned with restoring victims and offenders to their rightful position Punishment in its most simplified form is constituted by imposing some burden or by some form of deprivation or by withholding some benefit. Specifying the deprivation as a deprivation of rights is a helpful reminder that a crime is (among other things) a violation of the victim's rights, and the harm thus done is akin to the kind of harm a punishment does. Deprivation has no covert or subjective reference; punishment is an objectively judged loss or burden imposed on a convicted offender. Which is why we must look to retribution to justify the act of stealing or depriving of the right to vote. Its merely a more sophisticated version of an eye for an eye mentality. Brief overview The purpose of imprisoning felons is to remove them from society because they've been deemed a harmful influence. Allowing them to vote (the sole purpose of which is to influence government and therefore society) would be counterproductive to imprisonment. This is why for the following reasons you must oppose the resolution Con 1 Felons are considered less trustworthy. Full rights are often not completely restored following conviction. society considers convicts, even those who have completed their prison terms, to be less trustworthy than non-convicted citizens. For example, federal law prohibits the possession of a firearm for anyone indicted for or convicted of a felony punishable by at least one year in prison. Also under federal law, anyone who has a \"charge pending\" or has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more cannot serve on a jury. So if someone who has a \"charge pending\" against him is deemed incapable of sitting in judgment of the fate of a single litigant, it hardly seems unreasonable to say that someone convicted of a felony cannot help shape the fate of a city, a state, or the entire nation. Even outside the realm of civic rights and privileges, society recognizes that an exconvict may be less reliable than others. For example, employers routinely ask prospective employees whether they have been arrested (let alone convicted of a felony) because they suspect that the mere fact of an arrest may be an indication of untrustworthiness. Where in a democratic society untrustworthiness is not a value to be upheld. Con2 Felon disenfranchisement is justified by \"distribution.\" according to the theory of Universalizability: \"whatever is right (or wrong) in one situation is right (or wrong) in any relevantly similar situation\" (Harris et al., p. 37). Universalizability as described above is a basic logical feature of all moral discourse. That is, in making a distinctively moral judgment, you commit yourself to its universalizability. If in making a judgment you refuse to recognize its universalizability, then you are actually refusing to make a moral judgment. Essentially it's a principle of consistency. Where sense it is consistent and applied to all cases its in turn just. Under the affirmative they have to say felons who have committed voters fraud should be able to vote. Con 3 Requirements We don't let everyone vote; children, noncitizens and the mentally incompetent don't. Voting requires certain minimum, objective standards of trustworthiness, loyalty and responsibility, and those who have committed serious crimes against their fellow citizens don't meet those standards. If you refer to the meaning of mentally incompetent you can see that incompetent means one who cant weigh morally right or wrong, thus is deprived of the right to vote. Whereas if you apply that understanding to a felon you can clearly see they were not able to weigh the difference between morally right and wrong, which deems them as mentally incompetent which limits them to the right to vote. Because to participate in self-government, you must be willing to accept the rule of law and even more so understand it.",

For example, in California [1] California \u2013 Voting rights are restored after parole is completed and no longer incarcerated. Anyways, I will argue why Felons shouldn't have the right to vote. Contention 1; Dishonesty and Poor Character. [2] \"We don't let children vote, for instance, or noncitizens, or the mentally incompetent. Why? Because we don't trust them and their judgment... So the question is, do criminals belong in that category? And I think the answer is clearly yes. People who commit serious crimes have shown that they are not trustworthy.\" People who are felons have committed crimes and have taken other rights of people. Such as committing murder and taking away an innocent life. As my opponent has stated above \"\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d When a felon takes can take a life, and the happiness of that person, and the happiness of that family. What gives that felon to have rights that every American bestows? \"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. When someone commits a felon, they should have some rights taken away. Voting privileges should be taken away as well. [3] \" Children, non-citizens and the mentally incompetent can't vote because of standards involving trustworthiness and responsibility. The same requirements should apply to felons\" Contention 2; [2] Congressional Authority over Voting \"Most prominently, the 14th Amendment makes felon voting a state prerogative, not a federal one...\" According to section 2 of the 14th Amendment, it's okay to take away a felons right to vote [4] \"Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants states the authority to deny voting rights to anyone with a criminal conviction, and it is up to the states to determine their own restoration process if they choose to enact one.\" The 1st Amendment doesn't state \"Every U.S citizen no matter what the background, has the right to vote.\" The 1st Amendment doesn't give that right to everybody, instead they give the states the choice. This is to show, Felons don't have the right to vote, it's not a right. By the 14th Amendment, Felons don't have the right to vote depending on the States choice. This Amendment clearly shows, it's not taking away a right. What should happen. [5] \" Your July 16 editorial \u201cDisenfranchised Felons\u201d asserts that the only reason not to let felons vote is \u201cto stigmatize them or to continue punishing them.\u201d To the contrary, the fundamental reason we do not let felons vote is that we have certain minimum, objective standards of responsibility, trustworthiness and loyalty to our laws that must be met before someone can participate in the sacred enterprise of self-government. So we don\u2019t let children vote or the mentally incompetent or noncitizens \u2014 or those who have committed serious crimes against other people. The right to vote can be restored to felons, but it should be done carefully and case by case, to ensure that the person has really turned over a new leaf. To put it another way: If you are not willing to follow the law, you cannot demand the right to elect those who make the law.\" Felons should be able to vote once they have turned over a new leaf and have shown over a span of time that they are capable to vote in a trustworthy matter.

            "premise": "His case: Overview: The major flaws of his argumentations are his numerous assumptions. From the very beginning of this debate, he frames it under a \"just\" society or attaining \"justice.\" However, the way he reasons to attaining justice is the implications of the resolution and the implication he correlates with democracy. Since the resolution is framed under a predicated democracy, we must view this procedurally: there is no legitimate basis for any preferences to be rejected. He offers no brightline as to what is the universal concept of \"just\" or attaining justice is. This means that under the democratic framework, justice can never be attained. His definition of \"democracy\" indicates governed by the people. Inversely though\u2014the majority of the people's decision or consensus is what determines a decision rather than whether it is \"just or not\" Observation 2: Felons and exfelons are both inevitably put into society. Because exfelons are a product of once-felons, the debate should centralize around HOW felons should be conducted in the status quo and post-resolution. Contention 1: Retribution The first line of his contention states that it is giving punishment that is \"deserved\" or punishment that fits the crime, but there can never be a clear brightline as to what is \"deserved\" or \"not\" Felons will use this non-delineated brightline of what is deserved or not as a loophole to perform their actions in a different society or framework that doesn't impact the magnitude of \"deserved\" as badly as the other one does. The denotation and predication of this contention is also off since it assumes that the punishment of the government to the felon has to be the equivalent of what the felon did. For example, if a felon was convicted of rape, that does NOT necessarily mean the government has to rape the felon back. Instead, the focus should be on the magnitude of the punishment towards the felon. For the magnitude of the punishment, he assumes that we must ALWAYS treat EVERY felon as a political non-entity. This is flawed for two subpoints a) It assumes that all felons are convicted of crimes that need the magnitude of dehumanization and b) there is one alternative or one type of punishment that is to be ultimately attained by these felons. It fails to regard other types of punishment that would sever the impact of how rehabilitation into society could be performed. 2) Flaw- \"Why, then, should criminals be allowed to maintain their political rights and the freedom to vote? There are many rights which are more basic taken away from the individual during his imprisonment?\" Let's take a look at this sentence and thematic concept. First off, the first sentence implies that maintaining political rights and the freedom to vote is of utmost greater magnitude than any of the implied correlative comparisons. The immediate sentence after that then goes on to state that there are many MORE BASIC rights taken away. Exactly, since there are so many of these basic rights taken away from the felon during their imprisonment, the magnitude of taking away the right to vote or the right to possess societal importance is unnecessary and past the prerequisite of basic rights being taken away. Since there are basic rights taken away, then there is a net loss of the felon's rights in society. As long as there is a net loss of the right to society, the felon is being shunned or punished for their activity. Cross apply Contention 1 Subpoint A\u2014it does a good job of explaining how the loss of the right to vote is an ADDITIONAL consequence pass the prerequisites. \"Other than serving a retributive function, disenfranchisement certainly does not meet the goals of incapacitation or deterrence. Individuals who are not already deterred from crime by the threat of incarceration are unlikely to be swayed by the prospect of losing their right to vote. \" Look further into my contention as well it also places an impact on the unnecessary removal of the right to vote: \"Once we begin to impose character requirements, voting slips back from being a right for all Americans to a privilege granted by the powerful.\" In other words, to prevent a tyranny or autonomy by one, centralized force, instilling the right to vote to these felons is what keeps the democracy upheld. The syntax he also uses in this contention with \"fair\" and \"basic\" ties hand in hand with the overview argument\u2014it's an assumed value that can never be reached by universal consensus or by his own definition of democracy. Contention 3- Double Standard This contention is the epitome of too many assumptions. Look to his first line \"essentially condoning violent acts.\" This is flawed for two reasons a)Look to Contention 1, Subpoint A \u2013 Turn: by not upholding the right to vote to the majority of the people and practicing social equality (definition of democracy) you are condoning tyrannistic autonomy b)If we were to look at his own value justice, by negating something on the \"just\" reason or the just way wouldn't necessarily be the equivalence of condoning the negative option. For example, if I didn't want to give money to a poor robber, I would not be condoning poverty, but rather acting on a just decision \u2013that giving money to a robber or burglar is not just. Turns his own value Look to his last sentence \"By affirming the resolution, you are saying that people who brake the law in the most brazen way, by committing a felony, would be better than a law-abiding citizen because they broke the law and still have the same amount of rights.\" This is flawed for four reasons a)If they had the same amount of rights for something they committed, they would not be SUPERIOR to law-abiding citizens but rather the right that both are instilled with is of great magnitude to the society/democracy b)They would not have the same amount of rights. Your contention 2 tells me that they are revoked \"certain, basic rights\" c)Not all of what felons convict are \"the most brazen way\". Poor generalization d)Extend/Cross Apply my previous argument that different states/societies/frameworks have different punishments/retributions. Different types of behaviors/performances in different areas equate to differentiating magnitudes of what they actually did. My case: The value debate 1)Great way to read my value out of context. I'm not talking about any attainment of equality during incarceration nor the magnitude of punishment. The value is there to support the prepositional phrase of the resolution \"in a democratic society\" a democratic society usurps the idea of \"equality\" or social equality (refer to my definition). To sustain social equality, there has to be a uniform approach to treating these felons post and pre convictions 2)No warrant to dejustification. C/A no standard of \"just\" The criterion debate 1)His definition never ergo-s \"protecting society\" Rather, look to my uniformed definition\u2014the practicing of social equality and the uniform approach to felons pre and post conviction 2)Contradicting. The first part of his argument states that maximization of fairness better upholds justice. Then he goes on to state that democracy is not always just. Flawed for two reasons a.No brightline to just or justice b.No brightline to what is \"fair\" or \"not\". If the universal ruling of the people turned out to be \"unfair\" would it yield to be \"fair\"? Contentions: 1)Great way to dehumanize them by calling them parasites 2)Not \"more democracy\" but a comparison of the magnitude/quality of how you uphold the ideal 3)Children do not have the right to vote. This argument seems to go nowhere, but if it's going where I think look to contention 1, subpoint b -\uf0e0 productivity is checked by the participation in voting and activities regarding the quality of society 4)\"A felony inherently hurts society\" and \"therefore government\" Cross apply my rebuttal on his contention 3 about the extra topical assumpti",

            "premise": "I accept my opponent's value of Democracy. A key note of democracy is majority rule. Large groups get more representation and therefore have more power. Felons are not a large group in the United States and therefore should be subject to the will of the non-felons. Opponent's VC-Maximizing rights This better fits the con side. Felons represent 1.6% of the population. By not voting the 98.4% of the non-felon population of the United States has more rights and there for the maximization of rights occurs. 98.4% vs. 1.6% who should get the rights. My VC is rationality. If you stop, sit down, and think about what a felon is you will realize why they should not vote. Over half of felons are drug abusers. 49% of people in prison are there for a violent offence. They are generally less educated. These people are rapists, child molesters, drug lords, thieves, and murders. Do we really want these people to have a say about what goes on in this country. I will first go over my opponents arguments then precede to my own. C1. My opponent said, \"If we allow this minority group (felons) to be disenfranchised, what is to stop us from doing it to others?\" This is a simple question; the Constitution. Amendment XIV specifically says states have the right to stop criminals from voting. The other Amendments also make it impossible for other minority groups to be disenfranchised. Disenfranchisement is not an issue. C2. The felons don't have a right to vote in states that don't allow it, and in order for any other rights to be violated; the rights of others besides felons would have to be violated as well. In America we have constitutional safeguards against this. Everyone is guaranteed basic rights in the United States. A.Voting does not help felons re-enter society. 67.5% of all felons are sent back to prison within three years of their imprisonment (US Bureau of Justice Statistics). This rate is very consistent across all 50 states. There is no difference between states that let felons vote and states that don't. Voting has no impact on recidivism. B.States have the right to restrict voters based on their criminal records (amendment XIV, section II) Again they made the choice, they knew the consequences, and now they have their voting rights rebuked. It's part of their sentence. C3. If you go back to my criterion by stopping felons from voting we are not crippling it we are strengthening it. There are 5.3 million felons that cannot vote. This is 5.3 million uneducated, drug addicted, parasites on society that we don't have to worry about screwing this country up. In order to have a strong democracy you need educated, people that are going to make the best choice for their country. Felons don't meet this requirement. These are my random arguments against that don't rebuttal my opponent's contentions 1-Harm Principal/social contract It is acceptable to restrict ones liberty when they have infringed on the rights of others. Being a citizen of the United States binds you to this social contract. If you break the laws you must suffer the consequences. Losing voting rights is one of these consequences. 2-Maintain Order Because of their actions we know what criminals support. The question is do we want these morals reflected in our laws? By giving felons representation we are essentially giving them the power to make laws. This would result in a mess. What kind of laws are pedophiles going to try and push? What do you think drug addicts will want? This also can result with problems of political corruption. For these reasons I negate",

            "premise": "As stated by Former Supreme court justice the late Thurgood Marshall \"It is doubtful...whether the state can demonstrate either a compelling or rational policy interest in denying former felons the right to vote. [Ex-offenders] have fully paid their debt to society. They are as much affected by the actions of government as any other citizen, and have as much of a right to participate in governmental decision-making. Furthermore, the denial of a right to vote to such persons is hindrance to the efforts of society to rehabilitate former felons and convert them into law-abiding and productive-- (dissent of Richardson v Ramirez) Because I agree With Justice Marshall I affirm the resolution that in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote.\" My Core Value will be that Of Justice defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"the administration of law or some other authority according to the principles of just behavior and treatment (oxford) My Criterion Is Preservation of Democracy. Preservation of Democracy means to do what is best to preserve the democratic process and democracy itself. This fulfils Justice because in a democratic society, justice is achieved when the people run the society and everybody has an equal voice. John Rawls Believed The three most fundamental ideas political culture of a democratic society are that citizens are free and equal, and that society should be a fair system of cooperation. 1st contention It must be agreed that racial prejudice in society is a fundamentally unjust principle. Now I would like to point out that the judiciary statistically is prejudice against ethnic minorities. Blacks comprise 13 percent of the national population, but 30 percent of people arrested, 41 percent of people in jail,and 49 percent of those in prison.. Nationally, blacks are incarcerated at 8.2 times the rate of whites. That is, a black person is 8.2 times more likely to be in prison than a white person. Further around 70% of all felons exonerated on DNA evidence are black. So not only are black overrepresented in prison, but there is evidence that the judiciary tends to be racially prejudice. 13% of all Black males are disenfranchised making for 1/3 of the total disenfranchised population. 13% is also just a national Average. In Florida and Alabama 31% of all Blacks are permanently disenfranchised. Nationally 2% of the Population is disenfranchised, However, 13.1% of Adult Black Men are disenfranchised. As African Americans are an ethnic Minority it makes no sense for them to represent a prison majority. Also as I have said many of them have been wrongfully convicted so that a disproportionate amount of Blacks are unfairly losing their democratic right to vote without even having committed a crime. This is No way Is Just and does nothing to preserve the democratic process and democracy. 2nd Contention The United Nations released a \"Standard Minimum Rule for the Treatment of Prisoners\" that stated \"The treatment of prisoners should emphasize not their exclusion from the community but their continuing part in it\" This standard establishes that it is the best interest of society to fully rehabilitate ex-prisoners back into society because it provides for the betterment of that society. According to statistics taken in 1998 a total of 3.9 million adults, or 2.0 percent of the eligible voting population, is currently or permanently disenfranchised as a result of a felony conviction. Also around 30% of all eligible black males can not vote in election due to felon disenfranchisement. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Six states, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, New Mexico, Virginia, and Wyoming, exclude from the vote more than 4 percent of their adult population. And each Florida and Texas Disenfranchise more than 600,000 people. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Lets look at the democratic implications of felon Disenfranchisement In 1996 the number of disenfranchised eligible voters in Florida was 647,100. In the 2000 Elections George Bush won Florida By 1725 Votes. The state of Florida has 27 Electoral votes. In that election George Bush won the presidency by 5 electoral votes. If all 647,100 of these Voters were re-enfranchised and 1726 more of those voters cast ballots in favor of Al Gore than in favor of George Bush the presidential election would have turned another way. So, by disenfranchising voters, Florida brought down the potential voter turnout, and by doing so restricted the democratic process. Because Disenfranchisement Restricts the democratic process it cannot be just as it does not help to preserve Democracy. The fact that these voters were disenfranchised caused a serious lapse in democracy, and therefore did no justice. Because Disenfranchisement restricts the democratic process the resolution is a just principle. 3rd Contention Among democratic countries the united states may have the strictest felon disenfranchisement laws. We are the only known democracy in which felons who have either fully completed or been released from, their sentence are still permanently disenfranchised. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \"Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives\u2026\" This Document establishes basic human rights in governments internationally and states quite clearly that every citizen has an innate right to take part and vote in elections. Because Felon disenfranchisement does not respect this basic right then it is an unjust principle that in no way, provides for the preservation of democracy. If a country can decide it can break any universal code as it please it would not be in the best interests of society and would not in any way preserve the democratic process. Conclusion: Because, as I have proved, the idea of Felon Disenfranchisement does not promote the best for society in the form of the preservation of democracy and the creation of justice, the reverse must also be true. If Felons were re-enfranchised it would strengthen the democratic process and would be the most just solution because it preserves democracy.",

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting this debate and posting a timely response. Also thank you for the link to the documentary, I watched it (parts one and two) and found it very insightful and although it did reinforce a few of the points you made I do find it disturbing that you are willing to form opinions off the basis of one documentary showing one situation. The people in that documentary are pre-trial, meaning that despite the fact that many have been there for years they have not yet served their debt to society. The purpose of being sentenced and serving time in prison is to over come these issues that they have dealing with normal members of society. Is it true that many of these felons will be released with the same immaturity shown here? Absolutely, but more than anything this points to a flaw in our justice system and our ability to rehabilitate our citizens. This is not grounds for denying them the right to vote. You also said that we do not let children vote. This is true and we do this for very good reasons. But we do let them vote when they no longer are classified as children. This is similar to having been released from prison. Upon serving your sentence it is assumed that you have taken the time in prison to think about your mistakes and learn from them, which is very similar to a child turning eighteen. After serving in prison you are supposed to be released and join society. Part of this means taking on the responsibility's that children face when turning into adults, including the responsibility of voting. Another point you made was that released inmates would 'manipulate our judicial and election system to their own corrupt means'. By saying this you are bringing up a point you had made earlier about felons having a 'pathological hatred for justice' which is simply not true. The majority of inmates do not 'hate' justice. When released many felons become one hundred percent normal citizens, with political opinions formed similar to the way that you and I form ours. And another point to be made about them 'manipulating' the justice system is that it would be virtually impossible. Released felons account for somewhere around two percent of the United States, so even if all of them had this hatred for justice that you mentioned (which they don't) it would simply not make a dent in our elections. My final point for this round is I think my most important. One of the ideals that this country was founded on was 'No taxation without representation'. Upon being released from prison, felons are supposed to incorporate themselves into society, find a job, and pay taxes. One of the reasons that slogan exists is so the citizens could have a say as to where their tax dollars were being directed. Taxing felons and denying them this right is unconstitutional and immoral. There are many people in the United States who did some regrettable act when they were young, served time and upon being released found a job, and for dozens of years have been respectable members of society including paying their taxes. Should we deny them their right to vote upon some stupid thing they did that long ago?",

            "premise": "I'm terribly sorry my opponent missed his time on the actual round. It's perfectly ok with me that you posted them into the comments portion (and I ask that voters pay absolutely no attention to that in deciding their vote). Lets open with some refuutes on my case and then further strengthen my side of today's debate. >>>\"First off, you're assuming taht the convicted rapist is not sorry and is still malicious. Secondly, you're under the misconceived notion that someone who has a history of rape, can vote for someone who will rape america.\"~ Me Yes, I might be making some assumptions. Forgive me if I give the benefit of the doubt to law-abiding citizens. How dastardly of me.~ You --More like, \"forgive me if a few million felons lose the right to vote.\" >>>\" There is no harm that can come from a rapist, murderer, or thief voting because they can only vote on something that's productive for the society. After all, we let ex-convicts marry, reproduce, buy beer, own property and drive. \"~Me False analogy, because the felon's decision to drink beer, get married etc. doesn't affect the rest of society.~You --Does it matter if the felon is affecting society as long as they are affecting it in a positive manner? >>>\"If we thought criminals could never be reformed, we wouldn't let them out of prison in the first place. \"~Me They can be reformed, but I'm assuming they're not reformed, until they prove otherwise.~You Problem, how do they get the chance if you don't give it to them? How can you say, \"prove you are reformed,\" but then give no chance? We give prison sentances and let people out based on them being reformed. Keep in mind, when a persn committs a felony, they're ALWAYS a felon. You're saying this person should never gain the right to vote because they haven't proven they're reformed? Then why let them out of prison in the first place? >>> \"The fact that you don't want people with different opinions to vote, is outragious! The whole purpose of voting is to weigh all opinions!\"~Me Again, we already censor certain opinions that we deem immature or unfit, such as children's and mentally incompetent's. And again, the readers need to ask themself if the forgers and drug dealers are fit to decide your neighborhood's policeman.~You --Problem here is, these people we're talking about here aren't children nor are they mentally incompetent. Another problem here is that you think they'll be choosing policeman. These people will be voting on bills, representatives, senators, presidents, etc (all of which are for our benefit). The police Acadamy picks police officers. Seeing as how these senators, bills, and representatives will affect these felons (especially the felons that are out of prison) they should give their opinion on the issue. What harm does this have on society? Absolutely none. They are still forced to obey by the law after they get out of prison and still forced to pay taxes like everyother citizen, only difference is, they have a scar in their past. Note I said their past. Meaning they've served the due punishment for their crime ALREADY. What purpose then is there to disenfranchise the felon after he's rehabilitated? Lets take drug charges (which you speak of) for example. Now, idk the exact point where a certain ammount of drugs becomes a felony, but what makes you think someone who is a gram above the felony mark has worse judgement on voting for a president than someone who is a gram under the felony mark? Better yet, seeing as how Presidents have to meet a certain minimum to run for president (meaning there is no BAD choice), what makes you think they will be worse at picking a president then any other citizen? You must see that we are excluding these people solely on the purpose of them having a different opinion than us. Now, in an instance when these people can ACTUALLY hurt us, of course it's different, but if the worst that can happen is something that is STILL productive for society, what's the problem. Put it this way> Lets say that there is candidate A and B for any bill, governor, president, senator, mayor, reppresentative etc. Now, there are going to be non-felons who pick both A and B. What makes you think that if a felon picks either A or B that it will be detrimental to our society? Voting may very well not be inalienable in most societies such as monarchies and dictatorships, but in a democratic society, yes, it is inalienable. A way you can look at this is, take away what you're arguing is inalienable or not and see if the subject being argued upon, is the same. If it is the same without the subject, it's not needed. However, if without the subjetc it is something completely different, it is essential and inalienable. What is a democratic society without voting? Or Better yet, is a democratic society a democratic society without the right to vote? Of course not, in seeing this, you see that it is essential to have the right to vote if you're going to have an actual democratic society. I ask my opponent and audience again [...] What is a democratic society, without the right to vote?",

Also who's criterion came out to be superior and best fulfilled the Core Value that came out superior.(sorry this is a bad explanation) Opponent: I ask only one thing and that is some experience with LD style debate(essentially how it works and the structure) As stated by Former Supreme court justice the late Thurgood Marshall \"It is doubtful...whether the state can demonstrate either a compelling or rational policy interest in denying former felons the right to vote. [Ex-offenders] have fully paid their debt to society. They are as much affected by the actions of government as any other citizen, and have as much of a right to participate in governmental decision-making.

John Rawls Believed That Justice was created in a Democratic Society when citizens are free and equal, and that society is a fair system of cooperation. Justice is the best core value for this debate because the resolution specifies a democratic society and the goal of every democratic society is justice also the reason a society is democratic is they believe it to be the most just form of government. The Criterion Is Preservation of Democracy. Preservation of Democracy means to do what is best to preserve the democratic process and democracy itself. This means not only allowing everyone to participate in governmental decisions but listening to the voices of everyone. A democracy is beyond a simple majority rule system it means also to listen to the minorities such as felons. This is the most relevant to the resolution because again the resolution specifies democracy and for that society to exist we must work to preserve it. This ties in with my core value of justice because by allowing felons to vote we are ensuring a free, equal and cooperative society and therefore creating justice. Definitions: Democracy: the belief in freedom and equality between people, or a system of government based on this belief, in which power is either held by elected representatives or directly by the people themselves Right: a Moral or legal entitlement to have something (oxford) Ought: to indicate a desirable or expected state(oxford) 1st Contention\u2014Democratic Perfection and Maximization of Rights The creation of justice, by preserving the democratic society, is the pathway towards the achievement of the perfect democracy. Democratic perfection is the highest state of being for a democratic society and is created when the full possibilities and potentials of living in a democracy flow to each and every member of that society. If you take the right to vote from any segment of that citizenry you are automatically depriving everybody else of the possibility of that ideological state. As said by former Supreme court Justice Hugo Black \"No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.\" Therefore the right to vote must be protected in a democratic society along with all other rights. So if we take the right to vote from any member we are harming the entirety of society. Look at it like a piece of fabric, if it is whole is cannot be easily broken, you can tear at it but it will not break. But if there is the smallest of holes, there is a weakness from which the fabric can be ripped in two. By disenfranchising felons you are putting that whole in the fabric of the democratic society and weakening the entire structure. By damaging just that part you are endangering the whole. Because it substantially weakens democracy felon disenfranchisement does not create justice, therefore proving the resolution to be a Just principle. 2nd Contention\u2014Impact on the democratic process The United Nations released a \"Standard Minimum Rule for the Treatment of Prisoners\" that stated \"The treatment of prisoners should emphasize not their exclusion from the community but their continuing part in it\" This standard establishes that it is the best interest of society to fully rehabilitate ex-prisoners back into society because it provides for the betterment of that society Approximately 4.7 million adults are disenfranchised or 2.0 percent of the eligible voting population. Lets look at the democratic implications of felon Disenfranchisement In 1996 the number of disenfranchised eligible voters in Florida was 647,100. In the 2000 Elections George Bush won Florida By 1725 Votes. The state of Florida has 27 Electoral votes. In that election George Bush won the presidency by 5 electoral votes. If all of these Voters were re-enfranchised and 1726 more of those voters cast ballots in favor of Al Gore Rather than George Bush the presidential election would have turned another way. So, by disenfranchising voters, Florida brought down the potential voter turnout, and by doing so restricted the democratic process by impacting not only the country but world politics. The fact that these voters were disenfranchised caused a serious lapse in democracy, and therefore did no justice. Because Disenfranchisement restricts the democratic process the resolution is a just principle. 3rdst contention\u2014Fencing out a Demographic It must be agreed that fencing off a certain voter demographic is a fundamentally unjust principle. By disenfranchisement this is precisely what we would be doing. Blacks comprise 13 percent of the national population, a minority, but 49 percent of those in prison. Nationally, blacks are incarcerated at 8.2 times the rate of whites. Furthermore around 70% of all felons exonerated on DNA evidence are black. This also means that statistically speaking there are a greater number of innocent blacks in prison who have not been exonerated. Not only is there evidence to suggest an unwarranted racial disparity but, certain crimes punish blacks more heavily. Take Cocaine for example, Possession of 5 grams of Crack Cocaine is a felony. However Possession of a similar amount of powdered cocaine is a misdemeanor. This makes no sense because 5 grams of powder will make more than 5 grams of crack and the active ingredient is the same. 81% of everyone convicted of felony crack possession is black while only 20% of those convicted of Powder possession. So not only are we sentencing and wrongly convicting this minority, more often we are punishing crimes that tend to be committed by black more harshly. By doing this we are fencing out a group of voter and silencing a minority, which works against the preservation of democracy therefore denying justice. Because, as I have proven, the idea of Felon Disenfranchisement does not promote the best for society in the form of the preservation of democracy and the creation of justice, the reverse must also be true. If Felons were re-enfranchised it would strengthen the democratic process and would be the most just solution because it preserves democracy.",

CV: My Core value of justice was not refuted allowing it to stand as the Core Value for this debate VC: This was also not disputed so the social contract must be seen as the Value criterion for this debate 1st contention:TO start I would like to point out the definition of democratic according to the Princeton dictionary--Democracy: the belief in freedom and equality between people, or a system of government based on this belief, in which power is either held by elected representatives or directly by the people themselves. The Democratic philosophy works for a republic system as well because the people vote on the representative which is known as a indirect democracy but a democracy nonetheless. So this point is irrelevant because if we are debating an impossible society why would we be debating a situation such as this?? The resolution applies to all democracies representative. or otherwise. 2nd contention: My opponent argued in defense of this contention that a felony is a quality. However this person chose to commit a felony. So they made an active choice to disregard society so it is a choice not a quality. so you are not oppressing them based on who they are, you are not oppressing them at all in fact, they are meeting justice. Also they are being punished for what they did not who they are. 3rd contention: First off all the rebuilding of this was a mis-quote of my point so I ask that you, as the reader and judge, look back to my response to the original point. Also a society cannot survice if it allows children to vote because then candidates would play towards children who would very obviously vote out of self intrest on points like \"eliminating homework\" This society would quickly die out. Moving on to my own case CV: unanswered VC: Unanswered seen as accepted. 1st: my opponent contend that John Locke was also a firm believer in liberty and Equality. and so he would not advocate removal of rights. However if you will read the \"Treatise of Two Governments\" Locke says that the social contract is only valid as long as it is a mutual agreement. So the felons violated their part so they have voided the contract between them. Because Voting is a privilege of society(since you can't vote without a society) it is taken upon violation. 2nd: My opponent says that disenfranchisement is an unequal idea because they have already received punishment. However if Felons,who have broken the social contract, are given equal rights to those who have not we are creating an unequal society. If the rest of society has the same rights as a felon then those felons who have violated the contract, through such things as voter fraud, insurrection, Murder and terrorism are then elivated because they can commit a crime and still have the rights of everybody who has not. Now to crystallize this debate and offer the voting issues. As I can see it this debate has boiled down to four main issues which are my voting issues for this debate. 1st the idea of whether of not a democracy actually exists. 2nd whether or not the social contract advocated deprivation 3rd impact of democracy 4th social equality Now the first of these can be seen to stand in my favor as I have fully refuted this point by saying a republic is a form of democracy therefore invalidating it. The second, as i said earlier also falls in my favor, because John Lockes idea on violation of the social contract, also without a social contract man shall turn to right man and NO RIGHTS SHALL BE PRESERVED so a social contract MUST exist and it advocates deprivation of rights after breaking and removal from society. The third falls quite clearly in my favor due to the fact my opponent would advocate allowing children to vote under his own case which would destroy society. For the fourth we must look to my second contention. Here I quite clearly prove that allowing felons to vote is unequalk and therefore does not fulfill the Core value of my opponent as well as my own. Thank you all (just a note this is my last speech the last speech in the last round I will Just post a congratulations or something of the sorts)",

            "conclusion": "In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote.",
            "premise": "\"A passive and ignorant citizenry will never create a sustainable world.\" Because I agree with philosopher Andrew Gaines, I affirm the resolution, resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. Affirming achieves the value of equality, as defined by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary as \"An ideal of uniformity in treatment or status by those in a position to affect either.\" The value equality is the only value for the round because equality was the foundation in creating democracy. The criterion that I will use to measure equality is fair representation. Voting is intended to represent all voters' voices. When we have fair representation among all classes, races, and sexes, we will achieve a greater amount of equality. I will offer the following definition from the Cambridge International Dictionary of English. Felon: a person who is guilty of a serious crime Contention 1: Communities suffer severely from felon disenfranchisement. Jeffrey Reiman, author of Liberal and Republican Arguments against the Disenfranchisement of Felons, \"Research has shown that poor and/or non-white persons are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced to prison than their wealthier, white, counterparts.\" This means that people of color are more likely to be arrested because they are of color than those who are white. Because of this, communities suffer greatly. According to Marc Mauer, who wrote Disenfranchising Felons Hurts Entire Communities \"\u2026The vast expansion of the prison apparatus over the last two decades is now hurting not only those incarcerated and their families, but their communities as well. Increasingly, the ability of these communities to gain political representation and influence \u2013 and therefore access to public resources is being thwarted by the American race to incarcerate. The structural racism in the system, an entrenched and often unconscious bias in law enforcement, has weakened the Black political power. This affects everything, from township supervisors to the president and all the policies that result.\" Project Vote, an organization dedicated to voter engagement and civic participation, reported, \"When felons lose the right to vote, it weakens the political power of the entire neighborhood, including residents who have committed no crime.\" Communities do not have the voting power to make the changes needed in a community. On a larger scale, there is a huge discrepancy between the minorities and the wealthy white upper-class. \"Political influence and access to resources are further hindered\u2026urban areas suffer from the vicious cycle set in motion by the dramatically high rates of arrest and imprisonment of members and their communities,\" adds Mauer. In order to break this lewd cycle, felons, like any other group of people, must be granted the right to vote\u2026not only for the felons, but also for the law-abiding citizens who have committed no crimes. Disenfranchisement does not value equality or justice in any manner when we are disenfranchising entire communities. Contention 2: To become a true democratic society all people have the right to vote. The key words of this resolution are \"In a democratic society\u2026\" Aristotle, a renowned Greek philosopher, said, \"If liberty and equality are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost.\" This means that we must grant all people the ability to vote. We must allow not only men and women but also all ethnicities and most importantly, those who follow the law and those who have broken the law. If we refuse the vote of any class, race, sex, or age the ability to vote, we are no longer a \"democratic society\" because we cease to represent every person. A democratic society is \"for the people, by the people.\" Refusing to allow any person the right to vote undermines the principles that have laid the foundation of democracy. Philosopher Ayn Rand said, \"A majority has no right to take away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities form oppression by majorities.\" To take away the voice of any community weakens democracy severely. However, giving everyone the ability to vote will help create a better democratic society. Contention 3: Disenfranchisement is counterproductive. It is the goal of every prison system in a democratic society to evolve their prisoners from delinquents to productive members of society. Disenfranchisement seeks to undermine the efforts that prisons put in place. Prisons have chaplains, libraries, job assistance networks, and work release programs to teach their inmates about being good members of society. Matthew Cardinale, a graduate student in sociology at the University of California, believes that disenfranchisement will only undermine the prison's objectives. Cardinale wrote a report about poor and homeless people with felony convictions and found that disenfranchisement caused felons to feel they were \"\u2026only a fraction of a citizen.\" Felons also felt the sense of separation left little motivation to change their criminal behavior. This means that the delinquents, who are no longer true members of society, have little motivation to change their lives. This leaves the potential for crime to increase instead of decrease. Granting felons suffrage yields a positive effect. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, \"[R]estoring the right to vote helps reintegrate people with criminal records into society and, by increasing voter participation, strengthens democracy.\" Civic participation instills in the offender feeling of belonging in the community and a sense of responsibility toward others. This connection to others reduces the criminal tendencies and helps restore former felons to contributing members of society. Furthermore, Jeff Manza and Christopher Uggen who are Associate Professors at Northwestern University, said, \"Denying voting rights to ex-felons, or felons living in their communities on probation and parole, undermines their capacity to connect with the political system and may thereby increase their risk of recidivism.\" In conclusion, a true democratic society grants all people the right to vote, communities suffer severely from felon disenfranchisement and disenfranchisement is counterproductive to the prison's rehabilitative system. The goal of any democratic society is to achieve equality. In order for any democratic society to function, we need to have all voices represented. Thank you.",

I look forward to his/her rebuttal. And also, as a forewarn, if there is some issue on my interpretation of the wordings, please see Caveat below. I must also urge the voters to remember to read Voting Standards after reading my contentions. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!! Let's have fun :D -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fairness I'd like to first point out the apparent discrepancy between the resolution the opponent is supporting and the actual position that he/she is arguing. This is a blatant and flagrant invasion of CON ground, as he/she would be able to abusively change stance at whim. Therefore, CON should automatically have the win. But as is courtesy of debate, I will address HIS/HER argument. I will assume that the PRO is for felons owning guns and that the resolution is to be rephrased as thus: \"Resolved: that guns should be allowed to felons.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Definition Should: must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): http://dictionary.reference.com... Felon: a purulent infection at the end of a finger or toe in the area surrounding the nail http://www.google.com...= Gun: A gun is a muzzle or breech-loaded projectile-firing weapon. http://en.wikipedia.org... Allow: let have; \"grant permission\"; \"Mandela was allowed few visitors in prison\" wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Burden Of Proof: On the Instigator/PRO. The opponent must prove that felons must have guns. He/She must be able to effectively defend against all of CON's rebuttal/rebuke. Failure to do so equates to CON's victory. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contention 1: Inanimate Objects Cannot Own/Possess. 1) Inanimate objects cannot possess/own 2) That which does not move is inanimate [1] 3) Felons is an infection located at fingertip thus immobile. [2] 4) Felons are inanimate (2, 3) 5) Felons cannot possess/own (1, 4) Felon cannot \"have\" guns, as it is an inanimate object--an infection. So there is no point in allowing them firearms. [1] http://dictionary.reference.com... [2]-http://www.emedicinehealth.com... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contention 2: No Harms/Need. The opponent has yet to address why the felons need posses guns. Ignoring the (profile pic) that the notion is, the fact is, there is no viable reason as to why felons should ever possess guns. They are inanimate. There is not one hypothetical situation wherein they need to defend themselves. Thus, there is no reason for them to be allowed firearms. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contention 3: Felons are inherently harmful presence. Even if I were to concede that felons can indeed own, it would prove more harm than good to allow them to own firearm. Felons are infections on the human body (see Definition above). Infection both by definition proper and connotation is a malignant presence detrimental to the host--therefore human kind in general. Regardless of the impossibility of felons owning something, The effect of ownership of firearm by something that is adverse to humanity per se may be comparable to that of Al-Qaeda's possession of WMD. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- VOTING STANDARD The Voters must vote by the persuasiveness and coherency of the debater's argument and not by prejudice.

Topic: the subject or theme of a discourse or of one of its parts. http://dictionary.reference.com... Topic is Felon. Opinion is voter's thought on what felon is. Prejudice is voter's preconceived thought on what felon is. Prejudice does not meet voting standard. Ergo, the voter's preconceived thought on what felon is should not affect this debate. As the \"King of harassing people\" put it, \"You don't vote based on pity or based on your own opinions prior to the debate, but who did a better job with the argument.\"[1] The voter is to judge only per strength of argument. [1] http://www2.picturepush.com.... (8th comment) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Caveat The fact that opponent failed to define the terminology in the first round meant that he/she was leaving the debate open to the interpretation of the CON. The opponent cannot and should not offer a radically alternative definition to the debate in the second round, as it will most definitely breach CON's argumentation and ability to argue against it. What he/she can do is offer a slight modification of the terms in the context of which the terms are already defined.",

            "conclusion": "Prisoners should be allowed to vote",
            "premise": "Background Now, I will point out that it has been declared constitutional for states to disenfranchise felons in the supreme court case Richardson v. Ramirez[1] so here I will not be presenting any legal reasons why felons should be allowed to vote, as the legal reasons show that they can't. Instead, I will focus on explaining why this ruling is wrong. Not every felon has committed a terrible crime. In many states, it is considered a felony to possess a certain amount of marijuana[2]. Thus, also in these states, your voting rights can be taken away just because you have marijuana. I think that since many states are now legalizing marijuana, and a majority(53%) support marijuana legalization [3] with that number rising every year, it is safe to say that people are beginning to realize that marijuana use or possession is not a crime. Since marijuana possession, I consider, a lesser crime than say murder or theft, why should all felons have their voting rights taken away? Some didn't do anything that really harms others. I imagine there are other \"felonies\" that most people would agree are not actually that major of a crime, yet they are felonies and they would prevent you from being able to vote in basically every state. In addition, some estimate that at least 10% of convicts are innocent of their crime and wrongly placed in prison.[5] Why should these people be denied their right to vote just because the other 90% of prisoners did commit a terrible crime? I consider it a worse problem to deny 10 innocent people the right to vote, than to allow 90 felons the right to vote. While it seems like it's proper to deny a murderer or another felon the right to vote, I'll explain in my next point why this is flawed as well. Laws are based off of what seems moral and immoral Since laws are based off of what seems moral and immoral, and there is tons of evidence to suggest that morals are subjective[4], why should criminals have their voting rights stripped away over something that is subjectively wrong? Even murder is subjectively wrong, as many cultures consider murder okay in some circumstances that America or other nations would consider immoral[4]. Since I believe laws are supposed to reflect what society deems what is moral, shouldn't criminals still have a say over such laws? Prisoners are still part of society, albeit they are put somewhere they can no longer harm others, but they still are part of society, they are just separate from most people in society. Just imagine one day that society deems it morally justifiable to murder someone in a specific circumstance, however the law is lagging a little behind society. Then what begins to happen is a massive influx of prisoners will occur as more and more people are murdering under those circumstances, and more and more people are being denied a right to vote. This makes it impossible to change the law, even if majority of people want to make it legal to murder in that instance, and it\u2019s considered moral to do so, but the law can never be changed because people are constantly being thrown in prison. Now, perhaps my opponent will say there is good reason to have murder under all circumstances to be illegal, so it should never change, but if majority of society agrees it is moral, why should there be a law against it? In addition, it is merely my opponent\u2019s subjective opinion that murder would be wrong in that instance, so what makes their subjective opinion better than others\u2019? This is all hypothetical of course, I don\u2019t know if my opponent would have brought this point up, but I rebutted it in case they would. Since murder is universally agreed upon in our society to be wrong, perhaps we can go back to the the marijuana usage argument to get my point across better, if it seemed my murder example was weak. Most people believe marijuana usage is morally okay, now imagine if a majority of people who believe marijuana usage should be legal are thrown in prison because they, themselves, use marijuana. The law can thus never change, even though marijuana usage is seen as moral by society, because people are getting their voting rights taken away. This can apply to any action that changes to be moral by society's view. I will leave my argument at this for now. Sources: [1]https://en.wikipedia.org... [2]http://www.drugtreatment.com...

            "premise": "I accept my opponents value of Democracy. A key note of democracy is majority rule. Large groups get more representation and therefore have more power. Felons are not a large group in the United States and therefore should be subject to the will of the non-felons. value and criteria -Maximizing rights Felons represent 1.6% of the population. By not voting the 98.4% of the non-felon population of the United States has more rights and there for the maximization of rights occurs. 98.4% vs. 1.6% who should get the rights. (US Bureau of Justice Statistics). My value and criteria is rationality. If you stop, sit down, and think about what a felon is you will realize why they should not vote. Over half of felons are drug abusers. 49% of people in prison are there for a violent offence. They are generally less educated. These people are rapists, child molesters, drug lords, thieves, and murders. Do we really want these people to have a say about what goes on in this country. Contention one: Most say \"If we allow this minority group (felons) to be disenfranchised, what is to stop us from doing it to others?\" This is a simple question; the Constitution. Amendment XIV specifically says states have the right to stop criminals from voting. The other Amendments also make it impossible for other minority groups to be disenfranchised. Disenfranchisement is not an issue. Contention two: The felons don't have a right to vote in states that don't allow it, and in order for any other rights to be violated; the rights of others besides felons would have to be violated as well. In America we have constitutional safeguards against this. Everyone is guaranteed basic rights in the United States. A.Voting does not help felons re-enter society. 67.5% of all felons are sent back to prison within three years of their imprisonment (US Bureau of Justice Statistics). This rate is very consistent across all 50 states. There is no difference between states that let felons vote and states that don't. Voting has no impact on recidivism. B.States have the right to restrict voters based on their criminal records (amendment XIV, section II) Again they made the choice, they knew the consequences, and now they have their voting rights rebuked. It's part of their sentence. Contention three: If you go back to my criterion by stopping felons from voting we are not crippling it we are strengthening it. There are 5.3 million felons that cannot vote. This is 5.3 million uneducated, drug addicted, parasites on society that we don't have to worry about screwing this country up. In order to have a strong democracy you need educated, people that are going to make the best choice for their country. Felons don't meet this requirement. 1-Harm Principal/social contract It is acceptable to restrict ones liberty when they have infringed on the rights of others. Being a citizen of the United States binds you to this social contract. If you break the laws you must suffer the consequences. Losing voting rights is one of these consequences. 2-Maintain Order Because of their actions we know what criminals support. The question is do we want these morals reflected in our laws? By giving felons representation we are essentially giving them the power to make laws. This would result in a mess. What kind of laws are pedophiles going to try and push? What do you think drug addicts will want? This also can result with problems of political corruption. I am one who believes in responsibility. Everyone on this earth has responsibility and can use it. But by granting them a right they don't deserve, they are taking us for granted and we are letting them. Now prisons take such good care of their occupants, that some would prefer living in a prison because they can get pampered and taken care of. It's been said that there has even been said that some felons have purposely committed a crime just to be in prison where they feel is a better place to live. So I rest my case by saying things because I believe my ethics are correct, and that justice need be taken place if so deserved. For all these reasons I negate.",

            "conclusion": "Felon Disenfranchisement",
            "premise": "I'm starting on my side of this debate then moving to the affirmative's side. My value: My opponent for some reason says my value is inferior because \"democracy is a means to obtaining human rights for everyone.\" If this is true, then my value of the Preservation of a Democratic Society is the best because clearly we want to keep our democracy. My criterion: He says my criterion is only doing what the people want... that is not what it is. It is upholding a democracy that best serves the interests of the people. I am not saying that whatever the people vote for should be done... obviously just because the society votes for slavery doesn't mean that we should implement slavery. But the purpose of government in general (including a democracy) is to protect the people, and i have shown/ will show more why I am serving the best interest of the people and my opponent is not. My 1st contention: First off, my opponent agreed that it is important to follow the social contract, so if i can show that disenfranchising felons is consistent with the social contract, I win this contention. My opponent's only response to this is that the punishment felons should get is jail. I agree, felons should be put in jail, and while in that jail they should have their vote taken away. In jail people don't have many important rights like liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. If we don't allow them these basic rights, why should we allow them to vote? Jail is also not the only punishment. After felons are released from jail they cannot carry guns for obvious reasons. My opponent also says \"This is in no way proportional to a felony\": I agree, taking someone's vote away is not nearly as bad as raping or killing someone. So the main point is, while the felons are in jail they should not get to vote because they have not completed the rehabilitation process or paid there debt to society. And once again, LET THEM VOTE ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF JAIL. Another point, my opponent dropped my Richard L. Lippke card about treason... so I win this round because i proved that a group of felons ought NOT have the right to vote. 2nd contention: My opponents only response to this is that i agreed to his definition of democracy, and best benefiting the people is not in it. I do agree to his definition of a democracy, a democracy is a government in which supreme power is vested in the people. But the people choose this type of government because they believe that they themselves can best make laws to benefit society. Also, in the U.S gov't does determine laws. We elect congressmen who are part of the government, and the CONGRESSMEN vote on laws, not the people directly. UNDERVIEW: my opponent didn't respond to this AT ALL. You can vote negative because we can't decide what ought to be done in a democracy. We cannot establish a normative rule in a democracy because what democracies ought to do is listen to the people. ================================================================ Now the Affirmative's case: Value: I was simply saying that voting is not a human right, it is clearly a political right because you can only vote if you have a government. So my opponent cannot say that we need to protect human rights and have it be relevant to this debate. Criterion: My opponent talks about felons being treated as secondary citizens because they can't vote. Again, let them vote OUT OF PRISON, but while they're in prison don't let them vote. In prison you already are a second class citizen pretty much, so taking away the right to vote will not hurt them anymore. My opponent also says \"all citizens need to have an equal voice to protect their basic human rights.\" This is not true: just because people can't vote doesn't mean they don't have rights. For example children can't vote and they still have basic human rights. Also there are millions of people who choose not to vote, but just because they don't share their voice doesn't mean they don't have rights. Contention 1: \"He never says the reason to disenfranchise felons this argument falls\"... that is what my whole case is about. To my second response to this contention he says that the purpose of democracy is to protect the felon's rights. I agree that we need to protect felons rights in general, but when they commit such a serious crime we have a reason for restricting their rights. It's the same when we send someone to prison, we try not to restrict rights, but when someone commits a felony they clearly deserve to have some rights taken away. Also, taking away the felons' right to vote while they're in prison is not restricting any of their \"human rights\". My opponent makes no connection to not letting them vote in prison and not having human rights. Contention 2: My opponent's second contention is all about reintegrating felons into society. I say that taking their vote away ONLY IN PRISON will not hinder the reintegration process at all. My opponent's response to this does not make sense at all, \"I defined the democratic society as the US and it is a problem in the US.\". If my opponent is trying to say that because this is about the US, then we're talking about permanent disenfranchisement... then i propose we change the law limiting it to only disenfranchisement in prison. So pretty much you can take all of the affirmative impacts of helping reintegrate felons and put it on the negative's side. Contention 3: My opponent's 3rd contention talks about how felons would not be able to get welfare if they couldn't vote. I ran out of letters responding to this, but i meant to say LET THEM VOTE OUT OF PRISON. If we let them vote once they are released from prison then they will be able to get welfare. Conclusion: One of the key points of this debate is about letting felons vote out of prison. Take away their right in prison while they haven't rehabilitated yet, and give them it back once they leave prison. This point is key because it takes away his 2nd and 3rd contention. My opponents first contention is irrelevant because he talks about human rights, but voting clearly isn't a human right, it is a political right. Voting is only a right at all if you live in a democracy, so it cannot be considered a right that can be applied to all humans. I win on my side of the case because i defended all of my contentions, and my opponent never responded to my underview. Good luck.",

I am going to try and keep these as cut and dry as possible since I'm limited so ill just give a value, a criterion list and explain my contentions and I will leave it at that. My value for this debate is going to be Equality, and my value criterion for this debate is going to be that of the right to vote. \"All men are by nature equal, made all of the same earth by one Workman; and however we deceive ourselves, as dear unto God is the poor peasant as the mighty prince.\" It is because I agree with Plato that I must affirm the resolution. Resolved: In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote. For clarification the Affirmative offers the fallowing set of definitions. Contention 1. No democratic society exists so don't bring up a country that has one. Contention 2. Democratic societies cannot punish people because of their traits, for then it will be oppressionistic and unjust. Contention 3. If a democratic society doesn't allow anyone within it's ranks to vote then it is no longer a democratic society Right: Adherence or obedience to moral and legal principles and authority. Democratic: of or like or supporting democracy. In accordance with the principle of equal rights for \"All.\" Society: A body of individuals living as members of a community. Felons: One who has committed a felony. Vote: A formal expression of opinion or choice Equality: The state or quality of being equal Republic- state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them. Now, To begin with I would like to point out that the resolution deals with a democratic society, so a major point of this debate will be what is a democratic society. Allow me to explain, anything done democratically, or a democratic society is a society in which every single member of the society votes on every single issue in government. Now you may be wondering to yourself well how is that possible, and I am here to tell you that it virtually isn't. There is no country in the whole world whose type of government is simply democratic. The closest thing anyone in the world comes to a democratic society is that of a republic, which is essentially the U.S. So if my opponent attempts to bring up a democratic society that strips it's felons of the right to vote, then they must be either daft or ignorant, for I have just said that it doesn't exist. My second contention is that democratic societies cannot punish people because of their traits. The essential building blocks of a democratic society is that liberty, and equality should be offered for all. How can you claim that everyone is equal, and at the same time punish people because of their qualities? You cannot! You cannot expect a minority of people to live and die on the whims of others for the rest of their lives simple because of their traits, or who they are. Being a felon is no different than being Black, White, Hispanic, or Asian. Being an felon is a trait. So if a society punishes people for being themselves than that society is no longer a just society. My third contention is that if a democratic society doesn't allow even one member of it's society to vote, then it no longer a democratic society. The meaning of a democratic society as explained before is a society in which everyone votes on every little problem. However if even one person doesn't vote on the problem, then what does that make the society. Well, if I don't vote then technically someone similar to me who votes the same way as me would be essentially representing me thus changing the government to a tainted democracy, or even a form of republic. In lamence terms if a democratic society doesn't let a felon vote then it isn't a democratic society anymore. So when asked if a democratic society \"ought\" to allow felons the right to vote, if the society wants to remain democratic it should. If the society wants to remain a just unoppressionistic one it should. Lastly if the society IT WOULD. So should democratic societies allow felons the right to vote the only logical, factual, Moral, and Just interpretation of the resolution lies with the Affirmative. Thank you",

            "conclusion": "In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote",
            "premise": "To attack my opponent's case: The Negative uses Justice as a value for the resolution, stating that \"\u2026the resolution is about punishment. Punishment must be just. Thus, the resolution implies a value of justice\" However, there is no place in the resolution where it says the word \"punishment\". Disallowing a felon to vote would only the protection for the people, according to the negative, because felons can and will make laws that harm the people. Also, Justice is not mentioned anywhere in the Resolution, so Democracy still outweighs justice as a value when it comes to a democratic society, which has the root word demos, which means people. Thus, both democratic society and democracy are closely intertwined. My opponent also uses the value criterion of Contractarianism, which is basically the Social Contract. The social contract is also his contention, so I will attack both at once. Contention 1: Social Contract Theorem. Since there is more than one Social Contract, his Contention is vague. I do not know whose Social Contract exactly he is using. Is it Hobbs's, Rousseau's or Locke's? These three Social Contracts were made on totally different theories. Hobbs believed that all men were evil. Rousseau believed that some men were good, and some were evil. Locke believed that all men were good. There is no general theory that can encompass all three of these largely opposite theories. Therefore, I must press for the Neg. to choose which Social Contract Theory he actually uses. If he does not choose, then I will be able to sink his whole contention if I prove that one of the Social Contracts is either fallacious, or supports the Aff. To attack his sub points, however: C1A: My opponent uses the idea of reciprocated responsibility. Felons, in this idea, make the laws, and thus they have to obey them --- However, felons do not make the law; they only elect the people who make the law. Also, in the Constitution, it says that the people have the right and duty to revolt against the government if it becomes tyrannical. Thus, if a law is passed that tyrannizes a certain race in the country, that race has the right to revolt. However, according to my opponent, they made that law, but they do not have to obey the law. This is not democratic, because the idea would allow the government to make oppressive laws and the people would still not be allowed to stand up for their rights. C1B: The Neg. uses General Will in his second contention. The general will is a concept in political philosophy referring to the desire or interest of a people as a whole. However, the flaw with General Will is that it would submit a minority, no matter how little the difference is, to the decisions of the majority. Ex: There is a democratic country with two rival factions who hate each other and want to exterminate each other. One faction currently has 100,000 supporters. The other faction has 99,999 supporters. However, in a vote for a law, the majority that has only 1 more vote than the other faction can pass a law to kill all supporters of the rival faction. After all, this is General Will. How is this fair, that a teeny, tiny majority of 1 person can decide the deaths of 99,999 people? Thus, the General Will theory is flawed. C1C: In summary, my opponent pretty much states that, since they committed a crime against humanity, they have to lose their rights. However, the problem with this idea is: First, felons should not have to lose their rights in addition to the jail term. There is a law in the United States called double Jeopardy, in which it states that a convicted criminal cannot be punished multiple times for the same crime. So, if the jailing of the felon is already punishment, then the felon should not be disenfranchised because he already has been punished. Second, even if he does have to lose his or her rights, why does it have to be the right to vote? There are many other rights that people have, why can't they lose the right to mobility, or to bear arms, or to free speech, or freedom of the press? Why is it that they only lose the right to vote? There is no reason why the right to vote is more special or less special than the other rights. To defend my case: Actually, the value of Democracy should pretty much stand throughout and is obvious in the resolution based on the root words, as I said before. Both Democracy and a Democratic Society both have the root word demos in them. Thus, both mean, for the people. Also, since democracy is an idea, and a democratic society utilizes the idea of democracy, thus democracy is needed for a democratic society to take place. My value criterion, equality, also connects to a Democracy because it is implied by the definition of democracy. The definition of democracy is that the supreme power is held completely by the people under a free electoral system. Now, in a democracy, the concept of voting is that the power of the government is equally distributed through the people, so equality does connect strongly to the value of democracy. Contention Overview: The United States is only being used as an example of a democracy, and by democracy, I did not mean an ideal democracy. Therefore, since my opponent has said that the United States is a democratic republic, it implies that the United States uses democracy, which would enable it to relate to the value. Since my opponent dropped my point about \"once a felon, always a felon\", I am allowed to use it in my defense. C1: As I wrote before, the 26th amendment of the Constitution states that \"all citizens over 18 years old have the right to vote.\" This quote makes no mention of whether those citizens are felons or not. Thus, the only way for a person in the United States to not have the right to vote would be if they are not a citizen, or if they are under 18 years old. Since a felon does not lose his citizenship when he is convicted, then he retains the right to vote for his jail term, and the rest of his life. It is also irrational to deny a person the right to vote for the rest of his life for something as simple as drug abuse, which is a felony, when his felony has harmed no one. C2: \"By voting off his logic the affirmative world would have no punishments because they would all be justified.\" This line does not make sense, so I do not need to defend my contention unless the Neg. clarifies this line. C3: My definition of \"felon\" does not contradict the fact that a felon does not have to be from the current democracy. My definition of felon is \"Felon: a person who has committed a felony, which is a grave offense against society, such as murder or burglary, and commonly punished by imprisonment of more than a year, or death.\" In nowhere of the definition does it say anything about the system of government. Thus, the Neg's attack against this contention fails, and the contention still stands. C4: My opponent dropped it, so it stands Thanks!",

My opponent has the full burden of proof. I'll provide one source, and I will have destroyed my opponent's opening statements. My opponent opens with his opinion. Opinions can't be substantiated. He says we need more people voting, but somehow it doesn't make sense that felons should be the ones filling the polls instead of law abiding citizens. The proper solution is to get more law abiding citizens to vote. He assumes that all felons committed their crime a long time ago. That's an assumption used as a blanket statement. Blanket statements only need one example to be destroyed, and here I can provide a standard that breaks his statement. The minimum punishment for a felony is 48 hours [1]. He says that they're still citizens so they should vote. Something about committing a felony is that they're forfeiting certain rights by damaging the American public. Voting is one of those rights.

            "premise": "Going down the flow. Definitions: Democratic Society- My opponents argues that there are many democratic societies, and that any one of them must allow felons to vote. However, my opponent by doing this is being extremely vague. There are too many different types of democratic societies to look at. My opponent can then be abusive by looking at every democratic society and finding some sort of flaw in one of them. Therefore, we must limit it to \"a democratic society\", which in this case I have done by looking at an ideal democratic society. Observation One- My opponent in his round before his last one argued that a democratic society is one that follows the principles of democracy. However, I would like to turn this argument because the principles of democracy is to provide equal representation to its' people. Observation Two- You can extend this due to the fact no current society follows to the principles of democracy, which is essential according to my opponent. Felony- My opponent says that felony is not a violation of John Locke's social contract theory. However, I am first not looking at John Locke's social contract theory. Second, my opponent tries to argue it within the context of law dictionaries. However, since you have extended my second observation, those law dictionaries are irrelevant because they are not in the context of a democratic society. Therefore, look at my definition of a felony in the context of the violation of the Social Contract of a democratic society. Social Contract- My opponent argues that there are different philosophers views. However, my opponent failed to address the fact that all of these philosophers had the same views of what the contract is and does. They did however have differing views on what it protected. However, in this case since it is in the context of a democratic society, it is meant to protect and provide democratic values. This value is the right to equal representation. Vote- My opponent argued against this by giving the example of the United Nations. However, in this debate we are looking at vote in the context of a democratic society. The United Nations is not a democratic society, therefore his definition of vote is irrelevant. I have provided the definition of vote in the context of a democratic society. My case Value: Safety- My opponent argues he did not drop the point that safety protects democratic values. However, if you clearly look at my constructive you see I say safety is \"Safety is the protection of rights that the society values the most.\" I go on saying that it protects right democratic society values the most. Therefore, you can extend this point through. Therefore, in order to have democracy, you must protect the values of democracy. The protection of these values is safety. I have shown through my case that the felon voting is violating the social contract and in turn violating safety. My opponent then goes on and says that I would only let people who can make a good decision should work. This is untrue, I would let people who abide by the social contract vote, and those who do not will not be able to vote. Value Criterion: Social Contract- My opponent says he can show that I do not uphold the Social Contract. By doing this my opponent is trying to show how he upholds the Social Contract better. Therefore, my opponent is accepting it as a weighing mechanism for the round. Therefore, whoever better upholds the Social Contract will win the round, so this is the Value Criterion for the debate. My C1- My opponent is saying that they are still within the Social Contract if they are being punished by imprisonment. He uses Locke as an example. My opponent has no source behind this and this completely untrue. In fact it says in the philosophy of the Social Contract, \"those who simply choose not to fulfill their contractual obligations, such as by committing crimes, deserve losing their rights.\" http://en.wikipedia.org... Therefore, one of their rights are the right to vote, and they deserve to lose it. Now you can cleanly flow my contention one through the round, and I show how I better uphold the weighing mechanism of Social Contract and Safety. My C2- My opponent attacks by saying that the rest of society would vote the opposite of the felon of a bad choice. He goes on and says that not all felons are bad. Both of these statements are flawed. The first for the reason that my opponent drops my Clegg quote which says we don't let felons run their own lives, why should we let them run ours. This says that with felons voting they have the influence to run our lives, which society cannot tolerate since they have shown they will make bad choices. As well, real life scenarios are not as clear cut as the example my opponent brings up. Moving on to the second point not all felons are bad. Clearly they are bad because they committed a felony. They have shown they are bad by committing an act that is violates the social contract. As well, we are dealing with the right to equal representation because that is the right to vote in a democratic society. Moving on to my opponents case: V: Already attacked. VC: Equality is not inherent in the definition of democracy. In fact a democratic society only guarantees the right to equal representation. As well, he moves on saying that felons do not have to be jailed but only fined, that would be equal. However, by fining only felons, that would be unequal. To achieve equality in this case then you would have to equally fine all of society. My opponents value criterion has no bright line. I have already shown how my opponent is \"trying\" to disprove how I reach the Social Contract, which in turn causes him to \"try\" to achieve it. C1: My opponent argues that felons can have equal liberty, and US is a democratic society. However, felons have to be punished in some way, which would not be equal. Otherwise this would lead to anarchy. Second, my opponent dropped that even in the US disenfranchisement is constitutional. C2:My opponent drops the fact that we cannot give preferential treatment based off of social class so extend this through. As well, poor had access to equal rights but still need to be punished. Social Contract argument addressed. C3: My opponent says felons don't have to be punished. However, this would lead to anarchy with massive crime rates. He dropped the imply argument I made so extend that they were punished in democratic society. C4: Disenfranchisement is the removal of the right to vote. http://en.wikipedia.org... Therefore, only the government can do this. Therefore, it is in the setting that the government can organize the vote. Also, I did not say felons were mentally incompetent. I said we already limit people from voting, such as the mentally incompetent, so felons should be too. For these reasons, you must vote negative. I would like to thank my opponent for a good debate.",

            "premise": "Now into the summary and impact round! No new arguments and refutes as this is the last round :) thanks To summarize, my points were P1: Restricting felons from voting violates the Constitution. P2: Felon disenfranchisement encourages racial discrimination. P3: Ex-felons deserve the right to vote. Ex-felons cannot be barred from voting on legal premises since disenfranchisement for life violates the Constitution. It violates the excessive sanctions part of the 8th amendment as well as the 15th amendment. America needs to defend everyone's voting rights, but how can we fulfill this if ex-felons are still not allowed to vote? Everyone is supposed to be part of the American Dream. We all should have an equal opportunity at life, but ex-felon disenfranchisement violates this. Voting still is a big part of society. Ex-felons are affected by the results of elections. They should be able to have a say in who leads their country. Once a felon starts fulfilling his/her civic duties, they should have their full rights returned to them. On top of all moral values, ex-felons who actually have a say in their government are less prone to committing crime again. Since this reduces crime rates, it only further proves that ex-felons SHOULD be able to vote. What this debate really comes down to is weighing my opponent's main points (bad judgement and potential dangers of felons recommitting crimes) against the simple reality that ex-felons are people who abide by the law and deserve their full rights. If a person has bad judgement, does that mean he can be denied his Constitutional rights? The fact remains that ex-felon disenfranchisement is illegal. Furthermore, the past is the past; we cannot continue to punish ex-felons for mistakes they made long ago. They are already on lower ground than normal citizens. Also, if an ex-felon has bad judgement, he would not have gotten out of parole or probation -- felons have to be reviewed to get fully free. The potential dangers of felons recommitting crimes are not relevant because studies show that ex-felons who can vote are way less likely to commit crime. This is what sets me over my opponent. He has failed to prove the morality and legality behind disenfranchisement, but I've proven the moral and legal reasons behind allowing ex-felons to vote. I suggest voters cast their ballot for my side because I've proven convicted felons released from prison/parole/probation should be able to vote for both legal and moral reasons. I've refuted all of my opponent's refutations/contentions effectively (his refutations were quite repetitive and can be refuted by my rebuttals in previous rounds) and provided more detailed evidence. Overall, I have presented a stronger case. Thank you. Also, I'd like to say thank you to my opponent for an excellent, engaging debate. Your arguments were very well thought out. It was fun debating with you :)",

            "premise": "Thank you for posting this debate. Since this resolution is an LD topic, I will outline what Lincoln Douglas Debate is for anyone who votes. If my opponent disagrees with how I explain LD, we can argue in the comment section. However, this is a basic outline of how to judge LD debate. The value is each debater's goal for the round. Values must be topical. The value criterion (sometimes called standard, criterion, VC) is a weighing mechanism used to determine if and to what degree the value is met. If an argument is never attacked, it is called a \"dropped\" argument. Once dropped, the opponent can not refute it in later rounds. Furthermore, an argument must always be extended (carried on in the next round) to have any impact. Neither side can ignore one of their own arguments and then bring it up in the last speech. Also, no new arguments can be brought up in round 3. They should be ignored if they are. And lastly, the affirmative side always has the burden of proof, and the negative side has the burden of refutation. When voting, you should first decide what value is the \"paramount value\" for the round. Next, you decide which VC best measures to what degree the resolution achieves the value. And finally, you look at the contentions (arguments) and determine which ones weigh the most on the VC. Whomever has the arguments that best achieve the value through the VC wins. It is possible to lose ones value and VC, but still win. Now my case... ************************************************************************************** Aristotle once said, \"If liberty and equality are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost.\" Because I believe this statement, I stand in firm affirmation of resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. Before continuing, I offer the following definitions: Democratic society: is government by the people in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system. Abraham Lincoln summarized this best in the words \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" Felons: as defined by Black's Law Dictionary as one who has committed a felony. Ought: Should, or in the best interests of the actor Since these definitions will set the grounds for today's debate, a few observations are required \u2013 Observation 1: A democracy has three key elements that are essential to its existence: a)A political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections. b)The active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life. c)A rule of law, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens. It is with utmost importance that we all recognize the necessity of all three of these elements. By violating one, the democracy ceases to be a democracy. Therefore, both sides of this debate have the burden to prove that there position will not ignore any one of the three. Observation 2: A felon is not only a person currently in jail, but anyone who ever committed a felon, now, or decades in the past. In other words, a man who was convicted of a felon in 1960 is still considered a felon in 2008. Therefore, neither my opponent nor I can overlook this group in our argumentation. With both these observation in mind, we can look to my paramount value for today's round of maximizing equality. There are multiple reasons why maximizing equality is the paramount value: 1.Equality is the foundation for a democracy. All three elements of a democracy involve equality. If equality is not achieved, then the democracy falls. Therefore, equality has necessity 2.Equality can clearly be defined. When two individuals have the same possibility to act in the political process, equality is established. Other values, such as morality or justice can not clearly be defined, for they are subjective. To achieve equality, my value criterion is philosopher Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative. The Categorical Imperative is simply a cost-benefit analysis for an action. If the net gain outweighs the net loss, according to Kant, then the action should be done. The Categorical Imperative is the best standard for maximizing equality because: 1.The Categorical Imperative is a clear weighing mechanism and has a clear bright line. In other words, we know when an action meets the categorical imperative. 2.The Categorical Imperative is topical. With the word ought, the resolution implies an agent must determine if he or she will have a net benefit from the action. 3.The Categorical Imperative is needed for equality. A democracies primary goal is it's survival. If it falls, it can no longer achieve any of it's other goals. Equality is how a democracy is maintained. So in the context of this debate, an action that preserves a democracy, one that leads to equality, will always be the ultimate benefit from the Categorical Imperative. Therefore any action, according to my criterion that should be done, will lead to equality. Contention 1: Felon suffrage has no harms Subpoint A: Felon suffrage for those currently in jail has no harms I would like to reference my definition of ought, which describes an action that is beneficial to the actor. Therefore, my opponent will try to argue that suffrage to felons is harmful to society. This is simply not true. Since a democracy follows majority rule, a minority can only enact change when a section of the majority switches sides. Because of this, felons can not change public policy in a manner that will benefit them and harm the majority on a greater scale than any individual voter. Let's analyze a hypothetical scenario. A bill to abolish the death penalty is being voted on. If the death penalty is proven to help society, then the majority of society will vote to maintain it. So even if every single felon votes to abolish the death penalty, it will remain in place. Since no harm can come from allowing felons the right to vote, how can we say they don't deserve the same opportunity as everyone else. Subpoint B: Felon suffrage for those out of jail has no harms. It is understood that criminals deserve a punishment, but do they deserve a punishment beyond that decided on by a judiciary? Absolutely not. After serving their sentence, be in a fine or time in jail, a felon should be treated like the rest of society. By abolishing the felon's right to vote, we unjustly increase their punishment. Therefore, a felon, who has served their time, deserves the right to vote. Contention 2: Felon suffrage has benefits. Subpoint A: Felon suffrage preserves equality The expansion of suffrage is needed for equality to exist. If voting rights are distributed on different levels for different people, equality is obviously not met. Equality can not be achieved with anything else but suffrage. If two individuals are treated completely equal by a government, except with the ability to vote, then the individual with suffrage has an unfair and unequal advantage in changing public policy for his betterment. Subpoint B: Felon suffrage helps society progress Sometimes the majority is only a slight majority when the issue is highly debated or has no clear answer to it's net gains. In this instance, felons can add another perspective to the equation. For example, most individuals do not know the quality of their prison system. Felons do. In the case of a bill that wants to give millions of dollars to fund prison reform, the opinion of voters will split. Many will consider it a waste of precious money, while others may see the benefits of a better prison system. The majority may be those against the funding, but they aren't necessarily right. If felons have the right to vote, they can add numbers to the minority and possibly make it the majority.",

            "premise": "Okey Dokey. Thanks for excepting this debate! This is my first online debate, so bear with me! So as a brief roadmap for the judges, I will NOT be presenting my own case, but will head straight into attacking my opponents case. I will present my own value of Justice, which is defined as giving each person what they are due.(I have clearly defined justice, therefore my opponent cannot say that it is not clearly defined, furthermore, your value isn't something that is supposed to be defined easily, it is the intangible goal that we try to come close to meeting in the debate. It is SUPPOSED to be vague.) In any society, justice must be upheld to have a functioning society, we must give people just punishments. Felons who have voilated other people's rights are no longer due the right to vote.This is even more important in a democratic society because such a society would thrive on fairness and justice. The value criterion in a Lincoln douglas debate can either be how your value is measured, or how it is acheived. Therefore Justice can be acheived throught Societal welfare, which is the well-being, safety, and prosperity of society. Because justice does whatever is best for society, and protects society, then justice can only be acheived through societal welfare. In any functioning society, the government must uphold justice in order to protect society. In a democratic society, the government is society, so therefore society must protect itself. To clarify the resolution I would like to define the following words. Democratic- Of the nature of, or characterized by, democracy; advocating or upholding democracy.(OED) Society- A collection of individuals composing a community or living under the same organization or government.(OED) Retain- To keep in possesion or use. Democracy-Government by the people; that form of government in which the sovereign power resides in the people as a whole, and is exercised either directly by them (as in the small republics of antiquity) or by officers elected by them(OED) Ought-That which should be done, the obligatory; a statement using \u2018ought', expressing a moral imperative.(OED) In other words a moral obligation.(OED) Now to attack my opponents case. With my opponent first observation which stated three key elements to a democracy, he does not offer a single definition or source, so until he does this his observation cannot be considered a valid observation. As for his second observation The resolution specifically states RETAIN which is defined as to keep in possession or use. Meaning felons ought to be able TO KEEP the right to vote. Meaning they should be able to vote even while incarcerated (imprisoned), and never have the right to vote taken away from them, which is simply not the case. Felons should not be able TO KEEP in their possession(retain) the right to vote. However, there is nothing stopping them from REGAINING the right to vote AFTER they have repaid their debt to society, and proven that they can be beneficial to society once more. So while a felon in 1960 is still considered a felon in 2008, that doesn't necessarily mean that that felon ought not be able to vote if that felon has repaid his/her debt to society. My opponent's value is Equality, however equality only exists as long as people believe that they are equal. And Felons who have voilated societies rights, have basically said that they are above society, and not equal to the rest of the people in society, and if a felon doesn't believe that he/she is equal to the rest of society, then he/she should not be given the same rights as the rest of the people in society. Furthermore my opponent has provided no source that says the foundation of democracy is equality. Because democracy is defined as government by the people in society. I would say the foundation of a democracy is government by the people in society. And when a felon has commited a crime he/she removes themselves form society, and therefore can no longer have a say in the government of that society. As for his Value criterion, I'm not exactly clear on how it links to equality. He said that equalty is how democracy is maintained, again how is this true, he has not elaborated on this, he simply says that equality is how democracy is maintained. WHY is equality hoe democracy is maintained. (excuse me is I sound like a nagging school teacher) What does equality have to do with democracy. Isn't it the right to vote that maintains a democracy because democracy is based on the people in society goevern society, and the way in which the people in society govern society throught the right to vote? My opponents first contention is that Felon suffrage has no harms To attack his subpoint which was that felon suffrage for those in jail has no harm. My opponent says that because a democracy follows majority rule, the majority of the society decided what happens, not the 5 million or so felons currently in jail. He later says that sometimes the majority is only a slight majority, and the vote of the felons could change the outcome of the election. Isn't this kind of contradictory. Furthermore in his Contention 1 subpoint A he essentially says a felon's vote doesn't really matter because it won't change anything. Doesn't this basically contridict everything a democracy stands for? Because in a democracy EVERY vote matters, and EVERY vote can change an election. Furthermore a felon has voilated societies rights, and societies trust. If a felon cannot be trusted to run his/her own life how can we trust that felon to have a say in how the rest of society runs their live. Allowing a felon to vote would create a double standard because we would be allowing Law breakers to become Law makers. Also because ought is defined as a moral obligation, and doing what is moral is not always best for the actor. We cannot allow felons to vote because we have a moral obligation to protect society, and allowing felons to vote would be harmful to society. His Subpount B- Again negating the resolution doesn't mean all felons will NEVER be able to vote. It means all felons should not be able to RETAIN the right to vote. As I have already explained the difference I won't elaborate on it unless it proves neccessary. Furthermore a felony is a crime punished by imprisonment for over a year or death. If society feels that you are a big enough threat to have to be removed from society for over a year then you should not be able to vote until you have been rehabilitated. My opponent says in this subpoint that after a felon's time in jail he/she should be treated the same as the rest of the people in society. However this is not true, if it were we would be allowing sex offenders to teach third grade, which we don't because justice doesn't give second chances. It does whatever is best for society. Contention 2 Felon Suffrage has benfits. Subpoint A Felon suffrage preserves equality. Felons who have broken the law and committed a heinos crime can no longer be considered part of society. And as I have said before felons do not believe they are equal to the rest of the people in society. Furthermore, we don't give everyone equal voting right, take children and the mentally incompetant, they can't vote, in order to protect society, and similarly we must prevent felons from voting in order to protect society. SubPoint B Felon suffrage helps society progress First of all, in most democratic societies the people do not vote directly on bills, citizens vote for representatives who then vote for said bills. So a felon wouldn't really have his voice heard on this particular issue. Also the voice of the felons is not going to completely be oppressed, felons who have repaid their debt to society and proven themselves to be beneficial to society most likely know the quality of their prisons, and can lobby for prison reform. Because of all these reasons I strongly urge for a vote in Negation.",

            "discussionTitle": "In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote",
            "conclusion": "In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote",
            "premise": "I will start with my opponent's case, and then move on to defending my case. Definitions: Democratic Society, Observations- My opponent is wrong when he says that there are lots of democratic societies, but there can be \"a democratic society\". Just as if I say, \"There are many apples,\" and then I say \"In an apple, there should be a worm\": Here, I saying there are many apples, and I am saying that one, any one, of the apples should have a worm inside. Thus, I can say there are many democratic societies, and that in any one of these democratic societies, felons ought to retain the right to vote. Felony- As I showed before, a felony does not violate John Locke's social contract theory, and therefore the definition of felon should not have anything to do with the social contract theory. Rather, as stated in law dictionaries, the definition is\" a person who has committed a felony, which is a grave offense against society, such as murder or burglary, and commonly punished by imprisonment of more than a year, or death.\" Social Contract- As I said before, there are three social contracts, with conflicting views; Hobbs thought all men were evil, Rousseau thought some were good, and some were evil, and Locke thought all men were good. These conflicting views cannot all be applied to a democracy because they will have contradictions, and it is impossible to join contradictions together. Vote- Vote is not about the people taking advantage of the right of equal representation. It is about the people expressing their will or choice. This is shown in the UN Security, where 5 permanent members hold more influence than other members because they can veto any resolution (http://www.globalpolicy.org...). This means that if the majority of the members support a resolution, but one of the permanent members such as France vetoes it, then the whole resolution is dropped. This shows how the permanent members have more influence than the other members, and thus do not have equal representation. Therefore, this example shows how the minor countries do not have equal representation and cannot take advantage of the equal representation, yet they vote, because this expresses their wills and choices. This supports my definition of vote but not the Neg's. Value- \"my opponent drops my point that in order to protect these democratic values we must have safety.\" -First, I have checked my opponent's whole case, and he never states that point. -My opponent agreed that democracy was inherent because he did not argue it, he cannot change his answer -However, safety does not relate to the resolution because disallowing a felon to vote in a democratic society is not related to safety at all, unless the Negative wants to venture to say that a felon's voting will harm the safety of a society. If the Neg. chooses to follow that path of reasoning, then he would be supporting the idea that a person should only vote if they can make a good decision. This claim is undemocratic and illogical, yet without it, safety will not relate to the resolution. Thus, safety fails as a value. Value Criterion- I am not saying that it doesn't represent a philosopher, I am saying that the general use of the Social Contract theory allows me to destroy his point by disproving that any one of the Social Contract theories do not support his claims, which I will again show in my attack on the First contention. C1- \"He doesn't understand that all social contract philosophers accept the fact that if you do not uphold your obligation to follow the law, then you violate the social contract\" This is completely false. As I said before, Locke stated that a felon is still within the Social Contract if they break the law, but are punished. Thus, since they are already punished by imprisonment, they stay within the Social Contract, so his first contention falls, and as I said before, so does his VC C2- I am not saying that the felons' votes are not important. What I am saying, is that if the felons really wanted to all vote for a dictator as a president, the rest of the people in America would obviously vote for the candidate who was not a prisoner. They would obviously not say, \"Oh, there's a dictator running for president, let's all go vote for him.\" This shows that if the felon's did really vote for a bad choice, the other people's voting would counteract that bad choice. Furthermore, this only assumes that all felons are bad, and will always make bad decisions, which is not true. -Also, the resolution also does not talk about the right to equal representation; the only right it talks about is the right to vote, which we are debating about right now Defending my own case: V: I have attacked my opponent's value and have successfully defended my value in my rebuttal. VC: My value criterion of equality is the correct value criterion as I said because it is inherent in the definition of my value, democracy. Furthermore, the resolution only says a democratic society, so if a democratic society was created where felons are not jailed, but only fined, then there would be equality. -I have disproved his Social Contract as a VC. C1: I have just showed that equal right is a good VC, and that felons do not have to be denied equal liberty. As well, the US is still a democratic society, and it does not have to be ideal, so it can be used as an example. C2: The first line of the Neg's attack,\" My opponent dropped the attack on my opponents second contention was dropped that they have access to equal rights.\" This line doesn't make sense. According to my understanding of the line, it means that I have dropped the attack against my second contention. However, that is not true; I have not dropped the attack on my second contention at all. He has ignored the lines I wrote for my defense before, so I ask you to look again at the second round, Aff defense of Contention two. Also, I have again shown before that the felons have not violated the social contract before. C3: I have already showed that equality stands in my VC. Also, the resolution in no way whatsoever states that the felon has to be punished in a democratic society. According to the idea that my opponent has not argued of \"once a felon, always a felon\", a felon could potentially come from a dictatorship that happened before a democracy because he would have been punished by the dictatorship, but the status of felon would have carried throughout his lifetime, into the democratic society C4: The resolution does not mention disenfranchisement, only the right to vote. Thus, the right to vote can be for anything. Also, voting is not just for a government, people can hold votes for everything. Finally, my opponent claims that felons are mentally incompetent to vote; this is obviously not true, take, for example, Chuck Colson (http://www.pfm.org...) which shows that he is in every mentally competent since he has changed.

            "premise": "I will post my constructive then go over my opponents side of the flow. I negate the resolution. Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. Counter-Definitions A Democratic Society \u2013 An ideal society which provides its' citizens equal representation. Society- A community of people, as of state, nation, or locality, with common cultures, traditions, and interests. (Black's Law Dictionary) Felony- A violation of the Social Contract, which results in the felon being put in jail or being put to death. Social Contract \u2013 The gathering of the rights society values the most, which is guaranteed under the Social Contract. In addition, the rights that are sacrificed to protect these rights. Citizen- A member of society who has abided by the Social Contract. Vote- A member of democratic society taking advantage of their right to equal representation. Observation 1.It must be looked at since the resolution states, and it is defined, that what separates a democratic society from any other type of society, is the right to equal representation. 2.It must be looked at since the resolution states, and it is defined, that there is currently no society that is truly democratic, because they do not provide equal representation. Value and Value Criterion My value for this round will be safety. Safety is the protection of rights that the society values the most. This must be the highest value, because a society must protect what it values the most for the members of society. A democratic society in this case values the right to equal representation the most. My value criterion for this round will be the Democratic Social Contract. The Social Contract must be looked at since it best protects the rights the society values the most. Also, it is inherently democratic because it is developed and agreed on by majority of society. In this case, it will provide the best protection for the right to equal representation, which is valued the most by the democratic society. The negative will show how the felons have violated the Social Contract and must lose their right to equal representation. Contention One: Felon's Have Violated the Social Contract The felons have violated the social contract of a democratic society. A democratic society must operate under the Social Contract. The Social Contract provides the best protection for the rights the society values the most. It shows the government's obligations to you, and your obligations to the government. The Social Contract states that people gain rights from a government but in turn have to subject to the civil law and political authority of a society. The only right guaranteed to be gained in a democratic society is the right to equal representation. However, even though this is the highest valued right, a democratic society should provide other rights, such as the right to liberty and life under the social contract. It applies in this case because the felon's have violated social contract by committing a felony. The breaking of the social contract allows the government to take away the right that they value the most. In this case, the right that is valued the most is right to equal representation. The felons have shown that they are a danger to the society, and the rights it values the most. Therefore in violating the Social Contract, the felon has forfeited this right that the society values the most, which is protected under the Social Contract. If the felon in this case has violated the social contract, they have violated safety as well. This way the negative better upholds safety because they are upholding the social contract by taking away the felons' participation in civil society. It also upholds the Social Contract, because they have taken away the rights guaranteed by the Social Contract from those that have broken it. Contention Two: Felons' rights are inherently taken away According to the resolution, rights are inherently taken away by the democratic society. The two rights that are being mentioned in this case are the right to life and liberty. These two are natural rights people are endowed with according to John Locke. Even though a democratic society does not necessarily have to provide these rights are some that a democratic society should uphold. By putting you in jail or to death, either are results of a felony according to the definition, the society is taking away either the natural right to life or liberty. It is already showing through this that the society can take away rights. Therefore, the society has the authority to take away the right that it values the most, the right to equal representation. As stated previously, the society protects the rights it values the most. It is already protecting the right to life and liberty, so it must protect the right that it sets it apart from other societies, which is the right to equal representation. Roger Clegg, JD, further elaborates on this topic by saying, \"\"It makes no sense. We incarcerate people and we take away their right to run their own lives and leave them with the ability to influence how we run our lives?\" This shows that if democratic societies already take away the right liberty, they must in turn take away the right to equal representation as well. This way the negative better upholds safety, because they show how rights are already taken away for the means of safety. It also upholds the Social Contract, because the negative upholds the Social Contract by taking away the rights it guarantees from those who violate it. I do not need to go over my opponents definitions since I provided counter definitions. My value for this round should be prefered over democracy, because the responsibility of any government is to provide safety. That is the basis that a government is formed, because it is to get out of a state of anarchy and to protect the consensus of rights provided by the government. Therefore, safety should be used. As well, Social Contract should be used because it best protects the rights of the people, and better upholds safety. Equality cannot be used because felons are not equal for they committed a felony. Since you are going by my standards for the round and the fact that a felony violates the social contract, you must automatically negate. As well, my opponents example comes from non legit democratic society since they do not provide equal representation, so that is void. Again, the social status argument is non relevant because no matter your status you receive equal application of rights provided, and they still performed a wrong act. Next, my opponent by citing the constitution fails to realize in Richardson vs. Ramirez the Supreme Court deemed felon disenfranchisement constitutional. Again, my opponent by citing the United States is not providing equality because they do not allow children or the incompetent to vote, which violates equality.
