The drug is therefore administered to women who: Choose to be sexually active. Choose to be reproductively barren. Based on the points of \"free-will sexual intercourse\" and \"free-will reproductive suppression\" I will argue that a Company health care system or the Government's health care system is not responsible for incurring the cost of this drug. This drug, in it's intended form, falls under three prospective categories: Recreational use. Family planning. Hormone therapy. (Exclusive to only a handful of birth control methods) If we forced a health care provider to pay for birth control, it would be just as liable to pay for other recreational supplies. Should the HMO also pay for novelty condoms? Sex toys? Pornography? All these things are designed for recreational sex. If we forced the health care provider to pay for birth control, it would prospectively force the HMO to furnish other services for family planning. Should the HMO pay for fertility treatment? Cryogenic sperm storage? Day care? Education? Food? All these things are prospective costs incurred through family planning.As my opponent has mentioned, birth control has some medical benefits. What he failed to mention, is that these benefits are drug specific. Not all birth control methods prevent ovarian cysts and not all birth control methods decrease menstrual activity.If the pill is being used to treat cysts, excessively painful menstruation or a hormonal imbalance, then the pill is no longer considered birth control. It has taken on the properties of medication. For this purpose and this purpose alone, the HMO should cover the cost of the pill.",

            "premise": "I would greatly appreciate some proof that the pill can treat cancer. I could not find proof of such a claim but instead found studies that showed it could be linked to breast cancer and cervical cancer in women. [1]Second, I've already expressed the fact that a woman can simply practice abstinance. There are a wide variety of alternative methods to the pill, such as IUDs, condoms, and surgery. Some of these are just as effective as the pill.Why should it be an insurance company's responsibility to look after a woman's womb in such a way? It is her personal responsibility to take care of that issue, not her insurance company. In the case of rape, providing birth control would apply to a large range of women and not just rape victims. They could also use one of the alternative methods mentioned above.Again for the Viagra case, my opponent's claim is inane. It is the company's right to choose what they cover and what they don't. Viagra actually treats a legitimate health problem, unlike my opponent's stark belief that birth control somehow prevents cancer. If it were proven that the pill prevents cancer by a reputable institution, then the argument might have more of a base.The final claim again is ludicrous to me considering that not providing birth control would in no way cause women to \"suffer because they are capable of bringing life into this world.\" Unless my opponent is referring to the pain of childbirth (which is uncontrollable for an insurance company), her statement has no support or reasoning behind it.1- http://www.cancer.gov...;",

The debate will be in the format of: 1. Intro and main argument, 2. Rebuttals, 3. Re-rebuttals and closing arguments. I would much rather hear from Con first. Nevertheless, here are my opening arguments:1. First of all, birth control occasionally serves actual medical needs, such as curing ovarian cysts, or (relatively) less important, lightening menses.While this is probably not a good argument on its own for someone who needs birth control for its primary, stated purpose; it must be brought up.2. Even if the only purpose of \"the pill\" is to facilitate sex, health insurance already covers Viagra and its relatives, and their primary purpose is to allow for intercourse.3. On a purely financial (probably heartless) note, it would be cheaper for insurance companies to cover birth control than covering the resulting medical expenses arising from the unexpected child.I apologize for the omnipresent spelling and grammer mistakes, but please try to keep the argument from devolving into a fight over semantics and syntax. I welcome and appreciate critiques (and dismantlings) of my argument. Thanks for helping my debating skills grow!",

The burden of medical necessity lies with a doctor and should not be determined by an insurance company. As for the Viagra claim, the fact that some insurance companies cover this drug proves sexism because no insurance company has ever covered birth control under any circumstances. If certain insurances deem a man's erectile dysfunction as being a medical problem than a women who is battling cancer should be allowed the same coverage. Men cannot bare children this is true but women should not have to suffer because they are capable of bringing life into this world that is one of the reasons as to why we have the equal rights amendment, to procure that women be treated fairly when it comes to men in every aspect regardless of their physical description or biological make up.",

Other men have to pay for the medication just like women have to pay for birth control. There is no sexism behind this issue unless you wish it to be there.It is absurd to bring in the equal rights amendment considering that men cannot become pregnant. The situation is completely biased and that makes the issue moot. If a woman wishes not to become pregnant, she can practice abstinance or buy the birth control on her own.The implication that not covering birth control says that women's health is not important is incorrect and unfounded. If anything, it makes women more independent because THEY have to be responsible for their own selves. This is equivalent to men having to buy condoms; it is their responsibility and no one else.In conclusion, there is no reason for insurance companies to pay for any type of birth control, whether male or female.

I believe even for a high risk surgery, women no matter the age should have the final say on what is to be done to their own bodies. Women should not have to wait till they are legal enough to drink to have access to this alternative option to birth control, especially when most teens as young as 14 can get birth control pills without parental consent. Why do we allow women this young to have access to these things if they are not capable of making consequential decisions? Even a preteen knows that she should be on some sort of birth control if they are having sex. Otherwise it wouldn't be available to them.

The risks might go back down, but that doesn't help women who get breast cancer while still on the pill. No condoms do not prevent abortion. That is only one reason why NFP couples have such low divorce rates. Read the rest of it. There are several other reasons as well. \"Isn't using birth control better than having unwanted teen pregnancies and abortions? Look at both these issues and judge for yourself if contraception is part of the solution or part of the problem. Because of the widespread use of birth control, more people than ever have sex without intending to have children. Sex out of wedlock has become far more common, and more sex means more babies. Some argue that teaching people how to use contraceptives will alleviate the problem. But research shows that \"programs in safer sex education and condom distribution have not reduced the out-of-wedlock birth rates among sexually experienced teens. . . . The fact is, increased condom use by teens is associated with increased out-of-wedlock birth rates.\"[1] A few years ago in Colorado, one school began passing out condoms to the students. Within three years the birth rate rose 31 percent above the national average, and in one school year one hundred births were expected among the twelve hundred students. The administrators were described as \"searching for explanations.\"[2] When unwanted pregnancies occur, many turn to abortion as a solution. In fact, studies show that about half of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion.[3] Some argue that increased use of contraception could have lowered these abortion rates. However, the research institute of the nation's largest abortion provider admits that most women who receive abortions had been using birth control during the month they became pregnant![4] Such couples feel that the \"fault\" of the pregnancy can be blamed on the failed contraception, but by contracepting they have already set their wills against new life. Since contraception treats pregnancy as if it were a disease, many people conclude that abortion must be the cure. I once saw a condom advertisement that called pregnancy \"the mother of all nightmares.\" With this mentality it is no surprise that the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey said, \"At the risk of being repetitious, I would remind the group that we have found the highest frequency of induced abortion in the group which, in general, most frequently used contraceptives.\"[5] Even a former medical director of Planned Parenthood admitted in 1973, \"As people turn to contraception, there will be a rise, not a fall, in the abortion rate.\"[6] Fifty million abortions later, no one can dispute his prediction. Lastly, it should be noted that anyone who believes that contraception decreases abortions ignores the fact that hormonal birth control can cause abortions.[7] Click here for details on that. Mother Teresa did not need to see the statistics. She was well aware of the connection between contraception and abortion when she said in a speech in the presence of Bill and Hillary Clinton: \"The way to plan the family is Natural Family Planning, not contraception. In destroying the power of giving life, through contraception, a husband or wife is doing something to self. This turns the attention to self and so destroys the gift of love in him or her. In loving, the husband and wife must turn the attention to each other. Once that living love is destroyed by contraception, abortion follows very easily.\"[8] __________________ [1].

It is often said that with optimum use of the Pill, it should have an effectiveness rate of 99 percent. Therefore, it is said to have a \"method\" failure rate of about 1 percent. However, in typical use the rates change significantly. This can be caused by many things, such as a woman's forgetting to take her pill or taking it at the wrong time of the day. Thus the actual rate, called the \"typical\" or \"user\" failure rate. For the first year of use for women under the age of twenty, the Pill has an annual failure rate of 8 to 13 percent.[21] One study that followed sexually active teenage girls on the Pill found that 20 percent of them became pregnant within six months![22] The typical failure rate of the Pill has been shown to vary according to such factors as a woman's age, race, marital status, education, and economic status. For example, one large study showed that poor teenage girls who lived with their boyfriends had a 48 percent chance of getting pregnant during their first year on the Pill, whereas a wealthy married woman over the age of thirty had a 3 percent chance of pregnancy.[23]\" (Chastity.com)",

That being said, I shall pull some statistics from Americanprogress.org to make you rethink your opinion. The average working women between the ages of 18-34 only earns roughly 27,000$ a year. Many of these women have put off seeing the doctor to get birth control just because of the cost. Now most of us being middle or upper class think birth control is cheap, but to these people it is expensive considering the limited amount of cash at their disposal. As for the insurance, true insurance does help pay for birth control, but it does not pay for the whole cost. Women with private insurance have to pay 50% of the cost still to get birth control. Women spend 68% more out of pocket healthcare cost then men do, in part because of contraception cost. With all this information, one can come to the conclusion that free contraception would free them of the financial strain and anxiety of having to worry about having access to contraception all the time. 2. You admit that publicly funded birth control would lower the abortion rate. I am glad we agree on that. A lower abortion rate would have huge societal benefits such as having less people go through the traumatizing experience of abortion and less people having to pay for an abortion which would help the economy since with all that extra money, they can spend it on other things they need or want (or save it). 3. True, there wouldn't have been any movement to do things in a certain way had it not been for high population growth. The past is the past though and we need to focus on the present. The world is projected to be able to support 8 billion people. We are at 7 billion right now, so as a world if we want to avoid a crisis or extreme inequality we should work and implement solutions (public funded birth control) now so that we can avoid the crises of tomorrow. 4. Colorado when they implemented this program, it was estimated that it saved the state 69$ million dollars alone for just the year of 2004. How they came up with this number was the cost that it saved both the healthcare system and the welfare system. Every year STD's cost the US healthcare system 17 Billion dollars. Publicly funded birth control in Colorado shows that it would save the US healthcare system money because in Colorado the STD rate dropped since the funding for birth control not only covered the oral contraception pill, but also condoms which prevent STD transmission. With this drop, the Colorado healthcare system as I said earlier said money. The Colorado welfare system also saved money because less welfare children were born. Since Publicly funded birth control would save both on healthcare cost and welfare cost, the savings would more then cover the cost of providing birth control to the public. Plus, not only will the program save the government money, it will also save the individual money so it is a win-win for everyone.",

            "premise": "I am inclined to yield to my opponent's statement, \" instead of debating possible scenarios and requirements, we are simply arguing over weather it should simply be used. As clear cut yes or no stance.\" My standing is no, euthanasia should not be available for use. My opponent has brought up the concept of body autonomy as a counter argument, and while I agree that bodily autonomy is important, it needs its restrictions as much as anything else does. The ability and knowledge that we have control of who we are and what we do is one of the few feelings of actual freedom we ever get to truly express. Yet, nothing is without its consequences. Should someone consent to be euthanized, every outcome needs to be taken into account. For example, the costs, the lasting effects on those who care about the person, the effect on the person giving the Euthanization. We cannot allow such an act to be available for use if the main argument is bodily autonomy and the patient not wanting to be a burden on those caring for them. It isn't always ourselves we worry about, it's also how are actions affect others. Bodily autonomy is accepted, but it shouldn't be absolute, we would reap far more consequences than originally intended. Now for my counter argument, I would like to introduce the public conscience and medical ethics. When anything is legalized and made available, it becomes accepted. When something becomes accepted, it becomes a norm. Euthanasia should not be available for use for its inevitable affects on the public conscience and its violation of the doctors moral codes and ethics. If euthanasia were available and accepted, we would be hiring executioners, not doctors. The public mind would sway to a numbed state, where walking into a hospital is either your conscience decision to be treated or placed in a body bag. But that's just the issue, soon, death would become so common a thing and people would accept the fact that you would never need to suffer again. The ill would see euthanasia as a quicker more efficient means of treatment, and if the public wasn't still in the state of mind that the loss is great, they'd be in support of and making pre arrangements for the newly decided to be deceased. The other problem with that would be the decision on who would commit the Euthanization. Doctors and nurses alike take an oath not to bring harm to any person who comes into their care, to treat those who need them most, and to not simply let a person die. If euthanasia were available, who would be the one to deliver it? The doctors? They have broken an oath to not bring harm to those under their care. The nurses? They have also just broken their oath. So we must resort to the unbiased, the people whose conscience mind see nothing in euthanasia besides the earning of cash. The possibility of recovery is not the only reason euthanasia should not be available for use. Society has evolved from what it was so long ago, we cannot simply throw out the progress that has been made for an easier solution, for an absolute control over the body.

In Genesis in the story of Onad, when he had sex with his deceased brother's wife (as was his obligation to give her a child) he stopped and spilled his seed. It says that this displeased God, and Onad was killed for it. Some people have argued that he was punished for not fulfilling his obligation to give a child, but if you read further on, you will find that the punishment for not fulfilling this obligation was not death, but was public humiliation. Therefore his punishment must have been for contracepting. Sources: Chastity.com biblechristiansociety.com The bible",

            "conclusion": "Welfare Recipients Should Be Subject to Mandatory Birth Control",
            "premise": "I thank Pro for instigating an interesting debate.DefinitionsI am not looking to win on a cheap semantic point but I am confused on Pros definition here. Pro says \"For the purpose of this debate, I\u2019d like to clarify that the word \u201cwelfare\u201d will mean benefits or resources typically provided to the average non-recipient through wages earned, or through an employer. These could include healthcare benefits, cash payments, food assistance, or housing.\"Doesn't Pro mean resources or benefits provided to the recipient ? How can some one who is on welfare be a non recipient ?After reading Pros argument I think what they have in mind is government paid/tax payer funded benefits to people, also known as welfare. I think its also clear what Pro has in their sights is the social safety net/welfare system of which distributes government payments.I shall first present some objections to Pros argument, then move on to providing argument so to why we should NOT have mandatory birth control for welfare recipients.Objection 1: Birth control and abortionClearly the goal of Pros policy is to not have people on welfare produce more babies. Yet Pro takes away the option of abortion. I find this restriction dubious at best and possibly hypo critical. I think Pro is trying to have it both ways here, wants to have no children produced on welfare, but doesn't want to anger the pro life/evangelical community.Well I am not going to let that slide, if your willing to deny pro creation rights to welfare recipients then you don't get to take away their pro choice rights. You want no babies on welfare then you allow abortion as an option for people who have to fulfill the burden YOU put on them in the first place. It's the least you could do.Under Pros policy we can have a mantra for welfare recipients.......abortion........safe......affordable.........and regular !!!Objection 2: Is mandatory birth control really the best option ?Take this example that Pro provides...\"Hodges is a perfect example of why mandatory birth control is necessary. \u201c[She] had been on birth control pills, she said, but quit taking them because her boyfriend was in jail. When he was released, she didn't have any contraceptives around the house. And that's when she became pregnant.\u201d\"But notice that Hodges had been taking birth control pills, but later on didn't take them cause she didn't have any around the house. There is an access issue here to birth control. Before we take away reproductive rights, maybe we should make sure that every effort has been made at education of birth control and access to birth control before taking away such rights ?Pro provides another example...\"\u201cSylvia Missal, who runs a young parent program at Children's Hospital in Boston,\u201d says that welfare mothers say they do not want more children but \u201cthey\u2019re not able to organize themselves.\u201d\"Again the first issue here is one of organisation, if this was solved you wouldn't need to resort to mandatory birth control.I shall now provide argument that welfare recipients should NOT be subject to mandatory birth control.The Religious Procreation Argument\"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. 28 God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that [am]moves on the earth.\" [1]This is on the first page of the bible. Pros restriction is in direct contradiction of Gods command and implied command for humanity to pro create.......fruitfully. Does Pro really want to go put something in place that goes against the good book ? the holy word of God ? Well maybe Pro does, but I am sure all those evangelical Christians on which they profess there faith on the authority of the word of the Lord would be not so inclined.Evolution and Diversity Now maybe Pro doesn't adhere to the Christian God, or the Christian holy text. Maybe Pro doesn't even believe there is a designer, well I got you covered there too. Pros command for mandatory birth control is a big no no in the survival of a species. Under Pros proposition humans as a species will have less diversity, (read less genetically diverse). It won't just be less because a 2nd generation of welfare recipients won't exist, it has a knock on effect as those welfare recipients cause they don't exist won't have kids, and those kids who will now not exist won't exist and so on and so on.The lesser the genetic diversity the lesser the chances for a species to survive as wikipedia explains...\"Genetic diversity plays a very important role in survival and adaptability of a species because when a species\u2019s environment changes, slight gene variations are necessary to produce changes in the organisms' anatomy that enables it to adapt and survive. A species that has a large degree of genetic diversity among its population will have more variations from which to choose the most fit alleles. Increase in genetic diversity is also essential for a species to evolve. Species that have very little genetic variation are at a great risk. With very little gene variation within the species, healthy reproduction becomes increasingly difficult, and offspring often deal with similar problems to those of inbreeding. The vulnerability of a population to certain types of diseases can also increase with reduction in genetic diversity.\" [2]Military RecruitmentUnfortunately people are wising up that being sent to war by rich white men isn't all the glory and fun its made out to be. As such the military is having more and more problems getting recruits, sign up get shipped to Iraq and maybe get your legs blown off is hardly an appealing sell and people aren't just buying the whole your serving your country and freedom and democracy by going over sea's to dispose of a tyrant which was once supported by your own country.........but I digress.Now I ask you, who is going to fight in the military , and by fight I don't mean enlist I mean actually going over to what ever hell hole and actually being in harms way. Who will do this ? the George W Bushes of the world ? Would you vote for a presidential candidate who look less like Dubbya and more like Freddy Krueger who has being dis figured in military combat and also is in a wheel chair cause they had their legs blown off ? yeah good luck with that. Clearly it is necessary for the elite not to be put in harms way which explains why it was necessary for George W Bush be kept safe during Vietnam conscription in the national guard...\"During the 1968\u20131974 period, Presidents Johnson and Nixon decided against calling up National Guard units for service in Vietnam. As a result, National Guard service was widely portrayed as a way to avoid combat. The waiting list for the Guard at that time was extremely long, and there have been charges that young men from influential families were improperly moved to the top of the list.\" [3]So who shall fight in wars ? easy, poor, desperate people that's who. But under Pros plan there will be less of these poor desperate people, and thus undermine the recruitment effort of the military.Pros plan weakens our resolves and emboldens the enemy.I look forward to Pros response.Sources[1] http://www.biblegateway.com...[2] http://en.wikipedia.org...[3] http://en.wikipedia.org...",

It has been scientifically proven that guys are more attracted to girls who are fertile, and not on birth control. (Contraception: Why not 3rd edition) The birth control pill has an 8 percent failure rate with perfect use. The condom has a 17 percent failure. \"In the Consumer's Guide to the Pill and Other Drugs it also states that \"Early-age use of the pill carries a greater risk of breast cancer, of developing larger tumors and having a worse prognosis.\" (Chastity.com) Condoms cause cancer as well \" \"BERLIN (Reuters) - Most condoms contain a cancer-causing chemical and their manufacture should be subject to greater quality control, a German scientific research institute said Friday. The Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Institute in Stuttgart, Germany, said it found the carcinogen N-Nitrosamine present in 29 of 32 types of condoms it tested in simulated conditions. \"N-Nitrosamine is one of the most carcinogenic substances,\" the study's authors said. \"There is a pressing need for manufacturers to tackle this problem.\" The carcinogen is thought to be present in a substance used to improve condom elasticity. When the rubber material comes in contact with human bodily fluids, it can release traces of N-Nitrosamine, the study said. Local government officials said condom users should not stop using rubber contraceptives based on results of the study because N-Nitrosamine does not present an immediate health danger. But Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment said that daily condom use exposed users to N-Nitrosamine levels up to three times higher than levels naturally present in food.\" (Chastity.com) Condoms do not protect against HPV, the most commonly contracted STD: http://chastity.com... My source for that punishment is the bible. Why do you think that NFP couples having low divorce rate and contracepting couples having high divorce rates is a coincidence? Studies have proven it to be true, and not a coincidence. http://chastity.com... NFP has a below one percent effectiveness rate. You are not going to find any type of bc more effective. I forgot to mention earlier but most forms of contraception are also abortifacient. You can't logically say that they prevent abortions, when they cause them. \"When a woman ovulates, she can become pregnant. However, the Pill has mechanisms that can cause an abortion before a woman knows that she has conceived. If a sperm does fertilize the egg, the newly conceived baby (zygote) may be transported more slowly through the fallopian tubes because of how they have been altered by the Pill. Thus, the child may not reach the uterus, where he or she needs to implant and receive nourishment for the next nine months. Because the fallopian tubes are changed, the baby may accidentally implant there, causing an ectopic or \"tubal\" pregnancy, which is fatal to the baby, and can also be life-threatening for the mother. If the baby is able to travel safely to the uterus, he or she may not be well received. One reason for this is that the chemicals in the Pill thin out the lining of the woman's uterus (the endometrium).[10] As a result, the baby may not be able to implant. At other times the child will attach to the wall, but he or she will be unable to survive because the normally thick and healthy uterine wall has shriveled and is therefore unable to nourish the baby. The Pill also impacts the woman's progesterone level. This causes the lining of the uterus to break down and eventually shed as it would in a menstrual cycle, further denying the baby's attempt to implant. Many doctors are concerned about the fact that women often are not informed that the birth control pill can cause an abortion as well as prevent pregnancy. One medical journal declared, \"If any mechanism of any OC [Oral Contraceptive] violates the morals of any particular woman, the failure of the physician or care provider to disclose this information would effectively eliminate the likelihood that the woman's consent was truly informed and would seriously jeopardize her autonomy. Furthermore, there is a potential for negative psychological impact on women who believe human life begins at fertilization, who have not been given informed consent about OCs, and who later learn of the potential for postfertilization effects of OCs. The responses to this could include disappointment, anger, guilt, sadness, rage, depression, or a sense of having been violated by the provider.\" (Chastity.com)",

Failure RatesMy opponent cites unsourced statistics of success from the Catholic Diosceses of Richmond. I don't think I need to say what's wrong here.2. Pill CancerIt does help women who might otherwise have gotten one of the types of cancer the pill protects against. I assume the risks probably mostly balance each other out. Regardless, if one fears cancer so much, one need not use the pill. That does not preclude using another type of birth control.3. STDs and Condoms I don't feel like pointlessly rehashing an argument here, so I will simply quote a government site. Note what I said last round about any protection being better than nothing. \"Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In addition, consistent and correct use of latex condoms reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including diseases transmitted by genital secretions, and to a lesser degree, genital ulcer diseases. Condom use may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated diseases, e.g., genital warts and cervical cancer.\" [1]4. NFP and Divorce I invite my opponent to make a case regarding this instead of using her source as an argument. 5. More PregnancyThe birth control did not increase the birth rate, that was the students being stupid and having more sex. Birth control cannot be blamed for people's idiocy.6. Abortion I concede this point fully.New Arguments:A. Natural Family Planning is not always possible It is complicated, and generally only usable by people in a stable relationship. Additionally, it provides no STD protection, and requires abstinence. The biggest issue is, of course, the complexity and relationship requirement. NFP is pretty much useless unless you are married or in a very stable relationship [2]. You can't just be like \"Tonight let's use NFP\" out of nowhere, it requires an excessive amount of preparation and is easier to screw up than pretty much any other tactic.

            "conclusion": "Abortion Is Not Birth Control.",
            "premise": "First of all, just to clarify, I would like to post that actual meaning to a few terms here. MURDER: Law. the killing of another human being under conditions specifically covered in law. In the U.S., special statutory definitions include murder committed with malice aforethought, characterized by deliberation or premeditation or occurring during the commission of another serious crime, as robbery or arson (first-degree murder), and murder by intent but without deliberation or premeditation (second-degree murder). DELIBERATION: Thoughtfulness in decision or action. PREMEDITATION: Law. sufficient forethought to impute deliberation and intent to commit the act. KILLING: To put to death. BIRTH CONTROL: Regulation of the number of children born through the deliberate control or prevention of conception. All of these were found on dictionary.com which was last updated in 2006. As you can see here, the word killing means \"to put to death.\" The word murder means \"the killing of another human.\" They are the same thing which therefore shows that abortion IS murder. Also, birth control means \"prevention of conception.\" If a woman is pregnant, then the baby has already been conceived, therefore, abortion could not be a form of birth control. The doctors who kill convicts are killing them for a specific reason, the ones who kill the babies are killing just for the reason that the mother basically wanted to have fun without the consequences. You also said in your argument that \"if they don't want the baby then give it up for adoption.\" That is practically contradicting what you have said before. About the whole thing that you said about taking the time to make sure you don't screw up other lives, that is what condoms are for. Plain and simple. If the woman does not want to get pregnant, then she should either choose to abstain until she knows she is ready for a child, or to make sure the guy is wearing a condom that has not been tampered with. That is her responsibility, and if she is stupid enough to not use her head, then she should not have the option for abortion. Even though you say it should not be used as an easy way out, it is used for that more than anything. Women should either stay protected if they don't want the baby, or they should HAVE to go through the whole 9 months of pregnancy. Having abortion as an option period tells women \"Hey you can have fun all you want, not be the responsible adult you should be, and if you end up pregnant, you just kill the baby.\" It sounds harsh, but it is true. Knowing that abortion IS an option tells women they can have fun, and then they don't have to live with the consequences of their actions. That is not mature at all. The mature and adult thing to do is either stay protected or abstain. So to conclude my argument, abortion IS the killing of an innocent child that has no say whatsoever of what happens to THEIR body, it cannot be considered a birth control at all, since the woman has already conceived, and abortion should not be an option, because as my opponent has stated in her argument, there are adoption agencies out there that will take the baby, therefore NOT just \"casting aside the newborn humans.\"",

            "premise": "\"Most of the world\"s population growth over the next century will be in Africa and Asia; in the other continents the population growth has already ceased.\" ----- Christa Brelsford Nowadays, we always face the population problem. As we can see, population problem keeps happening in developing countries. Population bomb bring lots of problems to developing country, for example, resources lack, slow economic development, education faultiness, etc. In this debate, I want to argue about population control measures in developing country. Should developing countries publish policies to control the population? Population bombs brings lots of problems, lack of resource should be one of the most serious problem. some developing country, some country in Asia and Africa, still have huge trouble on the population control. They have tons of people and they still don\"t know how serious the problem is. The population bomb in these country bring lots of trouble, for example, lack of resource. As we all know, hunger still exist in Africa. Lots of children are on the brink of death. We all know that lack of resource was existed in Africa but why does this happened? Because of the population growth and economic lack. Although we know people in Africa should have some measures to control the population, but most people in Africa have no idea about family plan and birth control. So I think developing country should have population control policy to help people know more about birth control. Some developing countries have population control policy, for example, China. China published \"One-child policy\" in 1979, which means each Chinese family can only raise one child. This policy had huge influence. Chinese government has to do this because China have huge population based and if the country doesn\"t control it by law, China will have much more population than today. As the country with the largest population in the world, Chinese government use this way to help retard population growth. The one child per family policy do help China during 1980s and 1990s, Chinese development went faster and the nation had less pressure. This situation helped Chine on economic field and resource field. But things have been changed in China recently. In 2015, since China published new birth control policy, every family can have the second child. But because of the lack of resources and financial stress, lots of family choose not have the second child. This kind of situation may not happen decades ago, but nowadays more and more Chinese couples don\"t want to raise the second child. \"The birth policy is a fundamental state policy that China must uphold in the long run,\" (Gan, N. First one child, now two - but China's birth control policy is here to stay, South China Morning Post.) The example I provide about China is a great example of birth control policy that was published in developing country, and cause positive effect. Family plan is very important for society development, but some people in developing country didn't realized why counties need have birth control. So developing countries need to have the population control policies to force people doing birth control.",

Also when speaking of God's mercy, forget you not our old pal, Uzzah. As the Biblia Sacra Vulgata (I apologize for using the outdated version last round, this round I use the official version from the Vatican's website) says (2 Samuel 6:6-7)\"(6) Postquam autem venerunt ad aream Nachon, extendit manum Oza ad arcam Dei et tenuit eam, quoniam boves lascivientes proruperunt.(7) Iratusque est indignatione Dominus contra Ozam et percussit eum super temeritate; qui mortuus est ibi iuxta arcam Dei.\" [1]God killed Uzzah, who was only trying to help out. Why not kill Onan for polluting? Also, some random folks on Wikipedia agree with my random assertion that he was killed for disobedience, so we cannot rule that out so quickly. [2]As far as I know, contraceptive side effects are fairly uncommon. Perhaps some statistics would bolster Con's argument. Regardless, most every drug has a side effect. Surely Con does not propose that we discontinue pharmaceuticals? Additionally, while Con's argument is unsourced, I leap to the conclusion that most people who use NFP do so for a religious reason, which would also keep them from divorce. It is likely a coincidence based on the groups of people likely to use NFP and the groups of people unlikely to divorce overlapping. Also, as I will go into later, NFP can fail. A lot.Contraceptives do not have high failure rates. Additionally, they are greatly superior to NFP. Some things are pretty easy to screw up, but there aren't that many ways you can mess up taking a pill. Not so with NFP. NFP, even used perfectly, has a 1-9% failure rate (not to mention when used imperfectly) as opposed to the 0.3% failure for perfect use of birth control pills. Even imperfect use is only 8%. There are even options like the etonogestral implant that have a very low 0.05% failure rate. Even properly used condoms have a low failure rate of 2%. Even perfectly used withdrawal can be more effective (4%). [3]Even though condoms do not protect 100%, they are still far superior to the 0% protection offered by no contraceptives whatsoever. My source claims they are \"very effective\" in preventing HIV/AIDS. It goes on to say that they reduce the risk of any STD, including HPV. [4]Contraceptives best allow for planning, and they can prevent STDs. Additionally, there is no compelling reason for not using them. The resolution is affirmed.Sources:1.

(7) against the indignation of the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him for his rashness; and he died there beside the ark of God.\"This is obviously wrong about the \"oxen in the play came out\" bit, according to every other Bible I have ever read, it's supposed to say something like \"because the oxen stumbled\". Other than that, it is sufficient. I would appreciate it if my opponent could in turn show me where in the Bible the punishment for using birth control was laid out. 1. Failure ratesOf course you can easily screw it up. You can even more easily screw up NFP. Refer to my source. I am positive that the pill does not have an 8 percent failure rate with perfect use, perhaps with imperfect uses factored in it may average to 8%. I have found a source that supports my opponent's figures, but clearly shows NFP with a much greater failure rate [1]. I highly doubt that NFP has a below one percent effectiveness rate, and my claim of this is bolstered by my opponent's lack of sources.2. Pill CancerMost research appears to support the conclusion that after you stop taking the pill, the risks go back down. Additionally, the pill protects against some types of cancer [2]. 3. Condom CancerAs my opponent's source does not link me to the article in question, I cannot address this argument fully. For now, I will merely quote my opponent's own source \"Local government officials said condom users should not stop using rubber contraceptives based on results of the study because N-Nitrosamine does not present an immediate health danger.\". 4. Condoms and HPVMy source from last round disagrees, claiming it does provide some protection against HPV. Even if they don't protect against HPV, my opponent has not contested that condoms provide protection against a variety of other STDs. Contrast this with NFP, which provides no protection against any STDs. 5. NFP and DivorceI will merely quote the second line of my opponent's source here. \"First, couples with strong relationships may be more likely than other couples to choose to practice NFP.\". That is to say, couples use NFP because they have strong relationships, not they have strong relationships because they use NFP. This supports my argument. In addition, this means nothing for two people who are not a couple. 6. Abortions I concede this point in general. However, contraceptives that clearly do not cause abortions, such as condoms, cannot be said to cause abortions and therefore they prevent them. Contraceptives help prevent conception. They protect against STDs. They are far superior to NFP. My opponent's primary source is probably biased. For all these reasons, the resolution is affirmed.

You may want to consider that just because it is now more accessible doesnt guarantee that teenagers will still go and buy them. Also consider the fact that they must be used correctly. There are many birth control contraptions that could do quite a bit of damage to the teenager if they use it improperly, sometimes birth control pills and such are linked to causing many problems in an individual Yaz: a birth control product used by millions of women was found to be linked to horrible side effects such as blindness, in some cases cancer, strokes, etc. and that is just ONE of the DOZENS of birth control supplements out there on the market. You claim that parents dont want to let their kids have sex because they will get pregnant and that sex is safe with birth control, perhaps you have never heard of things called STD's.... STD's, as we all know, are sexually transmitted diseases and there is no form of birth control on the market that prevents against the passing of any STD from one individual to another.

Lots of developing countries don\"t have ability providing every child to school. If they publish birth control policy, they can give more children opportunity to come to school. In some developing countries, family don\"t let girls come to school. I know some of the reason is about culture and religion, but female education always affect countries\" development. From the research, we can know that most women who had higher education will implement a better family plan, they know how to take care of birth control and how to respect new life. Women without higher education may not good on this aspect. \"Laxenburg, Austria - 28 July 2011 -- Future trends in global population growth could be significantly affected by improvements in both the quality and quantity of education, particularly female education.\" (Regan, L. 2011) From this article we can see that the population growth have lots of things to do with female\"s education level. Because \"more educated women generally have fewer children, better general health, and higher infant survival rates\" (Regan, L. 2011).\"The education was related to \"human quality\", which means education \"affects health, economic growth, and democracy, these projections provide a more comprehensive picture of where, how, and under what conditions human well-being is increasing.\" (Regan, L. 2011). From the article, we can find out that if developing country provide more opportunity to female, the society will improve a lot. \"The population problem is integrally linked with justice for women in particular. Advancing gender equity, through reversing the various social and economic handicaps that make women voiceless and powerless, may also be one of the best ways of saving the environment, working against global warming and countering the dangers of overcrowding and other adversities associated with population pressure. The voice of women is critically important for the world's future\"not just for women's future.\" (Mia. M. 2003) The author mainly discussed the measure to help woman have higher education level. The author believes that it is very important for young woman realize the responsibility they have for give birth and raise children. The author thinks that the primary education should have the duty to teach young girl about the life\"s meaning and respects of people\"s life. School should have sex educational curricula to lead young women realized the importance of taking safety measures during the sexual life. If developing countries can have more education resource for each child, the can make family plan education universal.",

            "premise": "First, let\"s understand how birth control pills work in your body. Typically, your body ovulates once a month, ripening a new egg that will then journey down a fallopian tube. Eventually it reaches the uterus, where it would implant, if fertilized. If not fertilized by a sperm, then the lining of the uterus that had built up in preparation for the fertilized egg is unnecessary. Both egg and uterine lining leave your body, cleansing your system and preparing for a new month. When you take birth control pills, you impose synthetic hormones on your natural cycle. Many birth control pills contain high levels of estrogen that effectively convince your pituitary gland that you are pregnant (this explains some of the side effects of the drugs) and that you don\"t need to ovulate. Because your body thinks you are pregnant, the uterine lining thickens. Once you start the placebo pills, however, your estrogen level drops suddenly, and your body menstruates \"normally.\" This abnormal cycle is what millions of women experience every month, and yet few doctors discuss the consequences of taking these prescriptions for year after year.",

If there are more children, there will be a smaller proportion of children going to school, but there will be many more children in school than if there are fewer children. Basically, let's say you have 100 kids. They represent the children of the nation without birth control policies. Of the 100, let's say 65 go to school. That's 65%, and not a great number. But now let's only have 50 kids. They represent the children of the nation with birth control policies. Of the 50, let's say 40 go to school. That's 80%, and a pretty great number. But do you see the problem? Yes, the number is much better with fewer children, 25% larger. But the number of students attending school is much smaller, 25 students smaller. If there are more children, more will go to school. Also, the argument that women having more children is somehow A). Denying them of having a voice. and B). contributing to global warming is nonsense. Global warming is factories.

NFP is much more effective than BC, and has no harmful side effects. BC is known to cause breast cancer and many other serious health problems such as blood clots and strokes in very young as well as older women. Couples who use BC have an incredibly high divorce rate, while couples who use NFP have a divorce rate below one percent. So if you cannot financially support a child or you have another just reason to avoid pregnancy than use NFP. Contraception does not reduce the numbers of abortions. Contraception has very high failure rates, but most people are unaware of this, and because of the high availability of contraception there is a much higher number of people having sex than if it was not available, than when the contraception fails, abortion is often seen as the alternative. While it true that condoms can reduce the risk of some STD's they do not protect against the most common STD, HPV, and they actually increase the number of people infected with aids and other STD's for the same reason they increase the number of abortions.",

            "conclusion": "Welfare Recipients Should Be Subject to Mandatory Birth Control",
            "premise": "Thank you to my opponent for his timely reply. In the interests of clarity, I shall explain my definition further for the benefit of Con. My statement was: \"For the purpose of this debate, I\u2019d like to clarify that the word \u201cwelfare\u201d will mean benefits or resources typically provided to the average non-recipient through wages earned, or through an employer. These could include healthcare benefits, cash payments, food assistance, or housing.\" What this refers to is the fact that the average citizen (a non-recipient of welfare) receives those benefits from their wages, or their employer through a benefits package--wherea welfare recipients get those things from the government instead of a job. My apologies for not being clearer. Rebuttal: R1: Abortion The resolution clearly states that the birth control methods presented for debate are preventative, not post-event. Abortion is not considered a method of preventative birth control simply because it does not prevent pregnancy, only birth. According to contracept.org, \u201cAlthough most abortions are performed for birth control, they are by no means contraceptive.\u201d [1] In addition, one women\u2019s health site states that \u201cAbortions are not meant to be used as a regular form of birth control; if you are having sex and do not want to get pregnant, use a reliable form of contraceptives.\u201d [2] Even for those who are pro-abortion, the idea of using the procedure to substitute for responsible sexual behavior is generally ill-advised due to the psychological and emotional factors involved in the decision to abort Con\u2019s argument that we must allow abortion \u201cas an option for people who have to fulfill the burden YOU put on them in the first place\u201d mistakenly assumes that putting restrictions on reproduction for citizens who have demonstrated an inability to be self-sufficient places a \u201cburden\u201d on them at all. The burden is completely voluntary, much like drug testing for employment, or handgun ownership. People who wish to engage in certain activities accept that they will need to engage in those activities within the framework of responsible restrictions. Those who wish to drive a car must both insure that vehicle and adhere to driving laws, or they will have their driving privileges temporarily removed. It is a contract that citizens enter into: I want you to allow me to do X, and so I agree to do it within Y conditions. The same principle is in effect here: I want/need welfare benefits because I cannot support myself/my family, therefore I agree to not exacerbate the financial hardship in my home by adding to the number of mouths I have to feed. In reality, the \"burden\" in question is on the rest of society, who is expected to foot the bill for this irresponsible conduct. R2: Best Option Con argues that \u201cthere is an access issue here to birth control,\u201d but ignores that the pill is not the only form of contraception. In fact, there are several types of contraception available at any drug store. To shrug off a pregnancy by saying \u201cI just didn\u2019t have any around the house when he got out of jail\u201d is, as before stated, demonstrative of a lack of personal responsibility. The \u201cissue of organization\u201d is a nice way of saying that these people, and others like them, exhibit a lack of willingness to take responsibility for their actions. R3: The Biblical Procreation Argument Con is correct that Genesis commands Adam and Eve to procreate. This may be because they were the only two people on Earth at that time. Since Con has decided to use the Bible as a credible source, I will also offer the following verses in rebuttal: \"Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.\" \u2013Ephesians 6:4 \u201cIf anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either.\u201d \u2013 II Thessalonians 3:10 R4: Evolution and Diversity Con argues in A1 that my proposal is advocacy for abortion on demand as a method of post-event birth control. However, now he claims that welfare babies promote genetic diversity in the human species? In addition, Con\u2019s diversity argument has racial implications, since \u201cdiversity\u201d refers to minorities. I present the following cross-examination questions: a) How can welfare babies promote genetic diversity if they\u2019re being aborted under Con\u2019s abortion-on-demand scenario? b) How is Con so certain that preventing these pregnancies at all will result in \u201cless diversity,\u201d if he offers no statistics on the breakdown of welfare mothers by race? c) Which situation is Con actually advocating for: aborting welfare babies, or not? R1 and R4 are contradictory. R5: Military Recruitment Con characterizes disabled American combat veterans as people who look \u201cmore like Freddy Krueger who has being dis figured in military combat and also is in a wheel chair cause they had their legs blown off [sic].\u201d This is offensive, demeaning, and completely unrelated to the topic at hand. Con then degenerates his argument into a hodge-podge of anti-military and anti-Bush sentiment that not only does not advance his topic or argument whatsoever, but is factually incorrect (8700 National Guardsmen served in Vietnam, and 75,000 of them served in the First Gulf War, proving that enlisting in the Guard is not exactly the best way to avoid combat). [3] His assertion that \u201cunder Pros [sic] plan there will be less of these poor desperate people [to fight in wars].\u201d However, under Con\u2019s plan as outlined in A1, those \u201cpoor, desperate people\u201d would have been aborted anyway. Con wraps up with another unrelated statement that mandatory birth control for welfare recipients \u201cweakens our resolves and emboldens the enemy.\u201d Again, this has literally nothing to do with the stated resolution of this debate, nor does it come close to rebutting it.

So we're clear, no one is forcing the owners of Hobby Lobby to take birth control they morally object to. Don't take them if you don't want to. No one is forcing employees of Hobby Lobby to take birth control they object to. Don't take them if you don't want to. The only force being applied is the corporation Hobby Lobby is forcing it's employees to take certain kind of birth control. Why should one's employer's religious views be imposed upon the healthcare available to me? Here's what Hobby Lobby should be worried about - Does the employee show up on time? Do the employee work hard? That's all an employer should be worried about. The tradition standard of what kind of insurance the corporation decides to provide remains unanswered, but could make for plenty of cost-savings for the company and plenty of \"buying it yourself, we've determined your insurance isn't going to cover that.\" China is brought up because it calls into question the true motivation of Hobby Lobby. Is this really a religious objection, a way to save money, or just a political ploy? Religious objection's in this area (non-abortion that Hobby Lobby believes is abortion), but not in other areas on the exact same issue of abortion. Viagra is a salient point because it has no medical benefit besides erections, whereas birth control is used for legitimate medical issues beyond preventing pregnancy. This flies in the face of the overtly sexist, \"why don't you buy your own?\" argument. Sex being a federally protected class. Boner pills - yay! Birth control - no! Buying your own is hard when you're making minimum wage at Hobby Lobby, especially hard if you have another mouth to feed because you couldn't afford the birth control to begin with. Meanwhile, Viagra, Cialis, and vasectomies are covered.",

China has the second largest economy in the world. A developing country could not be so large and powerful. Basically, using China as your prime example of birth control is not valid because China is not a developing country. Finally, look at the consequences of their one-child policy. What was once a thriving population is now decreasing and aging. Rapidly. By 2020, the elderly population will have increased by 60%, and the population would be 400 million below where it would be if it had never instituted the policy.

There are many ways that are not an abortion that can be used before to prevent a birth. The Planned Parenthood website lists 20 different forms of birth control, many of which come at no charge. These different forms of birth control when used in tandem can reduce the risk of a birth to practically zero. These forms of birth control include but are not limited too: Abstinence Birth Control Implant (Implanon and Nexplanon) Birth Control Patch Birth Control Pills Birth Control Shot (Depo-Provera) Birth Control Sponge (Today Sponge) Birth Control Vaginal Ring (NuvaRing) cervical Cap (FemCap) Condom Diaphragm Female Condom Fertility Awareness-Based Methods (FAMs) IUD Morning-After Pill (Emergency Contraception) Spermicide Withdrawal (Pull Out Method) This slue of methods are all viable methods of preventing a birth. Unborn babies are in fact currently protected by the law. There is a current federal law called \"The Unborn Victims of Violence Act\" of it recognizes a child in utero as a legal victim. The law defines \"child in utero\" as \"a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb\". This means legally a crime can be committed against a baby, such as murder. Currently as it stands the law sees unborn children as human and all humans have the right to life. No one has a right to rob someone of the right to life, not a mother, not a father, no one. Finally doctors who perform an abortion are in violation of the Hippocratic Oath which all doctors must take. \"I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.\" is a line from the modern Hippocratic Oath. Killing a baby when there are other alternatives is in direct violation of the statement against over treatment. As long as any other option exists a doctor should not carry out an abortion, because the thing a doctor must hold most sacred, a human life, is at stake.",

            "premise": "Black people do not cause any \"trouble,\" as you put it. They are rational, peaceful human beings, just like us. You are unable to justify your argument that black people have some kind of inward tendency toward violence because that statement is not true by any means. We do not have to charge black people for coming into the world any more than we charge white people- essentially zilch, apart from normal hospital expenses. You are mentally ill. You also claim that the tax will be placed SPECIFICALLY to force black people not to have children. That's a corrupt plot. If they are too poor to pay your outrageous tax, they should not have to get an abortion. They'll just go out and get a live birth without the help of doctors in your twisted totalitarian society. Also, I've never heard of abortion making women happier. I'd assume it makes them pretty sad, since their kid just died, and you never provided any links which say abortion makes women happy. I'm pro abortion, but I do believe it should be an option, not some kind of mandatory population control. I think life is a basic right, it's one of the basic rights outlined in the Constitution of America. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Life is not a privilege. Things which want to live should be allowed to live. Murder and population control are both infringements of basic human rights. If we ever encounter population crises, then birth control pills will be doled out accordingly, but not with different biases to certain races. Life should not only be a privilege to rich people. If a poor person can make a good parent, and can raise a child without much money, then they have the right to have a kid. You are worrying about overpopulation before worrying is needed. We're only at 7 billion right now, and I'm sure there are more practical ways to solve overpopulation than to make birth more expensive to certain people and then raise the price with the malicious intent to prevent those people from reproducing.",

            "premise": "Every human being has rights, even if they cannot voice their wants or needs themselves. A baby in the womb IS a human being at conception, no matter how you spin it. Just because the baby is \"a part\" of the mother does not mean the mother should kill her baby. Technically, the baby is a part of the mother, but the baby itself is a unique human being all it's own -- why should the mother be able to kill her baby since it has no way to defend his or herself? If a woman were to \"accidentally\" get pregnant, she would be a tad unintelligent, first of all, for not using protection and being on actual birth control -- using abortion as birth control is sick. (In the case of rape, this is a tiny bit different, but less than 1% of abortions are due to rape -- also, just because the babies dad is a rapist does not mean the baby shouldn't have a chance at life.) Once you are already pregnant, there is no \"birth control\" that you can take because the baby is already alive. Killing it wont solve all your problems -- over all, it will create them. Women everywhere who have gone through with abortions that made sense to them when they were having it done feel shame and sadness and depression afterwards. The thought of that innocent baby dying because they were selfish haunts a ton of women for the rest of their lives. My opponent states that \"These babies were not supposed to live as they were being aborted, so they have no rights as a human and are not subject to being taken care of\". When someone is a murderer, do we take away their rights and punish them to death without having a trial first? No. These citizens, even guilty, retain their civil rights. A baby in the womb IS a human, as I have already stated multiple times. Let me give another example -- if a cancer patient is told he is supposed to die, should we just kill him and get it over with? After all, this person is not supposed to live so are they no longer \"subject to being taken care of\"? Should we just take the life support and the chemotherapy away from them and let them die, because they aren't supposed to live?",

I will be advocating for the devil, because I myself am against birth control.I humbly request that the sole source of scripture in this debate be the Biblia Sacra Vulgata. It is the only bible I own, and consequentially the only one I fully trust. It is a (the) Catholic bible, and therefore should be fully credible to my opponent. I am also willing to accept the New American Standard bible if necessary.Also, if I choose to use any secular arguments, I ask that they be given the same weight as religious ones. Obviously I am arguing the position in contrast to that of the Roman Catholic Church, and so I cannot win by using only their teachings.I will now begin my argument, starting first with the story of Onan. As it says in the Biblia Sacra Vulgata (Genesis 38:8-10)\"(8) dixit ergo Iudas ad Onam filium suum ingredere ad uxorem fratris tui et sociare illi ut suscites semen fratri tuo(9) ille sciens non sibi nasci filios introiens ad uxorem fratris sui semen fundebat in terram ne liberi fratris nomine nascerentur(10) et idcirco percussit eum Dominus quod rem detestabilem faceret\" [1] It is indeed easy to see how this might be taken as an argument against contraception. \"[Onan] sui semen fundebat in terram\", and in that way made God angry at him. But why was God angry? It is never specifically stated why. He could have been mad at Onan for not giving his brother's wife a child, for being disobedient, for polluting the ground, for any number of things. This is quite clearly a specialized case, as Onan was given a specific task which he clearly rejected. It is equally probable that God was angry at him for shirking his duty as it is that God struck against him for using contraception.My case:1. Contraception allows for planningContraception prevents children from springing up inconveniently. If you barely have any money and you're living in a dumpster, surely you do not want a child? Contraception can prevent children from being born into horrible lives.2. Contraception can prevent abortionWhich is worse? It is clearly much better to use contraception than to get an abortion. As it is unreasonable to expect no one to have sex, contraceptions save lives by preventing abortions.3. Forms of contraceptives prevent STDSSTDS are bad. Some contraceptives prevent them. Therefore, contraceptives are good.I will shore up my case in the next round. I again thank my opponent for giving me the opportunity to argue devil's advocate for the first time.Sources:1.

            "premise": "Thanks again con for accepting this debate. I will reply in order with your comments. \"Unenforceable\" --It wouldn't be difficult to check for things like the age of the mother, how far along she is, and whether or not she was a victim of rape or incest. There would be patient confidentiality as always, of course. Would there still be underground abortions? Maybe...but should we feel bad for people who break the law? If they weren't raped, they put themselves in such a position. \"Abortion is a complex issue to which even the opposition to it tends to agree that it's a valid medical procedure, unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\" --I completely agree. Such problems are further compounded by high cost of medical care even if nothing goes wrong, which one expert summarized as: \"So how much does it cost to have a kid without insurance? According to my experience, just about $12,638.31\" --This is a problem with our healthcare industry that needs to be corrected also. That said, many would argue that you should not have a child if you can't afford one. Attempting to have no exceptions to allow abortion, leads to the level of negative intelligence seen in the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's \"legitimate rape\" --Do you mean no exceptions other than medical or rape? I already conceded those as morally neutral. However once decent and logical exceptions to allow it are in place, it becomes foolish to try to over regulate under what circumstances a woman is allowed the procedure.. --The problem is figuring out what's decent and logical. \"For rape or incest (both illegal in the USA), would a conviction be required before she gets the procedure, or a mere accusation?\" --Good point. I would say on accusation for obvious reasons, but if she turns out to be lying she should go to jail. False rape accounts are uncool, whether to hurt a guy or dodge parental responsibility. But I doubt a lot of women would lie about such a thing. \"Good decisions include financial decisions. Pregnancy as proven above, is very often a bad decision for such.\" --So we should address the problem with an easy cop out? This is going to increase responsibility amongst youth and young women? When they know they can have unprotected sex and get pregnant over and over and have abortions? And then one day when they want to get pregnant and find that they can't due to scarring? Is this really teaching them to face their choices head on and do the right thing? \"If any man claiming to be the father was enough to prevent (or delay until genetic testing is done) an abortion, there would probably be nutjobs activists going in and claiming to have fathered the child of any woman entering an abortion clinic\" --LMAO!! You are probably right. But they get those anyways...and paternity tests are not uncommon especially when applying for state assistance anyways. Tanif requires one, for instance, at the father's expense if the child turns out to be his. Like 90$ \"No option is guaranteed. Further getting into these moral areas, some states have inflicted the social experiment of teaching abstinence only, leading directly to increased pregnancy rates among the already financially disadvantaged\" --Few things in life are guaranteed, save death and taxes. Birth control methods mentioned above are 90-99% effective. Abortion also has a chance of causing infertility or even infection and death in rare cases. Speaking of the financially disadvantaged, the poor, minorities, and women under 25 are most likely to seek abortions. This is inherently tied to socioeconomics, and THAT is where we should begin in trying to address these issues of birth control, parenthood, and poverty that leads to abortions. \" In the United States alone, there are millions of women like me, spending at least some of their waking life in an agony of anxiety and longing and hope and prayer and grief, trying everything from herbal supplements to special lubricants to expensive pills to having holes drilled in their ovaries to get pregnant. They obsessively pee on sticks to the point that it becomes a literal addiction, and many of them suffer repeated, heart-wrenching miscarriages. Meanwhile, every day, 125,000 women a day pay a doctor to murder the miracle we would literally give our right arms for.\" -- http://www.lifesitenews.com... \"You can look at any chart showing historical fertility rates in the United States and see it bottom out after the Roe v Wade decision in 1973 and staying around those levels. Because fewer and fewer are working for every retiree, our current level of taxation nowhere near covers what the requirements for Social Security and Medicare will soon be.\" -- http://townhall.com...",

Young women stupid enough to get pregnant don't seem to understand what they have created. A baby is not a consequence. It is a life. Now I understand you don't think abortion is right. That is your opinion. Good for you. Its not mine. Abortion should not be an easy way out but it should be a choice for someone who emotionally or physically need it.

Abortions can cost anywhere from $320-2000+ without insurance to cover any portion of that. With insurance, any co-pay you might have would again be more than probably 2 boxes of those condoms. So if you haven't completely abandoned your personal and social responsibilities already, you can hold your head high and say that you, at the very least, purchased insurance to help in such an instance. Even then, you're robbing everyone with that carrier because you abandoned your responsibilities. To your third point, a somewhat slower population growth may help the environment, true. In many ways though, we are accelerating our capabilities to do things in a more Green fashion because of the rate we are at. There would have been little movement to make solar anything big, or make hybrid cars, or anything like that back in a time where the population was spread as thin as it was in the 1800's (and there wasn't). And the fourth, I think it's hard for you to claim anything based on human nature as a \"savings\". Also, I'd like to mention how counter intuitive your financial plan for savings is. You plan to reduce your taxpayer base and also save money on the very thing you propose those taxpayers fund! If it is public funded it will be a tax. It will need management and gov't employees. I'd really like to see how you plan to reduce the cost of that $10 box of condoms for every person in the nation by 1) reducing the number of people as a whole helping to pay into this thing, 2) hiring people to distribute or at least administer hospitals to distribute these things freely and equally, 3) funding constant ad campaigns and classes to ensure the public knows about them. This is essentially what you're asking for. Some points for you: 1) They don't use them now, what makes you think they'll use them later. I don't find many people telling me they didn't use protection because the cost was high honestly. They're more apt to say \"I didn't know\" or that \"it doesn't feel the same\", or something on those lines. 2) As far as money \"saving\" goes you're only counting the savings for people who are more prone to buy them. For someone who doesn't need them, want them, or is responsible enough to take care of their business ... every single one of them you make pay into this system is putting them in the red. Every single one of their dollars spent is towards a product they don't even get which is wasteful spending in my book. You can show the average cost to have gone down but you're subsidizing that discount on everyone else's dime. Here's a link for those abortion cost claims I made above since I didn't know this info before the argument, and had always just assumed it. Apparently it was just common sense, though, that it'd be quite an expensive procedure. http://health.costhelper.com...",

If she is lying, she should go to jail (or jeuvie).\"Her confidentiality! One of the key issues to Roe v Wade, and the 14th Constitutional Amendment; which the reason to reject has been refuted (the drop in birth rates, which actually happened prior to it).The amount of courage it would take for one of these girls to report her father, is immeasurable. Demanding she either birth her father's (or other relatives) child, or attempt to send someone she loves (due to Stockholm syndrome [11]) to prison and face everyone knowing what happened (school bullying etc), is a borderline evil choice. Of course she might go a third option and seek an underground abortion, \"but should we feel bad for people who break the law?\" I'm guessing according to pro the answer is no, and that anything which goes wrong is acceptable collateral damage because she's a lawbreaking criminal. I highly disagree with this sentiment.Proving that she is lying is pretty hard: \"That's why we have polygraphs\"It's a subjective test easily influenced by emotions, proven too unreliable to be used in court, and you wish to send people to prison and force them to bare children if they fail it? Granted in prison they don't have to go bankrupt over it, but that is another very poor solution to the social problems in question.\"Giving them a silent abortion and sending them on their way isn't going to help rape victims get justice or feel better in the end.\"Rape is the one crime to which the victim is placed on trail, sometimes more so than the accused (comparing her to Satan, is acceptable behavior). This proposal would likely backfire on this proposed benefit of more convictions, as women receiving an abortion for rape would have to live in fear of failing their trail; thus encouraging them to either get an underground abortion or suck it up and give birth to the rapists offspring. I hope we can both agree those are both horrible options, and a victim should never be placed in a position to have to consider such.I believe the above serves very effectively to refute the \"Case1\" and \"Case2\" false dilemma fallacy.\"You seem to be focusing mostly on problems with our legal system now.\"Yes. We both live in the United States, therefore I assumed this debate is over the United States today, not some utopia with universal health care etceteria.While I never called abortion an \"easy out,\" a woman not needing the permission of men to make medical decisions that often affect her for the rest of her life, is an \"awesome right\" they have in western society. Should medical advances allow men to carry the children for them, which would actually satisfy the Roe v Wade ruling in regards to when it's too late to have an abortion (sustainability even if by artificial means), than this issue would be worth revisiting.\"it actually blinds them to their rights to enjoy parenthood and live comfortably like the rich people who can have as many kids as they want and not worry about it.\"Your arguments have begun to directly contradict themselves, for example: \"many would argue that you should not have a child if you can't afford one.\" \"Minorities and young women are far more likely to have abortions, as are the poor\" I believe I have already countered with the cost of merely birthing a child (\"$12,638.31\") being more than enough to bankrupt someone, forcing that cost upon them would only maintain whomever is in the lower class staying there.\"There is also a choice long before the point of considering an abortion, of whether to have sex, with whom, and how.\"Seriously? You point out that people \"should not have a child if you can't afford one,\" and then imply if they don't have that money they shouldn't have sex either? Or is this a plea for them to restrict themselves to same sex sex? ... If relying with the \"how,\" keep in mind that abstinence only programs have failed badly, yet are still inflicted upon youths; those programs as their name implies, excludes the teaching such things as how to use a condom [12].Reminder:As things stand right now...My sources have gone unchallenged, pro's have been refuted. However some of my conduct is questionable.The suggested changes seem to apply to a utopia, whereas attempting to enforce them risks a dystopia of Victim Blaming (subjectively rejecting my \"unenforceable\" motion, as such a society as that, really could enforce it).In my opinion there has yet to be a clear reason to reject either Roe V Wade or the 14th Constitutional Amendment.Sources:[11] http://counsellingresource.com...[12] http://rhrealitycheck.org...",

            "premise": "1. Employees have EARNED their health care benefits \u201cIndirect Compensation definition Non-monetary remuneration provided to employees, including annual leave, overtime allowance, health insurance, life assurance, company car and mobile and pension funds. Note that both \u2018standard\u2019 contractual features (annual leave) as well as valuable benefits (health care) can be included in indirect compensation. Indirect compensation compares to direct compensation, which is monetary remuneration paid directly to employees for their services, starting with a basic salary. The total remuneration package is a combination of direct compensation and indirect compensation.\u201d Source: http://www.hrzone.com... For their work, employees are compensated by direct and indirect compensation. Direct income is their regular paycheck. Indirect compensation (see the definition above) includes health insurance. In other words, employees have earned their benefits. 2. Employers do not have the right to restrict how employees spend their salary Since employees have earned their salary and their benefits, so these are rightfully theirs. So employers can decide how to spend their own money, but they cannot decide how the employees spend their money. It is the same for indirect compensation. Employers cannot take away part of the employee\u2019s indirect compensation that they are legally entitled to. Should a Hindu, Buddhist or Jainist employer be allowed to reduce the salary of an employee if they spend part of their salary on eating meat? The employer would argue, that it is against his religion to pay for slaughtering animals. http://en.wikipedia.org... Suppose that the employer is a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, whose faith does not allow blood transfusions. Should the government make an exception and not require that the health insurance covers blood transfusions? http://en.wikipedia.org... If I am a pacifist, should I be allowed not to pay taxes, if some of these taxes are spent on wars that I do not approve of and go against my conscience? This kind of logic does not make sense. Christian business owners look at this the wrong way. They are not responsible for the choices of their employees. Their concern that they are birth control products is misplaced. Here is a solution: The health care premiums of employees whose object to birth control, will only go towards non-birth control costs. And a larger share of the health care premiums of all other employers will go to birth control costs. This way, all employers will still pay the same, but Christian Business Owners no longer have to have the feeling that they are paying for birth control. Of course the \u201csolution\u201d above means no change at all in practice. It is a psychological solution to a psychological problem of perception. 3. price of non-compliance \u201cFaith\u201d cannot be an excuse to break the law. So there is no problem with fining business who break the law. These Christian business owners can use the political process to change the law. Until then, they have to obey the law. This is the democratic process. 4. discrimination? Opponent: \u201cDefinitely not in all businesses, but it isn't unrealistic to suggest you would see businesses hiring men instead of women to avoid covering costs of birth control insurances.\u201d Because of the affordable care act, health insurance companies are not allowed to charge more health care premiums for woman than for men. In other words, the affordable care act prevents gender discrimination. So, the affordable care act does not allow health insurance companies to charge extra to cover for birth control products. http://www.care2.com... 5. Religious freedom of employees Freedom of religion is limited when the freedom of religion takes away the right of other people. We also have to take into account the religions freedom of the employee. For example, the religion of the employee may require the employee to prevent unnecessary suffering. If the employee is pregnant with an embryo that will be born with birth defects, will have severe pain, and will have only a short time to live. It may well be employee\u2019s opinion, that a termination is the moral thing to do according to her faith. The infringement of the employees rights could be seen as religious bullying as explained in the following opinion piece: http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Conclusion Employees have earned their benefits, and employers have not the right to make decisions against the coverage that the employees are entitled to according to the law. The argument that the Affordable Care Act might lead to discrimination is invalid, because the Affordable Care Act prevents gender discrimination.",

            "premise": "Fundamentally this argument comes down to a simple question, does teaching abstinence work? I would strongly argue the fact that abstinence has for too long been the accepted method of teaching about sex and wrongly. I firstly want to compare two methods of teaching about sex, the first being the US where abstinence is the generally preferred route and the second being Europe where the sex-positive approach is taken. By sex positive I mean that as the society understands that teenagers are going to have sex, that they will have sex. My case in point being the USA in which the Teenage pregnancy rate was 7% in 2006, now you may think that this number is \"low\" but when compared to the figure for example of the Netherlands you can clearly see the difference. In Holland only 0.7% of teenagers become pregnant. This equates to only 7 in every 1000 and is 10 times less than in the USA. Now if we look at how sex is taught in each country I think it becomes obvious why. In the USA as mentioned abstinence is the preferred method with 34% of schools teaching abstinence only with _no_ teaching at all of birth control methods. This method is irresponsible as teenagers are going to have sex, however much you teacher them or whatever laws are in place humans are sexual creatures and natural urges are going to prevail. Teaching students about sex and how sex can be positive rather than portrayed as negative will help them to makes better informed choices about what they want to do. Creating a false dichotomy between having children equals having sex and no sex equals no children is a vast simplification which scares people and hides the facts. In your post you make the point that schools should not teach students about sex and it should be the parents' responsibility and to counter this I would like to present an analogy. If you were a farmer and wanted to find out whether to farm sheep or pigs would you either ask your uninformed parents to make the decision for you or an informed expert to present the facts about which is best? I would argue that it is better that someone who was informed taught. In order to make informed choices it is important that contraceptives are readily available and if needs be free. Removing the barriers to create a simple choice in which everyone can make.",

Why is there a death penalty set down in our court systems? Because yes, killing is necessary for people who for example are serial killers. They should be killed off instantly. That is why killing is necessary. But not for a poor little baby who has no choice in the matter whether or not they were created. Just for example, what would happen if every single person who murdered someone was instantly put to death themselves? That would mean that every single abortionist would be put to the death penalty because what are they doing? They are MURDERING innocent little humans who cannot even attempt to get away. There is no way to get around it, abortion is murder, period. I guess the only thing that kind of does not make sense about your last argument is that you said that \"[a life] should not just be cast aside like nothing.\" Well, in the scenario with the teenager, your basically saying that should happen. But in the case with the woman who gets rapped, your saying that the alternative other than \"casting it aside\" should be ultimate death? Besides the fact that there are many adoption agencies out there, how would that be casting them aside? There are plenty of couples out there who would love to have a baby, but for one reason or another the woman can not get pregnant, so therefore thier only option is to adopt. That is where the children should go if their birth mother does not want them. Not to mention, how do you know for a 100% fact that a teenager amy not understand just as much if not more the decision about abortion? Yes, the children we bare are the future. But how do you know that that one child put to instant death before it even left its mothers womb was going to come up with the cure for the common cold, or for cancer, or HIV and AIDS? Yes, you could also say \"well how do you know that maybe they would be the next Hitler?\" The answer to both those questions is you really don't know until you let it happen. If one of those babies would have been the next Hitler, then yes, ultimate death, but only IF it would get to that point.

            "premise": "I thank Pro for their reply.Although I raised some objections there is only one I really want to focus on going into this last round.Objection 1: Birth control and abortionPreviously I argued that abortion would help in achieving Pros aims, as well as NOT allowing abortion is detrimental to Pros goal of not having welfare recipients having a baby while on welfare. Pro doesn't seem to challenge that Pros policy would be more effective with abortion as an option.Pro distorts their own source as Pro says...\" I gave two reputable (with one being pro-choice) sources stating that abortion is not a method of birth control.\" but Pro sources says...\" In addition, one women's health site states that \"Abortions are not meant to be used as a regular form of birth control; if you are having sex and do not want to get pregnant, use a reliable form of contraceptives.\"\"This source merely makes the point that abortion shouldn't be the primary form of birth control, my objection already made this assumption. I am not making the objection based that abortion should be the primary form of birth control in Pros policy.So once again, what reason did Pro gives us that although abortion will help in achieving their policy goals never the less Pro prohibits abortion in their policy ? Pro at best tries to hide behind their own resolution. This doesn't address the question nor does it refute the points I have continually made about abortion being helpful in what Pro wishes to achieve here.I think I have made the discrepancy quite clear here, and for the Pro life advocate this position at the very least is quite worrisome if not untenable.Until this discrepancy is sorted out, I think this gives a good reason not to adopt Pros policy concerning welfare recipients and mandatory birth control.The Religious Procreation ArgumentPro straight of the bat decides to talk about me personally, rather than engage the argument, as Pro says...\"This entire segment is pointless, as Con is on record in multiple debates arguing against the existence of God, generally seen as the Divine Author of the Bible. This means that not even Con agrees with Biblical theology,\"Trouble is you can't really tell what my views are from my past debates as I just love playing devils advocate. But this is entirely irrelevant and a red herring, as I could be the reincarnation of Adolf Hiter currently being the leader of the scientolgists and the argument still stands. Its not the person that Pro has to refute but the argument. Pro says...\"At no time is there a command for all mankind to irresponsibly conceive over and over with no thought to consequences.\"This is making the bible say something that it doesn't say. Pro doesn't get to make up by them self what exemptions there are and say oh but this is what God really meant. Pro doesn't get to decided ok, but that is responsible and in line with genesis but that isn't. Pros policy (absent Pro as the judicator of what counts as an acceptable exemption to Gods command and what doesn't) is still in violation of the command in genesis. The argument from religion, more specifically the argument from the Christian bible of the Christian God giving the command to be \"fruitful and multiply\" still stands.Evolution and Diversity Pro says...\"\"Some how even after two long paragraphs talking about genetics & the diversity of genetics in a species, some how Pro makes this about black people.\"\"Pro is right, Pro only mentioned \"minorities\", that was a mistake on my part. Maybe Pro meant Mexicans, Asians or Blacks I dunno.Maybe Pro is confused because Pro thinks that my reference to diversity is in a racial context, it isn't. I have clearly stated it in a genetic context. As I said before...\"Under Pros proposition humans as a species will have less diversity, (read less genetically diverse). It won't just be less because a 2nd generation of welfare recipients won't exist, it has a knock on effect as those welfare recipients cause they don't exist won't have kids, and those kids who will now not exist won't exist and so on and so on.\"Genetic diversity will be less under Pros mandatory birth control plan that it would of otherwise being, thus the survivability of the human species is lessened, as I cited before...\"Genetic diversity plays a very important role in survival and adaptability of a species because when a species's environment changes, slight gene variations are necessary to produce changes in the organisms' anatomy that enables it to adapt and survive. \"This gives us a good reason to reject mandatory birth control for welfare recipients.Military Recruitment & The Economic ArgumentPro says...\"He is then advocating that we pay welfare to families so they may join the military for the express purpose of being used in war.\"This is a mis characterisation of my argument, I clearly made the argument potential recruitment's can be found from poor desperate people, and that welfare families are a good sources of such people. Its hardly the case that all welfare families will join the military.Pro says...\"I submit that \"cultivating\" a welfare-raised segment of the population for use as \"fodder\" is unreasonable to the point of incredulity, and far less humane than simply not creating this segment at all.\"Again, I only argue that the welfare family provide a sources from which to recruit, I am not arguing that they should some how be \"cultivated\". The fact that their will be desperate poor people is enough for the military to get their hands on them.Pro says...\"Lastly, Con revisits his war premise by claiming that \"USA war machines needs [sic] man power, and thus [welfare] sucks man power away from other sectors of the economy.\" Does Con have any sources to support this idea?\"No what I said was...\"This problem is made worse by the USA current war effort and future wars (yes I said future wars, we all know its going to happen, stop kidding your self). The reason it is made worse is because the USA war machines needs man power, and thus sucks man power away from other sectors of the economy.\"Pro asking for statistics hardly refutes the premise that the military needs man power. Neither does it refute the premise that as the military takes more and more man power from other sectors of the economy you need more man power to fill in the gaps. Where does Pro think the resources for the military come from ? People and bomb making factories just don't fall from the sky. Pro doesn't seem to challenge my inflation argument, or the increase in labour bargaining power from having less supply of workers and potential workers to the determinant of big business.Closing Remarks.I hope you found this debate as fun as I did, and credit to Pro for instigating a more interesting debate topic. I showed that there is a problem in Pros argument as they restrict abortion, a restriction that was never justified and for at least the Pro life advocate or those sympathetic to Pro life positions should not agree with the resolution, until the very least this issue is resolved.I also provided argument that we should NOT have mandatory birth control for welfare recipients based on a religious pro creation argument, an evolutionary and genetic diversity argument and a military economic argument. Even if you don't agree with all the arguments, even if one of the arguments is a good one, its enough to negate the resolution.I ask the vote go to the Con.I thank Pro for the debate.",

The reason it would save money is because less welfare children would be born since the lower socio-economic groups would have access to birth control. Since there would be less welfare children born, the state would not have to spend on much on welfare as they currently do. 2. Less abortions. Since all people would have access to birth control, the amount of unintended pregnancies would drop. With less unintended pregnancies, there would be a correlating effect to less abortions. 3. Good for the Environment. With slower population growth, society as a whole would become more sustainable and put less strain on the environment. 4. Good for the economy. With all the money saved from having to spend on birth control, people could spend money on other items or services (or better yet save money) which would have a positive effect on the nation. With positive economic, social, and environmental consequences, it seems unreasonable to argue that It would have a negative effect compared to the current status qua of not having birth control publicly funded.",

Are you intending to be consistent? \" 2. With the advanced medical contraceptives of today such as Condoms, Birth Control, and the Day after pill, Women have a choice whether to have a child or not. And that choice has to be made 3 days within sexual activity. With the day after pill available at local walmarts for considerably less than an abortion would cost, there is little to no reason as to not be protected. \" Condoms and other birth control methods are imperfect, and the day after pill argument assumes a false premise, because by the time you know an egg has been fertilized, it's already too late. The primary use of such a pill is as a last resort in the event of a bout of unprotected sex resulting from negligience or rape. It is, as a practical matter, useless for dealing with used but failed birth control methods. Further, the existence of alternative solutions is not sufficient to establish that something should be illegal. \"3. In America we have always been a people who have decided things by votes and opinions\" Votes are among the worst ways of deciding things, the existence of a mob that believes x is correct is not sufficient to establish that it IS correct. I'm sure if you polled Germans about Hitler back when he was in power- oh wait, that's how he got in power. :D Also, polls conflict on the question, especially when you change the wording about. \" 4. On top of that disturbing new evidence is surfacing that the fetus can feel pain during abortions after 20 weeks of conception.\" Fish feel pain too. Yet I still eat them. The sole purpose of the law is the protection of entities which happen to have rights. Rights are the limits of what behavior is proper toward a rational entity, if you violate them toward such an entity without them first violating yours, you increase the chance of them violating yours. This is the sole basis for rights. Fetuses, however, are not such an entity- they have not yet developed rationality. Neither, I should note, have some infants- it is not certain when rationality develops, but, evidence points to it being sometime after birth. Also, even were it true that fetuses were rational, the fact remains that if they are in your womb without permission, they are violating your rights- they are trespassing on your private property. Thus, the other condition on which rights are based (reciprocity) is violated. \" I challenge anyone who will take me on in this debate and will also bring up more points if the above points become exhausted, only if granted permission to by my opponent\" No holds are barred.

            "conclusion": "Welfare Recipients Should Be Subject to Mandatory Birth Control",
            "premise": "Thank you to Con for his reply. I shall now answer each of his objections.O1: AbortionCon restates his position that we must consider abortion as a valid birth control option. However, I gave two reputable (with one being pro-choice) sources stating that abortion is not a method of birth control. In addition, the resolution that I have BOP over is preventative birth control, not post-conception abortion. The point here is to stop conception, period, not come along later and abort the fetus. As for the ones that will \"slip through,\" Con correctly states that this could theoretically happen in rare cases. Unfortunately, to disregard an entire premise based on a less-than-1% chance of failure (which is what Norplant and other long-term contraception options have), is like saying we should abolish the entire prison system because once in a great while, an innocent man goes to jail. Obviously we would not do this. We would instead deal with that particular case. If birth control is administered by a doctor and still fails, then that particular baby would go on to be born and the mother would continue to receive benefits. No system is foolproof, but contraceptives administered by a health care provider would go a long way toward ensuring that errors are highly minimal.My opponent claims that mandatory birth control is \"sneaky\" because people would be forced to \"do what we tell them\" if they want their money. Anyone who is employed is already quite familiar with this premise, because that's what employment is: Doing what someone tells you, so you can have money. Plenty of people are not happy with facets of their employment, but they perform the duties because that's what is required--and without that paycheck they would be desperate. There's nothing sneaky about that. O2: Best Option/Moral Judgments\"Lack of willingness to take responsibility for their actions\" in no way denotes a moral judgment. Instead, it is a common sense argument. Adults take responsibility for themselves and their families. A moral judgment would include commentary on the fact that both case examples involve children by multiple fathers, most of whom are in and out of jail. It would also pronounce a personal opinion on the drug use of the mothers. In actuality, who these women (or men) sleep with is no one's concern; nor is it our business how often they are in jail. The only relevant point here is their demonstrated inability to financially provide for themselves. Since both of my sources--one of them being a welfare recipient--admit that they're not going to stop having children, the burden falls on taxpayers to subsidize their conduct. Does Con believe that his taxes should go to pay for the medical bills and daily sustenance for someone who has lung cancer because they chose to smoke? \"Octomom\" is a classic example as well. She was on welfare before she had her 8 babies. Do you really believe it's our job to subsidize someone who wanted to conceive babies when she already was not able to provide for the babies she had? The PRO argument is not that she shouldn't be allowed to have children at all. The argument is that she shouldn't be allowed to have babies she cannot financially provide for.All of our liberties come with responsibilities and guidelines that we must adhere to. Yes, we have freedom of speech--within reason. Yes, we have freedom of assembly--as long as its peaceable. Yes, you can have as many babies as you want--as long as you can provide for them. O3: Appeal to the MassesCon mischaracterizes my argument here. All I did was state that 62% of citizens would support a mandatory birth control law. The logical fallacy does not exist because we are talking about proposing a law in a democratic republic. Therefore, the will of the people has merit. I am not stating that my proposal is \"true\" because the masses say it is. I'm stating that the majority of the people, from a legal standpoint, support the law being passed. O4: Having More Children Con uses a quote by the Massachusetts welfare director out of context to insinuate that my argument allows welfare mothers to have more children. If we read the entire context, we see that she was talking \"about a similar program to stop additional benefits for mothers who continue to have children on welfare.\" I'm well aware that it wasn't about mandatory birth control. It was showing that similar programs are already underway because state governments are beginning to see that there is a problem. If anything, that's a perfect solution to the ones that \"slip through\" the net, as Con puts it.O5: Religious ProcreationThis entire segment is pointless, as Con is on record in multiple debates arguing against the existence of God, generally seen as the Divine Author of the Bible. This means that not even Con agrees with Biblical theology, and so his use of it to bolster his argument is hard to understand. That being said, it again becomes a matter of context. There are only 11 instances of God telling someone to \"be fruitful and multiply,\" and none of them are generalized admonitions to mankind. Three of those are to Adam and Eve, the only two people on the earth at that time. Two were to Noah, who with his family, were the only survivors of the Great Flood. One was in regard to Ishmael, the father of the Arabic nations, as God explained that he would make the Arabs a mighty people. Two were to Jacob, the father of the 12 tribes of Israel. One was to the people of Israel as part of their covenant through Moses. The last two are prophecies by Ezekiel and Isaiah, explaining to the Jews that if they would stop worshipping idols, God would bless them. At no time is there a command for all mankind to irresponsibly conceive over and over with no thought to consequences. O6: DiversityCon makes an incredible statement here in regard to my point on genetic diversity when he says that \"Some how even after two long paragraphs talking about genetics & the diversity of genetics in a species, some how Pro makes this about black people.\"Not only did I not ever mention \"black people,\" but Con straw mans here by pretending that I did, even claiming I'm obsessed with them. In addition, his own definition of \"minorities\" as being only referring to \"black people\" is flawed at its base. The lack of logic or even basic demographic understanding in this segment is surpassed only by his sarcasm.O7: Military RecruitmentThis segment is also lacking, as he claims he \"clearly provided argument that showed how the Geroge W Bushes of the world probably are not going to be signing up to fight in the military and or be getting out of actual combat.\" He somehow ties his completely unrelated point in with the topic at hand by saying \"desperate poor people are a good source of military fodder.\" He is then advocating that we pay welfare to families so they may join the military for the express purpose of being used in war. I submit that \"cultivating\" a welfare-raised segment of the population for use as \"fodder\" is unreasonable to the point of incredulity, and far less humane than simply not creating this segment at all. O8: EconomicsLastly, Con revisits his war premise by claiming that \"USA war machines needs [sic] man power, and thus [welfare] sucks man power away from other sectors of the economy.\" Does Con have any sources to support this idea?ConclusionCon's arguments are not only all over the board, but they are bolstered by less than credible sources (Wikipedia). He uses not only straw man arguments, but provides no statistical data to back up his claims that the U.S. \"war machines\" somehow reduce manpower in other facets of the economy, which is literally not related at all to the topic at hand.",

            "premise": "it is because of the peer pressure in teens lives with school, media, and music that they are having sex in the first place we all no that teens(not all ) are having sex and no matter how much the parents want to stop it teens will always be disobeying their parents. Additionally, most of pregnancies occur to unwed teen mothers. This means that even though most teens do not want to become pregnant, they are still becoming so as a result of sexual activity. While actual force to have sex is rare, many teenage girls (especially those under the age of 15) feel pressured to have sex. And, of course, the more intercourse a teenager has, the more likely it is that a teen pregnancy will eventually result. It's undeniable that kids today are maturing and growing up faster. Whether this is due to media influence or something in the meat they're eating, there is a definite sexual energy that permeates America's youth. And young teens are going to do what they do best: being sneaky and getting what they want. Three of Portland, Maine's middle schools have had a total of 17 reported pregnancies, a number that doesn't necessarily reflect any abortions or miscarriages. Whether because of outside influences or of their own accord, these students are exploring sexual avenues, and they are likely unaware of what can happen. Not all kids are comfortable approaching their parents about bodily and emotional changes. If a school can provide that service for free and guide them down a healthy path to the future, then allow that program to flourish. This won't be an enabler for kids who have already made their choice - it's going to protect them. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a report this week indicating a increase in teen birth rates for the first time in 14 years sixty-seven percent support giving contraceptives to students, according to an Associated Press-Ipsos poll. About as many \u2014 62% \u2014 said they believe providing birth control reduces the number of teenage pregnancies. (80%) of teens who have sex get pregnant unexpectedly Even though the use of contraceptives has increased among teenagers, its use remains spotty. Teens may use birth control to help prevent teen pregnancy, but most do not use contraceptives consistently. Erratic contraceptive use, however, is better than none. A sexually active teen that does not use any birth control has a 90 percent chance of becoming pregnant within a year.",

            "premise": "It is not the role of government to coerce it's citizens to fund what boils down to an obstruction of free market exchange between two consenting individuals. You have two major issues with you're position. First, if we Americans are truly free, the person who produced birth control should have the right to sell his or her product at whatever price he wishes. Then, a second party who wishes to purchase the birth control, can make an evaluation on if the utility of the product, in this case, birth control, is greater than the utility that could be otherwise provided by the money. This is part of being a free citizen. Beside the fact that a free person is able to interact with other free individuals without a third party interfering (in this case, the government), there are market issues. The lowering of the price of long term birth control artificially with government enforced price ceilings causes as an effect a mismatch between the utility provided, so consumption of the product (birth control) increases. To make this simple, would you go to the doctor more often if a visit costs you a dollar, as opposed to if it cost you $300 a visit? What if it costs the doctor $150 dollars to take a patient for an appointment? If people are going there because they suspect they have a very minor ailment (they feel tired that day, etc), that creates a problem, where there is a gap in financing that must be paid by a third party. This is what is going on here. Now people are consuming at a great that is artificially increased. Now, if you want the government to enact this by subsidizing with taxpayer money, I don't think I have any right to tell those people how their money should be spent, they earned it. If you expect them to just set a price ceiling, then who would want to produce at a price that would, more than likely, cause them to lose money. Why would I run a business that just loses me money? Then you have a shortage in the supply of long term birth control. Now either very few people will be able to get birth control, or the government has to produce it (either by paying someone or in-sourcing it). Once you enter that arena, where the government (with no efficiency motivation by profit), takes over major industries (pharmaceutical production), you have full blown communism. I could go on and on, but until I get more details, I'm going to think that you didn't fully consider the implications of what you are asking for. Even if it does provide a net positive outcome for society, the United States is a government that was founded on the idea that a government gets it's authority by the consent of a free populace. Once the government starts coercing people with the threat of force (you go to jail if you don't pay taxes), along with a monopoly on force (the military), it's not a free country. I don't think free birth control is worth being subjected to a communist government.",

            "premise": "Thank you, Con. I. Addressing Counter-Arguments/Rebuttals \"Everyone acknowledges that having sex has risks, such as protection breaking, but you should go into the action accepting that it may happen, and willing to accept the consequences. If you were worried about getting pregnant, you shouldn't have had sex in the first place. Everyone knows that condoms break. That doesn't make birth control a 'basic human right,' as Pro stated in Round 1. Keep in mind that this is the terminology that Pro used, as I will be addressing it shortly.\" Con is essentially stating in the above rebuttal that sex should be strictly procreative; that if the couple knew the risk of pregnancy and didn't want to have a baby, that having sex should not be an option to begin with. This is of course ignoring the kinds of sex a couple may have that are not physically able to procreate. To think of the birth of a child as a \"consequence\" that couples must deal with is to present the idea as though it is a burden to the family, which is proving the thesis statement that childbirth can be painful and can be a burden on the family; children are expensive to take care of and not everyone has the money to afford taking care of them. Con is right, condoms breaking doesn't make birth control a human right, what it means is that if people intend to have sex in a manner that is not procreative, and it is anatomically possible for such partners to reproduce, they should have access to birth control/contraceptives to nullify and slim the chances. The point, plan and simple, is that sex is not/should not be a strictly procreative activity in the world, and even couples capable of reproducing (i.e man & woman) can tend to have forms of sex that are not procreative. II. Addressing Con's Contentions \"Why is it the taxpayer's burden to pay for someone elses stuff? It's not like birth control is too expensive. Target sells contraceptives at a rate that would have buyers without health insurance paying $9 per month [2].\" Con is implying that the contention I am making here is that contraceptives should be distributed freely. That is not the contention I am pushing for. The contention I am pushing for is that contraceptives should be available to whomever needs them when they need them, and they should be a part of the general healthcare and freedom system of their country. A country should never be taking away the right women have to contraceptives and birth control, and just like healthcare, these things should always be available to those who want to buy them. Though it would, of course, be ideal that women get to have free contraceptives (at least for the women and their partners), it is not entirely necessary to do that. Taxpayers have a lot burdens, especially in the U.S, and paying for contraceptives to be free would be the least of their concern. \"Nobody is entitled to free stuff. This is a simple argument. Nobody has the right to free stuff because of their gender and the choices they've made. Nobody is burdened to pay for other peoples stuff. It's pretty simple.\" Does this contention address healthcare in a similar light? By revoking a woman's right to use contraceptives, one would be forcing them to raise their child and foster them away. \"Don't want to have kids? Don't have sex. Tons of people are celibate and happy. Roughly 10,000,000 Americans have waited until marriage to have sex, and were better mentally and financially prepared for a child [5]. There are a lot of ways to keep from having a child whilst not banging everything that moves.\" Again, sex should not have to be a strictly pro-creative activity between partners. Conditiong a country in a way where sex is strictly intended for reproducing is taking away plenty of basic human rights. Being celibate until marriage is also off-topic, seeing as those people intended to have children and had such for that reason specifically, not everyone does for that. What is a human right? A human right is [6] \u201cendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\u2026\u201d This is a religious issue! You cannot have an atheistic debate over rights endowed by a Creator!

Addressing Con's Questions\"Is it morally justifiable to make someone else pay for your things if you can afford them? If yes, then who can't afford $9 of contraceptives? And why should we pay for them?\"My contentions are not that contraceptives should be distributed at $0 prices. However, perhaps it would be logical to offer these contraceptives to someone through their health insurance, no?\"Is it morally justifiable to make taxpayers pay for something that they believe is a gross violation of the human rights of the foetus?\"It is ironic that con has jumped from the 'human rights' concept being a religious matter and not being material for the debate to actually using 'human rights' to justify the opposition of the right to contraceptives. May it also be on record that American taxpayers are paying for inhumane acts such as drone strikes and wars as it is, thus this would be too insignificant an amount of money to truly be a concern in the minds of taxpayers.\"Is it morally justifiable to make others take responsibility for your mistake in the bedroom?\"No, but giving women the right to have contraceptives through their health insurance isn't doing this.\"Is it morally justifiable to kill a child so you can drink and smoke for 9 months?\" This question is assuming that abortions are justified by the pregnant individual wanting to be able to drink and smoke.\"Would a just God give someone the right to kill his creation?\"Take a look at the Bible, Torah and Koran; I would say based on those books that yes, a \"just God\" according to most religious people would allow such a thing._____________________________________________________________________________________Excuse my relatively short argument, my next will have much more length to it.",

            "premise": "For ease of reference: Any quote from my opponent shall be bolded, any quote from an outside source shall be italicised. Source numbering continues across rounds, sometimes referencing back to previous sources (as opposed to source spamming the same data with a dozen extra links). Multiple quotes from within a single source, shall have the source listed at the end of that paragraph.While I shall mostly reply in order, one quote stands out too much...\"many would argue that you should not have a child if you can't afford one\"Agreed.\"It wouldn't be difficult to check for things like the age of the mother, how far along she is, and whether or not she was a victim of rape or incest.\"Really? Please explain details on this reliable test on the fetus to determine if it was the offspring of rape.Currently only an estimated 40% of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, with only 4% leading to a conviction which is half the rate prosecuted [5]. Of course some anti-abortion legislators actually claim pregnancy is proof that it was not rape [3]. I do not believe Pro falls into that camp, but it shows how scary the legal environment is for the victim.\"There would be patient confidentiality as always,\"Regarding the case of incest, a blood sample is needed from the accused father, throwing confidentiality right out the window.\"our health care industry that needs to be corrected also\"Irrelevant. While I agree, larger changes to society do not affect the issue as it currently stands. It's along the lines of how rape shouldn't be a factor, since rape really shouldn't happen.\"if she turns out to be lying she should go to jail.\"Proving that she is lying is pretty hard, and she's already likely in a bad emotional place regardless of if she is lying or not. In our legal system, her honesty would probably often be questioned by whomever has a better lawyer; often further victimizing the victim. Considering that \"15% of sexual assault and rape victims are under age 12\" and \"44% are under age 18\" [6], this continues my line of reasoning regarding inequality against the already financially disadvantaged.To bolster this point of inequality, let us consider the infamous R. Kelly trail which was delayed by his lawyers a full six years (which was vital to throwing off Jury recognition of the victim)... He literally made a \"27-minute sex tape with an under-age female. But a high-powered defense team convinced the jury of nine men and three women that the identity of the girl was not conclusive.\" The positive identity of the victim was questioned, not the clear fact that she was under aged (assuming the correct victim, a 12 year old girl). \"14 witnesses for the prosecution identified the girl in the tape, and some identified Mr. Kelly as well,\" another of his under aged victims (who was not filmed) was compared by his highly paid defense team to Satan [7].\"Birth control methods mentioned above are 90-99% effective\"Yes (aside from the mentioned pull-out-method), but we are talking about government regulation, when the government decides people shouldn't know about those methods [4].\"Abortion also has a chance of causing infertility or even infection and death in rare cases.\"Getting away from the days of underground abortions, myths based on them continue regardless of medical advancement. Today in the United States including from late term, \"the death rate for abortion is currently 0.6 per 100 000 procedures, making it as safe or safer than receiving an injection of penicillin.\" Less than half will ever seek a second abortion. Sadly connecting to the issue in the previous paragraph, \"teens are more likely than older women to delay having an abortion until 15 weeks of pregnancy, when the medical risks associated with abortion are significantly higher\" [8].\"Lifesitenews.com\"While the entire site is highly biased, this particular author is off the deep end. She writes \"violence against the zombie is reminiscent of violence against the fetus,\" thus if we are pro life we should not harm zombies (assuming they're real) or watch zombie related films? She also writes \"the reason why people are pro-abortion is not because they believe that the fetus isn\u2019t a person, but because they know that the fetus is a person, and they don\u2019t particularly like people\" [9].\"Townhall.com\"1. Slavery is a poor answer to budget problems. And yes demanding people have more kids so that those kids can give offerings to the elder caste is approaching that line. This should already be apparent considering the repeated points about legislators doing social experiments which have been proven to cause increased unplanned pregnancies [4].2. The Roe v Wade connection does not in fact line up if looking at a graph [10]. Education plays a factor, so does economic downturns. Seeing how the drop was already in place before that ruling, you've failed to raise that point to even a decent Post Hoc Fallacy, it barely even qualifies as a Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.

            "conclusion": "Contraceptives should be classified as preventative health care for insurance coverage",
            "premise": "Hi Beverlee! Thanks for accepting this debate. I just want to clarify that the scope of this debate is strictly on whether all contraceptives should be classified as preventive care, not preventive care in general nor reproductive health, which has a larger scope than just contraception.For the purpose of this debate, I am defining preventive care as \"a pattern of nursing and medical care that focuses on disease prevention and health maintenance. It includes early diagnosis of disease, discovery and identification of people at risk of development of specific problems, counseling, and other necessary intervention to avert a health problem. Screening tests, health education, and immunization programs are common examples of preventive care.\"(1)Preventive care consists of two basic functions:1. disease prevention 2. health maintenanceSome common methods of attaining said functions are:1. Screening and early diagnosis/identification2. Education and counseling3. Proactive prevention methods such as immunizationsAs you can agree, that is a pretty broad definition and there are definitely some aspects of contraception that can fall into preventive care. However, contraceptives as a whole does not meet the definition of preventive care. FDA-approved methods of contraceptives are \"hormonal (e.g., birth control pills), barrier (i.e., diaphragms), emergency contraceptives (i.e., \"morning after\" pills) and select over-the-counter (OTC) contraceptives.\"(2) \"Certain OTC contraceptives for women are covered at 100 percent including female condoms, emergency contraceptives (Next Choice\", Next Choice One-Dose\", Plan B One-Step\"), and contraceptive film, foam and gel.\"(3) I will structure my argument around the function of preventive health care and relate it to the 3 FDA-approved functions of contraceptives (as OTC contraceptives fall into one of those three categories).A. Disease PreventionOne type of barrier contraceptive (condoms) does assist in preventing the spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD). However, that is just a secondary function. I will argue that STD prevention is not a critical objective for preventive health care, the primary purpose of contraceptives is not disease prevention, and the decision to have sexual relations is a privilege, not a right.Point 1: STDs are not considered a critical objective to preventive health careI would like to highlight some diseases on the CDC website for Preventive Screening recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF):(4)1. Alcohol Misuse2. Chlamydial Infection3. Hepatitis B only for pregnant women4. HIV only for high risk persons5. Obesity in Adults6. Tobacco UseHep B and C are on the list but the USPSTF only recommends Hep B screen for pregnant women and does not recommend or is neither for nor against screening for Hep C. Also, there is a distinct absence of other STDs, such as gonorrhea, meaning that STDs, in general, are not considered part of the preventive care regimen. Point 2: The primary purpose of contraceptives is not disease prevention but pregnancy preventionSee definition of contraceptive. Also, the majority of FDA-approved contraceptives (hormonal, barrier other than condoms, and emergency) do not prevent disease. \"The condom is the only form of birth control that also protects against sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).\"(5)Point 3: Sexual activity is a choice, thus the use of condoms is a responsibility, not privilegeThe decision to be sexually active is a privilege, not right. In fact, abstinence is the only way to prevent the spread of STDs.(6) Just like purchasing care insurance, the cost of condoms for the purposes of STD prevention is the responsibility of the individual. While I fully agree that counseling for obesity or tobacco use should be included as preventive health care, the cost of tools such as gastro-bypass surgery and Nicotine patches are NOT covered by most preventive health care insurance nor required by ACA as preventative coverage. Review the Cigna Preventive Drug List and there is no category for weight loss or tobacco cessation.(7) Therefore, counseling and education on STDs should be covered by preventive care but not contraceptives such as condoms.I do not support full coverage of condoms under the guise of preventive health. Like the cost of maintaining a healthy lifestyle (gym membership, more expensive organic foods), using a condom is a personal responsibility.B. Health MaintenanceThis will probably be a greater point of contention in this debate as there are direct health benefits to the use of some contraceptives for specific individuals. I will argue that contraceptives as a whole do not promote health maintenance because only a few hormonal contraceptives help regulate health in specific circumstances and the use of contraceptives may actually be a health detriment.Point 1. Contraceptives used for health maintenance is limited to specific circumstances and typesOral birth control pills can help regulate numerous issues such as acne(8), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (a debilitating form of PMS)(9), ease menopausal symptoms/discomfort(10), and even help prevent osteoporosis(11). However, each of these are only representative of a select group of hormonal contraceptives and health situations. Not all hormonal contraceptives are helpful in each of these specific cases. Other contraceptives have no bearing on an individual's health whatsoever. For the sake of clarity, becoming pregnant is not a health maintenance issue for a normal, healthy woman.Point 2. Use of contraceptives can actually be a health detrimentAccording to the World Health Organization, \"the birth control pill increases a woman's risk for cancers of the breast, cervix and liver, but it decreases risk of endometrial and ovarian cancers.\"(12) Additionally, hormone imbalance is an issue where women may experience \"anxiety, loss of appetite, insomnia and lack of concentration...sudden weight gain, a reduced sex drive, hot flashes and night sweats\"(13) While there are several factors that can contribute to hormonal imbalance, \"more commonly, medication such as birth control pills can also throw off your body's chemistry.\"(14) Other potential side effects of oral contraceptives \"may include severe abdominal pain, chest pain, unusual headaches, visual disturbances, or severe pain or swelling in the legs\"(15) as well as \"sexual, metabolic, and mental health consequences.\"(16)Contraceptives were never designed to be a health maintenance tool. I would support the limited use of certain oral contraceptives to assist in regulating hormones as a preventive health resource, but not all contraceptives in general.(1) http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com...

            "premise": "Rebuttals: You stated, \u201cWith proper sex education, these infections could be safely prevented, or at least the rate will be significantly reduced, resulting in better sexual health.\u201d This is a kind of an assumption not supported by any evidence. You just presented statistics on young people involved in sexual intercourse, but never the relationship between sex education to safe sex. Furthermore, in your second point as stated \u201c76.7% of teens did not use birth control pills or Depo-Provera to prevent pregnancy the last time they had sex. In addition, more than half a million unplanned pregnancies occur to teens each year\u2026 What we can conclude is that we can't control whether teenagers have sex, but we can control whether they are safe about it and know how to prevent STD's and unwanted pregnancies.\u201d How can you say that we can control them in having safe sex in preventing STDs and unwanted pregnancies? This is another form of an assumption. Where is the study that shows the we can control as such? All you presented were just an fallacious assumption, or if not, claims not supported by evidence. PointsThere are many different groups across the United States advocating for abstinence-only sex education in the schools. They include Concerned Women for America, the Eagle Forum, the Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, the Heritage Foundation, the Medical Institute for Sexual Health (MISH), the National Coalition for Abstinence Education, and STOP Planned Parenthood International. These and other proponents of abstinence-only education argue primarily that sex before marriage is inappropriate or immoral and that abstinence is the only method which is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy and STIs.1 Many such groups emphasize that condoms are not fool-proof in preventing pregnancy or STIs, and that sexual activity outside marriage can result in \u201cserious, debilitating, and sometimes, deadly consequences.\u201d2 In addition, many abstinence-only advocates are deeply concerned that information about sex, contraception and HIV can encourage early sexual activity among young people.63 These advocates credit the decrease in teenage pregnancy largely to the advancement of the abstinence-only message.3 An article on the Concerned Women for America web site states that \u201c[t]his is not simply an issue of morality, but a matter of public health. The problems that have become so entrenched in our country, such as AIDS, illegitimate births, poverty, increasing crime and the breakdown of the nuclear family, can all be attributed to the debilitating effects of a public policy that condones sex without love or responsibility. \u2026 As research clearly indicates, America is not suffering from a lack of knowledge about sex, but an absence of values.\u201d4 Abstinence-only proponents point to studies concluding that the abstinence-only education message has played a central role in the decline of adolescent sexual activity, and related negative health outcomes, over the last decade. One study reports that \u201c\u2026abstinence and decreased sexual activity among sexually active adolescents are primarily responsible for the decline during the 1990s in adolescent pregnancy, birth and abortion rates. Attributing these declines to increased contraception is not supported by the data.\u201d5Sources: [1] Concerned Women for America. Abstinence: Why Sex is Worth the Wait [Internet]. July 1998.

There was a time in this country when women would come into the emergency room with a prolapsed uterus and end up dying of an infection because she got an abortion from a shady-poorly trained individual with a coathanger. In the Dominican Republic where the Catholic church has a significant amount of clout if a women comes into the emergency room with uterus problems she is handcuffed to her bed and becomes a crime scene and often faces decades of incarceration because she didn't want to give birth to the child conceived via a violent rape. 2) It is not the place of the government or anybody else to force medical decisions on people. Human beings must be first and foremost when it comes to what does and doesn't happen with their bodies. If you opt for surgery, it isn't my place to second guess your decision. You have medical sovereignty over your body. 3) The typical ideological and philosophical underpinnings behind the abortion debate are the same as those behind opposition to birth control and any amount of reproductive freedom of women. And though it may sound noble to suggest that a small cluster of cells has unalienable rights, even though I flake off more cells that that in a typical day, let's keep our eye on what is actually occurring. These people want forced births. It is their belief that women need to have lots of babies and that that is their duty and their desires amount to absolutely nothing. 4) Carrying a pregnancy to term may be dangerous, not simply in the cases of ectopic pregnancy where doing so would certainly kill the mother, but even a healthy pregnancy is a very dangerous undertaking and should not be taken lightly. An abortion does carry a small amount of risk but far less than other options. And these pros and cons of risk must weighed by the individual who will be undertaking these risks. 5) Ectopic pregnancy, tubal pregnancy, as well as a wide variety of other issues often medically necessitates an abortion. Not all pregnancies could be carried to term in all cases because either the pregnancy would cause the death of the mother or the fetus would not be viable. --- The counter-arguments typically argue that a cluster of cells without so much as a nerve differentiated yet is as worthy in terms of rights as a woman whose medical decisions, life, and reproductive freedom would be tossed out the window to appease a few religious nuts. We should, as a society, try to minimize the number of abortions by giving women more opportunities and more lines of support both economical and psychological, however we do not take the path of forced births and back-alley hanger abortions because we want fewer abortions to occur. In a just society we need control over our medical decisions and reproductive freedom.",

            "conclusion": "Welfare Recipients Should Be Subject to Mandatory Birth Control",
            "premise": "Thank you to my opponent for his acceptance. I look forward to debating this controversial topic. For the purpose of this debate, I\u2019d like to clarify that the word \u201cwelfare\u201d will mean benefits or resources typically provided to the average non-recipient through wages earned, or through an employer. These could include healthcare benefits, cash payments, food assistance, or housing. At the core of this particular debate is not the \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d of the welfare system, nor is this debate\u2019s purpose to demonize or otherwise judge the personal moral and societal conduct of those Americans who receive welfare benefits. The very clear resolution here is the simple idea that an individual\u2019s Constitutional right to reproduce at will is directly related to their ability to provide for the common good of any human beings they create, much like an Individual\u2019s constitutional right to keep and bear arms is directly related to their willingness to exercise that right within the confines of responsible conduct pertaining to the said exercise. In addition, the reproductive rights of the individual must be weighed against the greater collective right of members who are already meeting their individual responsibilities to be free from the burden of taking on the care of those who choose to exercise their reproductive rights in an irresponsible manner. While the Constitution holds individual rights to be sacred, the Supreme Court has held that our rights are only able to be exercised to the extent that they do not infringe upon the rights of others. Therefore, the irresponsible exercise of reproductive rights by welfare recipients (who demonstrate by their temporary or long-term dependence on government assistance an inability to be fully financially self-sufficient at that time) infringes upon the independent individual by forcing the support of said irresponsible behavior. Americans by and large support this idea, as shown in a 2001 Zogby poll, which found that \u201c62% would support legislating birth control with benefits, and agree with the implication that welfare recipients too often have children they are not financially able to support.\u201d [1] \"We're asking welfare mothers to take responsibility for what they do,\" [Massachusetts welfare director Claire McIntire] said about a similar program to stop additional benefits for mothers who continue to have children on welfare. \"We're not saying you're absolutely forbidden to have children. It's your choice, knowing if you have a child you will receive no additional money from the taxpayers.\" [3] Example Case Studies: People v. Johnson highlighted the issue of mandatory birth control in 1990. Darlene Johnson, a welfare-dependent mother, was convicted of abusing her four children. At the time, Johnson was pregnant with her fifth child. The case judge offered her a choice: she could serve a seven year prison term, or she could choose to serve one year and have the Norplant birth control implant for the duration of her probation. After initially agreeing to the Norplant, she later changed her mind and appealed the decision. Johnson violated her parole before her appellate hearing by using cocaine, and was sentenced to five years for the violation, thus negating the original decision involving Norplant. [2] Shante Hodges, an 18-year-old with two children and a third on the way, said that being told not to have another child because she is on welfare is like \u201ca stranger in the street telling me I shouldn't wear those sneakers\u2026 politicians tell them not to have a baby, but that doesn't mean they're not going to have it.\u201d [3] Hodges is a perfect example of why mandatory birth control is necessary. \u201c[She] had been on birth control pills, she said, but quit taking them because her boyfriend was in jail. When he was released, she didn't have any contraceptives around the house. And that's when she became pregnant.\u201d This particular example shows, absent any moral judgment, a basic lack of personal responsibility for one\u2019s actions. \u201cSylvia Missal, who runs a young parent program at Children's Hospital in Boston,\u201d says that welfare mothers say they do not want more children but \u201cthey\u2019re not able to organize themselves.\u201d [3] As a nation we would never mandate that citizens adopt children. Why then do we mandate that citizens who are independently supporting themselves also support\u2014financially \u201cadopting\u201d through taxpayer-funded programs\u2014those who refuse to exercise their rights responsibly?

            "premise": "Many students are starting to experiment with sex at an earlier and earlier age. Although it may be the responsibility for parents to educate and provide information about birth control to their children, there are a lot of parents that are failing to do so or failing to do this at an early enough age. Because of this phenomenon there is an increasing amount of pregnancies, abortions and STDs because of lack of information. Even though it is sometimes believed that introducing this information may actually entice youngsters to experiment earlier than they may on their own, I believe that pressure from their peers, television and music are much bigger influences that will provoke this behavior more than clear, concise information. Although this may be a catalyst for some children, I believe that the number of youngsters that could be helped by this information will far outweigh the number being enticed by it.",

            "premise": "In short:Unenforceable.In detail:Abortion is a complex issue to which even the opposition to it tends to agree that it's a valid medical procedure, unfortunate, but sometimes necessary. This is compounded by the number of things that are likely to go wrong for the woman during a pregnancy, to include: Anemia, Depression, Ectopic pregnancy, Gestational diabetes, High blood pressure, Hyperemesis gravidarum, Placenta previa, Placental abruption, Toxemia [1].Such problems are further compounded by high cost of medical care even if nothing goes wrong, which one expert summarized as: \"So how much does it cost to have a kid without insurance? According to my experience, just about $12,638.31\" [2].Attempting to have no exceptions to allow abortion, leads to the level of negative intelligence seen in the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's \"legitimate rape\" comments [3].However once decent and logical exceptions to allow it are in place, it becomes foolish to try to over regulate under what circumstances a woman is allowed the procedure... For sake of clarity, such reasons shall be laid out in the rebuttals, and use cross examination.Rebuttals:\"Clinics ... should only give abortions to people who would either risk their lives to carry, or who were victims of rape or incest.\"In the case I rape I wholly agree she has a right to an abortion, due to the growing tissue inside her being a continuance of the initial violation.For rape or incest (both illegal in the USA), would a conviction be required before she gets the procedure, or a mere accusation? If a conviction: our legal system is very slow, possibly setting the abortion only being finally allowed sometime after the third trimester. If an accusation: innocent people would likely be accused, similar to the current problem of paternity fraud.\"The message we send to our kids about respecting life and making good decisions.\"Good decisions include financial decisions. Pregnancy as proven above, is very often a bad decision for such.\"If a man wants their child to be born and has means to support it, is it right the mother can still go have an abortion?\"In such cases she could easily claim it's a different father. If any man claiming to be the father was enough to prevent (or delay until genetic testing is done) an abortion, there would probably be nutjobs activists going in and claiming to have fathered the child of any woman entering an abortion clinic (yes this would be fraud, but seeing how they've already done murders and kidnappings over the issue, I believe it's a fair prediction of their behavior).\"There are other options, such as the morning after pill, condoms, withdrawal, IUD's, and etc.\"No option is guaranteed. Further getting into these moral areas, some states have inflicted the social experiment of teaching abstinence only, leading directly to increased pregnancy rates among the already financially disadvantaged [4].Sources:[1] http://www.womenshealth.gov...[2] http://www.babybankruptcy.com...[3] http://www.cnn.com...[4] http://thinkprogress.org...",
