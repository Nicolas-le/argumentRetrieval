The genetics that cause diseases such as diabetes and heart disease is absolutely real. Being healthy and good lifestyle choices only helps reduce your risk of being subjected to these diseases. In many cases no matter what you do you will become diabetic because it is in your family but it will always help to be healthy when trying to fight a disease. Overall, eating fatty foods and lack of exercise will result in obesity. You decide what to put into your body and how active your life is. While there are genetic disease that can result in obesity, obesity in itself is not an illness but rather a choice.",

Side effect or not, obesity is directly correlated from illnesses that effect a person hormones. You do make a valid point in your second argument but that is more or less off point from the point i was making when i brought it up. I was simply stating a fact that obesity does in fact lead to march harmful diseases that cannot always be fixed by simply eating healthy and exercising. That is to say if an obese person does eat healthy and exercise before they become sick with the various illnesses related to obesity (Heart Disease, Diabetes, etc.). True family history does also play a factor in those illnesses affecting a person's health. Obesity greatly increases those factors. In Conclusion may it be a side effect of some illness or be directly correlated to a person's life style obesity in the long run is a disease. A disease that effects tens of thousands if not millions of people in the United states, and across the globe for that matter. It is a serious issue that should be taken seriously and not written off as a poor life style choice.",

His choices have resulted in loosing 100 pounds and overcoming what he had done to his body for so many years. The point of the matter is there is no illness that forces you to take in fatty foods and ignore exercise. You are correct that being overweight does lead to heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure and that only suggests that indeed being overweight is a contributor.

People do not have to have to eat an unprecedented amount of calories in order to become heavily overweight or obese as some people put it. People can just live their lives and become obese. It is a health issue not a sheer disregard of a person's health; some people just cannot help themselves when it comes to this issue. So just because someone gets a Super-Sized double quarter pounder from McDonalds with a coke, and milk shake does not mean they are obese. For if that logic was correct then soon enough most if not all of children will soon be obese. Sure it means there making a terrible choice with their lunch but it will not make them become obese as you have suggested, though it is not the bone of your argument or i would hope it wasn't anyway. But yet you make it seem that anyone who enjoys Fast Food will start to live a lifestyle of obesity which is a sad mistake and probably a biased outlook on a major issue of today's modern society. Anyone can become obese no matter what they eat. Foods are not the issue in obesity as media and people who are looking for a scapegoat make it seem. The real issue in this matter is a person's body. As a person's body can have many natural parts, act very unnatural, such as hormone imbalance, issues affecting a person's glands, as well as a slow metabolism. All these and other factors can play right into the hands of obesity and the risks that come with it, like Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, and Heart Disease. These are all health issues not lifestyle choices, well last time i checked they were health issues not social, I could be mistaken, just saying.",

            "premise": "1. Though you make a valid point on the fact that the choices of exercising and eating healthier there are many other factors that go into a person suffering from obesity. There are plenty of people who eat healthy and stay active yet still remain overweight, or obese. This is not because of any choices they made; it is because of a medical issue. Though this not mean it is entirely a genetic issue. Obesity is still largely related to ones genetics. A person can make all the right choices in life, eat healthy, stay active, and never sit still in a sense and yet they will remain overweight, or obese. Bottom line they remain this way due to the fact that their body's genetics simply can't lose weight because of its genetics. 2. Congrats to your father. 3. Though there is no illness that causes a person to eat all those fatty foods in the world. There are illnesses that cause them to be unable to lose the weight they do gain though the foods. These illnesses lead to them becoming overweight and then soon enough becoming obese, or just really overweight. It cannot always be helped, and just because some over the top BS pill will create a temporary fix for their weight. It does not mean every obese person should run out and get a lifetime supply of hydroxi cut or whatever the hell it's called. For that solution is exactly what it says it is. A temporary fix for the larger issue unless of course they constantly use these pills. For once the body has an outside source take over a bodily function it is difficult to return to a pure body experience. So every morning the person would have to wake up and take pills in order to stay \"healthy\" or skinny again. So i remain with my point that obesity is directly correlated to the fact that some people just have poor genetics that cause them to gain weight, but never lose it. While on the other hand there are people who can go out eat obscene amounts of unhealthy food and then sit on their couches all day and never gain a single pound. So as i said a person's weight is directly related to their genetics.",

It affects a person, animal, or plant and it is a condition that prevents the body or mind from working normally.My opponent has also pointed out cancer, and that it is not a disease because the don't choose to get it. However, this is not true.

            "premise": "There are many different definitions. Just because you choose a definition doesn't make you right. Obesity most of the time is caused by excessive amount of calories. People have choices, to be healthy or not. It's all up to them what they eat or don't eat, if they choose to exercise or not. They know if they eat unhealthy food more then likely they will gain more weight, compared to if they eat more healthy food they wont gain as much wait compared to junk food. My claim: 1)Obesity is a preventable risk factor for other diseases and conditions, and is not a disease itself. Like smoking is a preventable risk factor for lung cancer and drinking is a preventable risk factor for alcoholism, obesity is a preventable risk factor for coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cancers (like endometrial, breast, and colon), high cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, liver and gallbladder disease, incontinence, increased surgical risk, sleep apnea, respiratory problems (like asthma), osteoarthritis, infertility and other reproductive complications, complications during pregnancy and birth defects, and mental health conditions. [42] [36] Women who gain 20 pounds or more between age 20 and midlife double their risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. [36] For every 2 pound weight increase, the risk of developing arthritis rises 9-13%. [36]. 2)Obesity is the result of eating too much. The suggested daily caloric intake for 31-50-year-olds is 1,800 calories for women and 2,200 calories for men. [7] In 2009-2010, 30-39-year-old women consumed an average 1,831 calories (which is 1.7% over the recommendation) while men of the same age consumed an average 2,736 calories per day (which is 22% over the recommendation). [3] The average American restaurant meal portion size is four times as large as portions in the 1950s and 96% of entrees at chain restaurants exceed dietary guidelines for fat, sodium, and saturated fat, with some almost exceeding daily intakes in one meal. [44] [45] The body is doing what it has evolved to do by converting excess calories into fat cells. The CDC recommends reducing consumption of sugar drinks (like sodas) and high-energy-dense foods to prevent and reduce obesity. [42] The Mayo Clinic states, \"Having a diet that's high in calories, eating fast food, skipping breakfast, eating most of your calories at night, drinking high-calorie beverages and eating oversized portions all contribute to weight gain.\" Sources http://obesity.procon.org...",

She points out that if they make unhealthy choices they will gain weight. This is also very true. However, this does not matter, as this does not mean obesity. Obesity is not being unhealthy, or having fat. Obesity is a medical condition. Obesity is not a choice, it is the result of a series of choices. The result is distinct from the choice.Her claims merely expand upon the nature of becoming obese, they do not refute my points and they are rebutted by the points I have already made.As you did not ask me to waive my final speech, I will not.Good Luck to the Pro.",

            "premise": "\"Note that I will use previous examples of Congress' performance, and not just the current Congress\"Thats fine as long as its reasonably recent..... Like anything before Kennedy is pretty unreasonable. Reasons why people who approve of the job Congress has done recently should be classified as having a mental disease1) People who approve of Congress match all the symptoms of people who have a mental disease.A mental disease is basically a disease of the mind where the psychological state of someone who has emotional or behavioral problems serious enough to require psychiatric intervention. One mental disease in particular, called psychosis, is a severe mental disorder characterized by derangement of personality and loss of contact with reality Now, people who think Congress is doing a good job clearly either have no contact with reality, or they are retarded, which is another type of mental disease. Basically, If You approve of Congress's job -> You are detached from reality -> You have a form of Psychosis -> You have a mental disease2) The statistics line up in favor of the ResolutionAbout 1 out of every 4 Americans suffer from a mental disease: http://www.thekimfoundation.org...Only about 1 in every 20 people even approve of Congress in the first place:http://www.huffingtonpost.com...The sheer number of Americans who have some kind of mental disease implies that those who approve of Congress already have some kind of mental disease. If the number of people who approve of Congress already have mental disorders, then approval of Congress itself could very easily be classified as a mental disease3) Psychiatrists are concerned about those who do approve of Congressprofesional psychiatrists themselves think that those who approve of Congress may have mental disorders. One psychiatrist went on the record at the White House saying \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure who these people are or where they come from\u2014perhaps they are psych ward patients, or unstable recluses living in remote huts on the outskirts of society\u2014but what we do know is that they are extremely disconnected from reality and in need of immediate attention if they are not already receiving it. We need to find these people and get them the help they need before their illnesses get worse.\u201d http://www.theonion.com...So those are my arguments for why the Approval of Congress should be classified as a mental disease - 1 - People who approve of Congress are likely disconnected from reality, a characteristic of mental diseases - 2 - There are already an a**load of Americans who suffer from mental diseases - 3 - Psychiatrists are concerned for those who do approve of Congress, and believe that they need professional help.",

Therefore, for everything mentioned about diseases, I will call it out as invalid. \"And how can kids play outside when they have homework!?!?!?!?!\" How do people do extra curricular activites? Homework, on average, takes up thirty minutes to two hours for an elementary school, and perhaps one hour to two hours for gifted. Most schools release children from school around 3:00. This leaves them with four hours at the LEAST with the maximum amount of homework. \"And how can parents urge their kids to play outside or whatever when their busy buying food thats not good for their kids as you previously stated!!!!\" Parents do not spend their lives in grocery stores; they could at least mention excersize OR allow them to do extracurricular activities after school. However, when parents notice that their child is obese, they should at least try to change their lifestyle a bit, because a family's lifestyle really does make a difference for a child's weight. Who directs the family's way of life? The parents. \"Where I go to school there is alot to be tackled\" Based on your profile, it says that you are in highschool. Highschool is VERY different than elementary school in the amount of work and such people get. Parents are at fault for their child's obesity because they buy the food. They are in charge of what their children do, and they lead the lifestyle of their children. Children need excerize and healthy food. Parents are responsible for both areas. Lack of these things will cause obesity. Parents have control over this, and can stop it. Children's schools are not guilty, because the majority are changing their menu to stop the rapid growth rate of obesity. Fast food places do hold a bit of the blame, but like my opponent has said before, \"its not like they're shoving food down the kid's throats\". My opponent has failed to prove any clear points as to why parents should NOT be blamed for obesity; he has only provided counter-arguments. Hopefully he will state many points in the final round.",

Instead, I will make my argument this round and address my opponent's in round three. First, lets establish that obesity is a major problem. Obesity is a risk factor for cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Cancer \"Obesity is associated with increased risks of the following cancer types, and possibly others as well: Esophagus Pancreas Colon and rectum Breast (after menopause) Endometrium (lining of the uterus) Kidney Thyroid Gallbladder\"Diabetes \"Obesity or being overweight. Research shows this is a top reason for type 2 diabetes. Because of the rise in obesity among U.S. children, this type is affecting more teenagers.\" [2]Heart disease \"Coronary Heart DiseaseAs your body mass index rises, so does your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\" [3] The real question is does fat shaming work? I contend tat fat shaming in an ineffective method of reducing obesity. In fact, fat shaming have the opposite effect. I will also give an alternative to fat shaming. II. Main argument Fat shaming has been proven to be ineffective. Both through scientific and anecdotal evidence. I know plenty of obese people in my life that have been fat shamed. They are still obese. Here's some scientific evidence \"CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that rather than encouraging people to lose weight, weight discrimination promotes weight gain and the onset of obesity. Implementing effective interventions to combat weight stigma and discrimination at the population level could reduce the burden of obesity.\" [4] Instead, people need to be educated on the causes of obesity. Overeating is one cause but there are many others. Also, there are dietary tricks like eating high fiber foods to help curve appetite. Fiber \"It has been suggested that sufficient fiber in the diet will tend to prevent excessive food intake\" [5] Sleep \"Thus, rodent obesity models also support an association between sleep and obesity.Improving sleep quality may be a clinical tool to treat obese individuals.\" [6]. Exercise \" Not exercising in a given week was associated with a 35% incidence of obesity. Exercising for 30 minutes, 1-2 days a week, was associated with a 28% incidence of obesityHowever, the survey also showed that those who exercised every day were slightly more likely to be obese (20%) than those who say they exercised five or six days (19%).\" [7]III. Conclusion In lieu of fat shaming education needs to be provided to everyone. Not just obese people. This way no discrimination takes place. Furthermore, many people I know that were young and normal weight are now extremely overweight. By taking a preemptive strike against obesity via education for normal weight people we eliminate shame. IV.

I am not defending the fact that it is alright for them to be obese but society should and could be doing a lot more such as creating awareness about healthy eating, good food practices and exercise. People need to intervene. In the documentary FED UP a bill was trying to be passed to stop unhealthy food being served however someone prevented pizza from falling under this bill because it contained tomato sauce which to some company counted as a vegetable. How much more ridiculous can it get? Not as ridiculous as the fact that heart disease is the number one biggest killer in the world and obesity the leading cause.

It is a social responsibility that we help our next generation free themselves from the cycle To your point about 'Pro-fat' what really do you mean when you say people don't want to see reality?

            "premise": "I'll take the neg on this case, arguing that healthy people are not more oppressed than the obese. Opression is defined as: the act of subjugating by cruelty, force, etc. or the state of being subjugated in this way[1] Although my opponent states how there are groups which advocate that the obese be treated equally, this does not prove that the unhealthy are being opressed in any way whatsoever. My opponent proves that the more accepted the obese become, the more obese people there will be, and the more obese people there are, the less healthy people there are. However, this is a logical fallacy as shown by Occam's Razor[2]. Occam's razor states that when an argument that assumes too much to be proven true, it is likely to be false. This applies because my opponent's entire case revolves around the fact that the more accepted obesity becomes, the more people will become obese, which is a huge assumption. To make this argument is the same as making the argument that th emore accepted Homosexuals become, the more Homosexuals there will be, which is rediculous. Further more, simply there being less healthy people is not oppression unless the government comes down, forces food down your throat, and thus strips you of your right to be healthy. I don't advocate Obesity as an actual disease unless you have a legitimate medical condition that affects your metabolism, but there is no reason to assume that either the healthy or the obese are being oppressed.

            "premise": "Parent obesity causes loss of parental rights Obesity is a major medical deficit in America. If the parents are extremely over weigh, then they aren't capable of taking care of the children, there aren't able to go outside and work and other things of that nature. The parents have created a window of embarrassment for their children, which can also lead to suicide for the children if the harassment is too harsh for the child to bear. Parent obesity causes loss of parental rights. Parents can loose their parental rights for the mere fact that they aren't capable of taking care of the child. And separation of the child and parent can impact the child deeply. If a parent is obese your not teaching your child about their disease, your showing what not to do, and what not to be, which is double messaging. For example if you are drinking and you tell your child not to, how are you supposed to inform them that this wrong when your continuing to drink. Childrens training grounds are based from home. Your children are supposed to take after you in positive ways. How are you teaching your children what no to do when you continue to do it, and by the time you actually get it in your child's head that this isn't the way to go, your gone from this world your self for over eating! As you can see there are many reasons why children are burdened by their parents obesity. When parents are in and out of the hospitable, the financial capabilities take a toll on the child, especially when it deals with getting things they need and sometimes what they want.",

            "premise": "Dear con, you could have given your definitions in earlier rounds but since neither of us did that, I don't see any problem giving my definitions as soon as I could, in this case, in R3.You have been talking about me breaking the proper format rule so much. And I remind you once again, you are the one who started arguing in the wrong round. I mean, what are you even arguing against if the instigator, who is on the affirmative side, hasn't even said anything yet.Then you broke yet another rule of citing your sources at the end of last round in your R3.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"Being fat is a reflection of an unhealthy life style and suggests a lack of maintenance.\"No, being excessively fat, or obese is. \"The best way to describe a fat person, is that they're the size of a car.\"The best way to describe an obese person, not a fat person. (Not in my opinion though, Lamborghini, for example makes some slick narrow super cars)I would like to bring to my opponent's knowledge that fat kills a person when it is in too much excess, that is, one is OBESE. If your abs aren't visible, you won't necessarily die due to a 'fat heart attack'. \"This source tells us that one in 11 deaths are cause by excess fat. Being fat is an efficient way to die.http://www.dailymail.co.uk...;Oh, look! You have a source mentioned in the middle of R3! Anyways, I opened it and the first thing I see is the heading (obviously) - \"Britain's obesity death rate\" WHY DOESN'T MY OPPONENT GET I AM NOT SUPPORTING OBESITY! FAT AND OBESE ARE NOT SYNONYMS IN THE MEDICAL SENSE! The Google definition of obese is \"GROSSLY FAT\" i.e. \"RIDICULOUSLY FAT\". Yes, ridiculous amounts of fat kills people, Yes, it is a disease. Yes, people who are ridiculously fat should be given medical aid. BUT WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT OBESITY IN THIS DEBATE?I still stand by my words. Being fat is okay. Being obese is wrong. You are speaking against obesity, I am against obesity as well! But don't falsely say that every fat person on this planet is also obese.\"This is detestable and you should be ashamed sir, ASHAMED\"Sure, buddy. I should be ashamed of stating the real facts? Or should I be ashamed because you want me to, since you sense you are losing? I think, you should get the differences between basic English words like obese and fat cleared up. You are confused.\"Obesity is not a paradox\"No, it is not, but 'obesity paradox' is a paradox. It has confused so many people in the medical field. You can't just deny its existence because you don't want it to exist! Although, I still don't support obesity, but I needed to show one case where fat people are fit, and look! There are enough cases to confuse a whole group of medical professionals around the world. My opponent further says that I am dangerous. Dear contender, I never did and never will support obesity, or tell obese people that its good to be obese. Don't try to change the thoughts of the readers of this debate and the voters. This attack was literally pointless.In my opinion, and hopefully that of a huge number of people, little knowledge is what is actually a very dangerous thing. I get it, you hate fat people for being fat, you want everyone to have glistening abs, but you shouldn't let your pre formed views come in the way of this debate.\"Certainly it can't be healthy to your mental health being fat, the realisation that you're less attractive to the opposite sex. The opposite sex have deemed you UNFIT through unconscious bias.\"Whoa, what kind of a cocoon is my opponent living in? He really thinks fat people don't get love? There are entire communities of people who admire fat people sexually and romantically! And they are not really invisible. I would be shocked if you haven't come across terms such as BBW (Big Beautiful Women), BHM (Big Handsome Men), etc. And the people belonging to these communities aren't less in number either.\"Heart deisease is the number one cause of death in America\" (Use the spell check feature please. Using proper spelling is a rule as well {Con spelled disease as deisease}, not a big deal, but still.)America suffers from obesity, and so people die due to it. I still don't support obesity. I support being moderately fat (I don't even know how many times I will have to mention this)\"Please donate to my charity in order to save a fat child today\" I think you are trying to make a joke, but in case you don't know, that link is to a site whose aim is to \"preserve and protect the ocean and its inhabitants\". I would like the voters to consider con's providing of a link of a completely unrelated to the debate just for the sake of a silly joke.I would also like the voters to consider that con's argument was about how obesity is bad for people, even after I had stated that I do not support obesity in R3 (quoting myself from R3 - \"I feel I have already cleared the fact that I am not supporting obesity\") Apparently, con just chose to ignore me.Quote from source - \"In a new study by U.S. and European researchers, published [PDF] in the European Heart Journal, overweight people were found to be at no greater risk of developing or dying from heart disease or cancer, compared with normal weight people, as long as they were metabolically fit despite their excess weight.\"Fat is a killer when in excess. Diseases such as a myriad of heart diseases don't depend only on weight.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have successfully argued and made my points against the contender. I have proved through the arguments that more than one cases exist where fat people are fit. Doing that was the necessary and sufficient condition for proving myself correct to con and the voters. The con has not yet been able to prove that fat people are unfit in every case. He has only proved that obese people are unfit and even that is not 100% true, since the Obesity paradox exists. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I hope we reach a conclusion on common grounds. Sources will be mentioned at the end of R5 (BECAUSE THAT'S THE RULE) I await con's last round of argument before conclusion round. :)",

That's how people get obese, at least the majority of them. Later on they might get a disease relating to their digestive system due to the fact that they have had a long history of over eating and surrounding their whole body in fat, which is never healthy. Of course this doesn't go to all people, some have illnesses, some don't. On the other hand, I also disagree with you when you say that obese people no matter how hard they work there is no outcome. I've seen it happen, read, and heard about it. Out of the top of my head these are a few people who went from obese to thin.

I noticed that in the beginning of it it said that \"fat\" means \" having more body fat than is optimally healthy\". Here is the definition of living: living: having life; being alive; not dead; in a healthy state To be alive we all need to have health. My own opponent's source states that those who are obese are not optimally healthy. Here is a list of the top eight oldest people recorded: 1. Jeanne Calment: aged 122 years Was not obese 2. Shigechiyo Izumi: aged 120 years Was not obese 3. Sarah Knauss: aged 119 years Was not obese 4. Lucy Hannah- aged 117 years Was not obese 5. Marie-Louise Meilleur Unknown 6.

            "premise": "A two line response? Oh this is gonna be fun! Incoming text wall!My opponent's only sentance just says a few random downsides to obesity. However, this is going to be massively insufficient of a reason to show, as con put it in the first round, \"that there must be ways to stop the obesity.\" If she cannot fulfill her own BOP, then you have to affirm the resolution. My BOP, as stated and agreed upon by myself, is to show why it must continue. I contend that without obesity, as well as leading causes to obesity, the world would end as we know it. My argument shall make one assumption that my opponent may challenge, if she so desires. That assumption is that Fast food restraunts are a leading cause to obesity, and that so long as fast food restraunts exist, obesity shall always remain constant. I feel like this is a perfectly valid assumption, and that it would be highly counter-intuitive for con to attack this assumption, but if they so wish to then they can do so. Anyway, I shall proceed with my case now.>> ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY <<It's easy to look at a McDonalds and just think \"Wow, what a bunch of fatties\" or, in my teenage boy case, \"God I'm starved. How much money do I have?\" without actually considering the worth of that very fast food joint. Fast food is, arguably, a major factor in the American economy. More than 3 million people work in the fast food industry in the US alone[1]. Even in a bad economy, McDonalds has reported an increase in third quarter by nearly 11 percent[2]. The fast food industry spent 4.2 billion dollars in 2009 on advertising alone[1]. Spending on fast food has been rapidly growing ever since the '70s. In 1970, Americans spent 6 billion on fast food[3]. Fast forward 30 years, to 2000, and now Americans spend 110 billion in just that year alone[3]. On average, americans spend more money overall on fast food than they do on things like personal computers, computer software, new cars, and higher education (such as colleges and universities)[3]. American spending on fast food is more than the combined total of our spending on things like movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos, and recorded music[3]. McDonalds ALONE is responsible for 90% of job growth in America[3]. The impact of places like McDonalds on the work-place are almost indescribable. To quote Eric Schlosser:[3]\"In 1968, McDonald\u2019s operated about one thousand restaurants. Today it has about twenty-eight thousand restaurants worldwide and opens almost two thousand new ones each year. An estimated one out of every eight workers in the United States has at some point been employed by McDonald\u2019s. The company annually hires about one million people, more than any other American organization, public or private. McDonald\u2019s is the nation\u2019s largest purchaser of beef, pork, and potatoes - and the second largest purchaser of chicken. The McDonald\u2019s Corporation is the largest owner of retail property in the world. Indeed, the company earns the majority of its profits not from selling food but from collecting rent. McDonald\u2019s spends more money on advertising and marketing than any other brand. As a result it has replaced Coca-Cola as the world\u2019s most famous brand. McDonald\u2019s operates more playgrounds than any other private entity in the United States. It is one of the nation\u2019s largest distributors of toys. A survey of American schoolchildren found that 96 percent could identify Ronald McDonald. The only fictional character with a higher degree of recognition was Santa Claus. The impact of McDonald\u2019s on the way we live today is hard to overstate. The Golden Arches are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross.\" Without places like McDonalds, I don't feel like it would an understatement to say that as a society, economically and socially, we would be devastated. >> IMPACT OF REMOVAL OF FAST FOOD <<In order for my opponent to successfully refute my case, she MUST advocate for the removal of fast food restaurants, otherwise I'm still fufilling my BOP by advocating them as a massive benefit to our economy. Without the fast food industry, everything that's connected to them takes a massive blow to profits. Advertising, the meat industry, toy companies, all of these things would be hurt. Needless to say, the current recession we're in right now would be nothing compared to what would result from removing fast food from our nation. If our economy is trashed, then the global economy will further fall into the dumps. With our economy in the dumps causing the world economy to go into the dumps, then we would be forced to look to other means to feed our people. As Lieutenant Colonel Bearden writes[4]:\"As the collapse of the Western economies nears, one may expect catastrophic stress on the 160 developing nations as the developed nations are forced to dramatically curtail orders. ... [T]he stress on nations will have increased the intensity and number of their conflicts, to the point where the arsenals of (WMDs) ... are certain to be released. ... [O]nce a few nukes are launched, adversaries and potential adversaries are then compelled to launch on perception of preparations by one's adversary. ... Without effective defense, the only chance a nation has to survive at all, is to launch immediate full-bore pre-emptive strikes. ... [R]apid escalation to full WMD exchange occurs, with a great percent of the WMD arsenals being unleashed.\"Thus, if we remove fast food to remove obesity, then we trash our economy. If we trash our economy, then the world economy is trashed. When the world economy is trashed, as Bearden explained, we get nuclear war. Nuclear war will always outweigh harms of obesity on two levels:1. Nuclear war would mean the essential end of the world and destruction of all man-kind. The death of a few from obesity related illnesses will never compare to the extinction of the human race.2. Even these obesity related illnesses can be treated and/or cured. Death is unique in that it cannot be treated back for or reverse in the way that most diseases can. Once you're dead, you're basically dead and nothing can really be done about it. This means that we are going to need fast food if we want to survive. Which means that obesity needs to stay around. Which means that you have to affirm the resolution.

The only attack my opponent makes on my case is that fast food isn't the only cause of obesity and that people can still not gain weight from eatting fast food, however this is faulty for two reasons:a) I never claimed that fast food was THE ONLY cause of obesity. This completely takes out virtualy all of my opponent's last round where she's pointing out other things that can lead to obesity. b) Fast food is still one of the leading causes to obesity,[5][6][7] and with fast food still in play then there's no chance of solving back for the obesity problem, which is my opponent's BOP. Thus, by saying that fast food is irrelevant, she is failing to uphold her BOP. By arguing for fast food being removed, she bites into the negative impact of nuclear war and makes me fulfill my BOP. This is the classic double-bind situation where no matter which route she takes, she still fails to win.Thus, the only vote here is for the pro debator.

            "conclusion": "Obesity",
            "premise": "It seems like fast food is almost a daily topic in the news. Whether it is because of their ingredients (such as trans fat), the negative health effects (like diabetes), or being linked to obesity, fast food dominates the headlines. This then begs the question, \"Does fast food cause obesity?\" The simple answer is no. Consuming more calories from food than the body can burn is what causes weight gain. This means that you could eat fast food on a regular basis and not become obese. In fact, you can even lose weight while eating fast food. This, however, requires knowledge of not only how many calories you are burning on a daily basis, but also the calories in the food that you are eating. What Does the Research Say? Fast food is not the cause of obesity in today's society. However, because fast food is typically high in calories and the portions are large, it does promote eating too many calories, which can lead to weight gain and obesity. Beside \"fast food\" there are another causes of obesity: Lack of Energy Balance A lack of energy balance most often causes overweight and obesity. Energy balance means that your energy IN equals your energy OUT. Energy IN is the amount of energy or calories you get from food and drinks. Energy OUT is the amount of energy your body uses for things like breathing, digesting, and being physically active. Overweight and obesity happen over time when you take in more calories than you use. An Inactive Lifestyle Many people aren't very physically active. One reason for this is that many people spend hours in front of TVs and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure activities. In fact, more than 2 hours a day of regular TV viewing time has been linked to overweight and obesity. Environment Our environment doesn't support healthy lifestyle habits; in fact, it encourages obesity. Some reasons include: \u2022Lack of neighborhood sidewalks and safe places for recreation. Not having area parks, trails, sidewalks, and affordable gyms makes it hard for people to be physically active. \u2022Oversized food portions. People are exposed to huge food portions in restaurants, fast food places, gas stations, movie theaters, supermarkets, and even at home. Some of these meals and snacks can feed two or more people. Eating large portions means too much energy IN. Over time, this will cause weight gain if it isn't balanced with physical activity. \u2022Lack of access to healthy foods. Some people don't live in neighborhoods that have supermarkets that sell healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Or, for some people, these healthy foods are too costly. Genes and Family History Studies of identical twins who have been raised apart show that genes have a strong influence on a person's weight. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. Your chances of being overweight are greater if one or both of your parents are overweight or obese. Your genes also may affect the amount of fat you store in your body and where on your body you carry the extra fat. Because families also share food and physical activity habits, a link exists between genes and the environment. Health Conditions Some hormone problems may cause overweight and obesity, such as underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), Cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Underactive thyroid is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. Lack of thyroid hormone will slow down your metabolism and cause weight gain. You'll also feel tired and weak. Cushing's syndrome is a condition in which the body's adrenal glands make too much of the hormone cortisol. Cushing's syndrome also can develop if a person takes high doses of certain medicines, such as prednisone, for long periods. People who have Cushing's syndrome gain weight, have upper-body obesity, a rounded face, fat Emotional Factors Some people eat more than usual when they're bored, angry, or stressed. Over time, overeating will lead to weight gain and may cause overweight or obesity. Smoking Some people gain weight when they stop smoking. One reason is that food often tastes and smells better after quitting smoking. Another reason is because nicotine raises the rate at which your body burns calories, so you burn fewer calories when you stop smoking. However, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain. Lack of Sleep Research shows that lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity. For example, one study of teenagers showed that with each hour of sleep lost, the odds of becoming obese went up. Lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity in other age groups as well. People who sleep fewer hours also seem to prefer eating foods that are higher in calories and carbohydrates, which can lead to overeating, weight gain, and obesity.

            "premise": "The current social situation that America is in is only the tip of the iceberg. 65 % of American adults suffer from obesity and 1 in 3 children are obese. The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. last year was $147 billion. Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death. Obesity is no longer just a social concern. If obesity continues to rise in the future then it will impact business productivity, the economy, housing, transport. It will change our future for the worst. However just like with issues such as smoking and child mortality persistent efforts create an impact. This epidemic is now part of the American culture .Children are growing up not knowing about healthy eating habits. Findings from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggest that kids ages 2-18 get most of their calories from two foods groups: Milk, Cakes/cookies/quick bread/pastry/pie. Their fat comes mainly from cheese and from crackers/popcorn/pretzels/chips. As these children grow up, this core issue subjects itself into a cycle where communities not making healthy choices, not in the sense that they don\"t know about basic nutrition such as a candy bar being worse than a carrot but, in the sense of including variety, correct portion sizes and moderation. To say that obesity is an issue of willpower is no longer viable because if we look around at the food being given to our generation absolutely everything we eat (apart from fruit and vegetables contains fat and sugar). American are constantly exposed to toxin foods that are affordable (a lot more than fresh fruit and vegetables), heavily promoted, and good tasting. If people don\"t know the correct methods to ensure healthy eating habits then there is no way obesity can be overcome. There is a clear disconnection between what is and what should be and the way this can changed is by providing more effect tools and creating harmony between communities and the government. Communities need to be continual informed of the advantages of a healthy lifestyle and the realistic ways they can obtain it. Kelly Ward a professor of psychology, epidemiology, and public health at Yale University suggests this: subsidize the cost of healthy foods, so they cost less; increase the cost of bad foods, so they cost more; regulate food advertising aimed at children; and develop more opportunities for people to be more physically active\". In 2010 a study was released by The Trust for American Health that stated that 80% of Americans recognised that obesity was an issue. In the 5 years since, communities have been working to actively engage more people into physical activity (through programmes such as Shape Up) as well as obtain healthier eating habits. How do we do this if Americans do not get the help they need? People need to have the tools, the knowledge, the assistance and guidance to be able to make the change. Intervention must occur to break the cycle we are in. https://www.cspinet.org... http://www.usatoday.com... http://www.psychologytoday.com...",

            "premise": "True, to say \"America is obese\" is a generalization, but the best way to judge a country's obesity rate is by comparison. The U.S. in 1800 was very wealthy, but in today's world their standard of living would be lower than most developed nations. Like wealth, obesity rates are considered high or low in a relative way. There is no absolute threshold for what would make a country \"obese\", but it is evident that something is causing the U.S. to pull ahead of the competition when it comes to obesity in first-world nations.While I will not argue about policy implications, since that is not the topic of debate, I will reject the notion that obesity in America does not affect the whole country. Obesity cost $190 billion in health care expenses in 2005 [1] and could reach $344 billion by 2018 [2]. This means higher health insurance premiums for many non-obese Americans.Another concern regarding America's obesity rate is how it affects children. Childhood obesity is clearly on the rise: It is arguable that obesity is a choice for many adults, but lack of concern for a child's health can cause them many problems that the child was likely not aware would result from obesity. This includes negative health affects, as well as the potential for bullying and poor self-esteem. Obesity does indeed correlate with self-reported emotional issus: And to pass these on to the next generation willingly would be irresponsible.America is an obese nation and it is worth addressing.Sources:1) http://www.hsph.harvard.edu...2) http://usatoday30.usatoday.com...",

Let's go through the evidence and see what is stated. \"A diet high in carbohydrates may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer in sedentary and overweight women,\" BMJ 2002;325:566 That could be any carbohydrate. Soft drinks comes to mind. Just because one source of carbohydrates causes disease doesn't mean another does. It's common knowledge that fruits and vegetables are healthy and soda isn't. A condemnation of soda is not the same as a condemnation of fruits and vegetables. \"Fasting DNL was measured after a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in normoinsulinemic lean (n = 5) and hyperinsulinemic obese (n = 5) subjects.\" Am J Clin Nutr. 2003 Jan;77(1):43-50. Again, high-carbohydrate diet could be an all soda diet. Yes, scientific peer reviewed sources are used, but carbohydrates may not be the culprit. \"Diet is clearly implicated in the origin of colorectal cancer, with risk factors for the disease including reduced consumption of vegetables, fiber, and starch and increased consumption of red meat and animal fat. Nutr Cancer. 2000;37(1):19-26. This serves to help falsify the hypothesis rather than reinforce. Now lets look at the effects of detrimental health effects of soda. \"We found clear associations of soft drink intake with increased energy intake and body weight.\" Am J Public Health. 2007 April; 97(4): 667\"675. doi:\" 10.2105/AJPH.2005.083782 \"Meanwhile, the evidence continues to mount that sugar-sweetened drinks are a major contributor to obesity, heart disease and diabetes, and that exercise makes only a modest contribution to weight loss compared to ingesting fewer calories.\" nytimes.com Next, the health benefits of antioxidants, fiber, and vegetarian respectively. \"It appears that carotenoids (including beta-carotene) can promote health when taken at dietary levels, but may have adverse effects when taken in high dose by subjects who smoke or who have been exposed to asbestos. \" J Am Coll Nutr. 1999 Oct;18(5):426-33. \"Suffering from diarrhea?

It is clear to me the hypothesis that carbohydrates causes disease is false. Instead I argue that excess soda consumption causes disease. Also good luck finding beta-carotene in animals meats. Beta-carotene doesn't work so well when taken in supplement form. I added some extra references which help falsify the hypothesis that carbohydrates cause disease. In fact, I argue that a diet high in vegetables and fruit which tend to contain how amounts of carbohydrates, anti-oxidants, and fiber helps prevent disease.

Hydrogenated oils, partially hydrogenated oils \" cause heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. 3. Fried foods (this includes chips) \" cause heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. 4. MSG (monosodium glutamate - i.e. hydrolyzed yeast extract, hydolized protein, etc.) \" MSG is a neuroexcitotoxin which hyperstimulates brain cells, causing them to burn out and die, leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\"s and Parkinson\"s diseases. 5. Soda pop (Diet and/or Regular) \" leads to insulin resistance, diabetes, heart disease and obesity; also, the phosphoric acid leads to calcium depletion, which leads to osteoporosis.

Wheat flour foods (breads, pasta, cakes, cookies, crackers, etc.) \" grains cause insulin resistance, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Gliadin, one of the two main protein components of gluten, is very pro-inflammatory. 7.

            "conclusion": "Fat Tax should be implemented",
            "premise": "The debate is whether fat tax should be implemented. Fat tax is defined as a form of sin tax implemented on unhealthy foods that are linked to obesity. The motion is limited to first world or developed countries as these are the countries facing high level obesity and would benefit from such taxes. Fat tax is proposing tax on food and drinks which are considered unhealthy. These foods are believed to increase the obesity levels. \"Fat tax\" is another form of sin tax - taxing on items such as cigarettes. A sin tax refers to popular vices and comes from prostitution in the 16th Century. It is proven to be success. In the US for every 10% price increase there is 4% reduced consumption. To combat the epidemic that is obesity it makes sense to implement this tax which has proven to decrease societal vices. When unhealthy food costs more it is proven that consumption will decrease. The excuse for \"junk food\" consumption is that it is cheap. However, a tax would make it more or less the same level as healthy food in which people would choose the healthier food as the issue is not healthy living education but affordability. Sin taxes are proven to decrease the consumption of taxed goods falling in to the category, thus the solution to the obesity epidemic is \"fat tax.\" An an unimaginable amount is spend on medical expenses because of obesity and related weight issues. In countries where medical services are given by the state, this cost then falls to the state to cover. It is also important to remember disease and other medical conditions linked to obesity. Diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes, several kinds of cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, asthma, chronic back pain and hypertension are only a view diseases. The diseases in this list are chronic and therefore need lifelong therapy which usually include expensive and complex procedures. Even if these are not all taken on by the state this puts pressure on the household to produce enough income not only to treat the medical issues but also to keep the rest of the household running. Not to mention the loss of income caused by obesity in ways such as decreased productivity, absence and premature death. This makes it clear the the \"choice\" to obesity and unhealthy living should be restricted - (note: not taken away). Therefore the government would have a legitimate reason to implement such a tax. Finally, fat tax would allow for healthier decisions as the prices across healthy and unhealthy foods would no longer have such an immense gap. The simple fact that sugary, salty and unhealthy foods are more popular is the prices. These foods are not only less expensive but also less likely to be affected by inflation. It is also important to note that obesity is prevalent in lower socio economic households. Thus proving that food choices are dependent on price. For theses reasons I propose the implementation of \"fat tax\"",

I have no idea where you got that link, so I think you're just trying to throw out random arguments to make your side look better. 2.) this argument can in no way be applied to the topic. The only way this would work were if the obese were literally forcing the healthy to change their eating habits or vice versa. \" Other people choose to be obese and it is out of control and growing, therefore the other people (for example, there are those who don't prefer to be in the company of obese people) are oppressed and squeezed out.\" You refer to obesity as if it were a contagous disease that can be caught through contact with the obese. No. I live in Alabama, one of the most Obese states in the nation. I have both fat and skinny friends (I don't know where the line between overweight and obese lies), and in all the years I've known both, neither side has changed their weight. This is proof against the fact that Obesity is \"out of control\", or that the healthy are \"oppressed and squeezed out\" which is just rediculous. I'm sure the experiences of the entire audience go against this outrageous claim as well. Furthermore, my opponent drops the fact that his claims are just as rediculous as the homophobic claims for Don't Ask Don't Tell, that the negative effects of obesity actually act as a deterrent for the healthy, that most people don't want to be obese in the first place so treating them equally won't change anything, that accepting the Pro's case oppresses the obese more than the healthy thus negating the resolution, that what he's treating as oppression can't actually meet the definition of oppression, and that using his logic means that someone moving here from Zimbabwe is being oppressed by the Americans because he can't find others from Zimbabwe. And yes, there's a whole paragraph full of things he dropped :P I urge a Con vote because the Pro has not served to prove that the Healthy are being oppressed, the only thing he's been able to prove is that there are weight equality activists. His examples of oppression don't actually meet the accepted definition (in the case of wanting to be with \"your own kind\", even though this is normally the case with racial barriers or extracurricular activities rather than obesity) and can't be proven to actually happen (in the case of the healhty being \"squeezed out\" or the obese being \"out of control and growing). Furthermore, the pro case is less of a claim that the healthy ar being oppressed more than the obese, and more of a case where he states ignorant biases similar to homophobia (which he did not refute) only with weight.

She bought her teams rugby shirt,child size. She paid the same price as the person buying an xxl, where's the justification in that ? triple the amount of cloth. Its the same in all clothes shops, its not right. If you purchase material they charge per mtr. Yes charge them more,they are not paying extra tax, it will go towards the forthcoming gastric band they may require because they have no will power.

In this condition, crystals of monosodium urate or uric acid are deposited on the articular cartilage of joints, tendons and surrounding tissues.

            "conclusion": "The obese should not be entitled to disability benefits.",
            "premise": "I'd like to thank Mr. Eggleston for proposing this discussion of an important topic. Because an obese person deviates far from what our societies deem attractive, people find it very easy to be cruel and close-minded and make a number of unwarranted assumptions about obese people. This is a chance to discuss facts.I appreciate Mr. Eggleston's concession that the facts are exactly as I have explained them. Unfortunately, he has introduced a sort of slippery slope argument that is ungrounded in the law and contrary to the facts.Starting with the latter, Mr. Eggleston claims that this case is the thin edge of the wedge. If he is still discussing the U.S., as was his initial argument, this is contrary to the facts. As already set forth at reasonable length, the U.S. has taken obesity into account in determining eligibility for SSD for some time, and requires that obese people are offered reasonable accommodations so that they can stay employed. This is the think end of the wedge, and it is precisely the system that Mr. Eggleston claimed must not be changed.If he is disussing Europe, as pointed out there is already a vibrant welfare state in Europe. Going a step further, there is no reason to conclude that obesity and the effects of obesity, such as muscular-skeletal diseases, are not taken into account in determining whether a person is incapable of working and thus eligible for full or partial disability. In fact, Denmark itself may be at the thick end of the wedge, and a ruling that requires that accommodations are made to avoid the payment of partial or full disability is likely a boon.(https://www.swisslife.com...) In short, the proposed slippery slope is contrary to the facts as admitted by Mr. Eggleston, and is illogical because there is no reason to suppose that keeping people employed sends anyone down the path to reliance on the welfare state.Proceding to the former, Mr. Eggleston's assumption that this ruling is precedent for an expansion of disability benefits is unwarranted. As pointed out in my original argument and sources, this cannot be true in the U.S., where SSD for obesity-related condition long preceded the requirement of workplace accommodations. And, it may not be true in European countries, where by all appearances an obese person with related conditions that rendered him unable to work would already have been eligible for disabiity benefits.But, more importantly, Mr. Eggleston's assumption runs contrary to the way in which a judicial system based on precedent and the rule of law actually works. Courts make limited rulings, and have done so since time immemorial, without succumbing to the slippery slope, in large part because courts are in fact bound by the necessity of interpreting statutes. Here, disability due to an inability to work is completely different from disability requiring workplace accommodations, because of the simple logical reality that a person eligible for workplace accommodations is not eligible on a claim of inability to work. And, the inability to work one particular job does not qualify a person for disability benefits, rather, it is required that the person is permanently unable to work. (http://www.ssa.gov...) So, the concept of a disability that requires a workplace accommodation is vastly removed from the concept of a disability that creates eligibility for benefits due to an inability to work. The two are not even remotely the same. Courts are aware of the distinction, and it is unreasonable to conclude that they will create a rule whereby people who by definition can work are thus eligible for benefits that require that they cannot work. As a parting shot after all of Mr. Eggleston's resistance to facts and logic, I will point out that in the U.S. (and likely elsewhere) it is already the case that persons who cannot walk long distances can obtain handicap decals, despite Mr. Eggleston's warnings about this being an eventuality of the decision. (http://www.daytondailynews.com...) I wonder how we can fear Mr. Eggleston's bogeymen when he is blissfully unaware that they are walking about beneath his nose.Thanks for the debate.",

            "premise": "My Opponent often fails to realize that I am not debating on the basis of the Cookie Monster sanity, but on the basis of the Cookie Monster addiction to cookies. If he wishes to continue to use straw man arguments so be it, but they won't help them against my arguments. If he wishes to sugarcoat the situation and not call it an addiction, then that would be to downplay any addicts addiction to anything. To make the snide remake of calling it merely a \"sugar tooth\" is equivalent to saying that the 9/11 Hijackers were merely disoriented and happen to crash into the Twin Towers on accident. I am well aware that, the consequences of the Cookie Monster's addiction have obviously lead him to obesity, and may very well lead him to other health problems later in life. One needs only to look no further than cdc.gov to find the Health Consequences to obesity Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels referred to as \"overweight\" and \"obesity,\"* the risks for the following conditions also increases:1 * Coronary heart disease * Type 2 diabetes * Cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon) * Hypertension (high blood pressure) * Dyslipidemia (for example, high total cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides) * Stroke * Liver and Gallbladder disease * Sleep apnea and respiratory problems * Osteoarthritis (a degeneration of cartilage and its underlying bone within a joint) * Gynecological problems (abnormal menses, infertility) If my opponent really did indeed care about the Cookie Monster then he would be encouraging him not to eat cookie's at this alarming rate. I know however, my opponent does not care about the Cookie Monster and he will allow him to eat until, God forbid, he dies of a stroke, heart attack or cancer. I am not by any means saying that it will lead to this, but at the rate the Cookie Monster eats cookies it is very likely. On average a chocolate chip cookie made with margarine contains 138 calories, the Cookie Monster has been seen devouring numerous cookies without any consideration for his health. Just imagine multiplying those calories by the span of the years he is alive, not only does it appear cookies are his favorite food but it appears to be the only food he enjoys eating. Why would the Cookie Monster be known as the Cookie Monster if it weren't for his addiction to cookies? Not only does the empirical evidence weigh on my side, but even the theoretical is on my side as well. Simply by speculating we can come to the fact that at the rate the Cookie Monster consumes his cookies, and the by the weight he has, he is defiantly headed for some serious health problems later in life. For as an observer of this debate one needs to realize the rate of consumption the cookie monster eats and the current weight of the cookie monster, both factors are going to contribute to an unhealthy cookie monster without a doubt. It is extremely obvious, just as the culprits hands are blood red, so too is the cookie monster's behavior. It would be sheer nonsense to even suggest that the Cookie Monster does not promote behavior that leads to obesity. This is truly the fundamental essence of the Cookie Monster, what his named after, lives for and is born to do. We must come to our senses here and embrace that unless he obtains a reasonable eating regime, he will perish along with the rest of everyone that looks up too him. Everyone shall be torn down in the process, and that is how easy the human mind is to influence, do not let con persuade you otherwise, the evidence clearly points without a reasonable doubt that the Cookie Monster promotes behavior that does lead to obesity. I will restate my points, Point 1. The Cookie Monster is a Benign eater Point 2. The Cookie Monster overindulges in cookies Point 3. The Cookie Monster does not eat his food properly. Point 4. The Cookie Monster manipulates others to obtain cookies. http://www.youtube.com... Conclusion, The Cookie Monster promotes behavior that leads to obesity. Also we must realize that an individual who is looking for \"cookies\" in a library must have an extremely distorted perspective of reality or contains the mark of an addict. Vote Pro",

            "conclusion": "We should introduce a 'fat tax'",
            "premise": "Statistics (1) More than one-third (34.9% or 78.6 million) of U.S. Adults are obese. Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity (47.8%) followed by Hispanics (42.5%), non-Hispanic whites (32.6%), and non-Hispanic Asians (10.8%). (2) Non-Hispanic meaning not Latin American e.g the United States and its Hispanic neighbours. Obesity is higher among middle age adults, 40-59 years old (39.5%) than among younger adults, age 20-39 (30.3%) or adults over 60 or above (35.4%) adults. Amazingly, (3) shows that no state or territory has <20% of obesity in the US population. Australia is also horrendous, (4) in the fact that 63% of adults are obese, 25% of children are overweight or obese and that it is the 2nd highest contributor to burden of disease.Overweight and obesity (high BMI) is the second highest contributor to burden of disease, after dietary risks. Smoking is the third highest. The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. Was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. Dollars; the medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight. Never the less, it proves that the USA, UK and Australia is some of the most obese countries in the world, thanks to Con's points. (5) Worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980. In 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 600 million were obese.39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2014, and 13% were obese. Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight. 42 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2013. Obesity is preventable. NHS and diseases The tax was introduced in October 2011, (6) in an attempt to limit the population\u2019s intake of fatty foods, and reduce obesity rates. According to the Danish National Health and Medicines Authority, 47% of Danes are overweight and 13% are obese (UK). Any food with a saturated fat content of more than 2.3 per cent will be taxed at a rate of 16 kronor (\u00a31.85) per kilogram of saturated fat. The move will add the equivalent of 25p to a pack of butter and 8p on a pack of crisps. This is statistically working on our society, changing peoples decisions on food. Appallingly, with obesity numbers rising so fast \u2014 with it estimated that by 2050 the cost to the NHS (at current prices) could reach \u00a39.7 billion a year \u2014 the wider cost to society might push \u00a350 billion (7) The National Health Service: in the UK, a system that provides free medical care and is paid for through taxes. The NHS should certainly not be wasting money on obese patients, but with obesity, comes many diseases. (8) High blood pressure- Above people who are 25, 75 million people that are obese suffer from High blood pressure. Diabetes- 90% of people who have diabetes suffer from type 2 diabetes. Heart disease- people who are under 45 have the greatest risk of getting heart diseases. Cancer- if you are obese you have a 50% chance of getting cancer. Depression- depression increases by 55% if you are obese. Gallstones- If you are a women, gallstones can deeply effect you. There are many more diseases, but I just named a few. Impact on the Minority Con stated at the bottom of paragraph five that 'most people don't likes paying taxes, especially when they do nothing for them'. In the fact that 63% of adults in Australia, 34.9% of US, 25% of UK and 39% of adults world wide are obese; don't you think we are in a way helping the wider people to live. Helping decrease cancer risks and other diseases, we are truly helping our society. 'Most people including myself eat chocolate, cake, and biscuits yet have a healthy lifestyle. It is not harmful to treat yourself now and then' states Con. I agree, but most people cannot control themselves and end up eating more than one/two pieces. I do a lot of sport, so when I go to school with my friends we have ice-cream every lunch and share lollies. (Now I think about it) my friends are overweight. Unless you even up the food with fitness it is okay, but some people could have 1 large fries from MacDonald's, chips, lollies, gum and 2 pieces of chocolate cake. You can't burn that off unless you do 5 hours f intense training. Burpees are hard- jump, push up, get up and repeat.(9) You have to do 524 burpees to burn off 1 large fries from Maccas. Fatter foods 'Many foods like cheese, butter, and milk will fall into the unhealthy label, when actually they can be good for you, and better than alternatives like margarine, so people trying to eat more healthily may find it harder financially to achieve their goal'- Con. Instead of full cream milk or fat milk, there is always the alternative of skim milk or low fat milk. Milk isn't unhealthy as it has many essential vitamins like calcium. Calcium helps your body develop stronger bones, hair, skin, nails and in general it is good for your body. Margarine and butter are basically the same. Butter has more fat than margarine but margarine has more chemicals than butter. The two won't be 'fat' because for a sandwich or a piece of toast you only add a bit. Unless you go eating the whole tub, margarine and butter are healthy in small quantities. Technically, financial matters will even out. If everyone ate healthily in the first place, we wouldn't have to get the 'fat tax.' Besides that, there would be less waist on money and resources for obese people. Such as the 'lager people ambulance'. Cheap food isn't good for you, you would end up getting not enough vitamins into your body. Then you'd have to use money on pills, treatment, doctors appointments etc. It all works out in the end. Fat tax benefits The fat tax will ensure the hospitals facilities and ambulances, it will make our society healthier, it will decrease the amount of deaths and will make the environment more of a healthy happy place. Overall, the Fat Tax will certainly be of benefit to our economy. Decreasing deaths and diseases whilst increasing well-being and healthy life style, the Fat Tax is a brilliant invention; helping our society to be a healthier place.

            "premise": "--My opponent first argues that there isn't enough farmland on earth to feed the obese and the starving. This isn't quite true. If the obese can sacrifice food for the starving then Pro has contradicted himself by proving enough land to feed both. Not only is this a contradiction, it simply isn't true. As of now we have plenty of food and farmland to raise food for more than everyone. However, if we continue to grow in population, by 2050 we will have a possible 12 billion people. Not only is food important for everyone, but so is a job. This just shows Darwins theory of \"survival of the fittest\" more plausible. Even if the obese remain obese, and we continue to reproduce at this rate, there will be starving children and there is nothing we can do about it. I think it's horrible that children die every day as a result of starvation, but that is nature. We are no different from the animal kingdom, the strongest and most prosperous will prevail. And it will always be the case. Animals will always die because there isn't enough food in the area, likewise with humanity. Animals will fight to the death for food, and if humanity gets put in a situation where food is an issue, so will we. We can't expand the earth, there is only so much room, and people will die because of that. It's not going to get any better, technology will improve, we might even become \"green\" and keep enough vegetation for everyone, but we will still be overpopulated if we keep growing this much, and people will die as a result of things other than starvation. It's life, not immorality. Sometimes that's just the way it goes. --My opponent also stated that money was not the heart of this issue. You're right, greedy, obese people are the heart of these worlds starving children. Not exactly, Your saying that obese people are eating starving children's lunches. They are eating it, because they have the money to buy it. Greed is essentially your argument. So while the obese are eating those children's lunches, you're spending money on, maybe not food, but a television set, a car, air conditioning, cable, a cellular phone, not to mention anything you do for fun. NOT IMMORAL, and neither is the obese. Not healthy maybe, but certainly not immoral. --My opponent then goes to explain the needs an adult vs. the needs of babies as far as nutrition goes. Life is most important here, obviously. That being said, why not give the calorie intake for survival? You gave the calorie intake to be healthy. We can survive off of much less. So, if simply eating more food than it takes to survive is killing lives, then even the smallest who consumes very little, but who are nonetheless surviving, is immoral. Obesity can also be a psychological disorder. Obese people eat because they are lonely, because they are depressed, or simply out of habit, which we all know to be a psychological disorder. Metabolism also plays a large part. We can increase or slow down our metabolism to a certain extent, but we all have a set, natural metabolism. I can almost guarantee you, I, a 6'1' 150lb guy, can eat more than the average obese person. So, once again, obesity is not the issue. Food consumption, sometimes, has nothing to do with obesity. Immorality has nothing to do with obesity, as I have clearly proven. Figured out that issue, give me a harder one\u2026",

            "premise": "The obesity epidemic is taking an enormous toll on global medical costs. In the US alone the health care costs attributable to either direct or indirect consequences of obesity have been estimated at $147bn.[1]\u00a0Put into context, this amounts to roughly 9% of the health spending in the US.[2] The figure might seem excessive, but we need to remember that obesity is linked to Type 2 Diabetes, several kinds of cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, asthma, chronic back pain and hypertension, to name just a few. We also need to realize that many of the diseases on this list are chronic in nature, requiring lifelong pharmacological therapy, which often follows complex and expensive diagnostic procedures, frequent medical specialist consultations, and not infrequent emergency interventions.[3] Adding to the list is the value of income lost due to decreased productivity, restricted activity, and absenteeism, not to mention the value of future income lost by premature death. Thus it becomes increasingly clear that due to the substantial cost obesity presents to the society, individual choices that might lead to excessive weight gain, can no longer be considered as solely individual in nature.[4] Therefore the government is legitimate in its action to introduce a form of a fat tax in order to try to dissuade the population from becoming obese and cover the increasing societal costs the already obese individuals are responsible for.

However she admits that her definition depends on the individual, making it impossible to objectify, unlike my definition which has an objective standard of harm. She has also failed to refute my definition of addiction throughout this entire debate, so we should prefer mine.CaseSince both of my definitions stand I would like to extend the first contention of my case that definitionally negates the resolution. Note that my opponent has never opposed this contention. Right here you can negate.Rebuttal1. Broken Heart SyndromeI'm just going to drop this line of questioning because it has come to the point where my opponent will not admit that anything other than cancer is a disease. She has not answered why the real consequences of broken heart syndrome should not be taken into account.2. Traditional Idea of DiseaseI would argue that the traditional model of disease is irrelevant to this debate. I offered a definition for what a disease it that was never refuted. Thus, my definition is what we shall look to, not tradition. An insurance company or governmental policy neglecting to cover addicts does not deny the condition the status of being a disease.3. ChoiceMy opponent again argues under the premise of choice but has failed to refute my evidence that states genetics cause 40% of alcoholism. You see, choice is not the only factor, some people are born destined to be alcoholics.ConclusionEven with a fourth round to be had, this debate is over. We've come down to simple rehash of old arguments. Here's why I have won.1. Definitional Negation: An addiction is a disease by definition. This is never refuted, thus conceded as true.2. The crux of my opponent's case is that addictions are not genetically influenced but never answers my evidence that 40% of alcoholism is caused by genetics. This undermines the very premise of her arguments. She has no offense left in the round, I do.",

            "conclusion": "Obese customers should pay more for flights.",
            "premise": "First, my opponent's exaggerated picture of an obese individual was abusive and entirely unnecessary. In fact, its only \"point\" was to raise the question of whether or not you would like to sit next to the individual in the photo. My opponent says, \"You can choose to donate half your seat to this guy...\" however, you have about a 1 in 6+ billion chance that you would ever have to sit next to that guy. So, if those odds are enough to get you to vote for my opponent, by all means... The reality is, however, that not all obese people are extraordinarily overweight by society's standards. In the past few years, the average waist line has expanded by 2 inches. Seeing thicker people is now more common, and you yourself may be obese or even have a family member who is considered obese without you even knowing it. For instance, if you are 5'5\" and weigh 180 lbs, you are obese. If you are 5'8\" and weigh 198 lbs, you are obese. Not all obese people are as massive as the one represented in the picture, and my opponent made no differentiation between that guy and the masses. Thus you must disregard the image and actually hold it against my opponent for stooping to that level (desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess). Next some $$ issues come into play. Pro says, \"However, had the airline intervened and helped the gentlemen get a specialized seat (at a slight increase in expense), neither of you would have had to endure that experience!\" What BS! Apparently he hasn't been paying attention throughout this debate where a huge focus has been the decline of airline resources, and how airlines are on INCREDIBLY tight budgets would eliminate any opportunity to implement new seating. If this were to actually happen, it would cost A LOT more than a \"slight increase\" of cost. I've noticed that Pro exaggerates quite a bit, hmm? Also, if this extra cost were applied to everyone, then it would not just be obese people paying extra for flights but EVERYONE. This contradicts the resolution. Then Pro suggests that obese people should have to pay between $20 - 50 extra per flight. I'm sure you can figure out that this small cost would not be enough to cover the cost of ripping out already existing airline seating and replacing it in terms of man power, cost of products, cost of supplies, etc on EVERY flight. Further, if the original goal was to have obese people buy an extra seat, we all know that a plane ticket costs well over $20. Thus, the airline would lose a lot of money here... and this doesn't even include the fact that by implementing more, larger seating, the airline would lose money in the sense that it reduces the amount of available seating per flight. This inconvenience could wind up costing airlines big time in the end, meaning it would cost money for ALL flyers as well. Considering that the odds are HIGHLY AGAINST you sitting next to an obese individual (10%!), well, you do the math. Next Pro tries to use the logic of, \"When an obese person walks into a department store to buy plus-sized clothing, does he or she not pay more for the extra fabric?\" Um, actually no - they don't. If Jen buys a pair of jeans in a size 4 and Jess buys the same pair in a size 16, they will both pay the same price for the jeans. And yes, at size 16, Jess is considered to be obese. Thus this logic does not stand here. Pro says, \"Of course, the group of people required for this small fee would be small. We're talking about the truly obese here (BMI greater than 3.5), not the common overweight.\" Well okay, you actually need a BMI greater than 30 to be over-weight, but nevertheless, this would actually include a lot of people. See some examples of weight statistics above (i.e. if your dad is 5'10\" and weighs 210 lbs, he would have to pay extra for a flight, AND - according to Pro - not be able to sit with you or his family due to the necessity of him having to sit in \"specialized seating\"). Speaking of which, this kind of \"specialized seating\" is degrading to those who are forced to endure such an experience against their will. Things like this are NOT TOLERATED. So indeed my opponent's claim that \"this eliminates the need for embarrassing moments\" because the \"obese are people too\" is BS. Then Pro tries to portray a happy-go-lucky scenario of someone buying a ticket and being asked whether or not they prefer plus sized seating. While I agree that a little extra room would be preferable, I also acknowledge that paying extra for it is NOT. Some people wouldn't want to or wouldn't be able to afford it, but Pro is suggesting that it's mandatory. If it's not mandatory, or if obese people wouldn't have to pay extra for this seating, than that completely negates the resolution in and of itself (because obese people are not paying more). Going back to old contentions, Pro asserts that taxation on things like cigarettes are so high because the government is essentially taxing for insurance. Uh, that's not true -- I cannot believe that Pro is actually naive enough to believe that high taxes are for INSURANCE purposes...?! Alright, I'm dumbfounded, so I'll let a quick cited source do the talking for a moment... \"The legislative controls in this case, which are represented by higher tobacco taxes, were not intended to cause people to quit smoking but rather to increase revenue. The state's claim that these punishment-style taxes are to encourage people to quit smoking for health reasons has only a smidgen of truth, just enough to become the facade... Since unequal taxation is inequitable, it is a human rights violation, more specifically an equal rights violation. The higher tax rate on tobacco is inequitable because it doesn't affect all citizens equally, only smokers. Targeting a minority is inequitable.\" The source for this information is the Bureau of International Information Programs (U.S. Dept of State) which can be found here --> [1]. Thus my opponent's propositions are not only morally wrong, but unconstitutional as well... at least via the current interpretation by government. In terms of my other contentions, Pro has merely brushed the surface on a defense. He says that I must prove genetics to be the #1 cause of obesity, but that is untrue -- After researching the main causes for the disease, what I came up with was clear across the board: factors include genetics, lifestyle and psychological disorders. Stress was considered to be in the top 3-5 causes as well. However if we take a look at these causes, almost none of them are preventable. Genetics - obviously not. Lifestyle - nope. Because you are born into it. If a child is raised in a household where parents/people over-eat, they will imitate the same behavior. People also cannot choose their culture (another huge factor) or necessarily control the stress in their life, etc. Bottom line, Pro is wrong here. Because he even wants taller/larger people in general to pay extra, and obviously people cannot control their HEIGHT. Again, this is highly discriminatory and WOULD NEVER FLY (no pun intended) without serious legal repercussions. Also, since Pro is once again naive enough to believe that obesity law suits do not exist, he might be surprised at the results of Googling \"obesity personal injury law.\" A tip? IT DEFINITELY EXISTS! [2] So no, unlike Pro, I have not made up any random facts throughout this debate. I don't need to stoop to that in order to be a good debater. Btw - Pro never included citation regarding the # of obese people who require medical attention on flights to prove HIS point, so disregard it. It also does not address other high-risk flyers. I've noticed that Pro did not respond to my arguments regarding cargo space/weight, costs and other points -- clearly he has not been the better debater in this debate.

Soaring prices have little to do with how much food is produced. Gas prices alone have a large impact on prices of our food. \uf06e http://www.worldhunger.org... \uf06eThe source above has accurate facts about world hunger and clearly states, IN BOLD, that we have enough food for the world's population. My opponent then demonstrates how we are different from the animal kingdom by providing an example that explains humanities intellect as the difference. Because of this difference, I'm assuming he is implying that humanity is not greedy because we have come together. \uf06eI'm afraid you are missing the point. Humanity is not at the top of the food chain because of strength. We are at the top of the food chain because of intellect and the tools we have developed as a result. As of now, we are the smartest species known to man, and that is our strength, that is why we are still walking the earth. So \"survival of the fittest\" still fits in our scenario. We may be able to outsmart the animal kingdom, but we can't control our universe. For example, in a thousand years our earth could be 200 degree hotter. Some reptiles and insects may be able to survive the heat and eat each other. Humanity will have lost most of our vegetation as well as most of the animal kingdom which will eliminate most of our food, and that is assuming we can survive that heat, which isn't probable. We would ultimately die off. Species under water might be the only form of life left. That is just an example, may be extreme, but it illustrates the natural order and the fact that we are a part of it despite our stereotypical theory of being more important than the world itself. \uf06eThat being said, we will do anything to survive, just as other animals will. If you're stranded in the desert with a friend, 130 degrees and the only water you have will either keep you alive for 7 days, or keep the 2 of you alive for 2. Despite what the \"moral\" thing to do might be, we will fight for survival and try to live as long as possible with the hope of being rescued. \uf06eThe point is, we are animals; slightly more civilized than the rest of them, but that is only because that is what it has taken to survive. We are just as greedy. But, we have developed a system of government and money and protection and can therefore do more than simply survive, we can be comfortable. And we will do what it takes to be comfortable even if it means somebody somewhere else is dying. We could give all of our money away and save a life or two. But that would mean living in a tent and being uncomfortable. Is it immoral? No, simply our standard of living. \uf06eNow, I think both of us have strayed away from topic, but I'll try and tie this all together. The following are my points and why the obese should not be considered immoral. 1)Immoral changes with time and place. Those in refugees, I'm sure, do not find it immoral to have an entire meal while there family and peers whither away. What we consider being obese now, was not obese 500 years ago and will not be 500 years from now. While the definition of morality is relevant, it doesn't prove that, by today's standards, obesity is immoral. 2)My opponent claims to be specific in food and not money, but then states the cost of food being a record high. Sounds like, to me, food and money goes hand in hand even from my opponents perspective, whether he means for it to be or not. We all live to the comfort level of our society because that is what is expected, and that is what we consider the standard of our comfort. My opponent's core concern is obviously saving lives by eating less, and blames the obese for doing that. Money provides food on our table just as much as it provides food on anyone else's table. So if being obese is immoral, then simply being comfortable in the way that most of us are living is immoral as well. The money we spend on a car, a/c, heat, television, cell phones, furniture, electricity, water, etc. All of this can be eliminated or at least cut down significantly so we can feed the needy. I don't know about everyone else, but I don't consider myself immoral because I have all of this, just fortunate. 3) To better tie together mine and my opponent's examples of why we are, or are not different than the rest of the animal kingdom: a. I am simply stating that we are no different. Sure, we are smarter, organized, and have developed tools as a result. But, we have done this only to survive, and it evolved from there. When we were cavemen, we had to make spears for weapons, discovered fire for warmth, and as time went by it progressed in to what we are now. We did this to survive, and it has evolved from there in to a civilization superior to other animals. 4)I am considered extremely skinny, and I can guarantee you, that I can eat more than your typical obese person. We all have natural metabolisms, mine is faster than most of your overweight people. That doesn't mean that they are immoral because they are fat but simply overweight because that is the way they were made. Sure, they can work out and trim the fat, but some people are going to be naturally bigger than others. \uf06eMy opponent has tried to demonstrate that being obese is immoral by giving an example of a family eating in front of a refugee camp. Obese or not, that would be immoral. Being obese has nothing to do with his example. He then gave a source, trying to prove that we did not have enough food on earth because the cost of food is soaring. His source had nothing to do with the amount of food and actually went to prove my theory that money and food go hand in hand. We then debated on the \"survival of the fittest,\" and he claimed that we are different from the rest of the animal kingdom because we are smarter, which is true. However, it further demonstrated my point because it simply proves that we are here because of the tools we have made, not because we are physically stronger. This ties in to obesity because we are all greedy by nature and will have lived the life that we were born in to. Greedy, maybe, and quite naturally. Immoral, not by a long shot. So I will say it one more time, obesity simply has nothing to do with the morality of our society. Skinny people can eat a lot, and obese people can eat very little. If the obese were the only people to blame for consuming more than what is recommended, they would still not be to blame for starving children. Check the sources; we have plenty of food to go around. Starving families are in geographic locations that don't support much vegetation and are dying off because they don't have the money to import goods. Obesity is not the issue; it's more of an economic issue. I could go on and on to try and prove my point but I feel I have already done that. I hope everyone else can see that as well.",

Should they not get the same benefits as the non-obese and disabled? My answer is no. Everybody IS equal. [3] Since when did the obese get benefits? According to my research, the obese don't get benefits unless they are also disabled. Why is your resolution \"THe obese shouldn't get same benefits\", when there were no obese benefits in the first place? The obese are treated equal as anyone else.",

            "premise": "With thanks to my opponent for joining this debate, I would like to reply to his comments as follows: I accept my opponent's point that morals vary from society to society, but every society agrees that taking a child's life is immoral, and I shall explain why this is relevant shortly. It is also true that we are conditioned by society to put our own personal wealth above charitable donations and pretty much everybody, with the possible exception of tramps, monks and students, could live a more meagre existence and give the remainder of their disposable income to good causes. However, that is not at the heart of the issue here. The crux of the matter is that there is only so much farmland on Earth and because the obese eat more than their fair share, it cannot sustain the whole of the world's population. By depriving people in the Third World of their daily sustenance, grossly overweight people are, in effect, eating starving children's lunches. Here are the facts: a normal adult consumes 2427 calories per day, 533 or 18% less than the 2960 calories an obese consumes. Source: http://environment.newscientist.com... A baby requires 1000 calories per day so every two days each obese is personally responsible for the death of a Third World baby \u2013 over a period of 40 years that's 7300 infants' lives a grossly overweight person snuffs out for the sake of their own selfish greed - Saddam Hussein got hung for less than that. Though my opponent digresses from my central argument that the obese lack morals, I do, nevertheless concur that in previous times overweight women were considered beauteous, as is evidenced by the depiction of voluptuous nudes in countless Renaissance paintings. Times have changed, but even today, there are some men that actually prefer bigger women, just as there are some men that prefer older women, or underage girls, or other men, or animals, or even inanimate objects - yes really, I saw a documentary about a bloke who lives near Seattle that has sexual intercourse with his VW Beetle \u2013 it was most disturbing! However, the majority of men, given the choice, would opt for a stunning blond cheerleader over some doughnut-devouring dropout from the fat farm who looks like a pig in knickers! However, as I said, this debate is not about the physical attractiveness of grossly overweight people, it is about morality, and since I have proved conclusively that the obese are morally responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent children, your conscience should oblige you to vote Pro for an end to wanton gluttony.",

If this is not the case, he or she should demonstrate that letting kids die of hunger is a good thing and that anyone who deliberately feeds a malnourished child is acting immorally. An observation - I have entitled the debate \"The obese are immoral\" rather than \"The overweight are immoral\" deliberately as I recognise that it is possible to be overweight but not fat, as is the case with some rugby players for example. In addition, some people are overweight due to water retention caused by medical complaints and do not, necessarily, consume food to excess. So, for the purposes of this debate, let \"the obese\" be defined as people who are fat because they eat too much out of pure greed. I would like take this opportunity to urge readers to vote on the quality of the debate, not on any personal allegiance to thin or fat people - after all, many of us who live in the West will know somebody we like who is obese, indeed, some of us may be grossly overweight ourselves. Now, please allow me offer you the following scenario: Mum, Dad and their children, Montmorency and Ethelbertha, load up their touring trailer, hitch it to the back of their truck and head off on vacation. Now this is a big family, not in terms of number, but in terms of size, as they are all obese. Some time later, they arrive at their destination and set up camp. That evening they have a slap-up barbeque with 21-day matured t-bone steaks, minted lamb chops, tiger prawns, Lincolnshire sausages, marinated pork steaks and stuffed chicken breasts which they consume with heaps of corn-on-the-cob and piles of fries, all washed down with lashings of beer and pop and followed with cream cakes and chocolates. In short, they ate far more than their recommended daily calorific intake in just one meal. Nothing wrong with that, you may say, why not? It sounds very nice. Aha! But that's not the end of the story, because the camp they chose to park up in was a refugee camp in Africa full of starving people. Clearly, polishing off a massive feast while desperately malnourished mothers holding their dying children in their arms look on is more than \"not very nice\" \u2013 it's immoral. That is because they have each consumed far more calories than they actually need to stay healthy and their excess body weight is evidence of ongoing gluttony. It is my contention is that, if the fat family had consumed the same meal in a National Park in California or a campsite in the South of France, it would have been as equally wicked as having the nosh up in the refugee camp - the truth is that the obese family knew there are starving people in the Third World and the fact that the starving people couldn't have seen them greedily scoff up their grub, doesn't absolve them from blame, because those facts wouldn't have made the malnourished campers any less desperate for food. We all know there is a global shortage of food yet this could be greatly alleviated, and millions of lives could be saved, if people in the West ate no more than they actually required to keep healthy and the food saved was diverted to the starving in the Third World. Thus, by wilfully depriving starving children of food, I have proved that the obese are immoral and you should, therefore, vote Pro.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for the amazing but irrelevant definition. It is clear that we need to abolish Trans Fat in our schools for the following reasons: Risk of Trans Fat Obesity Advertisement Trans fat as we know raises your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol levels. The consumption of Tran's fats increases your threat of developing heart disease and stroke. It's also associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It is the role of the government to look into many conflicts and determine which to implement and which to refuse; this is determined by looking into the conflicts and trying to determine which is proportional and which is not proportional. This is an example of a disproportionate problem and the government must look into it. Experts blame Tran's fats for at least 30,000 premature deaths a year. Experts now say Tran's fats are \"the biggest food-processing disaster in U.S. history\". An article from America Hearth organization states that Trans fats are currently thought to cause at least 30,000 premature deaths each year. In addition, experts believe just reducing the amount of Tran's fats in margarine's would prevent 6,300 heart attacks annually. In additional Tran's fat also causes obesity and creates a bad eating habit. In basic terminology, trans fat is made when a product manufacturer adds hydrogen to vegetable oil. The purpose of hydrogenation is to increase the flavor stability and shelf life of these processed foods. However we must see that we cannot afford to feed these unhealthy foods to our children because the damage produced by Tran's fat is simply to great and diverse for us to take chances. Trans fat adds to obesity in our schools, obesity is a growing problem in the United States, one that needs to be responded to and immediately. With more than 65% of obese kids in the United States, we are creating a time era that is now known as the obese generation. With obesity also been a genetics problem, it is clear that if we continue to serve trans fat in our schools, more than 75% of kids will be obese by the year 2015. The schools are there to promote what is right and to downgrade the wrong; however we find that the school is in a position where it desires money more than the children's edification and health care. This means that they buys the cheaper Tran's Fat contaminated foods rather than the well prepared healthy food. An article from cdc.gov states that \"The percentage of children who are obese1 has more than doubled, and among adolescents the rates have more than tripled since 1980. Obesity is a risk factor for health conditions such as diabetes and is associated with problems such as poor self-esteem\". Finally, the alternatives and solution are so simple that we find our self asking why the government have not approved it yet. Alternatives could involve the use of using saturated fat but in a lesser rate. A list from txf.org gives us many other alternatives to Tran's fat in which it states: natural trans fats. Butter Butter fat Coconut and palm oils Animal fat Fully hydrogenated vegetable oil Traditional liquid vegetable oils Liquid vegetable oils from advanced oilseeds Interesterification Non-fats Yes I understand that we simply cannot stop the kids these days from going out and consuming Tran's Fat but we could limit it through commercials and ADS. Many students watch televisions and use the computer as well so advertising the dangers of Tran's fat would not only reduce the use of Tran's fat but also enlighten people of its dangers.

            "conclusion": "Obese customers should pay more for flights.",
            "premise": "- OBESITY IS PREVENTABLE - I have a few problems with this rebuttal. First, we have already established that obesity is not always preventable! Genetics and other factors (including mental health) contribute to the disease. Further, sometimes the medications that people are on have a side effect of weight gain. If my opponent concedes that people cannot prevent all forms of sickness, than he concedes that people have no choice but to take medicine... medicine which can lead to obesity, therefore my point is upheld. Regardless, while obesity may very well be preventable in many cases, consider the fact that my opponent completely neglected health risks attained from things like smoking in his rebuttal. It's easy to say that obesity is more preventable than asthma; however, medical problems associated with contributing factors such as tobacco, marijuana and other drugs, alcohol, etc. all contribute to an additional increase health risks... yet we don't charge SMOKERS extra for \"insurance purposes.\" So clearly the cost of insurance cannot be a contention in favor of my opponent. What's good for the goose is good for the gander -- if this ideology does not cross apply to other flyer demographics, than obesity should not be singled out. Not without a law suit anyway (more about this later). - STATISTICS - My opponent has written \"since my opponent insists on an argument of statistics and precise percentages...\" which is completely false. I'd just like to clear the air and say that I do not want nor expect this to be a debate revolving solely around percentages. However, for my opponent to make an incredible, highly exaggerated claim in his favor without supporting sources is extremely abusive. No one is saying that you have to provide statistics for all of your reasoning, but what I AM saying is that it wouldn't be right for either one of us to just make stuff up on a whim and present it as factual evidence. - OTHER TRANSPORTATION - My opponent has noted that buses do not charge for individual seats. That is correct. They charge per passenger. My opponent then says, \"however, if obese passengers are indeed causing problems for the remaining passengers, perhaps extra fare is necessary.\" Right here it becomes apparent that a primary contention for Pro is the comfort of other passengers. The problem with this is that transportation's primary purpose is just that: transport. Comfortable circumstances are a LUXURY - not a necessity. If a customer deemed comfortable seating a priority, he or she would have several options: upgrading his ticket to first/business class; choosing an airline that specifically accomadates for larger seating; finding other ways of transport (car, boat, etc.) and so on. Personally I'm from NYC and have taken many forms of transportation. I cannot tell you how many times people ride the bus/subway and HAVE NO SEATING AT ALL, regardless of the fact that they paid for the ride. - FLIGHT ISN'T A RIGHT - Nope. It's not. But here my opponent is trying to straw man my argument and completely turn my point around. He said, \"If a customer from a low-income bracket cannot afford the price of the flight, it would be advisable that they seek alternate forms of transportation.\" I agree. So what's the point? Nothing. There isn't one here. MY point, however (supported with cited factual information), was pointing out the fact that there is probably a 10% chance that your neighbor on an airplane flight will be obese, due to statistics regarding obesity and its link to poverty, etc. Therefore if one is so concerned about this HORROR, they have the option of buying an additional plane ticket just in case. Otherwise they can just take their chances and 90% of the time be a-ok anyway. So here my opponent is trying to make you believe that I have suggested that healthy people buy additional seating on airplanes. I have done no such thing. My point was that if it is a huge concern to them, then they can. If they can just deal with it - or accept the fact that they have a 90% chance of being in the clear - then they DON'T have to buy an extra plane ticket. Simple as that. But my point here is why should an obese person have to buy an extra plane ticket to make someone else more comfortable? If it's about common courtesy and respect, then people should respect the obese too, by doing things such as 1) not smelling bad, 2) not bringing a crying baby on board, 3) not stinking up the bathroom, 4) not smoking as to up insurance, etc. However nobody has to pay for these inconveniences, so WHY SHOULD THE OBESE? Singling them out is wrong, and even if you disagree, my opponent has yet to prove otherwise. For instance, in response to the above, Pro has said, \"A crying child one may mute by putting on airline-provided headphones. Foul smelling passengers one may endure by simply turning on the airline-provided air conditioning. They do not lessen the product you purchased (the flight itself), even if they do make it slightly less desirable\" ... which is my exact point, except in reverse, obviously. That exact logic proves my case to be true -- having an obese passenger sitting next to you may make your flight less desirable; however, it is not lessening the product. Cramped space, smelly areas and other disruptions are inconveniences that ALL travelers face and deal with as a consequence of not being rich enough to afford their own private jets. - WEIGHT & FLIGHT - Pro acknowledges that an increase in gas prices is the #1 reason that the cost of flights has significantly increased. Another reason is that less people are flying due to the troubled economy. As a result, airlines are looking for every excuse to charge a little extra. They're pinching pennies at every opportunity. Thus, the charge for extra baggage is obviously going to increase. Now according to Pro, people pay for their seat... never did he mention that people ALSO pay for CARGO space. When people bring luggage on a plane, they are costing the airline money for things like, oh, the electric that powers the baggage claim area, the employees who transport the luggage, etc. Additionally, just as flying on a plane isn't an inherent right, neither is bringing luggage on a plane. Thus assuming that one does in fact pay for a seat on the plane, airlines have also agreed to say - okay - you can bring up to 100 lbs of luggage (for example). If you bring more than that, you pay. Those extra charges pay for increasing expenses in every aspect of flight, including gas. Similarly, an airline can charge you for things like soda on a plane. But to charge you extra per pound of body weight is discriminatory... - RESPECT FOR PASSENGERS - Obese people are not the only individuals who fit uncomfortably on a plane. Tall or larger people in general (not necessarily obese) may also be the cause of some discomfort. To discriminate against them could lead to a few things. First, it could upset customers so much that they choose not to fly at all... meaning that airlines are selling less tickets, meaning the 'skinny' people will face *INCREASED COST* to compensate for those lost sales. Second, while this idea sounds good in theory, putting it into practice would inevitably lead to countless lawsuits (amongst other burdens). This would not only be a waste of airline resources but government ones as well, and again cost others MORE MONEY... be it in taxes, other fees, etc. - FUEL - Back to the whole fuel thing, it has been said that 350 million more gallons of fuel are being used per year thanks in part to obese passengers. I don't have a lot of characters left for mathematical reasoning (though I'd be more than happy to explain it further in the next round!), but that comes to about 2.5 more gallons per flight - if that. So 2 gallons of gas is what...? $8 more per flight? So just how much extra should obese passengers be charged? That's it for now...",

I too hope that it will be interesting ==Definitions== Physical Education, as defined by the Merriam-Webster(1), is instruction in the development and care of the body ranging from simple calisthenic exercises to a course of study providing training in hygiene, gymnastics, and the performance and management of athletic games. I will leave the definition of a young child broad, however a child is defined as, by the legal dictionary(2), \"a young person\" ==Case== Contention 1: Childhood Obesity Childhood obesity is one of the biggest issues we face today. In 2012, more than 1/3 of children and adolescents where overweight or obese. (3) Children who are overweight or obese are at risk for various diseases, including heart disease and diabetes (4). In a sample of 5-to 17-year-olds, almost 60% of overweight children had at least one CVD risk factor and 25% of overweight children had two or more CVD risk factors. Children who are obese are also more likely to be obese as an adult (3). As an adult, there are further risks involved with obesity, including various forms of cancer. By prioritizing athletic and physical development, we can teach children the proper skills to avoid , such as calorie balancing. According to the CDC, Schools play a particularly critical role by establishing a safe and supportive environment with policies and practices that support healthy behaviors. Schools also provide opportunities for students to learn about and practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. (3) Contention 2: Improving life. As already stated, obesity is a major issue in today's world. Yes, intellectual education is important, but so is teaching people how to live a healthy life. Physical education provides kids a chance to develop motor skills, (5) key later in life. Secondly, sports education teaches kids both teamwork and a drive to succeed and win. (6) Third, Sports teach kids how to accept defeat.(6) It is for these reasons I urge a Pro Ballet. (Sorry for the short case, I am quite busy today.)",

            "conclusion": "Obese customers should pay more for flights.",
            "premise": ":: REBUTTAL :: 1. Cost of Insurance This contention is highly flawed. While obese customers may cost more to insure (as they pose a higher risk of becoming ill during flights), so do the elderly, those with allergies, those with asthma, those with mental illness, pregnant women, children in general, those who use/abuse drugs, those taking medication, etc. Because airlines do not require a background check before booking a flight, it would be extremely unjust to require specifically obese people to pay extra under the premise of an insurance issue, and not charge other potential 'threats' for the same substantial risk. Additionally, my opponent indicates that in only 1% of cases involving obesity is the condition genetic. I ask that statistics like this only be taken into account if they are cited/sourced, as it would be very easy for either side to draw up random stats that may or may not be true. Furthermore, I disagree with that figure on the basis of psychology alone -- I'm sure that even if 99% of obese individuals \"choose\" that lifestyle, there are some deep-rooted depression and self-esteem issues, which cause obesity to lean towards a medical (mental) condition rather than just a choice. Now even if you buy into the fact that overweight people choose that condition, you cannot deny my previous point that there are all kinds of conditions or circumstances which would increase the cost of insurance for certain flyers. To make this call for higher prices legit, you would have to agree upon charging a superior price for ALL flyers with medical conditions/situations that would cause insurnace to increase. Otherwise, a great deal of discrimination lawsuits would be on your hands, in which cases the airlines would be forced to charge migh higher prices for tickets than they already do in order to sustain legal fees. Plus, consider the fact that in order to regulate this kind of additional fee, new jobs would have to be created that deal specifically with insurance and charging passengers the right amount of money as designated for their flight. This would cause airline disruption, inevitably draw upon negative publicity, and most importantly cause the airline to shell out more money to pay the salaries of these new jobs and deal with other legal issues. In essence, the money that you are trying to 'save' is actually not profitable at all (it may even be an added expense), as new jobs would have to be compensated. And finally on this matter, you must take into account how many times one's obesity actually causes a MEDICAL EMERGENCY on a flight, to the point where insurance is actually even necessary. If the figures are low (and Pro hasn't given us any proof to indicate otherwise), you must find this contention to be entirely unnecessary and completely in my favor. 2. Comfort In order for this point to be validated, you must extend this argument to all forms of public transportation - not just airplanes. Therefore my opponent has the burden of affirming this resolution in terms of trains, subways, public buses, etc... in which case it would be easy to oppose for economic reasons. Further, a counter-attack may conclude that the airline be responsible for administering more comfortable seating for larger passengers; that is to say that bigger seats can/should be implented for comfort. You may charge passengers more money for this type of seating; you may even force a larger passenger to purchase a ticket for this kind of seating. However, you may NOT charge them extra for sitting in the same size seat as everyone else. Thirty percent of Americans are obese [1]. Statistics show that the highest demographic of obesity occurs amongst those of a lower class; in other words, the fattest people tend to also be the poorest [2]. Thus the likelihood of an obese person being able to afford a plane ticket is much lower -- say 10% (and that may be a generous figure). Now knowing that there is a 10% chance that an obese individual may cause you discomfort on a plane, a consumer has the option to buy THEMSELF an extra plane ticket, which would ensure them extra room for comfort even if an overweight person sat beside them. Sometimes, life is unfair and you make purchases hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. If you book a vacation in Aruba and it rains the whole time (causing you to have a disappoting experience), you won't find your hotel or airline refunding you any money for your misfortune. Similarly, airlines don't give you lower rates for the possibility of sitting next to a particularly foul-smelling passenger, or for being subjected to crying children. Better luck next time, mate. 3. Weight & Money --> The Real Issue There have been a lot of changes since the 1990s that have made things more expensive, specifically THE COST OF GASOLINE IN GENERAL. Many people blame George W. Bush for the rise in prices -- does that mean we get to charge all Republicans an added fee for contributing to our economic situation by voting for GWB? Certainly not. The truth be told, America has been looking for ways to promote healthy life choices by making it more expensive to lead an unhealthy lifestyle. For instance, we place high taxes on cigarettes partly because of their health cost. Similarly, ideas about making fast food drive-thrus more expensive have been discussed; Dr. Schmidt (an economist at the college of William & Mary) said people would expend more calories if they had to get out of their cars to pick up their food. The bottom line is, you cannot realistically blame overweight people for society's troubles, such as high gasoline prices. \"'This is like, let's find another reason to scapegoat fat people,' Dr. Oliver (a political scientist at the University of Chicago) says.\" -- \"Katherine Flegal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also wryly cautions against being quick to link cause and effect. 'Yes, obesity is to blame for all the evils of modern life, except somehow, weirdly, it is not killing people enough,' she said. 'In fact that's why there are all these fat people around. They just won't die'\" [3]. :: CONCLUSION :: Based on my arguments, it is clear why obese customers should NOT pay more money for plane tickets at the present time. It is neither cost effective nor fair, and the incentive for people to lose weight in order to save money just doesn't work. Countless studies prove that instead of helping, the stigmatization of being obese just leads to more over-eating and a higher rate/weight for those who are over-weight. This in turn leads to more fat people, meaning more sociological and economic issues in the United States and beyond. :: SOURCES :: [1] http://www.breitbart.com... [2] http://www.philly.com...

Rebuttal: Pro writes: \"In my school, no one eats the school lunchs\". He provides no evidence for this claim. I highly doubt that NO ONE eats lunch. :) Pro writes: \"people can not even tell what kind of food they are\" This is red herring, pardon the pun (That's actually pretty funny. LOL.) The fact that people can't tell what kind of food it is does not tell us what its quality is. Pro writes: \" i think more kids would eat if, say, taco bell supplied our school with lunch\" Pro gives no evidence for this claim. (K I know it's obvious, just sayin.) Furthermore Pro presumes that kids not eating lunch is a bad thing, without saying why. Lastly even if it is shown that kids don't eat it, & that it's a bad thing, that doesn't ipso facto mean that the school should switch to fast food. The most logical solution would be to simply improve the food. Reasons that schools should not serve fast food: 1) Fast food is unhealthy, & more specificly causes obesity[1] w8 is a problem in the U.S. More than one-third of U.S. adults (35.7%) are obese.[2] Over two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese, and over one-third are obese, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003\"2006 and 2007\"2008[3] The problem is getting worse: Between 1988\"1994 and 2007\"2008 the prevalence of obesity increased in adults at all income and education levels. [2] Being overw8 has negitive consequences: Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer[2][3], some of the leading causes of preventable death.[2] high LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis (degeneration of cartilage and bone of joints), sleep apnea and other breathing problems, some forms of cancer (breast, colorectal, endometrial, and kidney), complications of pregnancy, menstrual irregularities[3] Fast food has been linked to w8 gain[4] Fast food is a health hazard[5] there\"s evidence from studies in teens and adults that frequent fast-food consumption contributes to overeating and weight gain.[6] In 2008, medical costs associated with obesity were estimated at $147 billion; the medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight.[2] 2) Uncle Sam's in debt already, nuf said [1] Fast Food Nation.

Obese people are being discriminated against, and will continue to be discriminated against until they lose weight. In a study done by researchers at Rice University, he found out that \"Sales clerks tend to subtly discriminate against overweight shoppers but treat them more favorably if they perceive that the individual is trying to lose weight\" \"Ten average-weight Caucasian women between the ages of 19 and 28 played the role of customer in four different scenarios: an average-weight shopper in casual attire, an average-weight shopper in professional attire, an obese shopper (the result of a size 22 obesity prosthetic worn under the clothing) in casual attire and an obese shopper in professional attire. Following a memorized script, the shoppers sought assistance with picking out a birthday gift in various stores; after each shopping experience, they filled out a questionnaire evaluating the way they were treated by the sales clerk. A tape recorder in their purse captured the conversations so that the sales clerks' tone, inflection and choice of words could be analyzed. In addition, the researchers stationed an observer in the store within hearing range of the shopper to provide a second opinion of how each interaction fared by filling out a questionnaire after each shopping experience. Based on data from interactions in 152 stores in a large mall, the researchers found greater levels of interpersonal discrimination directed toward obese shoppers than toward average-weight shoppers. The findings were based on the observers' and customers' reports of the sales clerks' eye contact, friendliness, rudeness, smile, premature ending of the interaction, length of interaction time, and negative language and tone. Almost three-fourths of the sales clerks were women.\" >http://www.eurekalert.org... Discrimination towards the obese and overweight is just one more reason why we should fight towards ending this epidemic. Children growing up in these conditions seem to have more psychological disadvantages than those who grew up with an average weight. Children who get called names may have a hard time socializing with one another later on in life, and can cause severe damages to their personalities. As stated online at \"http://www.suicide.org...; \"People who are morbidly obese not only have to deal with the extra weight on their bodies, but also a social stigma associated with obesity. Clearly, the social stigma can be contributory to the onset of depression. The findings in the study that morbidly obese people are five times more likely to be depressed than those who are not, also means that people who are morbidly obese are at a high risk for suicide.\" If we increase the number of activities, and decrease the number of fattening foods obesity rates could decrease by half!",

This is problematic because (the United States of) America is a very heterogeneous country in many facets.

A murderous country, while containing many areas with low murder rates (such as Hawaii, Iowa, and New Hampshire). A racially diverse country, while containing many racially homogeneous areas (such as Maine and North Dakota). Any resident of these counterexamples could make a similar claim to yours about their own area of residence and draw a conclusion about the population of the U.S. that is very false.

            "premise": "As part of my opponent's last response he wrote: \"If the obese can sacrifice food for the starving then Pro has contradicted himself by proving enough land to feed both. Not only is this a contradiction, it simply isn't true. As of now we have plenty of food and farmland to raise food for more than everyone.\" Firstly, it is not a contradiction as I only said the problem could be \"alleviated\" if the obese ate less and secondly, I'm afraid there isn't plenty of food to go round, that's why food prices are at a record high and at least 100 million people are being pushed further into poverty and hunger as a result. Source: http://www.wfp.org... My opponent continued\u2026 \"Not only is food important for everyone, but so is a job. This just shows Darwins theory of \"survival of the fittest\" more plausible.\" I have no argument with that statement but then my opponent wrote\u2026 \"We are no different from the animal kingdom, the strongest and most prosperous will prevail.\" I do take issue with this, however. As my opponent stated, food is important and so is a job, and it is employment that sets humans apart from the animal kingdom. We evolved into the planet's dominant species though co-operating with one another. Instead of each individual foraging for themselves, we formed tribes and introduced division of labour whereby only some of the members were responsible for the provision of food, leaving the others to mine for metal ores, make tools, construct buildings, etc. There were two things that made this co-operation possible. The first was the ability to communicate sophisticated concepts using speech and the second was a code of laws based on common moral values (one of which is not to allow any fat people go around stealing grub off the kids!) As the human race developed, the physically strongest in society became less important than the most intelligent, to a point now where the situation is completely reversed. Here's another one of my scenarios to illustrate the point: A 22 year-old student rocks up in a pub in downtown Athens, Georgia. He is a big lad, 6'1\" and 150lbs, because he eats more than some obese people. He takes a stool at the bar and as he guzzles down his domestic beer he notices a couple of attractive girls and decides to impress them by picking a fight with some guys over by the pool table. Just as the student is about to throw his first punch, everybody's attention is attracted by the howl of the highly tuned V8 engine of a brand new Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder which pulls up outside. Out steps a tall, dark, handsome company director / revolutionary socialist. He walks into the pub, takes a table near the pretty girls' and orders a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape. He notices the young ladies' glasses are almost empty, so he politely invites them to join him, explaining in dulcet English tones that he couldn't possibly finish the bottle himself and legally drive back to the Foundry Park Inn and Spa, where he is staying in the Presidential Suite. The girls accept his offer and as they chat, they are impressed by his intellect and enthused by his ideas for socio-economic justice based on a mass redistribution of wealth and his plans to end to world hunger by shaming the obese into not being so damn greedy all the time. By this time, our student friend has forgotten his quarrel at the pool table and looks on jealously as the debonair Englishman leaves and heads back to the hotel with the girls. Unfortunately, the Lambo only has two seats so one of the girls has to catch the bus, but never mind that, the point is, it wasn't physical prowess that prevailed in this situation, it was personality and intelligence \u2013 that's what separates humans from animals. A summary of opponents penultimate point were that anyone that eats more than they need to survive, rather than stay healthy, would be immoral according to my reasoning. I don't accept that, we all have the right to eat enough to be healthy, but I do accept that people who eat food in excess, just out of pure greed, are also acting immorally, even though they may not be obese. His final point was that some people can become overweight for medical reasons, a point which I conceded in Round 1. You see, I'm not being unreasonable, all I'm saying is that if the obese weren't so greedy, more of the planet's finite food supply could go to malnourished children in the Third World and for that reason, I urge you to vote Pro.",

Genetic factors, for example, account for about 40% of the risk of alcoholism.\" Addiction is not always voluntary. It may, at times, be a disease afflicted through genetics.Furthermore, many people who have STDs who arguably received them because they \"chose\" not to use proper protection during sexual intercourse. By your logic, STDs are in fact not diseases because they may not be genetic. What about diseases that you catch during your lifetime wthat don't have genetic causes? Are they not diseases either?In essence, why are genetics intrinsic to the definition of disease?\"It was enacted as a buffer for those who needed higher self esteem without the feelings of shame.\"1.

            "conclusion": "Obese customers should pay more for flights.",
            "premise": "First of all, I'd like to thank my opponent for joining this debate with interesting and intelligent opinions. I hope to be as enjoyable an opponent to have. 1. Cost of Insurance While there's without a reasonable doubt that obesity is linked to similiarly potential medical issues in comparison to old age, allergies, asathma, mental illnesses, pregnancies, etc, obesity is by far the most preventable one. As such, my opponent's suggestion that airlines be required to perform invasive background checks for all medical issues is unnecessary and without ground. Let us take smoking for instance. It has a negative influence on one's health, and as such heavy taxes are required on any purchases of tobacco. The same goes for alcohol. Most of these taxes placed on the products go to pay for medical insurance and costs, since smokers have a higher chance of falling ill from their habits. The taxes increase each year based on specific calculations for how much it costs to house patients with tobacco (or alcohol) related diseases, and it's balanced out. Those who choose to use tobacco pays this tax as insurance. Those who don't smoke, don't pay this tax. It's quite a simple situation. However, since my opponents insists on an argument of statistics and precise percentages, I'll consider the argument here as moot, and as such I'll move on. 2. Comfort My opponent has suggested that perhaps all modes of transportation should raise fees for the obese, and I don't disagree. In fact the system currently already has this in mind: buses do not charge for individual seats, cars are personal purchases allowing consumers to purchase larger cars, and trains typically are pre-designed with much larger space already; however, if obese passengers are indeed causing problems for the remaining passengers, perhaps extra fare is necessary. That said, the debate topic is that the obese should be charged extra for FLIGHTS, so I'll return to our original topic. The argument that since obese individuals are statistically likelier to to be from a less wealthy background, and therefore should not be required to purchase airfare would have been an interesting one if our political system was socialist. However, airlines are not governmental institution, and flight isn't a human right. If a customer from a low-income bracket cannot afford the price of the flight, it would be advisable that they seek alternate forms of transportation. It would, however, be unfair that others who have the income or capacity to live healthier pay for their flights. My opponent suggests that when you sit next to an obese individual who is taking up much of your seat, perhaps you should be required to purchase yourself another ticket. This is the exact unfairness I referred to. Why would those who chose a healthy and balanced lifestyle, who already pay FAR too much in taxes to pay for the medical fees of those who choose this lifestyle? Keep in mind, transportation through flight is NOT an inherent right. No one should have to pay extra so the obese can travel faster or more comfortably. In regards to my opponent's statement: \"Sometimes, life is unfair...\", I disagree. Is this the same as sitting next to a crying child or foul-smelling passenger? Absolutely not. A crying child one may mute by putting on airline-provided headphones. Foul smelling passengers one may endure by simply turning on the airline-provided air conditioning. They do not lessen the product you purchased (the flight itself), even if they do make it slightly less desirable. The product one purchases is a full seat, and a small one at that. When another passenger demands a part of the seat YOU paid for and refuses to reimburse you in any way, this is robbery. One preventable by having the passenger pay their fair share. 3. Weight & Money \"Many people blame George W. Bush for the rise in prices -- does that mean we get to charge all Republicans an added fee for contributing to our economic situation by voting for GWB? Certainly not.\" You cannot be seriously attempting to compare the two. I'm going to chalk this up as humor and move on to your actual point. \"you cannot realistically blame overweight people for society's troubles, such as high gasoline prices.\" And I didn't. Please read my previous argument, it's difficult to debate when one's arguments are misinterpreted. I realistically blame overweight people for raising the costs of FLIGHTS since their weight requires planes to burn more fuel. There's no question that the greatest increase in flight costs involves the increase in gas prices. As such, most airlines are starting to \"redesign\" their pricing for carry-on luggage as well as check-in luggage. Whereas previously most airlines allow 2 pieces of luggage at check-in, now the industry standard is one, with extra fees attached to the second. Current passengers are charged extra for overweight luggage for this reason, why are they not charged extra for overweight physique? :: CONCLUSION :: There's no question that a flight with mostly overweight passengers will cost the airline more than a flight with mostly underweight passengers. This is simple common sense. The question here lies in whether it'll be more beneficial to charge consumers who are obese more than those who are not. If traveling by flights is a human right, and airlines are government controlled, perhaps it would make sense to maintain the status quo. However, since air travel is still considered a convenience rather than a right, it seems unfair to lump the excess fees from the excess weight to the innocent consumers who strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps, when our technology advances to a point when simple physics no longer factor in the costs of our travel, it would not matter if our fares are justly proportioned. However, with our current situation, it remains unfair for all of us to carry the weight of a few.",

So what a southern American citizen, like myself, views immoral might be completely different from a citizen in Hong Kong, or even New York. 2) Time changes our social rules. Now, we have a very specific scale of obesity according to height and gender. Centuries ago, there was no such thing. In fact, being \"plump\" (now considered obese) was a sign of wealth and class. So in that aspect, if you were starving, you were a peasant, which was acceptable. 3) You're saying that instead of eating that 7 course meal that far surpasses what our society says we \"need,\" donate money to charity so other people can eat and be healthy as well, right? Every culture, and every individual, has a standard of living. I bet you live in a house or apartment, probably have furniture, a t.v, a nice bed, refrigeration, a/c, etc. You can probably live on a quarter of the expenses your living on now and still be better off than those that are starving. However, that is all you know, that is how you were brought up and anything less would be uncomfortable (just an example). Those over seas, in Africa, who are starving know little more than being starving. I'm not saying that is right, or wrong. I'm simply stating that the definition of right and wrong changes. Basically, immoral is a word that changes by culture and over time. My country condones luxury living first, and then giving to charity. Other cultures differ, which is similar to the over all principal of morality. There is no concrete definition for being moral.",

            "premise": "Definitions1. AddictionMy opponent never refutes the definition of what an addiction is but rather offers an interpretation of what she \"believe[s] to cause 'addiction[.]'\"Whether the addiction a person has is to alcohol, drugs, gambling, or anything else has nothing to do with the status of an addiction as a disease. The resolution is not about the causes of addictions being a disease, but if addictions themselves are.2. DiseaseMy opponent never refuted my definition of disease either, so we must assume she accepts it as well.CaseWith both definitions agreed upon, I would like to draw attention back to my first contention. My opponent never addresses my case in her rebuttal, so we must assume that it is conceded as true. Even if we don't, the logic still stands that addictions are, by definition, diseases. This dropped argument will provide the judges with an independent reason to negate the resolution.Rebuttal1. Personal ExperiencePersonal experience is nice and all, but you have yet to disprove the facts that I presented within the last round about genetics accounting for 40% of the risk of alcoholism. We haven't seen medical verification that you are gentically prone to alcoholism either, and even if we are made aware of this evidence, it doesn't prove that you can resist addiction in all cases.2. Cancer PatientI'm sorry but I am having a hard time following this example. Okay, so sometimes addicts of drugs and alcohol take actions for a quick fix. How does this make their addiction any less of a disease? This is the effect of their addiction, this is what the disease makes them do. You talk about how people take these actions on feelings alone, but, once again, have yet to disprove that genetic factors are involved. Even so, why can't diseases be caused by emotional instability?Broken Heart Syndrome is caused by emotional distress [1].\"Broken heart syndrome is a temporary heart condition brought on by stressful situations, such as the death of a loved one. People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. These broken heart syndrome symptoms may be brought on by the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones. In broken heart syndrome, a part of your heart temporarily enlarges and doesn't pump well, while the remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions.\"Now I ask my opponent, why is it that when real consequences are taking place, Broken Heart Syndrome would not be considered a disease?3. SiroccosSure, siroccos is disease caused by addiction to certain drugs. However, the addiction to these drugs is also a disease. You asked if ther was a gene that forces people to become alcoholics, and I would just like to remind you of my evidence that there is.Conclusion1. Addictions are definitionally diseases. This is dropped and an independent reason to negate.2. My opponent's case relies on there being a lack of genetic causes to addiction, but does not disprove my cited evidence that genetics are, in fact, involved. Even without this evidence my opponent fails to prove that emotionally-caused addictions are not diseases.3. Remember however, that based on the wording of the resolution we are not debating whether the cause of addictions are diseases but if addictions are diseases themselves. If drugs and alcohol do not cause addictions, that is not a reason why addictions are not diseases and you can still negate.References1. http://www.mayoclinic.com...",

My answer having a \"broken heart is not a disease \" the heart itself before some emotionally feeling arose was perfect does not make for a disease one simply can't be defined a a real disease.then we could say a compulsive hoarder who refuses to part with anything' if you pick apart the underlying cause you may find this person has an emotional disorders NOT technically a disease but rather a set of imbalances due to a traumatic occurrence that must be corrected or rewired in order to release these habits. http://www.schaler.net... http://www.thecleanslate.org... This physical change of state is balanced by the arguments that addiction is simply an unwanted behavior, a behavior that doesn't fit the traditional idea of what a disease is. At some point before it becomes a condition over which a person has no control, addiction involves choice and human free will. To that end, it cannot possibly be categorized along with conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or other neurological diseases.The question is an important one because both medical treatment and insurance reimbursement are diagnosis driven. Standards of care are drawn up based on recognized disease states. Insurance companies make decisions on what they will cover by looking at standard treatment plans for approved diagnoses. Government policies are also influenced by how you define addiction.Proponents of the choice model of addiction argue that the consumption of drugs or alcohol is a choice, and that just as people can choose to take drugs or alcohol, they can choose not to.",

            "conclusion": "Alcoholism is not a disease!",
            "premise": "Alcoholism is not a real disease. But, addiction is. At the time when AA was started back in the 30's it contained a doctor's OPINION. Fast forward to 1953 and NA was formed. More research had been done into the topic of addictive substances and so on. What separates NA from AA as a whole is that NA recognizes alcohol as a drug and an addictive substance that can cause addiction and dependence not a disease of its own. If there was a person with a 25-I NBOMe addiction, they would not be recognized in today's society as a 25-I NBOMeoholic nor will they be diagnosed with the disease of 25-I NBOMe-lism. If someone actually said that though, first we would think they are crazy and that they are trying to seem unique. From a sober source: \"it is important to understand that the disease theory is just that - a theory. Additionally, it is important to understand that this theory is only accepted as fact by the rehab, rehabilitation, and treatment industry here in the United States. The rest of the world considers the disease theory for alcoholism pure bunk. In his book Why We Should Reject The Disease Concept of Alcoholism, Herbert Fingarette, Ph.D., makes the following observations: In the United States, but not in other countries such as Great Britain (Robertson and Heather, 1982), the standard answer is to call the behavior a disease - 'alcoholism' - whose key symptom is a pattern of uncontrollable drinking. This myth, now widely advertised and widely accepted, is neither helpfully compassionate nor scientifically valid. It promotes false beliefs and inappropriate attitudes, as well as harmful, wasteful, and ineffective social policies. The myth is embodied in the following four scientifically baseless propositions:1) Heavy problem drinkers show a single distinctive pattern of ever greater alcohol use leading to ever greater bodily, mental, and social deterioration.2) The condition once it appears, persists involuntarily: the craving is irresistible and the drinking is uncontrollable once it has begun.3) Medical expertise is needed to understand and relieve the condition (cure the disease) or at least ameliorate its symptoms.4) Alcoholics are no more responsible legally or morally for their drinking and its consequences than epileptics are responsible for the consequences of their movements during seizures.The idea that alcoholism is a disease has always been a political and moral notion with no scientific basis. It was first promoted in the United States around 1800 as a speculation based on erroneous physiological theory (Levine, 1978), and later became a theme of the temperance movement (Gusfield, 1963). It was revived in the 1930s by the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), who derived their views from an amalgam of religious ideas, personal experiences and observations, and the unsubstantiated theories of a contemporary physician (Robinson, 1979).1 Another observation is offered by Jeffery Schaler, Ph.D. in June of 1995: Extensive research supports the idea that addiction is a voluntary process, a behavior that is better explained by individual psychological and environmental factors, than physiology and the chemical properties of drugs.2 \" Source: http://www.soberforever.net...",
