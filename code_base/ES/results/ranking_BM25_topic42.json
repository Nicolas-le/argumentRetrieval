            "premise": "Fighting in hockey, and in sports in general, should not be permissible for any reason. While fighting does have a historic place in the way hockey is played and is often a notable reason why people watch hockey in the first place, it should not be allowed moving forward. Player safety should be at the forefront of sports, and by allowing fighting in hockey, the sport is openly showing its disregard for such safety. Hockey leagues do not need players to police each other and hold each other accountable, that's what referees and league punishments are for. Basketball is a relatively physical sport as well, however the NBA generally does a good job of enforcing appropriate fines and penalties to discourage excessive violence on the court. These monetary fines, game suspensions, and other punishments all hold players accountable without relying on the players to do it themselves. Hockey is one of the very few sports where it is seen as acceptable to have designated players that serve no role other than to protect the team's talented star players from getting hurt in a fight - a sign that the sport needs to change its standards to reduce violence among its players. Cheap shots will always occur in sports, however it is better to address those dirty plays with real-life punishments that affect the player's ability to participate and make financial gains, rather than by putting them in a glass box for a few minutes.",

            "premise": "While fighting might not be too different from the natural physicality of hockey, the way it is presented and glorified within the sport does propose an ethical dilemma. A body check into the boards is violent but it is not staged the same way as a fight is. When the helmets and gloves come off for a fight, fans of all ages see a part of the game that no longer belongs in today's society. Big hits will always happen in sports, whether it be in hockey, football, lacrosse, etc., but that should be the extent of glorified physicality. Hockey and its designated enforcers leave a negative impression on youth fans and players who look to emulate professional athletes. Rather than working to become a talented hockey player, some kids would rather become the guy who goes for \"big hits\" and is known for their physical play rather than developing useful skills within the sport. This influence of violence does bring up ethical concerns, as it changes the way youth players see and play the game. Physical violence is not an appropriate response to conflict, even within a physical sport. The concept of sportsmanship and playing the game the \"right way\" is put in danger by giving fighting a home in the sport of hockey.",

The practice of fighting in NHL games should be protected because it is not simply an exercise of unchecked aggression, but rather a tool to be used to hold players accountable for their actions. With 12 players on the rink at once and only 3 officials to regulate them, players often get away illegal/dangerous checks. In the absence of consistent regulation, fighting in hockey allows for the players to police one another. The knowledge that a dirty play or a cheap shot will likely result in retaliation offers an effective deterrent against players engaging in these potentially harmful activities. While fighting admittedly introduces a risk for injury, the severity of this injury pales in comparison to the potential injuries one might sustain from an illegal check.",

As mentioned previously, fighting in hockey has been an integral aspect of the sport since the formation of the National Hockey League. Furthermore, it is not as if these fights are completely unregulated. In the 1980's there was an average of 1 fight per NHL (100%). As a response to this, the League implemented new rules governing fighting. These rules still allowed fights to take place, they just assigned a 2-5 minute penalty to the players involved. This penalty causes players to be judicious about when they choose to fight. This is similar to the penalty system in many sports: soccer players shown to be more judicious about the use of aggressive plays after they have already received a yellow card, NBA athletes are more cautious about play after they have received 3 fouls, etc. Additionally, if the concern about fighting is motivated by a concern for the players, then the opinions of these players should be considered. A survey of NHL players conducted in 2012 asked them whether or not they believed fighting should remain a practice in the NHL, 98% of them responded that it should be. This demonstrates that the players involved, who are cognizant of the risks associated with the activity, still see a value in it and would like it to remain.",

An article published in WIRED magazine commented in April; \"as of this writing, no fewer than 158 National Hockey League players \" slightly more than one of every five in the league \" are injured.\" These are substantial numbers and they would not be significantly diminished by the abolition of fighting. The players on the ice know the risk they assume when they go out and play the sport, and in the absence of any complaints or activism on the part of the players to abolish fighting, I don't see how it could make the game substantially safer. I do not see any ethical considerations that distinguish fighting from any other dangerous component of hockey. Unless it can be demonstrated to be uniquely harmful in a way distinct from the dangers of stray shots, eye-gouging hihi sticks, or knee-shattering collisions, then I maintain that it is nonsensical to ban fighting in hockey.",

Fighting in hockey often results in the removal of either one or both players' helmets and gloves, resulting in an exchange of blows to the head. Players wear so much protective equipment that fights become more about punches to the head rather than a general pain to the body. This emphasis on head shots can result in an increased amount of concussions. Neurosurgeon Charles H. Tator suggests that 10% of concussions in hockey are the result of fighting rather than actual game play. This is an easily preventable source of concussions and player harm that has no place in the sport. The long term effects of concussions have become increasingly relevant as more former athletes, particularly professional football players, have been experiencing mental health issues as their careers and lives progress. The effects of concussions are just now becoming better understood by researchers, but it is becoming evident that athletes' brains are being severely affected by these traumatic injuries. Fighting also raises a concern about the recent painkiller epidemic in which athletes are being addicted to their prescribed medications, negatively affecting them even beyond the duration of their injury.",

            "premise": "I am Pro, and I will be arguing that Ice hockey is better than Hockey.Leggo:Since the first round is for definitions, I\u2019d like to provide some.DefinitionsIce Hockey - A fast contact sport played on an ice rink between two teams of six skaters, who attempt to drive a small rubber disk (the puck) into the opposing goal with hooked or angled sticks. It developed in Canada in the 19th century [1. tinyurl.com/6p959ln]Hockey - A sport played on a hard surface in which two opposing teams of roller skaters, using curved sticks, try to drive a ball into the opponents' goal (i.e. roller hockey) [2. tinyurl.com/7q7act7]Better - Greater in excellence or higher in quality [tinyurl.com/7232uaq] Contention 1: Ice hockey is more exciting. Ice hockey employs many of the beautiful, thrilling, and scintillating moves possible only on low-friction surfaces, such as ice. The smooth surface of the ice allows for more versatile skating, which is essential for exciting game-play and athletic challenges. The sport uses the ice as a dynamic factor in its physical competition exhibitions on which amazing tricks are performed, skate paths are undulated, and the thirst for victory hangs in the balance like the sweet breath of angels. Ice hockey uses checking, which involves hitting another player\u2019s body with yours. It is really exciting, because of the primal athletic aggression it unleashes; the fans love it as well. Ice hockey uses a puck, a flat cylinder of rubber, as the disk with which scoring requires. The puck is perfectly suited to the sport, because of its stable nature on the ice and the thrilling sound of the slapshot. The rolling ball as used in hockey is a banal, incongruous object to be used in the sport, as it makes passing, scoring, and general play awkward and disappointing. It\u2019s as if someone brought golf into the sport, which instantly makes it less exciting. The puck is also more easily manipulated by the player in ice hockey, allowing for more exciting scoring opportunities and more creative shots. The challenge of deflecting these shots is much more difficult for the goalie in ice hockey than the goalie in hockey, because the puck has a slimmer profile, is moving faster with less air resistance, and is more difficult to block, enhancing the shooting experience.Therefore, ice hockey is more exciting because of the dynamic qualities of ice skating, the perfect object of play: the puck, and the creative play and goals (see the video for exciting and creative goals).Contention 2: Ice hockey is more popular than hockey. Ice hockey has more spectators in the NHL than in every single country\u2019s roller hockey league combined. Ice hockey also has higher participation, more rinks, and a better societal image than roller hockey. Roller hockey is accompanied by a social stigma of nerdiness and awkwardness. The participants of roller hockey are even looked down upon by their familial sport neighbors, ice hockey. Ice hockey is known, watched, played, respected, and valued more than roller hockey.Contention 3: Ice Hockey is actually safer than hockey. Fewer common injuries occur in ice hockey than in roller hockey, largely due to the surface the game is played over. It is basic physics: friction is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. The higher the friction on a hard surface, the more intense the impact when one falls. That\u2019s why more concussions, broken bones, and fractures occur in roller hockey than in ice hockey. When a skater falls in ice hockey, much of the force of his impact is displaced into movement in a particular direction. Even ice skaters voluntarily fall and slide along the ice\u2019s surface during performances to increase the aesthetic experience and variety in their routines. Now, if someone were to voluntarily fall and slide along a roller rink, he must be a masochist.Therefore, with a basic understanding of friction and force, we are led to the common sense conclusion that ice hockey is safer than hockey.It is for all of the previously stated reasons that the resolution is affirmed.Thanks for reading and debating :Dhttp://www.youtube.com...",

Have disabilities in your legs but love hockey? Then play sledge hockey! Don't want to move around much but still play a version of hockey? Then play air hockey! Don't have a rink? Play field hockey! Too cold/hot to play hockey outdoors? Get a net in your basement,some hockey sticks and a ball, invite a friend over and GAME ON!!! There are many more types of Hockey then soccer, allowing everyone to pick their preferred version while soccer is just two nets and a ball. Argument #2: HOCKEY FIGHTS!!! Some people come to see hockey games and enjoy the sport, others want to see blood on the ice and some want both! The penalty is small (To be exact 5 minutes) and the punishment will be increased if serious injuries happen. Saying that these fights are dangerous is untrue most of the time and serious injuries are rare. Ice fights are viewed by many as a tradition, getting to the point that Ice fights are included and detailed in hockey themed games like the EA NHL series where the game allows the player to throw and block certain shots, eventually causing there to be a winner and a loser of a fight WITHOUT a simulation. The popularity of fights have even ushered in videos just about hockey fights, like this! I could give more, but I got to do some chores Thanks and I await your response!",

            "premise": "I request that voters appreciate that due to the very short round timings of instigator we both have unfortunately forfeited one round each and that neither my opponent nor myself should receive penalty for this since our acts cancel each other out.I shall like to point out that my opponent chose to defend ice hockey as opposed to field hockey (which is definitely what one would assume hockey on its own meant since hockey was originally field only).Nonetheless I shall rebut her points and hope to conclude in a very formal and appropriate manner.My opponent seems to begin justifying hockey's supposed superiority over football by stating that \" In football, you fall on soft ground. In hockey, you slam into hard boards and solid ice.\" This is as if to say that running into a slab of ice is a superior activity than running into a wall of muddy grass. I can assure that the bloodshed and overall damage of the ice is far more gruesome and malignant than the latter unless of course by chance the field happened to have very infested mud (which the well-cleaned professional fields of football do not). Thus this is a rather futile point to raise in favour of hockey as it merely proves the stupidity of ice hockey over football.\"There are no weapons in football.\" This is exactly why it's a safer and superior sport. It is a sport that turns the body into the weapon, one need only master his or her body and then train with it to master football. To master hockey is a far more dangerous and risky ordeal make it far more of a 'who is lucky enough not to get hit?' ordeal than a 'who is the best player?' ordeal.\"In hockey, every player carries a stick that can do serious damage.\" Yes and in the ghetto everyone carries a gun. Does this make the ghetto better than the uptown city?\"If a football hits you in the face, your face guard will protect you. If a hockey puck is slapped into your face, your facial bones will be broken and teeth lost.\" This is because American football is a far safer sport played by very risk-averse individuals usually who will go far in life. In hockey there is a huge element of risk that you could literally get your head cracked open or jaw smashed in, in the blink of an eye due to bad luck. Thus it is a far more barbaric and inferior sport in terms of its system of regulations and safety measures.\"if it[the hockey stick] strikes you hard enough and in just the right spot, you will die.\" Yes exactly, this is why it is a far more dangerous and less pleasant sport to play, referee and watch.\" Football cleats might give you a tiny puncture wound.\" That's because American football players want to be safe while training and competing in their sport, not sorry for ever taking it up.\"A hockey skate blade is razor sharp and at least two players in recent memory came close to bleeding to death after having major arteries sliced by them.\" Because that's exactly what we wants to happen in a sport... Not.\"I could go on but there really is no contest here.\" Then why offer a debate if there's no contest?\"Hockey is infinitely more dangerous to play than football.\" And this is exactly why football is the better sport.Do we think that slitting arteries of people open is a better option than not doing so? The law would suggest we do not.Do we think that smashing someone in the 'right spot' therefore, in essence, committing murder is a better option than not doing so? The law would suggest we do not.So then tell me why is it that a sport that incorporates both of those risks is deemed the better one? The simple fact is you can't tell me why because there is no reason why.As I said in round one, \"in American football anything is being involved in the sport.\" The brutality in American Football isn't one f danger, it is one represented through the fact that one must wear severely heavy padding in order to avoid the possible injury that could occur. Hockey endorses only shin pads and gum shields. This will not stop the hockey stick hitting you in the 'right spot' to cause a fatal blow and thus is a far inferior and barbaric sport in comparison with the civilised and rational sport of American football.I have refuted all points raised by pro (in fact favouring con's side throughout) and re-iterated my own.I leave it to the voters.",

Anyways, since you provided no arguments and no structure, I will just do a few arguments this round. On to debating! (ARGUMENTS) (1) Imagine that you were playing hockey, and you were skating up with the puck, when you get hit. Hard. You black out and wake up in the hospital, your career in Hockey over. The point I am making is that hockey is way too physical, which leads to many injuries. You are allowed to aggressively shove, slash and hit people in hockey with little to no penalty. You can get into a fight where you are only broken up after the fight occurs. Injuries come. A lot. I will post a few videos in this argument, so if you are squirmish, maybe don\u2019t watch them. This first video shows a hit from Boston Bruins forward Zdeno Chara on Max Pacioretty of the Montreal Canadiens. Pacioretty goes down, In a lot of pain, with a concussion. This second one shows one of the all-time best hockey players get a concussion, which turned out to affect crosby for over half of a year {1} Last, but most likely the worst, was this: Imagine you are Steve Moore. He was your average hockey player. Then, one game, against Vancouver, his whole career ended. Todd Bertuzzi comes up to him and wants a fight. Steve Moore says no. A few minutes later, Bertuzzi comes up to Moore, grabs his jersey, viciously punches Moore in the face then shoves onto the cold, hard ice. As a result, Moore was knocked out cold for around 11 minutes. He got three fractured vertebrae and a very major concussion. His passion, career, and love for hockey was done. Over. This is all a result of the violent nature of hockey. Now this is just concussions/injuries from hits/on ice not fight stuff, but what about from fights? http://www.nhl.com... In this video you will see he gets into a Soccer is not nearly as brutal as Hockey, while yes, I will not deny that there are injuries in Soccer, the severity of injuries and the amount of injuries are much higher in Hockey.

            "conclusion": "Hockey is better than soccer",
            "premise": "Time for rebuttals First argument The cost and the simplicity does not make soccer better than hockey. Hockey is a sport of talent. Not everyone can skate or stick handle, but everyone can run and kick a ball. Second argument The pace of the game has a big factor in entertainment. Would you sit and watch a game of any sport were the players just walked around slowly? That would not be a good sport to watch. While you talk about a man dribbling past 4 guys, a hockey player can do just the same with a puck. Have you ever watched someone split the defense before? Hockey players also display the positional awareness of there team mates and opposing players while keeping pace with both them and the puck. Hockey players are the fastest people on two feet while on the ice. Hockey players also demonstrate skill on the ice during a game while also adding in contact, making more of a challenge. Longer games can be enjoyable if there is a lot of action. There is not much action in soccer compared to hockey. In hockey you are watching a game that is constantly in motion. No matter what position you play you are always moving. A soccer game can get boring after an hour of watching men/woman running back and forth with a ball, kicking it out of bounds and having to throw it back in. Third argument The video is just showing a few clips of what constantly happens during a soccer game. Hockey players do not embellish because that gives them penalties. Soccer players embellish a lot. Fourth argument This one is simple. Large net small goalie, not many goals. Small net large goalie, still more goals then soccer. Simple as that. Fifth argument Have you ever watched the winter classics or the other outdoor games hockey players have been in? They play in a lot of snow. Hockey is mostly played in doors so they are not really exposed to this weather. That makes it better for fans. You do not have to worry about games being canceled/rescheduled because of weather. Sixth argument The equipment does not protect you from everything. There are gaps in the equipment. And getting hit as hard as they are, the equipment just simply absorbs some of the power behind the hit, but it will still hurt ( trust me) when players fight they take off there gloves ( throw down) helmets are not allowed to be taken off, but most of the time they come off with the power of a hit. Hockey players are on the ice 35-45 seconds at a time because while they are on the ice they are constantly moving. If you were to watch a game of hockey, you would notice that while a player is on the ice they are never standing still. They are always skating from one end of the ice to the other. Soccer players might play longer shifts, but that is because they are not constantly in motion. To add to the fact of how tough hockey players are. When you see a soccer player get injured (or pretty much any sports player) you see them lay on the ground until they are taken off by stretcher or helped off. In hockey, the players get up and skate off on there on. The only time you will not see that happen is if they are knocked out. Here is an example. Last season, Paul Martin, who plays for the Pittsburgh Penguins, broke the upper part of his leg. He skated to the bench and sat down to wait for his next shift. He did not realize his leg was broken until he stood up for his next shift and felt the bone move. Another example would be Clint Malarchuk. During a game he had his jugular vein cut by a skate. He refused to get on the stretcher. He skated off the ice on his own. ( he lived) the link to the video is below. If you don't like the sight of blood DON'T WATCH. Seventh argument Out of bounds rarely happens during a hockey game. Getting the game back in motion happens in a matter of seconds. http://video.nhl.com...",

            "premise": "Alright. Time to blow these 10,000 characters off the roof \"Longer Games\" In your rebuttal you said that for some fans that longer is better. Well how about this: For some fans shorter=better. To further my argument here is a short definition by Dictionary.com Definition of the word \"Longer\" #5: requiring a considerable time to relate, read, etc.: a long story. Definition of the word \"Better\" #1: of superior quality or excellence: a better coat; a better speech. The two words are NOT the same. Literally and Not-Literally. And to finish this off. I will repeat myself. THE LONGEST GAME OFF HOCKEY IS LONGER THEN THE LONGEST GAME OF SOCCER. Your rebuttal supported my statement. Hockey games CAN be longer then soccer games. Period \"Hockey Players are weaker/Break times\" Your point supports my argument that Hockey is a better team sport. This constant shift allows others to change the tide of the game allowing for a more rich and exciting game of hockey. It is not a sign of weakness but rather to give everyone a chance and to keep the bench from not over-crowding. You also did not mention how hard the soccer players work. You can be playing soccer for 45 minutes but work very lightly. Just because your playing for longer does not mean you are working hard. \"Popularity\" Being popular has it's drawbacks as well. Look at Brazil as an example. If they lose the FIFA world cup later this year then I can almost guarantee there will be a riot. http://www.dailymail.co.uk... Just because a sport is popular does not mean it's good. In fact I don't think you made an argument about how being more popular makes hockey better. Only in business is soccer better. But I think the topic was that \"Soccer is a BETTER sport than Hockey\" Not \"Soccer is a better BUSINESS then Hockey\" \"Inclusiveness Worldwide\" Have you ever heard of the AHF? The full name is the African Hockey Federation. Saying that there is less inclusiveness in Hockey is untrue. And like I wrote before. There are MANY types of Hockey. In Africa, they play field hockey. The topic is about all hockey and all soccer. Due to the many types of Hockey it (Soccer) is almost as included amongst the world. \"Easiness to Learn\" Wow. You say that Hockey Players are weak but you then say that they need to learn a whole bunch of skills? That must mean either Hockey Players are NOT weak or that Hockey IS easy to learn or both. I'm pretty sure that the difficulty makes Hockey Games funner and more interesting. I want to see a game where the players have to compete to win. I want to see the players think about a strategy. No sport should be easy, and if Soccer is as easy as you say it is, then I don't want to watch it. \"Injuries\" http://www.oddee.com... Think Injuries in Hockey are bad? Think again. Check these injuries out. Some of the injuries in this link were career-enders. I'm not saying that injuries do not happen in Hockey, I'm just saying that Soccer injuries match Hockey injuries. I see no other reason to continue. \"Goalies\" There are two reasons why you are wrong. First of all, Hockey pucks are small. Soccer balls are big. A goalie in soccer has a better chance of seeing the ball then the goalie in hockey seeing the puck. Second reason is the speed of the objects. A hockey puck may go 100 mph while a soccer ball goes only 20 mph. If you had a giant net in hockey like you do in soccer there would be many, many more goals and there would be no challenge to score causing there to be a more boring game. The size of the net does not make the goalies worse. One more thing. You forgot the amount of gear that the goalies in hockey wear. 20 pounds of big sweaty gear and you can only crouch. I think that takes alot of skill to keep all of that weigh on your body. Now to refute some of my opponents rebuttals Jacobie1121's rebuttal #1: Huh. You must have mistaken Hockey fights with Hockey violence. One is semi-banned and one is bad. I think Hockey fights are alright because they almost always occur because the defender in the fight cheated before. So you have to ask yourself: Is it bad sportsmanship to defend your team? Jacobie1121's rebuttal #2: Is it easier to get goals in Hockey? It's a smaller playing area, smaller net, bigger goalie with padding and trained professionals. In soccer you have a bigger playing area, bigger net, smaller goalie with NO padding and a few trained professionals. Plus in hockey the players are faster so it would be easier to take the puck and go and defend the goal. Scoring in hockey is not a piece of cake that's for sure! Jacobie1121's rebuttal #3: How many of those 25 soccer players get on the field? In hockey ALL players on a team have to contribute. This is how Hockey is more of a team sport. Just because there are more overall players does not mean that they all contribute. But in Hockey every player is critical. Jacobie1121's rebuttal #4: I don't like people getting hurt. I NEVER said I want people to get hurt in Hockey fights. NEVER. My second argument is available for viewing. I never once say \"I like people getting hurt\" I do MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) in my spare time. Do like it because I want to hurt people or because I like the sport? Also I do NOT care if the diver gets caught or not. The fact that a professional sportsman would attempt such a thing just shocks me and ruins entire games for me. Jacobie1121's rebuttal #5: Please go up for my answer as I already wrote it in my first rebuttal. Jacobie1121's rebuttal #6: Does it not require the perfect breeze and sun to play/ How about those open-roofed stadiums which must soccer games take place. What if it rains? What is it snows? Because there are so many types of Hockey out there you can play it year round but you can only play soccer a few times a year.

            "premise": "I'll give you one thing. You are such a master at the profession of being a Hypocrite! Hey, at least you where honest. I will go and give at least one reason for 6 of my opponents points, on why they are flawed, including rebutting his rebuttal. :) DARTH KIRONES SECOND POINT: HOCKEY FIGHTS!!!!! This seems very flawed. Yes, it might be exciting as a fan to watch, but you have to put yourself in the player's shoes. You are getting punched and shoved, until you get slammed to the ice by your opponent. You start to black out, but vaguely see some hands carrying you on a stretcher into the Locker Room. How the heck is situations like this \"good\"? Also, my opponent stated that they give bigger penalties if serious injuries occur. This is also false. They only give longer penalties if it is a hit that injures someone. In a Hockey fight, even if you knock someone unconscious, the penalty is still five minutes. As Darth Kirones says: \"the penalty is small\". Too small! DARTH KIRONES THIRD POINT: The Scoring He fails to see two things when saying that goalies in Hockey try harder than goalies in soccer. Just because you do not face as much shots in Soccer does NOT mean, at all, that you are trying less hard. Yes, there was less shots, but, the goalie made all the saves, didn't he? IF the soccer goalie faced more shots, it would have been a more accurate comparison because the soccer Goalie in that game did not have to work very hard to block less shots. That definitely does not mean that if there was more shots he would not have to work very hard though. Another thing. Because there is a lot less defence it is way easier to get shots on net in Hockey, then in Soccer, where there is more defensive players. DARTH KIRONES FOURTH POINT: Hockey is a better team sport Just because there is a shift in people on the ice does not make it more of a \"team sport\". It just means that you have different players on the ice. How does that make it more of a \"team sport\"? And the limit for NHL hockey is 23 players per Club, where as in Premier League Soccer, there is a limit of 25 players at a time. Seems to me there are more \"job opportunities\", as my opponent puts it, in soccer. DARTH KIRONES FIFTH POINT: Diving So my opponent says that he doesn't like people getting hurt. Ok, one more Hypocritical thing. He is cheating for Hockey right? Hockey is one of the most physical and highest contact sport. Well look at this: \"The highest rates of injury occur in sports that involve contact and collisions\"- University of Rochester sports statistics. My opponent might say that hockey players have more protection to prevent them from bug hits. This helps, but not enough. Players are still injured daily from big hits in Hockey. DARTH KIRONES SIXTH POINT: Faster This point is flawed for one major reason. My opponent stated that \"The word \"Longer\" and the word \"Better\" are NOT the same\" If you where a true loyal fan to a soccer or Hockey team, like many sports fanatics are, \"Longer\" and \"Better\" might very well mean the same because fans would love to see there favourite team for longer. This makes going to soccer games more enjoyable. DARTH KIRONES SEVENTH POINT: Promotion of Winter Fitness My opponent states that you don't get the full experience of soccer indoors because you don't have the \"sun shining on your face.\" Soccer does not need the perfect breeze and the amazing sunlight to be able to play. Also, if you wanted to emphasize that Hockey is such a winter sport, then why would you say: \"Just play indoors!\" That ruins your whole first point! If you want Hockey to be a winter sport, then you play outside, utilizing the ice. DARTH KIRONES REBUTTAL: Yes, hockey has unlimited overtime periods, but those very rarely go over 1 extra period, or 20 minutes extra time, and is ONLY IN THE PLAYOFFS!

If a hockey puck is slapped into your face, your facial bones will be broken and teeth lost; if it strikes you hard enough and in just the right spot, you will die. Football cleats might give you a tiny puncture wound. A hockey skate blade is razor sharp and at least two players in recent memory came close to bleeding to death after having major arteries sliced by them.

            "premise": "I will NOT save my rebuttals for the end. I will Rebut my opponent's points now and give some more of my own: My opponent said that you could \"play air hockey\". The resolution we are debating has to do with if soccer is better \"sport\" than hockey. Air hockey is not a sport, no mater how awesome it might be. Also, my opponent says an advantage for hockey is fighting. Beating someone senseless does not seem like a great thing to me, no matter how much the fans like it. Take a look at this video where Kevin Westgarth of the Calgary Flames is fighting. He ends up getting a concussion: Anyways, back to the points. Argument #3: Popularity Soccer has a way bigger popularity and viewing rate than hockey. Here is a quote from fifa.com: \"715.1 million people watched the final match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup held in Germany\". Now, let's take a look at the numbers for the Stanly Cup: there was a average of 4.91 million viewers of the 2009 Stanly Cup Playoffs final round per game. What's more, most amount of people watching a single NHL game was between Chicago-Montreal in 1971 was 12.4 million. 12.4 million people versus 71.5 million people. Thus, soccer is way more popular than Hockey, creating a much better business from ticket buying and merchandise purchasing. Argument #4: Inclusiveness Worldwide Soccer can be played in so many countries, no matter the status. For Example, take the country Cameroon. They are not in the greatest situation for economy, yet still have one of the greatest National Teams in Africa. Soccer is also played in Canada and the USA, even though it might seem way to cold. Yet Hockey is only primarily played in North America and Europe. It is usually only in colder countries. Ever heard of a Hockey Team in warm Africa? At least I have not. Ever heard of a soccer team in cold Russia? Yes! Argument #5: Easiness to Learn Hockey takes a lot of skill and equipment to learn. First, you need a stick, a puck, skates and ice (if you are playing on ice, witch is the most common form of playing by far). Then, you need to learn how to skate, so you might take lessons. Lessons cost a lot of money. Then, you have to learn how to skate, shoot, and keep control of the puck at the same time! In soccer you need only shoes. My opponent might say: you have to run and shoot and dribble in soccer at the same time too, BUT, running comes naturally where as skating you have to learn and take classes. One more thing: Please take into account that in Debates you vote on a debater that has good points NOT the side you would personally take in a real life situation. Thanks",

And if that happens in this game, the National Hockey League, fighting will be gone from the game.\" Simpson: \"I guess you ask, Glenn, why does that (the death of a player) need to happen for that (the elimination of fighting) to happen?\" It\"s a great question.

            "premise": "Thank you for creating this debate. Let me start by criticizing my opponents opening comments. I will build my argument as to why fighting in hockey should be banned in round 2.\"Now I won't deny Fighting is dangerous and could potentially hurt you, but It is has been part of the game since the beginning. So there's no reason why Fighting should be banned when in reality it won't do anything and the fans will just end up fighting which will cause a whole lot of controversy.\"There are a couple of things wrong with what my opponent has said, and I will explain.First he agreed that fighting is dangerous, then he said 'but it has been in the game since the beginning.' In the beginning of the NHL, players, including the goaltender didn't have to wear helmets/masks, so saying that it should stay the same to follow tradition, isn't a good enough point.My opponent then continues on to say that there is no reason for fighting to be banned because \"it won't do anything\". If fighting is banned, which would make the punishment more than a 5 minute penalty like it is now, fighting would probably disappear because players wouldn't put their careers at risk. And yes banning fighting would prevent the injuries of many players, and if fighting was banned already, it would have most likely prevented the deaths of Wade Balek, Rick Rypien and Derek Boogaard, who have all died because of reasons related to their career as a fighter in the NHL.My opponent said that fans \"will just end up fighting\" if fighting in the NHL is banned. I disagree, because anger between fan bases occurs very often because of a fight between two players, which starts huge and bitter rivalries.Good Luck.Vote Pro!",

            "premise": "I'll accept that challenge and thank Con for the opportunity.THESIS: The Mean Surface Temperature of the Earth has risen by 0.74\u00b10.18 \u00b0C over the period 1906\u201320012. Two-thirds of that increase (.6C/1F) has occurred since 1980. [1] This peak represents both the highest global temperature of the past 1000 years and the most rapid escalation. As a kind of shorthand, some scientists refer to the graphed geometry of this peak as a \"hockey stick\" to evoke a rapid rise after a sustained period of less dramatic change. To the limited degree by which the image of a hockey stick can approximate well-established recent changes in climate, the Hockey Stick is likely correct.I'll leave the body of my argument for Round2 after Con has had his chance, but we need to do some housekeeping regarding our shared assumptions.*****************I take exception to the proffered definition of the Hockey Stick Graph for 3 reasons:1) BIASED- When it comes to defining shared terminology, the offered definition should be as impartial as possible, preferably citing an objective source. Use of the word \"infamous\" as the first adjective in Con's definition demonstrates significant bias. Here's a definition of the word infamous from Merriam-Webster'sin\u00b7fa\u00b7mousadjective \\G2;in-f\u0259-m\u0259s\\1: having a reputation of the worst kind : notoriously evil [2]If Con wishes to conclude that the graph is evil during the course of his arguments that's his prerogative. Obviously, we're not going to agree that the graph is evil as part of our common set of assumptions.2) INCOMPLETE- To simply attribute the graph to Mann et. all (MBH99) is to disregard the preponderance of data for which MBH99 is only an initial compilation. Dozens of subsequent studies have confirmed the \"hockey stick\" geometry to greater or lesser degrees. \"Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century.\" [3] *3) BURIED THE LEAD- Obviously, the defining element in any Hockey Stick graph is the post-1900 blade- the recent, sharp upturn. The point of the hockey stick is that temperatures have rapidly escalated over the 20th Century and have now achieved the high-water mark for the past millennium. Most hockey stick graphs document significant increases in variability correlating to older data, so the hockey stick has demonstrably less focus on subjects like the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) or the Little Ice Age (LIA) then on periods after recorded thermometer temperatures. To define the graph as primarily a description of the MWP or the LIA is misleading and ignores the central thesis of the hockey stick.We might also note that Con's definition is undermined by the Hockey Stick graph he provides. Con's definition states that the MWP is virtually non-existent and that there's no LIA, but both events are discernible in the Wikipedia graph and conveniently labeled. Therefore, allow me to offer a definition of Hockey Stick Graphs from Wikipedia, which should be more objective and complete than Con's personal definition of Hockey Stick Graphs.\"Hockey stick graphs present the global or hemispherical mean temperature record of the past 500 to 2000 years as shown by quantitative climate reconstructions based on climate proxy records. These reconstructions have consistently shown a warming in the 20th century with the instrumental temperature record by 2000 exceeding earlier temperatures. The term hockey stick was coined by the climatologist Jerry Mahlman, to describe the pattern shown by the Mann, Bradley & Hughes 1999 (MBH99) reconstruction, envisaging a graph that is relatively flat to 1900 as forming an ice hockey stick's \"shaft\", followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the \"blade\". The reconstructions have featured in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports as evidence of global warming. Arguments over the reconstructions have been taken up by fossil fuel industry funded lobbying groups attempting to cast doubt on climate science.\" [4]*By way of example, here are a couple of additional graphs that qualify as Hockey Stick Graphs and which reinforce MBH99 data.Here's a graph from the a 2009 New Scientist article comparing 8 later which corroborate 2001 IPCC Hockey Stick (based on MBH99). http://www.newscientist.com...; width=\"614\" height=\"960\" />78 researchers from 24 countries spent seven years compiling data for the PAGES 2K project. They assembled 511 climate archives from around the world, from sediments, ice cores, tree rings, corals, stalagmites, pollen or historical documents and measurements to create the most comprehensive paleoclimate study yet. Published this year in Nature Geosciences, this most recent and comprehensive analysis strongly corroborates the MBH99 Hockey Stick. Green dots are the 30-year average of the new PAGES 2K reconstruction. The red curve shows the global mean temperature. Blue is MBH99 with range of uncertainty.

            "premise": "Sorry for the delay. Argument #3: The scoring The year is 2010 and the world cup is blazing off in South Africa. Come June 25th is a match between Honduras, two OK-level teams, and Honduras shoots TWICE in 90 minute, Switzerland shoots t the net five times. and whats the score? 0-0. In a hockey game the average amount of shots is 30 and yet the score is almost ALWAYS higher. What does this say about soccer? That the players are slacking? I think it says that the goalies of Hockey are trying harder as I see no beauty in a 0-0 game. Now. Jacobie1121 may say the goalies in soccer do work hard and that there are 0-0 games in Hockey as well. To answer the first rebuttal by repeating myself. SEVEN SHOTS TO 30. A goalie has to block 15 goals wearing tons of equipment but a soccer goalie has to block 2-5 goals with just a special goalie shirt and pants but yet the one who wears less and has to block less is the harder worker? No. Simply no. The second rebuttal would be that there are 0-0 games in Hockey as well. There are more shots in hockey, allowing there to be more opportunities for goals. Whether it's a close miss or an epic goal those shots are what brings us to our feet. Argument #4: Hockey is a better team sport In a hockey game the team is constantly changed around allowing for there to be more job opportunities and time to play while in soccer it's almost always always the same players. Because there are more skilled players in a lineup there is a greater chance of an exciting game because the talent changes quickly. Different players play with different styles which can be both bad and good. And we all love a good game-changer or game-destroyer! Argument #5: Diving I don't like to see others get hurt. But I HATE people who fake getting hurt for their own benefit. They are athletes. And being fair is a code that all athletes should follow. Why should reward those who fake? They get another player in trouble to give him/her a penalty or to get the person who was framed kicked out. Imagine you were a respectable player in soccer and someone pulled a dive claiming you tripped them. Would you say at least he did not get actually hurt? Or would you mention how unfair that is? The answer is obvious. I have no tolerance for cheaters whatsoever. I include a video about diving to see the sheer quantity of these fakers. I'm ready for your response",

            "premise": "I think that soccer is the better sport. Why? Soccer can be played all year round, hockey is usually played when the weather is cold. Soccer is a game that is played using your feet only, this increases many skills, such as running, dodging and many, many others.Also, soccer helps you realize what a great blessing it is to have 2 hands because you cannot use your hands, it allows you to realize that many people don't have that blessing and that you are very lucky to be in your condition. Although hockey takes WAY longer to learn, also hockey can be a very dangerous sport, many severe injuries have been caused due to rough play in hockey, and the ice is very cold so players must wear many layers of clothes to keep them warm, which keeps them from moving freely, which causes them to lose the game. Soccer, however, is played out in the sun, and players wear very comfortable soccer shorts and shirts, also the soccer shoes are very comfortable and allow the play to run around without slipping and kick the ball in the correct way. Hockey rinks cost tons of money to make, they also take up land and trees need to be cut down to make room for it. That is bad for the environment. Soccer can be played anywhere, no need to build a rink, just find a place on the grass, or anywhere with a large space, and PLAY! I'm not saying I don't like hockey, and that it is a bad sport. I am just stating my opinion, I mean, everyone has an opinion and I truly respect your opinion that hockey is better. My sources are: http://www.smu.ca...",

If the game is tied at the end of the two 45 minute periods, then you go into two 15 minute overtimes. If it is still tied after that, then you go into sudden death overtime. That is a lot of time for a game with not a lot of action. In hockey there are three 20 minute periods. When a regular season game is tied at the end of regulation, it goes into a 4-on-4, five minute overtime period after a one minute rest period. If there is no goal scored during that time then it goes to a three-round shootout. This sequence ends when one team mathematically has more shootout goals then the other, thus winning the game. That is the perfect amount of time for this sport to be played. Its not to long, and there is plenty of action to keep you on your toes. Scoring- In 90 minutes, you might see one goal during a soccer game. Or you might not. A 2-0 win would be considered a slaughter in soccer, but a close game in hockey. Goals are what makes a game exiting. You will see more goals scored in hockey then you do in soccer, making hockey more exiting. Out of bounds- In soccer, a lot of the time is spend kicking the ball out of bounds, and then throwing or kicking it back into bounds after a stoppage of play. There are not many stoppage of plays in hockey. You have the glass and boards keeping the puck in play about 99% of the time. The only time the puck is out of bounds is if it goes up into the netting (into the seats) or goes into the benches. Skill- hockey requires a certain level of skill to reach the high levels of professional sports, and hockey players have to have some of the strongest talents to even make the professional ranks. They have to be able to skate forwards, backwards and be able to stop correctly. And it is all done at high speeds. Skating is not something that everyone can do which makes it a talent. Unlike running. Plus they have to combine skating with stick handling. They have to be able to use their stick for various kinds of shots such as slapshots, backhand shots, and wrist shots. Hockey is not a sport for the weak. You have to be able to endure being thrown into the boards and having an open ice check come in your direction while at center ice. You have to put your body in front of fast moving pucks to block shots. You also have fighting which is not tolerated in any other sport. http://bleacherreport.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.iihf.com...",

            "premise": "Time for the rebuttals :) Starting at the top Longer games Longer games can be enjoyable if there is a lot of action. There is not much action in soccer compared to hockey. In hockey you are watching a game that is constantly in motion. No matter what position you play you are always moving. A soccer game can get boring after an hour of watching men/woman running back and forth with a ball, kicking it out of bounds and having to throw it back in. Break times/ toughness Hockey players are on the ice 35-45 seconds at a time because while they are on the ice they are constantly moving. If you were to watch a game of hockey, you would notice that while a player is on the ice they are never standing still. They are always skating from one end of the ice to the other. Soccer players might play longer shifts, but that is because they are not constantly in motion. To add to the fact of how tough hockey players are. When you see a soccer player get injured (or pretty much any sports player) you see them lay on the ground until they are taken off by stretcher or helped off. In hockey, the players get up and skate off on there on. The only time you will not see that happen is if they are knocked out. Here is an example. Last season, Paul Martin, who plays for the Pittsburgh Penguins, broke the upper part of his leg. He skated to the bench and sat down to wait for his next shift. He did not realize his leg was broken until he stood up for his next shift and felt the bone move. Another example would be Clint Malarchuk. During a game he had his jugular vein cut by a skate. He refused to get on the stretcher. He skated off the ice on his own. ( he lived) the link to the video is below. If you don't like the sight of blood DON'T WATCH. Easiness to learn Soccer might be easy to learn, but that takes the talent level out of it. Everybody knows how to run and kick a ball. It is very simple. But not everyone knows how to skate or or how to stickhandle. The fact that not a lot of people can do this makes it even more fascinating to watch. You are watching people do things that not everyone can do. Injuries Hockey might have a lot of injuries, but that is just part of the sport. That is how you know that hockey is much tougher then soccer. Occasionally you get players like Todd Bertuzzi who are way to violent ( i guess that's how i could put it without using colorful language :) ) those players are punished with suspensions from the games ( sometimes the rest of the season, and on one occasion a guy was kicked out of the NHL) and heavy fines. Take Shawn Thornton for example. He was suspended for 15 games ( should of been longer) for coming up behind Brooks Orpik, knocking him to the ice and punching him. (knocking him out). He also forfeited $84,615.45 in salary. Faking an injury is worst then the real thing. When you fake an injury you are wasting every ones time, and not to mention making a full of yourself. Goalies It takes more talent and accuracy for a hockey player to score a goal then it does a soccer player. Goalies are very flexible and also take dives. Just watch a game and you will see. They often go into the butterfly position which is like a split, and occasionally go down into a full split. Goalies have a lot of skills ( and guts) to be able to stop a puck moving at 95-118 mph. Plus being able to keep an eye on the small puck and knowing were it is every second of the game. A lot of hockey players use black tape so it is harder for the goalie or any other players to see the puck on the stick. Soccer goalies do not move that much either. And the ball is much easier to spot then a puck. http://espn.go.com...",

Refute/Rebuttal My opponent desperately tried to think of ways he could stop a possible rebut that I might possibly say, yet failed to discern one thing. You know why there are less shots in soccer? Because defense plays way, way better, and has way more players so it is hard for an attacker to score in soccer. In Hockey there is only 2 defense that in some cases are complete flops. This is not to say that soccer defense players can not flop, they definitely can, BUT they have more players to back them up! Also, my opponent stated that Hockey is more of a \"Team Sport\". Well, in soccer you have an average of 420 passes per game. How is that not a team sport? And, if you want more of a \"Team Sport\", saying that having more shifts and different players does not make it more of a team sport but instead just switches the player talent around. Also, if you wanted more of a team sport, wouldn't you want more of the team playing on the field/ice at the same sport? One more thing: REFS CATCH THE FAKERS IN SOCCER. The players learn that this ridiculous. Yes, the players where faking it, but refs see through it, and give them penalties for \"faking\". Anyways, back to the points!: Point #6: Injuries In any league of ice-hockey, there is many, many injuries, because of the physical play of hockey players. Concussions, broken bones, ribs injured and sprains are very often, which makes the game way more risky. These injuries come from the constant hitting and fighting in hockey, where as in soccer, if you check or rough anyone you are given a yellow or red card. Injuries in soccer are usually minor sprains. In hockey, big hits lead sometimes to a life-ending injury. In this next video, Lars Eller of the Montreal Canadians takes a really, really nasty hit (the video commentator is french but the point is still made): Scary Right? THAT\"S HOCKEY! Point #7 Goalies In Hockey, the Goalies are almost the size of the net, making it almost too easy for them to save a puck. They move rarely and have a very non-flexible job: SAVE THE PUCK. Where as in Soccer, as a Goalie, you have to dive for the ball, which takes skill, and in soccer, players kick the ball on spin so it is hard to read the play. Soccer goalies know this and have fine-tuned there skills to read plays. What's more, in soccer, the goalie has to boot the ball an incredible distance and they do it just fine. This goes to show that the Goalies in Soccer are way better. Thanks for this awesome debate, jacobie1121 :)",

In hockey, nobody slows down.\" This is not always true. In soccer you are constantly moving to run after the ball. 2.\"unlike soccer, which is timed to end at a specific time, Hockey has it's own schedule. Overtime hockey is a must-see, as it's a winner take all battle.\" This is also not right. Soccer has overtimes too. If they get a tie. Also professional soccer is longer than a mini league. 3. \"Nobody likes watching a rigged sport\" I\"m sorry but I disagree with you on this one. Soccer fans are crazy when it comes to soccer matches. Soccer also dates way back to BC. Romans also played soccer. Soccer is liked all over the world. 4.Action. Soccer has a lot of action.

By the way, people love a fight that\"s why the referees let the fights go on. 5.Some pictures of horrible injuries. http://farm4.static.flickr.com... http://t2.gstatic.com... http://t1.gstatic.com... http://t2.gstatic.com... http://t1.gstatic.com... 6.My resources: http://www.historyofsoccer.info...

Then you hare to learn how to pass with a stick and all of that stuff. Then you have to get into even more shape so you don't tire out in the game and then you have to play 3-4 times a week! You also have to travel and practice. Imagine how sore you would be! Football may be tough but hockey is way tougher! And what if you get involved in a hockey fight? You could get beat up a bit adding to your troubles and all of that gear you have to wear! That is 20 pounds extra! All of these factors add up to make Hockey one of the most difficult sports out there. Argument #5: Hockey is much more worldwide \"The Arab Cup of Ice Hockey was intended to be an annual international ice hockey competition involving teams from Arab nations. The inaugural tournament took place on the 16th to 20 June 2008 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. A 2009 competition was planned to be held in Kuwait City, Kuwait but was cancelled.\" Imagine that. Arabs playing ice hockey in the boiling sun. If you have been to the middle east you would know how freaking hot it is. http://en.wikipedia.org... Check that out. All of those countries play ice hockey. But wait! There are even more forms of hockey then just plain old ice hockey! Even more countries play different forms of hockey! Even more. Hockey is an Olympic sport and football is not, making hockey even more international! Well, I hope you post something. DarthKirones",

            "premise": "1.) Embellishment - If you are entire argument is based on a video made by some desperate guy determined to undermine the GREATNESS of Soccer using some archaic video footage of nondescript teams. I dont know what to say. I base my arguments on fact and the fact is that these days players who act like that are penalised. Here is the proof--- (there goes the argument on \"embellishment\". ) 2) Accuracy - This is a video of a 40 yard kick in the corner of the goal protected by a goalkeeper well above 6'3 with an entire wall in front of him . 40 yards almost the 2/3 of the length of a hockey rink. that's almost like an Ice hockey goalie scoring from his half. I doubt if you could show me a video of a ice hockey player make the puck swerve in the air from 40 yards out. 3) Toughness - Since you seem so hell bent on the toughness of this game let's analyze this a bit a) Adaptability - Soccer is played in rain , storm , snow and sweltering heats of brazilian maracana with temp of 42 centigrade, Does a Ice hockey player go through the same , No its always over ice , they would probably faint in any other condition. b) Endurance - How can one compare a game of 20 min halves of ice hockey with 45 min halves of hight tempo game of soccer. MLS in US is a very pathetic example of soccer , with sub standard players and worst style of play. If one wants to know how fast this game can be one should at least see barcelona FC in action, which would pale any. Yes any ice hockey game in pace and tempo. c) Ice hockey players wearing virtually a full body armor is not a contact sport, its sheer hypocrisy. I mean why have any protection if they are so tough play just the way actual rugby players slug it out. Rugby is a contact sport which in true essence has tough men not ice hockey. And if my purpose of watching sports is to see tough men i would watch boxing, judo , taekwondo , wrestling not ice hockey. The small minority of people who watch ice hockey watch it for their skill on ice not toughness. Some more facts which would make the position amply clear 1) Soccer largest watched sports in the world , World cup soccer most watched event on planet after olympics 2) Soccer clubs richest in the world more than NFL, NHL, Baseball etc etc. (If you can show me stats to disapprove this I would concede) PS - Ensure caution in choosing topic , either put \"Ice Hockey is better than soccer \"or accept both . Field hockey is still more popular than any Ice hockey.",

            "conclusion": "Soccer is better then hockey",
            "premise": "Here are 7 reasons why hockey is better than soccer 1. Speed: Ice hockey is just plain faster than soccer. Some of the fastest skaters in the National Hockey League can almost reach 30 miles per hour. Compare that to the fastest soccer players at about 21 miles per hour. I haven't even mentioned the speed of the puck flying at the goalies at over 100 mph. Things just happen faster on the ice than the pitch. 2. Space: There is less space on the sheet of ice than a soccer field. Part of what annoys me about soccer is that much of the game happens at midfield. It is rare to see end to end action for any length of time in a soccer game, because the field is so large. In hockey action often is back and forth with slap shots flying and clutch saves being made. Plus the ice is enclosed by the boards and plexiglass, which makes stoppages in play fewer. 3. Scoring: Ice hockey simply has more shots on goal, which leads to more scoring than soccer. In a match in the 2010 World Cup, Honduras had just two shots on goal against Switzerland who had a mighty five. Not surprisingly this game ended in a 0-0 tie. Maybe I sound like a rube when I can't see the beauty in a 0-0 soccer game, but to me it is nap inducing. Now 0-0 games do happen in hockey, but at least the goalie had to break a sweat and make, at the very least, 15 saves. 4. Acting: Even the most ardent soccer fans have to admit that the guys that play the game are just plain bad actors. A guy barely gets touched and he hits the turf like he has been shot. Don't worry though because he will make an amazing recovery and be at full strength as soon as the ball is back in play. There is sometimes acting in hockey when a player dives, but a guy will only do that so much because he knows he will pay for it later. See number 5. 5. Fighting: Although it isn't my favorite part of hockey it has it's place. It is the way that hockey teams police one another. Referees can't catch everything that happens on the ice, but the players often do. Spear one of my guys and the ref misses it, you can be sure that you will be dropping the gloves with my team's goon. It is a kind of justice that works. Most of the fighting in soccer takes place in the stands between drunken hooligans, which have been a black eye on the beautiful game for a long time. 6. Time: Stoppage time in soccer is one of the oddest things to me about the game. Why in the world can't the clock be stopped when there is a break in the action? Instead we get an amount of time that is added on to the clock, before the final whistle blows. No one, except the referee, seems to know exactly how much time is left. When the clock hits 0.0 in hockey the game is over. This way everyone, including the fans, knows when the game will end. 7. Checking: I have saved the best reason for last, lots of contact. Checking is the biggest difference between hockey and soccer. There is something enjoyable about seeing a guy get legally crunched into the boards. In hockey you can't just finesse your way through the game. In soccer there is contact, but not enough for my liking. It could be that I an just a simple ugly American that likes to watch full contact sports, but if the choice is soccer or hockey, hockey wins every time.",

In hockey you always have to be in very good shape. your cardio has to be at a very high level. The whole game you will be skating back and forth and changing directions at 100% speed. hockey player also have a lot of strenth. Most of the players, even the ones that look small weigh over 200 pounds of pure muscle. Hockey requires you to be fast, be able to accurately shoot the puck, be able to catch the puck, be able to read players, agility, endurance, toughness, the ability to jump, hitting power, and not to mention this is all done on Ice skates. watch this video and look at all the action. the different shots for a goal, the hits, the fights. all of this is shows why it is better and harder then tennis. http://www.youtube.com...",

And wouldn't you say that hockey players need to be very endured and have to change directions at the blink of an eye as well? For example, the puck consistently is either batted or knocked around on the ice multiple times in the matter of a few seconds. So, wouldn't you say, that as a hockey player you need to be ready to change directions as fast as the puck does? In the argument that football is more popular than hockey, you are right in the sense that hockey stands beneath football in popularity, *in the United States. Football is an American made sport, where as hockey is a Canadian made sport. It is clear that football would be generally more entertaining and popular to the American public then hockey would be. However, internationally, hockey is much more popular then football. So overall, Hockey would win the popularity contest.",

This video show how exciting hockey is. (Note: once the video reaches 1:20, skip ahead to 4:15). From the fighting, to the always tense 3rd period, the action is amazing. In soccer, numerous parts of the game are spent teams getting organized, and just passing the ball around. In hockey, nobody slows down. The game always has teams going full steam. 2: Speed, unlike soccer, which is timed to end at a specific time, Hockey has it's own schedule. Overtime hockey is a must-see, as it's a winner take all battle. 3: Soccer has been known to have had some problems with match fixing. In 2006, it was alleged that France paid $25 Million dollars to Brazil to win its match in the world cup quarterfinals. Also, earlier this year, The UEFA champions league was alleged to have rigged over 600 matches. Nobody likes watching a rigged sport. Sources: http://www.sportingnews.com...",

            "premise": "Lets get the points over with. Argument #6: Faster I'm going to be a bit hypocritical and break the rule that I set for myself that I will save my rebuttals for the end. The longest game of hockey would be longer then the longest game of soccer. Why you may ask? Hockey has unlimited Overtime Periods in the playoffs. Now, I know that totally contradicts my point, but I felt I needed to refute your first point right away. Anyways, my point. Usually a Hockey game is 60 minutes long with two intermissions. Not only the game is faster but the player moves faster and the pace is faster due to the small area of play. The speed causes more action because the players can catch up quite quickly to the puck. They also may know that due to the limited time frame they need to put on a very fast but entertaining show. The word \"Longer\" and the word \"Better\" are NOT the same. Argument #7: Promotion of Winter fitness We can all agree. Hockey is a winter sport. Whether your a Canadian like me or from Scandinavia or Russia or any where cold you know that it's difficult to do exercises because of the winter. You can't go jogging. Soccer and Baseball are much more difficult to play but Hockey? All you need is some gear, a puck and friends and your ready to not only have snowy fun but much-needed exercise. The cold should never stop you from being healthy. In fact I would say Hockey promotes fitness year-round. There is field hockey in the spring and summer, In the fall you can play street hockey and I am sure there are many more types of hockey that can be played! Now Jacobie, I can already here you typing \"What about indoor soccer?' Well, do you get the full experience of the wind at your back? The sun shining on your face? Do you get that warm summer feeling in indoor soccer? Two letters: NO. I'm looking forward to your rebuttal my friend! Thanks.",

            "premise": "YAY! THE FUUUUN PART. Ok. Here: I would like to point out that you did not refute all of my points. \u201cHockey is a faster sport.\u201d (the whole point) Pensfan states facts about how it is literally faster moving. Alright, I agree, hockey is faster, however, that does not make it better. In fact, it makes it worse! Faster players mean harder collisions. Imagine two players, going \u201cover 30 mph\u201d (Pensfan\u2019s figures.) That is a 60 mile collision. Enough to knock them both onto the hard ice, and that could possibly give them serious injuries. Concussion? Possible. Broken bones? Possible. Blood? Almost guaranteed. Where as in soccer, again I will use your figures, the collision would be two \u201c20 mph\u201d people colliding. Maybe make them stumble? Fall? But no broken bones, no concussion, and maybe a tiny bit of blood. That\u2019s all. Also, a stumble on to grass is cushioned, but a fall onto hard, hard ice, is already enough you give you a concussion. Faster pucks mean obviously harder hits if the puck hits you. I admit, a soccer ball can hit you hard and MIGHT cause an injury. If a puck hits you though, again your figure, at \u201c105 mph\u201d, that is SURE to give you an injury. Take a peek at this video: OOF! The guy even has a visor on. That shows that in hockey, they need protection from all the flying pucks. But that protection doesn\u2019t even work properly! Lastly, if the play is moving around so fast, it is hard to track that extremely fast puck. Imagine trying to follow the puck from here: http://upload.wikimedia.org... Hard Eh? Toughness from round 2: \u201cA recent ESPN study concluded that ice hockey is the most demanding team sport in the world.\u201d COMPLETELY FALSE! Here is evidence that ESPN did the study and said that \u201che toughest sport in the world is . . .Boxing.\u201d Source? Here: http://sports.espn.go.com... My opponent is LYING! So judges, this should be enough evidence as it is. BUT, I shall continue. Toughness is not always good. Remember we are debating the best sport in general, not just the professional version of it. It Hockey, I agree, you need to be tougher, but is that a good thing? If you have to be durable, then that kinda shuts down the door for the people who are not tough enough doesn\u2019t it? So if the professionals are tough, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is strong to absorb a check does it? Uh\u2026.you are Pro, right? You have the point about hard Hockey is. For those who are 4, learning to play, easier is way better. If it is harder it narrows the window for playing hockey a lot for only the people who are the strongest and the best. Pretty narrow, eh? Toughness from round 3: Soccer players usually play 45 minutes in a row while hockey players go off and on in shifts of 60 seconds. Soccer fields are bigger and and are not on ice, making the running bit much more difficult. \u201cA large field, a fast moving ball, and rare substitutions mean soccer players can expect to log some heavy mileage over 90-plus minutes. Midfielders tend to run the most, sometimes reaching nearly 9.5 miles\u201d Tackles and spiked shoes are quite painful, so soccer players are durable as well. To doubt the toughness of soccer players is intellectually dishonest. \u201cEmbellishment\u201d Diving, really? http://bleacherreport.com... That is 15 different dives in hockey. Ever heard of Claude Lemieux? A little outdated, but still hilarious. Players dive in both soccer and hockey. Deal with it. People cheat all the time, hockey, soccer, debates, board games, cheating is no reason to say one sport is better than another. Accuracy: May I point out that Hockey players use a stick that has been designed to be as accurate as possible, while soccer players only use their feet? If hockey players spent their time kicking a puck then we could compare the two, but the whole purpose of the hockey stick IS TO BE ACCURATE! It is almost rigged. Time: Alright, fine perhaps most soccer games are longer than hockey games, but in the NHL playoffs if the game is 0-0 then the game will continue for as long as it needs to until a goal is scored, meaning that the LONGEST HOCKEY GAME IS LONGER THAN THE LONGEST SOCCER GAME. Also, imagine you are a fan of Soccer, or a fan of Hockey. Would you rather get the average game time of 90 minutes of watching your favorite team or would you rather have less time watching your favorite team. What\u2019s more, you pay money for tickets. It\u2019s better value for you ticket to see a longer game. Scorring: Again, I agree with you, there are more goals in hockey, but hockey goals are worth less than soccer goals. Why? It\u2019s easier to score in hockey than it is to score in soccer. Another example is racing. There are more passes in indie races than F1, but F1 passes are more valuable. Skill: Um, no. Hockey players use a tool. IT\u2019S CALLED A HOCKEY STICK. Soccer is difficult as well, I mean, on average soccer players run 7 miles in agame! That takes alot of skill. Out of Bounds. \u201cAverages Offsides: 16 Icings: 9 Goals: 5 Penalties: 5 TV Timeouts: 12 Incidental stoppages: 34 (non-penalized skirmishes, puck leaving rink, puck frozen, etc)\u201d That is a good amount of stoppages. Do remember that since according to you soccer games are longer, which means more stoppages. Alright, I am very tired, and a little lazy, but I think I have done a good job. Why we have won: We have provided sufficient evidence for our side We have successfully wrecked his points. He had false evidence.

So, to stay that these are two have nothing to do with each other is correct in one sense, but also incorrect in the other. Such skills such as stamina, endurance, and strength are all key factors to athleticism that all sports players need, regardless of which sports they play. In both hockey and football, endurance and stamina are two very important skills, however, I believe that there is more endurance and stamina needed in hockey then there is in football. For example, in football there is a stoppage of play almost every few seconds after the ball is hiked. During this stoppage of play, players have more time to rest and regain their strength. In hockey, play is constant (unless stopped by the whistle, which indubitably never happens unless a penalty is called). Being that play is constant in hockey, I therefore believe that you need to have better endurance in hockey then you do in football. Also, with the more endurance needed for hockey, stamina is also needed. Stamina is the energy that you have over the entire course of the game which allows you to keep playing. You need a lot of stamina in order to keep playing at a constant rate. You do not need as much stamina for football because play is stopped almost constantly.",

            "premise": "I hope you'll feel better soon and I understand your situation. We have now reached the final round and I will refute my opponent's points, reinstate my main arguments, and tell you why I believe I should win. Refutations 1. \"Like in baseball, a hockey puck is 5 and is shot between 80 and 100 mph, which requires strength, speed, and accuracy because the puck needs to fit into a very small space between the pads of the goalie and the posts of the net. I feel that this is more difficult because of the shot to goal ratio compared to the pitch to hit ratio in baseball.\" I agree with your statement that making a hockey goal is difficult. However, as you yourself stated, it is easy for a goalie to save a goal, for he has a 90% chance to. In hockey, there is an easy and a hard end, whereas, in baseball, nothing is easy for the batter, pitcher, and catcher. The pitcher has difficulty by throwing the ball into a 4 ft x 6 ft box and throwing a fast pitch and knowing how to throw numerous pitches. The batter needs to judge the pitch's speed, time the ball, and make good contact so that he can get on base. The catcher also has difficulty because sometimes a pitcher can throw a wild pitch and the catcher needs to get it or else runners will advance on the bases. Hockey difficulty is as difficult as baseball, which is exactly what I am arguing for. 2. \"Typically in baseball, the pitchers are not good hitters, and thus are not great on offense. Hockey players need to have skill sets that make you good at both offense and defense.\" Not necessarily, because in hockey you have your specific positions i.e. your forward left winger, center, and right winger and your left and right defenseman. You also have your Star and Sniper who are considered the best players. You also have an Enforcer to protect the Star in a fight. Each hockey player has his designated role to win the game. In baseball, you have some people who specialize and focus on a specific role, such as pitcher who wants and needs to excel at his job. Just because you are well-rounded, doesn't necessarily mean you are good. You can be a jack of all trades, but a master of none. Hockey and baseball are similar in this way. 3. \"Fitness is very important in every sport. Baseball has \"spring training\" where baseball players train, however, the sport itself is less physically demanding than hockey. Hockey players that - \" Seeing as your argument was for some reason suddenly cut short, I can't truly refute this. However, I will try to say something about this. Batters need plenty of muscle to hit the ball well and deep and leg muscle to sprint around bases. Catchers need great reaction to catch wild pitches. Infielders need reactions and speed to catch line drives and good throws to get runners out. Outfielders need to run fast to some fly balls and catch them. Pitchers need arm strength and endurance to get through those tough, long games. Hockey players need endurance to move up and down the ice, speed to get to the puck, and strength to hit it hard to score a goal. And they especially need good eyes to find the puck and good coordination. These sports are similar in skill and fitness. Here are my arguments once again. 1. As the Proposition, I stated the resolution and argued that hockey and baseball are similar in skill. 2. Baseball requires strength as does hockey. 3. Coordination, endurance, and speed are evident in both sports. 4. Both have their own difficulties that players can overcome. For these reasons, vote Pro.",

Concussions, broken bones, ribs injured and sprains are very often, which makes the game way more risky. These injuries come from the constant hitting and fighting in hockey, where as in soccer, if you check or rough anyone you are given a yellow or red card. Injuries in soccer are usually minor sprains. In hockey, big hits lead sometimes to a life-ending injury. In this next video, Lars Eller of the Montreal Canadians takes a really, really nasty hit (the video commentator is french but the point is still made): https://www.youtube.com...... Imagine you are Steve Moore. He was your average hockey player. Then, one game, against Vancouver, his whole career ended. Todd Bertuzzi comes up to him and wants a fight. Steve Moore says no. A few minutes later, Bertuzzi comes up to Moore, grabs his jersey, viciously punches Moore in the face then shoves onto the cold, hard ice. As a result, Moore was knocked out cold for around 11 minutes. He got three fractured vertebrae and a very major concussion. His passion, career, and love for hockey was done. Over. This is all a result of the violent nature of hockey. Watch: I will elaborate way more in the rebuttal. And what's the worst that soccer has? Suarez? OK, and so he fakes that he does it. But what is worse, faking, or the REAL injuries? Point #7 Goalies In Hockey, the Goalies are almost the size of the net, making it almost too easy for them to save a puck. They move rarely and have a very non-flexible job: SAVE THE PUCK. Where as in Soccer, as a Goalie, you have to dive for the ball, which takes skill, and in soccer, players kick the ball on spin so it is hard to read the play. Soccer goalies know this and have fine-tuned there skills to read plays. What's more, in soccer, the goalie has to boot the ball an incredible distance and they do it just fine. This goes to show that the Goalies in Soccer are way better. Yes, hockey goalies make some crazy saves, but a crazy save in soccer is jut way harder. Judges, what would be harder? Making this save: Or these: The choice is obvious. Soccer! Thanks, DDD",

            "premise": "Okay first off thanks for debating. Now I'm going to say that hockey can be played year round. Nobody really plays on the ponds anymore. I play all the time in the summer. And ice rinks aren't as cold as you think, they are usually kept at 50degrees and the ice is cooled from below. You where saying that only being able to use your feet makes soccer harder and more unique and I do agree, but hockey is similar. In hockey you can use your hands (but only to bat the puck out of the air) but we also have to control a smaller object far from our body with a stick. We have to be able to know where it is on our stick without even looking at it, and we are doing this while we are on skates. people generally do not realize the amount of coordination you need in hockey. Also the power, agility, and explosivness needed is unbelievable. My last point for my argument is that hockey is faster and more entertaining. Because hockey is being played on skates, it is very fast. Shifts are short so every player comes out fast and powerfull. The ice rink is way smaller than a soccer field. This creates more action near the net and way more shots on goal. The goalies are constantly making huge saves and making big plays. In soccer there are less shots and less action. The physicality of hockey also makes the game more fun. I do think some of those cheap hockey fights are stupid but they are fun to watch some times. So that's all I'm writing for this round thanks again for debating!",

            "premise": "Some of the most sweeping remarks have been made showing an inherent lack of knowledge about the game of soccer. Beginning with the sudden death rule , I would like to enlighten my opponent that the sudden death rule or golden goal rule as it popularly known stands abolished for a decade now. It was last used 10 years ago in 2004. Here is a link which will help you understand the rules of the game before making such frivolous claims http://en.wikipedia.org...(association_football) Now let's take each of your claims in a systematic manner before determining their veracity 1) Length - As per my opponent the ideal length of any sport should be 60-75 min to keep it interesting for the spectator. Which is what makes ICE hockey popular. Soccer , Cricket , Tennis , golf , field hockey are the most popular sports in the world. Each of them are much ahead of Ice hockey in terms of the game length a) Soccer -90 mins ( only knockout games have an extra time of half an hour) b) Cricket - Test Matches - 5 days , with each day having a playing time of 7-8 hrs, One day matches - 7 hrs , t20 matches - 3hrs c) Tennis- Womens - 3hrs Men - 4-5 hrs , Longest game 11 hrs 9 minutes d) Golf - 4-6 hrs e) Field Hockey- minimum 75 min All these games are nautical miles ahead of Ice Hockey in terms of viewers which clearly proves that it is not the length of the game but the quality of it which determines its greatness. Just like a 4 hr epic lord of the rings movie will still be more palatable than a 1.5 hr Nicolas cage movie ghostrider. So the argument on length of the game is simply untenable Out of bounds - Another concern which shows a lack of research on the part of my opponent. He makes sweeping statement that \"\" A LOT OF TIME IS WASTED KICKING THE BALL OUT OF BOUNDS\". Well an added stoppage time is given to make up for the \"out of bound \" period which is 2-3 minutes usually. This is completely at the discretion of the referee and could be as low as 1 min in some cases. Compare that with the length of the half of 45 min and you get 3-4 % of the time. Not much really. http://www.football-bible.com... Skill - Any sport be it garden bowls or sepaktakrav requires certain level of skill to reach professional standards. I don't understand the meaning of the term \"Strongest talent\". Any sport requires years of practice to prefect before one reaches international standards. And every sport requires a specific set of skills to reach the top. For instance cricket requires exceptional hand eye co-ordination , fast reflexes , and an eye for detail, Polo , requires exceptional skill as a horse rider and hand eye coordination similar to Ice hockey players , same is that for a field hockey player. Soccer requires a player to have fast reflexes , vision , passing , dribbling , shooting , heading, tackling, ability to maneuver the ball in tight spaces with feet, improvising, anticipating the other players moves. Saying that Ice hockey players are the best athletes is just like saying Nicolas Cage deserves and oscar for Ghostrider. I mean are they strongest , quickest on feet, have best reflexes. Anyone in their right mind would understand that they are all athletes with specific skill to skate on ice while they play hockey that's about it nothing more , nothing less. And skating being something of a talent is partially true as barely a small fraction of the people in the world have access to skating rinks. That's just like saying being an astronaut, or eating heavily priced caviar is a talent. Competitiveness- Ice Hockey is barely competitive with just about 16 teams in world champion ships . For a game which has been around for a while that is just abjectly poor. Compared to that almost all 205 countries of the world participate in the world cup Intensity- World cup soccer held every four years is a much more intense competition compared to IIHF world championship held every year. At best it is like an FA cup soccer held in england every year. Most sports get an \"offseason\" -- soccer doesn't-----For most top-flight players, there's a league season, a league cup, a club championship and international games all going on at once. If that's not enough, almost every summer there's an international cup or competition of some sort, not to mention friendlies and World Cup qualifying. It's the sport that never ends. Sportsmanship is an important part of the culture.-And even though there are rivalries, players usually respect one another for their individual talents and love of the game. This becomes no more apparent than when you see players exchange jerseys after a good match. There are always new superstars whose fancy footwork or goal-scoring prowess seems to be a gift from the heavens. It's the Beautiful game World Cups bring the entire planet together.And basically give everyone one VERY important reason to party. The FIFA World Cup is the world's most widely viewed sports event. Around 715 million people watched the 2006 final match in Germany, while the 2010 South Africa event was broadcast to 204 countries on 245 different channels. Goodluck matching that ICE HOCKEY",

            "conclusion": "The global warming hockey stick is bad science",
            "premise": "The global warming hockey stick is a graph of global temperature over time. It was produced by a scientist named Mann, who first published it in a scientific journal in the mid-nineties. He modified and included it in the 2000 report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is called a hockey stick because it shows very little variation of climate for the past thousand years until the 20th century, when temperatures soared. That makes the graph look like a hockey stick on its side, with the blade upward. The resolution claims that the curve is bogus. \"Bad science\" means that the curve does not correctly depict the climate of the past thousand years, and that the hockey stick was a result of errors in the methods in deriving the curve. This debate is not about whether global warming exists or whether human produced CO2 is causing significant global warming. The debate is not about whether Mann et al deliberately fudged the data. (I think he was honest, and that the errors were a product of the confirmation fallacy.) The debate is solely whether the hockey stick accurately reflects climate data. The IPCC report of 1990 had an entirely different graph of climate history. That graph showed a Medieval Warm Period (MWP), warmer than the present and lasting to about 1300, followed by the Little Ice Age, a period much colder than the present lasting through the early 1800's. Both disappeared in the hockey stick. The graphs are shown here: http://www.john-daly.com... -- scroll down to find the hockey stick. How did they disappear? Scientists, led by Ross McKitrick, a professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, spent enormous effort trying to reconstruct Mann's work to find out. Mann refused to supply his data or the computer program that he used to process the data. Under intense pressure, enough of the data was revealed and enough information about the algorithms was revealed to allow reconstructing and analyzing the methodology. The actual software has never been released. The details of the analysis are provided in full in a thirty page article by scientist Ross McKitrick, \"The Mann et al Northern Hemisphere 'Hockey Stick': A Tale of Due Diligence.\" published in the book \"Shattered Consensus\" edited by Patrick Michaels. A good summary by a scientist who believes in human-caused global warming is from the MIT magazine Technology Review: http://technologyreview.com... The basic errors in the hockey stick derivation are: 1. Mann used an algorithm that normalized past data based upon the data of the last 78 years. This algorithm was tested by putting pure noise into the algorithm. Noise is fake data that just bounces around with no trends. When processed through the Mann algorithm, a hockey stick is produced. It makes hockey sticks out of nothing. 2. Mann used a method called \"component analysis\" as part of his method. When the raw climate data is put into a standard off-the-shelf computer program that does component analysis, the MWP and Little Ice Age reappear as they were in the 1990 IPCC report. 3. A variety of different types of data were used as inputs to Mann's analysis. The data are various proxies for temperature, like tree ring growth. Most of the data does not show a hockey stick, but one data set from the rings of trees growing at high altitudes did show a hockey stick. The literature says that high altitude tree data has unusual characteristics and should not be used as a temperature proxy. Mann not only included it, but weighted it 380 times more highly than other data. 4. There were errors in the method of filling in missing data. Mann's line of defense was that he didn't have the time to reveal his data or computer programs, and that no matter what critics did to reconstruct his work, they were not doing it right. Pressure mounted, and ultimately the National Science Foundation was asked to investigate the matter. They came back with an obfuscated report that seemed to confirm the criticisms, but at the same time didn't say the hockey stick was wrong. The matter was finally referred by Congress to a panel of statistical experts experienced in the processing of climate data. They determined unambiguously that the critics were correct, and that the hockey stick was invalid. The IPCC is primarily a political organization, so they felt no obligation to set the record straight. However, even politicians have to worry about saving face. The latest IPCC report covers a variety of analyses of past climate data, including the scientifically verifiable one. Separately, other studies and data has been produced relevant to the hockey stick. Paleoclimatologists have been building climate reconstructions at various points around the globe. These use tree rings, pollen in sediment layers, coral growth and other proxies for temperature. more than 350 such studies have been completed, and they prove beyond doubt that both the MWP and the Little Ice Age not only existed, but were worldwide. By 2003, the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics concluded: \"... the 20th century is neither the warmest century nor the century with the most extreme weather of the past 1000 years. The review also confirmed that the Medieval Warm Period of 800 to 1300 A.D. and the Little Ice Age of 1300 to 1900 A.D. were worldwide phenomena not limited to the European and North American\" continents. http://www.cfa.harvard.edu... The hockey stick was used as the basis of claiming that there is a clear trend: temperatures are soaring exponentially, and because it was allegedly unprecedented, we should expect that to continue. So have they continued to soar exponentially since the late 90s? No, actually they have been trending downward since then. http://www.factsandarts.com... So if there is some miracle explanation that says it was correctly derived, we know for certain that using it to predict future climate trends, which was its sole purpose in the IPCC report, is bad science. The resolution is affirmed. **General conditions: (Perhaps I am taking this debate thing too seriously, but I have my own concept of fun.) Do not accept this debate challenge if you are interested in pressing a really creative lawyerly approach, like debating what the meaning of \"is\" is or interpreting the resolution in a way contrary to common sense. Legitimate semantic arguments are fine. If you think the resolution is unclear, ask in the Comments. Do not accept the challenge if you know nothing about the subject and don't plan to research it.",

            "premise": "I thank Con for a good debate.I don't dispute that making of the hockey stick was honestly undertaken. All those involved were, I believe, convinced they were correct. I do question the peer review process, a point that I raised in response to Con's objection that results of the Senate panel were not subjected to peer review. That objection is not to the undertaking of making the hockey stick, which was completed prior to 2000, but rather to the later corruption of the peer review process. Of course, the Wegman work stands on it's merits.Honesty was the first of four criteria Con offered for science to judged \"good.\" I'm not sure the list is exhaustive, but I'll use it to summarize the debate. Standard Techniques were not usedThe original hockey stick paper was never reviewed by a scientist qualified to check the statistical methodology. The Senate committee investigation put the paper reviewers on record as admitting they were not qualified. No one on Mann Team was associated with anyone versed in mainstream statistics. Te hockey stick analysis relied heavily on bristlecone data, which the scientific literature states are should not be used as a temperature proxy.A panel of three expert statisticians, headed by Prof. Wegman, found that the statistical techniques used in the derivation of the hockey stick were wrong, and the critics were correct. Wegman specifically called the hockey stick \"bad science.\"Con suggests that von Storch fond the errors \"minor.\" He found one aspect minor, but, as Wikipedia summaries,\"In late 2004 [von Storch's] team published an article in Science that tested multiproxy methods such as those used by Mann, Bradley and Hughes, 1998, often called MBH98, or Mann and Jones to obtain the global temperature variations in the past 1000 years. The test showed that the method used in MBH98 would inherently underestimate large variations had they occurred; ...\" [12. http://en.wikipedia.org... Of course the Mann Team continues to dispute von Storch's assessment, but von Storch and the Senate panel are clearly the most qualified practitioners of the specialty of statistical analysis.Wegman and von Storch agreed on the result of the error in the Mann analysis. The hockey stick has a flat part showing that climate never varied significantly until the recent \"blade\" part of the graph. The blade part, showing recent temperature rise was not disputed; in fact proxies were not used for that part of the graph. So when Wegman says the hockey stick disappears, he means the long flat part becomes irregular. The error was that past climate variation were suppressed.In the last round, Con showed a recent revised graph in which some of the past temperature variations are shown. It's good that at least some errors have been corrected, but our debate is about the hockey stick graph presented in the 2000 IPCC report, shown in my R2, that eliminated all natural variations in climate. Note that even the more recent version of the graph does not show the last decade, when temperature have been flat.The hockey stick does not show robust findingsThe purpose of the hockey stick graph was to show that there had been no natural variations in climate for a thousand years and that CO2-induced global warming was causing an exponential increase in temperatures. The result allegedly showed that mankind was facing a climate crisis requiring immediate government action. The hockey stick theory was subsequently tested by comparison the temperatures that occurred subsequent to it's publication in 1998. It failed completely. Temperatures were supposed o increase exponentially, but they bounced around a constant level. If there was any trend at all it was slightly downward. As a work of analysis, McKitrick and Wegman and others showed that putting trendless noise into the hockey stick processing produced a hockey stick. A \"robust\" method, in scientific terms means that the method works accurately under a variety of conditions, When the supplied data has to trend, it should not produce one. that's inaccurate. therefore is fails as an analytical technique.Con maintains that Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age might be compatible with the hockey stick. The idea s that they might have been local events, akin to weather rather than climate. he hockey stick purports to show that whatever natural forces affect climate, they have not operated for a thousand years. But the MWP and the Little Ice Age are documented to have persisted over very large areas for hundreds of years. More studies show they were worldwide. The hockey stick was not reproducibleMann fought to keep both the data and the processing method secret. Good science requires tat both be given to other scientists so the results can reproduced. With enormous pressure, Mann gave up much of his data and enough clues about the processing method so that other could show the errors in the method. the exact processing algorithm is stills as proprietary to the investigators.Another test of how robust the findings are is to apply standard principle component analysis to the data and see if the hockey stick emerges. It does not. Con claimed that because others on the Mann Team have produced hockey stick results, the results are reproducible. McKitrick showed that in fact the results were not independent, but relied on the e faulty tree ring data and faulty processing techniques.What is happening is not dishonesty, but rather \"group think.\" Each person the Mann Team believes their analysis to be correct and they confirm each other in that opinion. It's a mild version of adherence to a religious doctrine by a core group of believers; none are dishonest, but they cannot be impressed by any objection. Con charges that Wegman working on finding the closeness of the group first, then applied it to the critique. It was the other way around. The Network Analysis was subsequent to the Senate Committee work, as the dates on the references show. What the network analysis a likely reason for the mutual confirmation of bad science, not the fundamental errors which were previously revealed.Comparing ExpertsExpert opinion is critical to the evaluation of this debate. It is not the case that when scientists disagree, one is free to choose who to believe. Science is highly specialized, and statistics is difficult specialty. McKitrick, Wegman and the other two panellists on the Senate committee and von Storch are level of expertise available in the subject. While Mann et al use statistical methods, they neither had expertise themselves nor did they not seek it in review. (I seek a colorful analogy. Mann vs. Wegman is like Gilbert Godfried vs. Chuck Norris or the Girl Scouts vs. the Oakland Raiders or ... never mind.) Wegman was distinguished as president of the American Statistical Association, Von Storch received the IMSC achievement award at the International Meetings on Statistical Climatology in Edinburgh in 2010, to \"recognize his key contributions to statistical downscaling, reconstruction of temperature series, analyses of climatic variability, and detection and attribution of climate change.\" [12]Con can do no more than to quote the arguments made by the Mann Team as to why they are correct and the experts are wrong. As noted, a degree in climate science doesn't require a single course in statistical analysis.SummaryCon says that the problem I have with the hockey stick is that it doesn't show what I want it to. The problems I have are that the data and algorithms were concealed, it was not peer reviewed by qualified statisticians, it has been found to be incorrectly derived by six highly qualified experts in statistics. It also found by experts to make hockey sticks out of trendless noise, and to suppresses past climate variations. Most importantly, it's prediction of an an exponential rise in temperature in the past decade was completely false. That makes it bad science.",

            "premise": "I don't see the reasoning for the existence of your first paragraph. I don't disagree that swimming is a tough workout. The same goes for your second paragraph. The fact that people with certain disabilities can swim has nothing to do with the amount of athleticism the sport takes. As for your third paragraph, of course a player must learn to swim. That's all the swimmer must learn to do. If a swimmer can't control a stroke to the point where he wont crash into other players, then I don't think that the swimmer has learned to swim at all. So the swimmer must learn one skill, in comparison to the many skills of a hockey player. As strength: A swimmer of course uses strength, as I'm sure almost every sport uses strength of some sport. As Agility: Agility is the power of moving quickly and easily; nimbleness. I don't know about you, but I've never seen a hockey player that was clumsy, slow, or overweight. I have, however, seen swimmers that aren't quick, or nimble. As endurance: A sprint wouldn't be considered \"a night at the pool\". Consider a 100 yard event at a swim meet. A 100 yard would range from 50 seconds to a minute and 20 seconds depending on the stroke. So even if you are using a lot of your body, your doing so for less than two minutes. I'd disagree that two minutes takes as much stamina as three periods of hockey. When using the these things as the criteria for athleticism, my argument concludes as the following: Skills: Hockey takes multiple skills, and swimming takes one. Strength: Both sports use strength, arguing which uses more strength is purely opinion and is useless. Agility: Swimmers are using constant strokes, they are paced. They know what is coming, it takes one stroke after the other. Hockey players have to dodge opposing players, and the puck. They dodge in many different ways, to protect themselves, and to help their team. They don't have the gift of knowing what they have to do next, like how a swimmer knows that their next action is to bring their arm around for another stroke. A hockey player must react quickly, as they might only have a few seconds. Endurance: A sprint in swimming takes little to no endurance or stamina. There are longer distance events, but a good swimmer could complete them in less time than one single period of hockey. You said \"they are both a complete work out of the body\", therefore, as a hockey game lasts for a much longer period of time, it is workout out of the body, entirely, for longer than swimming; thus taking more endurance.",

            "premise": "Pro, who has full burden of proof, has made the point that hockey is more fun as you move at faster speeds. This is firstly untrue as the players themselves, if anything, move faster in soccer as they fight in a 'melee' style with the ball rather than a 'ranged' style in hockey. In hockey you can be moving our stick as a pivot around your body and shoulder rather than actually be speeding around. In soccer all tackles and all moves involve actual body-based movement and therefore you are moving at greater speeds. The only thing that moves faster in hockey, whether it's on field or ice, is that the actual ball or puck move faster within the game than the soccer ball does in soccer. This not only makes spectating and filming it for TV-based spectating a lot harder as well as real-time commentating but also is a major health risk and is why soccer players can wear nothing but shin pads and be fine but hockey players on field have to learn to use the bat itself as defence and on ice have literally padding top-to-bottom and still get life-threatening injuries. I won't use sources, case studies or go into details as yet. If Pro wants to call me out on any of my claims, I'm happy to oblige in later rounds.",

            "premise": "Just because hockey is played in the olympic games doesnt mean that football isnt popular. It isnt played the Olympic games because its an American sport and once again we have been arguing AMERICAN popularity. Also the Stanley Cup is televised just as much as the Superbowl but people just dont watch it as much. Have you considered this, that most of the people who play in the NHL are mostly from outside our country? Because of this, it shows that in the US not many people play hockey over football which is why the popularity is down in the US. Internationally hockey is way more popular than football but once again we are talking about the US. I myself am a hockey fan and enjoy the game because of its toughness and athletism it takes to play the game but to say that it is more popular than football isnt a fair judgement. As for the rule changes that the NFL has been coming too, the league is just trying to limit the amount of head injuries that are causing men to suffer alot of brain damage because of how physical the game of football is. Your right that it is a privelige to play in the NFL but why risk causing life threathing injuries over vicious hits that are completely illegal. To say that it is becoming a \"touch football league\" it is completely un-jusitfied because these head injuries shouldnt be nessessary and jeopardizing the lives of people. There are plenty of hard LEGAL hits in the NFL that show how physical of a game it is and always will be. Also, most of the rule changes in the NFL are just to protect the quarterback which i might say is something a little childish to the quarterbacks and favoring them a little bit but still doesnt take away from still being the most physical sport.",

            "premise": "To start off, I would like to point out that this is a debate about the sport in general, not just the media perspective. Just because the fans watch it more does not make it a better sport. Now let's start things off: \"Fans want to see high-scoring games where people score constantly.\" http://www.sportsnetworker.com... According to this long article, if you scroll down to \"Celebrities in social media\", you notice that fans like seeing sports with popular athletes. Athletes become famous through amazing plays, their team and sometimes what they do for their community, and how they promote teamwork. Hockey players help out a lot, for example, Sidney Crosby donated his golden metal to charity. http://www.newswire.ca... Also he makes amazing plays that involve teamwork and a lot of dangling. I basket-ball, all you do is run and shoot by yourself, not promoting teamwork. Secondly: An average basketball game is about 105-95 [1]. This demonstrates how easy it is to get points in basket-ball, and how little skill it requires. Hockey has much less points because it is much harder and requires more skill. Now for my arguments: Hockey requires more thought. In hockey games, the coach need to perfectly time everything. When players are going to switch, which players should go on etc. They have to work hard, and plan things out perfectly. In basket-ball it is non-stop running, what is the thought in that? Secondly, the fans are much more invested in the game. The fans are so crazy about their teams. Unlike in basket ball. Basket ball has many fans, and a bigger franchise than hockey. But hockey fans care much more about their teams. Think about it, when Vancouver lost to Boston, they started a riot! http://news.nationalpost.com... Your turn.",

Football and hockey use a high amount of stamia at different times of a game. For example, a football play of high contact lasts about 4-5 seconds. During that amount of time, because you have to react so quickly on every given play, you lose breath and arent breathing regularly than you might be doing in a different sport. You may get a ten to 20 second break between plays but after that you have to go back to action. To continue that for a long 5-7 drive is very tasking on your body and you need to be mentally tough to do it because the other team is feeling the same way as you are but its who wants it more. With hockey, you have to continue playing about 2 minutes then a new line comes in and you have a long period of breath.

            "conclusion": "The Hockey Stick is Bad Science",
            "premise": "Climate Reconstruction Using Proxies Con correctly states that proxies are widely used in the historical reconstruction of temperatures. That is because there have only been reliable widespread direct temperature measurements for about a century. Scientist would like to know what temperatures were like before that. There are quite a number of measurements that can be used to deduce temperatures. con mentioned a few, but there are more. Some are better than others. Tree rings depend upon rainfall as well as temperature, and only reflect climate during the growing season. Trees of different species or at different altitudes or in different local climates will produce different indications of climates. Some species grow more rapidly due to the carbon dioxide rise in the 20th century. Local variations affect virtually every type of proxy. Scientists must use statistical methods to attempt to derive correct temperature reconstructions. By 2003, at least 350 historical temperature reconstructions had been published, with contributions from around the world. If all the data are combined, the picture of climate for the past thousand years is not a hockey stick. Con asks why there are four of the 350 that show hockey sticks. With 350 to choose from, finding four for almost any shape is not be surprising, given the variability. However, it seems that Prof. Mann and his colleagues shared tips on processing techniques, and the methods they derived works to make a hockey stick result out of any large data set. I don't believe there is any deliberate attempt to falsify data and I'm not alleging any malfeasance. The group seized upon a bad method and believes to this day it is correct. This is not shocking. Climate scientists are not experts in statistical methods, so it took experts in mathematical statistics to unravel the errors.The graphs below are scaled versions of those in [1. http://www.john-daly.com... ] The IPCC report of 1990 (A) had an entirely different graph of climate history. That graph showed a Medieval Warm Period (MWP), warmer than the present and lasting to about 1300, followed by the Little Ice Age, a period much colder than the present lasting through the early 1800's. Both disappeared in the hockey stick. (B) [1] shows a number of climate reconstructions confirming (A) and disconfirming (B). Mann's Errors Why did major climate variations disappear in the hockey stick? Scientists, led by Ross McKitrick, a professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, spent enormous effort trying to reconstruct Mann's work to find out. Mann refused to supply his data or the computer program that he used to process the data. Under intense pressure, enough of the data was revealed and enough information about the algorithms was revealed to allow reconstructing and analyzing the methodology. The actual software had never been released.The details of the analysis are provided in full in a thirty page article by scientist Ross McKitrick, [2] \"The Mann et al Northern Hemisphere 'Hockey Stick': A Tale of Due Diligence.\" published in the book \"Shattered Consensus\" edited by Patrick Michaels. A good summary by a scientist who believes in human-caused global warming is from the MIT magazine Technology Review: [3. http://www.technologyreview.com...]The basic errors in the hockey stick derivation are:1. Mann used an algorithm that normalized past data based upon the data of the last 78 years. This algorithm was tested by putting noise into the algorithm. Noise is fake data that just bounces around with no trends. When processed through the Mann algorithm, a hockey stick is produced. It makes hockey sticks out of nothing.2. Mann used a method called \"component analysis\" as part of his method. When the raw climate data is put into a standard off-the-shelf computer program that does component analysis, the MWP and Little Ice Age reappear as they were in the 1990 IPCC report.3. A variety of different types of data were used as inputs to Mann's analysis. The data are various proxies for temperature, like tree ring growth. Most of the data does not show a hockey stick, but one data set from the rings of trees growing at high altitudes did show a hockey stick. Mann not only included it, but weighted it 380 times more highly than other data.\"Almost all of the ... series selected for overweighting [by Mann] were of a single type and from a single researcher, Donald Graybill. The series were high-altitude bristlecone pine tree-ring chronologies, many of which had been studied by Graybill and Sherwood Idso as possible examples of CO2 fertilization of tree growth, following a similar study by Lamarche et al. on Sheep Mountain. The sites were selected for \"cambial dieback,\" that is, the bark had died around the circumference of the tree. ... They related that the anomalous twentieth century growth was unrelated to the temperature from nearby weather stations.\" McKitrick in Michaels, [2] p 41Mann didn't hand-select the odd data to be overweighted, his computer processing did it automatically. The method selected matches to recent instrumental data and weighted them as the best proxies. Since the match was a matter of chance, earlier data from those proxies was mostly noise. Later examination of the chosen proxies showed they didn't track the next decade at all.4. There were errors in the method of filling in missing data.Expert Evaluation Mann said he didn't have the time to reveal his data or computer programs, and that no matter what critics did to reconstruct his work, Mann claimed they were not doing it right. Pressure mounted, and ultimately the National Science Foundation was asked to investigate the matter. They came back with an obfuscated report that seemed to confirm the criticisms, but at the same time didn't say the hockey stick was wrong.The matter was finally referred by Congress to a panel of statistical experts experienced in the processing of climate data. The panel featured Edward Wegman. Wegman is a statistics professor at George Mason University, and past chair of the National Research Council's Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics. He holds a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics and is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He was selected to provide the highest level of expertise on the statistical methods employed. Wegman and the panel determined unambiguously that the critics were correct, and that the hockey stick was invalid.Harvard Smithsonian Metastudy In 2003, the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics reviewed 350 published reconstructions and concluded:\"... the 20th century is neither the warmest century nor the century with the most extreme weather of the past 1000 years. The review also confirmed that the Medieval Warm Period of 800 to 1300 A.D. and the Little Ice Age of 1300 to 1900 A.D. were worldwide phenomena not limited to the European and North American\" continents. [4. http://www.cfa.harvard.edu...] Aside from the data reconstructions, books have been published documenting the exceptional nature of the MWP [5. http://www.amazon.com...] and the LIA [6. http://www.amazon.com...]. the MWP had Greenland named for its greenery and grapes growing in northern Scotland. The LIA produced painting of ice skaters on the canals of Holland and a yearly festival on the ice of the Thames. Why the Hockey Stick is Bad Science The hockey stick was derived using incorrect procedures. It wrongly claimed temperatures were soaring exponentially, and because it was allegedly unprecedented, we should expect that to continue. So have they continued to soar exponentially since the late 90s? No, actually the trend was slightly downward after 1995. [7. http://www.factsandarts.com...]",

            "premise": "The reasons which have been enlisted are the Speed and Toughness or the level of contact allowed.I am a bit appalled at the choice of the two. Firstly the topic is Hockey is better than soccer. Where as my opponent fails to give legitimacy to the game of field hockey which is more popular and widespread, rather he chose to focus all his attention to Ice hockey. I don't want to get into semantics but Hockey is a much broader term which encompasses both forms and hence ignoring one for the other is unjustified. Secondly the quality of the game is never judged solely on the pace of the game. The parameters are the level of skill required , technical ability, team cohesion, simplicity and the high stakes involved. A spectator gets his money's worth while witnessing the sheer wizardry of Lionel Messi as he dribbles past 4-5 opposition players before putting the ball into the goal. While doing so he displays the positional awareness of both his teammates and opposition players, moving the ball at pace , performs evasive maneuvers, makes several judgments almost simultaneously. If this is not the what displays peak of human ability then I do not know what might. Similarly when Cristiano Ronaldo takes a free kick from 40 yards out , he kicks the ball with strength at specific angle which makes the ball swerve at pace before hitting the back of the net , leaving the goalkeeper dismayed and the spectator amazed. This is what elevates football from being just a game to a religion a faith. And talking of pace Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre emerick aubameyang clocked faster than WR sprinter Usain bolt over a 40 yard stretch. I would love to see an Ice hockey player attempt such a feet on foot . Thirdly Soccer is not a contact sport it is a game played in the mind and executed with skill on the field. There is no scope of contact in this sport hence it is looked upon severely by the referee. Ice hockey players have elaborate paraphernalia to make this a contact sport. Yet contusion , lacerations , concussions, broken bones are regular part of it. We do not know how many promising careers might have prematurely ended because of a rash tackle in hockey rink. Moreover judging a game just because it is not tough enough and players avoid injuries is just a bit sadistic. I recommend Boxing if someone is so inclined towards manning up, let the skill prevail on the field and not brute force.",

What's more, most amount of people watching a single NHL game was between Chicago-Montreal in 1971 was 12.4 million. 12.4 million people versus 71.5 million people. Thus, soccer is way more popular than Hockey, creating a much better business from ticket buying and merchandise purchasing. Argument #4: Inclusiveness Worldwide Soccer can be played in so many countries, no matter the status. For Example, take the country Cameroon. They are not in the greatest situation for economy, yet still have one of the greatest National Teams in Africa. Soccer is also played in Canada and the USA, even though it might seem way to cold. Yet Hockey is only primarily played in North America and Europe. It is usually only in colder countries. Ever heard of a Hockey Team in warm Africa? At least I have not. Ever heard of a soccer team in cold Russia? Yes! Argument #5: Easiness to Learn Hockey takes a lot of skill and equipment to learn. First, you need a stick, a puck, skates and ice (if you are playing on ice, witch is the most common form of playing by far). Then, you need to learn how to skate, so you might take lessons. Lessons cost a lot of money. Then, you have to learn how to skate, shoot, and keep control of the puck at the same time! In soccer you need only shoes. My opponent might say: you have to run and shoot and dribble in soccer at the same time too, BUT, running comes naturally where as skating you have to learn and take classes. One more thing: Please take into account that in Debates you vote on a debater that has good points NOT the side you would personally take in a real life situation. Thanks.",

Because an actual game will take 3 hours. That's right. There is more time spent with time outs and penalties then actual game play. Hockey is not stopped every 10-20 seconds. Hockey players just play. The speed of the game is not too short that you will disappointed but not so long you will be bored. There is no point in watching a long stretch of stoppages punctured by 10 seconds of game play. Sports fans, you want to watch games and have a few breaks, you don't want to watch breaks with a few seconds of game play, do you? Also, the overall pace of Hockey Games are MUCH faster. The playing fields are smaller which in this case is usually ice, the players go faster and the ball goes faster. Waaaaay faster. Faster players mean more competition to get to the puck. More competition means better games. Better games means happy fans. Thanks for accepting, I would do more points but I am a bit busy. It is mothers day and I have a mother to be with. DarthKirones",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for the responce.REFUTATIONS \"Thank you for taking a part in this and for having much respect. I assume you play soccer because you seem to write more and be most passionate about it, but that is just an assumption. In soccer, the goalie may have to leave his small box to play the ball. But the hockey goaltender must do the same to play the puck. And as the goal may be 4x the size if an Nil size, the ball is 10x bigger than a puck.\" False. The hockey net is 4 high by 6 feet wide. [1] The area is 24 feet in area. The puck is 1\" thick and 3\" in diameter. Since it is usually shot sideways, the puck is about 3 inches cubed.So, the puck takes up an eigth of the hockey net. [2] The soccer net is 24 feet wide, and 8 feet high. [3] This is 192 feet in area. The ball is about 28 inches. [4] Or, 2 foot 8. This takes up around a 68! As you can see, the amount of space that the soccer ball can fit into the soccer net is much much bigger than the space for a puck into a hockey net. The chances of a soccer ball going in is over 8 times more than a hockey net. So, obviously being a soccer goalie, you need to cover both the box and your net, this is much much harder than a soccer goalie. A soccer goalie already covers almost the whole net!\"The puck can be tipped, there can be multiple passes before a shot, the goalie can be screened and the goalie can be hit by another player, which may be illegal but is rarely called by referees.\" The same happens for many sports such as soccer and le cross.\"In football, what I meant by they aren't on the field all the time is that if your a quarterback, your not going to be on the field when the defense is on the field.\" The quarter back is always on the field.\"Baseball, the pitcher does need to choose the perfect pitch, but they have about a minute to do so. The hockey goalie must do the equivalent but in a split second\" The pitcher has 10 seconds, whereas a hockey goalie has plenty of time. While he observes the puck approaching, he has plenty of time to estimate where the player is going to shoot.\"Dance, dance is mostly a team sport where no body contributes the most. And if it is a single dancer, when they make a mistake, they cant be pulled and humiliated, they get to keep going on.\" In dance, if you make that mistake you are pretty much already out. In Hockey, if the goalie makes a mistake, the team can always even the score.\"Wrestling, just so we are clear, we are talking about cage fighters and not that fake wwe stuff right, that being said, fists and kicks don't hurt as bad as a puck to the groin. Plus, id like to see a wrestler skate with that much pads on.\" Let me tell you something, a puck to the groin doesn't hurt at all! Why? Because every goalie wears a jockstrap. A punch to the face, and being beaten up but still required to fight back hurts much more, and is much more difficult than a goalie with full padding who is basically standing still having to stop pucks when he already covers most of the net.\"On the armless ping pongers, I give them many applauds since I know I couldn't do it, but its still not that different id they're playing everyone like that.\" But it is still much more difficult.\"The goaltender may not be as important as you say, but it is the most difficult there is since all goalies must use the Same size net from mini mights to beer league, all goalies must skate which does not apply to any other sport. \" There are plenty of sports that include skates! Aggressive inline skating Artistic roller skating Bobrun skating Ice skating Inline speed skating Figure skating Rinkball Rink hockey Freestyle slalom skating Roller derby Roller skating Short track speed skating Skater hockey Speed skating Synchronized skating [5] And hockey goaltending isn't even close to the hardest position. In fact, plenty of goalies think goaltending is easy. \"As I embark on this next phase in my life with my goaltending school, all I can think of is all that the game of hockey has given me \u2013 and how it\u2019s now my time to give it all back to the kids. I\u2019m raising a family of my own now, and if I can be a positive influence on the kids at the arena and help them \u201cdream big,\u201d then I feel I\u2019m fulfilling my duty in life. The world doesn\u2019t need another coach yelling and screaming at their kids. Kids get enough of that through their teenage years, and that\u2019s why some of them they say the heck with hockey when they reach that critical make-it-or-break-it 14-16 years of age. I want to put as many kids in college, playing hockey, as I can. So, I have to put together a structured plan and create a culture that will make this happen. What I have to offer isn\u2019t just great hockey goalie drills and managing a practice. I feel my biggest asset is having the experience and gift for connecting with the kids. Here is the way I see it: Great Practice = Easy Game\" [6] You see? Even this goaltending coach admits it. With enough practice, it's and easy game. So if some goalies and goalie coaches think it's easy, how is it the hardest position?CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there are plenty of sports with a much more difficult position. Hockey goaltending is easy, because they already cover most of the net, and basically feel no pain due to their excessive padding. Also, skating isn't an issue with goalies since they barely move, they are in a small area. Also, it doesn't require as much dedication as sports like armless pingpong. Some people even think goaltending is easy! So, it is clear that hockey goaltending is one of the easiest positions, definitly not the hardest.SOURCES: [1]http://www.sportsknowhow.com...[2]http://web.archive.org...[3] http://www.sportsknowhow.com...[4]http://worldsoccer.about.com...[5]http://en.wikipedia.org...[6]http://www.stevevaliquette.com...;",

            "premise": "1) The Law of Series\"If coincidence does not exist in the sense that most people perceive it to be, then the lyrics to the song \"Hokey Pokey\" must not be a coincidence, and must in fact be metaphysically meaningful in some way....\"Coincidence as we all know is a very debated topic in the scientific community, with many scientists chalking up miraculous occurrences to events that took place simply by chance, and others suggesting that its a much deeper science than that. One scientist in this article i have chosen to quote, who goes by the last name of Beitman, suggests that \"dismissing coincidence as a matter of chance assumes that coincidences are inherently meaningless or insignificant. Without supporting evidence, this assumption is hardly scientific....\u201d He then recognized the difficulty in scientifically proving coincidences are anything more than chance....http://www.theepochtimes.com...If it truly is coincidence that the lyrics to the sign came out the way they did, or even if there is a deeper meaning behind the organization of those words, is in the end irrelevent though, because the plain meaning of the words when put into proper context includes the phrase 'and you turn yourself around' right in between 'do the Hokey Pokey' and 'That's what its all about'. If coincidence is the case, then its a coincidence that doing the Hokey Pokey is included in the lyric in the first place, whereas if its not coincidence and that there is indeed a deeper meaning and science to the song as Beitman would argue that there is, then 'turning yourself around' is placed in the lyric for a legitimate reason, which means that 'Doing the Hokey Pokey' can only be what PART of it's all about, if anything at all. 2) Collective consciousness\"Considering the lyrics of the hokey pokey must then be linked with such a collective consciousness must mean that human beings somehow unconsciously know why the hokey pokey is the meaning of what its all about.\"It could be equally valid to conclude that the collective consciousness of all people merely allows all people to unconsciously know THE LYRICS to the Hokey Pokey, not necessarily the meaning behind the words themselves or the true meaning of the song.... In 2008 a study im pretending that is real was carried out where 100 men at the mall were shown pictures of other men looking bored at the mall because their girlfriends dragged them to the mall to shop, leaving the men bored out of their minds.... All 100 men who were shown the pictures felt empathy for the men in the pictures because they consciously or unconsciously knew the pain and suffering those men in the pictures were facing, being able to relate to them on a personal level.... When asked to evaluate what the men in the pictures were THINKING about though, rather then just note the experience they were going through, the 100 male responders gave a variety of answers/guesses, ranging from 'The man is sad because he is missing the football game on TV right now' to 'The man is sad because he thinks he is dating the wrong twin', with some answers even being 'The man is sad because his in-laws will be in town soon and precious alone time is being wasted by being at the mall'....This study indicates that while collective consciousness is a reasonable but debated concept, the amount of information that people could gather from collective consciousness is very basic, meaning it is implausible to argue that people simply KNOW that the Hokey Pokey is what its all about based on this science. It can only be argued that people know the LYRICS to the Hokey Pokey, but nothing more. Furthermore If there was a collective conscious that the \"Hokey Pokey\" was what it is all about, then why is it that different cultures have different translations of what exactly it is that its all about. The UK knows the song as 'The Hokey Cokey'In New Zealand its known as 'The Hokey Tokey\"In the Phillippines its known as 'The Boogie Boogie'In Denmark its sung as 'The Boogie Woogie'https://en.wikipedia.org...The collective consciousness knowing that the Hokey pokey is what its all about is therefore invalidated by the fact that cultures cannot even agree on what it is that it is all about!3) Greko-Philosophical standpoint vs Einsteinian-Relativity standpoint on 'The Hokey Pokey'In Ancient Greece, the Philosopher Aristotle came to the Metaphysical conclusion that \"The whole is MORE than the sum of its parts' in that outside of a case in mathematics, machines or concepts that serve a purpose or service to humanity are on a whole worth more to society than all of the things that actually puts together the machine or concept in the first place. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...Albert Einstein though later offered a contention that the Sum was NOT greater than all of its parts, and that from a physics and relativity standpoints, the sum is in fact LESS than all of its parts due to concepts of decay and binding energy... http://www.einstein-online.info...The debate about whether the Hokey Pokey is or isnt what its all about derives to a standoff between both sides depending on whether they accept the Greko-classical argument or the Einstein-modern argument on the matter. If we accept the latter, than the Hokey Pokey is NOT what its all about, and that infact, it is even less than putting ones body parts in, putting ones body parts out, and shaking ones body parts all about. Accepting the Greko-classical argument favors that the Hokey Pokey is what its all about, but conflicts with existing and testable evidence indicating otherwise4) Meaning\"The only way to refute the hokey pokey is to say that we can know precisely what this dance means, but alas, we may never know what it means\"The dance means exactly what it is perceived to mean based on the plain reading of the lyrics though, which read off like cooking instructions.... Putting one's left hand 'in', for example, implies sticking a persons hand inside or towards a pre-determined and pre-agreed upon zone or location by the people who are participating in the song.... Then to put one's left hand 'out' is an instruction to then remove the persons hand from inside or towards the pre-agreed upon location, and instead point it at an inverse, opposite direction or location away from the pre-determined zone, often located at the center of the group that has gathered to perform the dance...... Finally, to put one's left hand in and shake it all about' is to simply repeat what the first step of the song entails, with the added condition of then shaking it around wildly in a timely matter in accordance to the lyrics of the song.... These steps are then repeated with other body parts until the song concludes. Since the Hokey Pokey can be explained and defined, by your own admission now the Hokey Pokey can be 'refuted', meaning it can be concluded that it is NOT 'what its all about'\"Sisyphus - doing something completely rediculous and possibly even meaningless repeatedly\"Like spelling 'Ridiculous' with an 'E' instead of an 'I' right?

            "premise": "swimming is an amazing cardio-vascular exercise and with increasing effort will raise your heart rate and stimulate your muscles. It gives you a more toned body if done regularly and is also less stressful to your joints than other forms of exercise such as jogging. If combined with a land workout such as a run or gym session it will help move your blood through your muscles to help them recover. It also is an extreme work out on abdominal muscles. Aside from that, by making it seem like the body weighs much less than it actually does, swimming is the perfect alternative for those who are not capable of performing other types of exercises and activities. Individuals with a spinal cord injury, for example, are able to strengthen their muscles through swimming when they may not possess the strength to walk or in your case \"play hockey\". As you earlier mentioned, I quote \"the player must learn to ice skate\" do you think a swimmer must not learn to swim? A hockey player needs to control a puck, do you not think a swimmer needs to hold their breath? Control different strokes, and avoid crashing into other swimmers? As Strength: the arms and hips are responsible for propelling the body through the water and both are directly connected to the lumbar spine. A strong core will enable more energy to be transferred from the core to the pull and kick components of the stroke. A weak core will allow more energy to leak out, resulting in a less powerful pull and kick. Thus saying a swimmer must also have strength. As Agility: The stronger a swimmer is the more agility they have. Because swimming is built on as above \"arms and hips\", The more power and speed put into a stroke the more agile they become. As for stamina, in regards to your statement \"A sprint in swimming wouldn't take very much endurance\" I agree with you. But we are debating about this in the terms of a sport, not a night at the pool. In all actuality swimming would take just as much stamina as hockey as they are both a complete work out of the body.",

In a game of basketball, all you need to watch is some people dribbling the basketball, and shooting from 3 feet from the net. The ball is extremely slow and its not fun to watch. In hockey, you hear the crowd suck in there breath thousands of times in a game. In basketball, the only fun part to watch is the time when someone slams dunk the ball. Dear readers, it is for these reasons why hockey is better then basketball",

            "discussionTitle": "The global warming hockey stick is bad science",
            "conclusion": "The global warming hockey stick is bad science",
            "premise": "In this round, Con has not responded to any of the six points of my case that establish that the global warming hockey stick is bad science. Instead he has arguments that scientific expertise means nothing, and then a litany of personal attacks against me. I will comment on his arguments relative to expertise. The personal attacks are too silly to respond to; for the purposes of a debate I could be a computer program or the personification of evil, it doesn't matter. All that matters is the evidence and reasoning presented in the debate. There are at least two ways to identify bad science. One way is to identify what went wrong in producing the science. Another way is to prove that the claimed theory does not agree with observed reality. I pointed out errors in the derivation of the hockey stick in arguments 1 through 4. I presented disagreement with observed reality in 5 and 6. In both cases, it is important to establish that the evidence is credible. Therefore I used credible sources who support each of the arguments I made. I did not really solely or even predominantly upon expert opinion about the overall credibility of the hockey stick. For example, the hockey stick claims the MWP and the Little Ice Age did not exist; the Harvard-Smithsonian survey says it does. The Harvard-Smithsonian study carries considerable weight be of the integrity of the institution, much more than, for example, an assertion of an unsigned blog post. Contradiction my reality is sufficient to prove bad science. Back in the 1880s scientists studying aeronautics said that according to then-current theory that bumblebees cannot fly. They knew perfectly well that bees did fly, so their statement was an admission that the theory was wrong. They didn't know why it was wrong, but it was nonetheless proof that it was wrong. (Turns out that modeling the change of shape of the insect wings during flapping is critical.) Similarly, the hockey stick says the MWP did not exist. It did exist, so therefore the hockey stick is bad science. We don't need to know why it is bad, although we do. The hockey stick was intended to prove temperatures were rising exponentially. That hasn't happened, so therefore it is bad science. Turning to Con's specific arguments: Con asks \"How can you believe temperature are rising and falling at the same time?\" There is no question that there has been a general warming trend of the earths climate since the end of the Little Ice Age around the mid-1800's. That is evident in the Hadley data http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk... There are quite a few ups and downs around the general upward trend. This is contrary to the hockey stick claim, which is that there was no significant warming until recently when temperatures supposedly took off exponentially, and was predicted to keep climbing unimpeded. However, looking at the data after the hockey stick graph ended in 2000, it's clear that in the past few years the trend is slightly downward. Thus temperature is in a long term upward trend, but is not behaving at all like the hockey stick. The hockey stick is contrary to CO2 global warming math models. The CO2 models predict that if CO2 increases exponentially, then temperature will rise linearly. There is no theory that predicts a hockey stick curve, and indeed none is observed. Con claims, \"Traceable references mean nothing. ... PhD means nothing.\" If so, then every bit of science is bad, since it is all based upon journal articles written and reviewed by credentialed scientists. If all science is bad, then the resolution is affirmed. Con claims \"Harvard means ... nothing\" and cites as proof an article about a scandal involving one guy in the medical school having a conflict of interest in cholesterol drugs. This is irrelevant to the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics that comprehensively verified the existence of the MWP. It provides no grounds to doubt the study results. Con agrees that experts in statistical methods are the ones who can appropriately judge whether Mann's methods were correct. Therefore the Congressional panel of experts in statistical methods provided that definitive judgment on Mann's derivation of the hockey stick. The panel said that Mann erred and the critics were correct. Con asserts, \"Apparently my opponent feels there is a systemic problem with statistical computer programs.\" No, there is no problem with the computer programs. If a person hits his thumb with a hammer, the problem is not with the hammer. The problem is with users outside of the field of statistics sometimes applying the programs correctly. Better training in statistical methods would treat the problem, but alternatively the use use of consulting experts on the data analysis team would solve it. Note that when the climate data was fed into an unmodified Principle Component software package, the hockey stick disappeared and the MWP reappeared. What was required was to not modify the software. Con does not deny the problem with the bristlecone pine tree ring data, but says that I should not bring it up if I'm going to discuss the data analysis errors. There is nothing inappropriate in pointing out multiple errors of different types. Con then launches into a personal attack against me, claiming \"My opponent has suffered a blow to the head.\" Among the unbelievable things I did, according to Con, was my agreement with Barack Obama on the gay marriage issue. Seems reasonable to me. I cite Con for bad conduct in his personal attacks. Con states, \"If I understand my opponent's position correctly: It is bad science to use statistical programs unless you are a statistician because no one else can understand them, and in fact only statisticians should be allowed to publish at all because what field does not use statistical analysis?\" I never said anything remotely similar to what Con asserts. I said Mann made a mistake in the processing of his climate data, and we know that he made a mistake because it was discovered by an expert statistician (McKitrick) and mistake was verified by an expert panel of statisticians. I commented that making a mistake in complex statistical analysis is not particularly surprising, because it is difficult. the climate scientists who originally refereed Mann's paper agreed it was difficult, saying they did not feel qualified to check the analysis. Then Con rambles incoherently, making more personal attacks. Again, this is bad conduct. Throughout the debate, Pro provided never addressed points 2, 4, and 6. He asked what the error was in the tree ring data (point 3) and I explained that it was shown not be a proxy for temperature as Mann assumed. He had no counter argument. Point 1, that inputting noise to Mann's algorithm produced a hockey stick was questioned, but never refuted by counter evidence. Con agreed that statistical experts were the one qualified to judge Mann's analysis, they did so and found that Mann erred. Finally, regarding point 5, there are now over 250 climate reconstruction establishing that the MWP and Little Ice Age did exist, contrary to the hockey stick. con merely asserts it is controversial. It isn't. For these reason, the resolution is affirmed.",

Thanks Let me first outline what makes a good spectator sport. A. Crowd Interaction B. Summertime, Outdoor activity C. Slow Pace to allow for conversation/discussion with friends D. Family oriented E. Value Would you agree? I would also like to point out a few flaws in my opponent's contentions 1) Regarding my opponent's contention, \"the amount of games per season\" I believe this is a contradiction to my opponent's side of the debate because a greater amount of games gives the spectator greater opportunity to attend these games and obviously baseball, with 162 games or more in a season, takes that category. If the spectator hasn't any spare time to attend the sparse and limited hockey games then he couldn't even begin to enjoy it. I also noticed that my opponent attempted to enforce this contention by implying that with less games there is greater importance in the outcome of the game as it pertains to the season, thus creating more dramatic game play. However, this can easily be countered by saying that, in baseball, teams play teams in series' of two to four and the results of those series' are equally significant to a win/loss in hockey. The Fans speak for themselves. According to ESPN, The 2010 MLB season (still in progress) has fielded about 30,338 attendees per game to the 2009 NHL's 17,460. And this concludes Round 1 Also I am new to this website so if there is any specific formalities that i may not be aware of or a specific format that should be used, just let me know http://espn.go.com... baseball attendance http://espn.go.com... hockey attendance",

            "conclusion": "Informal: Hockey is \"better\" than baseball.",
            "premise": "Thank you, opponent, for taking up this debate. I would like to throw out some figures to help shape my approach to the debate. First off, the comparison of the two games a they pertain to their schedules and times to each other. A baseball season is 162 games long, which means that the importance of each game is only .61% to the season total. In other words, if you lose a baseball game, it does not affect the outcome as a whole as much as hockey. There are 82 games in a season of hockey, which means each game is worth 1.12% (almost double) of the season and would thus lead each game of hockey to hold twice the importance of a baseball game in typical regular season circumstances. With more importance of the game to the season usually brings more emotional value for the spectator. Another point to be made about the spectator aspect of the sport is the amount of action that each viewer gets to watch compared to the time they get to invest in each game. A baseball game has no time limit, so basically the monotonous past time could theoretically take forever, but for the purposes of this debate I will say that the average game of baseball is around 3 hours.(http://en.wikipedia.org...) The average time of action for \"ball in play\" is 12 minutes (http://ask.yahoo.com...) which puts the action per game at 6.66%. To put that in perspective, that means for 93% of the game, there is no baseball actually being played. This time is taken up by commercials, throwing the ball back to the pitcher, spitting, and re-adjusting cups. Hockey generally takes 2.5 hours to watch and contains 60 minutes of action (3 periods of 20 minutes). This is a game of 40% action, and when compared to baseball has far less interruptions and far more action for the viewer. With more time of action for hockey, it means that the time invested by the viewer for each game yields more action and thus more potential for excitement. Now lets move to the athletics of each sport. A baseball and a hockey puck weigh the same (5 oz) and generally reach the same mph during game play (between 70 and 105 mph). As far as the physical aspects oh the game, hockey definitely outweighs the power needed on both offense and defense. Hockey entails skating, checking, fighting, taking checks, deking and playing defense, all while you are on your shift. While you are on your shift, you have to be able to play both offense and defense within seconds of each other, and also play as a team on both offense and defense. In baseball, you take breaks between each offense and defense switch, meaning you have time to mentally prepare and adjust and so on. While you are on offense in baseball, you are no longer a part of a team, you basically just a hitter or a runner. (I won't get into pinch hitting or running because I feel it is just absurd in the first place to have someone of better skill take over for you in a pinch.) As a runner you generally only have to run between 90 and 270 ft at a time. As a hitter you have to hit a ball traveling between 70-105 mph with a bat. Some people say it is the hardest thing to do in sports, but if that is true why are there so many hits? On defense in baseball, you are expected to throw the baseball between 90 and 270 ft once in a while when the ball it hit to you. Other than that it is catching the ball and fielding the ball in typically undemanding circumstances. Now to really show the difficulty of each sport for the athlete, I will show the scoring numbers in each sport. In hockey, the save percentage for goalies is on average .90. This means that the goalie will save 90% of all the teams shots, and for an individual it is much harder do be in that 10% when you share the ice with 4 other guys. In baseball, a non pitcher averages between .25 and .30 batting average. This means that an individual on offense in hockey has a harder time scoring and being in a scoring position than a baseball player. That is the bulk of my argument but I would also like to add a few extra points that can be supplementary evidence for my reasoning. Baseball takes 8 breaks between innings where hockey only takes 2 breaks between periods. Ice is a much harder surface to play on. Hockey requires more padding than baseball because it is more physical. The coaches/managers of hockey actually wear respectable clothing in hockey, not the players uniform. Hockey is played indoors so there are rarely if any cancelled games per season and there are no rain delays or rain outs like in baseball. Lastly, any \"sport\" that can be played more than once in a day (back to back double headers in baseball) isn't really that demanding of a sport anyway. Plus baseball players get paid way too much for what they offer athletically and steroids just doesn't really help their reputation anyway. So basically, it is harder to score in hockey, it is more physically demanding of its athletes, spectators get more bang for their buck and each game is worth more in the season total which makes for each game more important. If you look at the amount of minutes of action each sport offers per season, baseball averages 1,944 minutes where as hockey offers 4,920 and baseball takes up 5 months of playing every day where hockey is a concentrated action packed sport of athletics and strategy. That is all I have for now and I am looking forward to my opponents response.",

Therefore, you 'do the hokey pokey' - living the absurd existential life - and then you turn yourself around. What was it all for? nobody knows. It's absurd. Again, we are all living the lives of sisyphus.- Collective UnconsciousThat my opponent has made up their own fictitious study in order to refute the notion that the hokey pokey is a reflection of the meaning of life should already invalidate this refutation, but neverthess:\"you do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what its all about\" is contained within the song, implying \"that's what its all about\" concerns the nature of the meaning of \"what its all about\", or in other words, \"what the meaning of life is\", which is \"the hokey pokey\" which is \"absurd\".- Aristotle vs EinsteinIf I took apart a camera, all of its pieces would be useless. If I held all the taken apart parts in my hand, it would still be useless. However if I put the camera back together again, then I now have something I can take a picture with. In this way, the whole is more than the sum of its parts.Einstein would have been right in terms of science, but looking at things philosophically is about understanding things as they are and what their ultimate meaning is, whereas science only shows us hard facts that tell us neither what something is nor what its ultimate meaning is.- LiteralismUltimately my opponent is taking the lyrics too literally. In order to understand the genius of the hokey pokey, one must look at it symbolically; philosophically. Philosophy and science are not the same schools of thought ultimately and although they can be used together it would be a mistake to consider them to be the exact same thing.",

When a player embellishes an injury they are given a penalty. Accuracy- Hockey players have better accuracy. Under NHL rules, the opening of the goal is 72 inches (6 ft ) wide by 48 inches (4ft ) tall. In soccer, the uprights are 8 yards, or 24 feet, apart and the lower edge of the crossbar is 8 feet above the ground. Now take the goalies and place them in the nets. In hockey you have a goalie at least 6 ft tall with pads on. That is covering almost every opening of the net. In soccer you have a goalie of about 5'11\" standing in a large net with many openings. However the average score in a soccer game is about 2 (depending on the team). In hockey the average score is about 4. Toughness - A recent ESPN study concluded that ice hockey is the most demanding team sport in the world. Durability is a quality that hockey players display perhaps, paradoxically, more than any other athletes. They play a sport that is more physically demanding than any other - 60 minutes in a confined area with no \"comfort zone\" out of bounds. Hockey is non stop action. Either you are rushing on a break, or hurrying back to get into your defensive zone. There is no time, especially in the NHL, where a player would really have the chance to catch their breath during a game. In hockey you are constantly moving your feet. There is no such thing as standing still while on the ice. Each period lasts is 20 minutes long and there are 3 periods in a game. There are only 2 intermissions which last about 15 minutes so they can clean the ice. Each game lasts about 2 1/2 to 2 hours. http://www.iihf.com...

            "premise": "I would like to thank Roy for a spirited debate. I will take the first part of this response to rebut his last points and then summarize my contention. Firstly: there is nothing about the hockeystick that makes cold weather in the Little Ice Age an \u201cimpossibility\u201d. It is equally incorrect to say that the hockey stick shows \u201cno climate change\u201d for thousands of years. In my original proposal I explicitly stated that the discussion was about the hockey stick as originally developed and further expanded. As an example of the \u201cchange\u201d available in the hockey stick reconstructions throughout its history I provide the following illustration from Mann et al, 2003 [1] There appears to be quite a bit of change in the climate. The problem Pro has with the hockey stick is that it doesn\u2019t show his preferred issues as \u201clarge\u201d as he would like them to be. Unfortunately GOOD science is done without preconceived notions. The data fall where they fall. Unless Roy can point to a significant and obvious error in treatment of the data then the data shows what the data shows. Now, mysteriously, Pro wishes to bring up some nefarious hidden actions by Mann and associates and intimates that they are setting out to make software that heavily weights certain data, preventing critics from being published and ultimately resorts to the \u201cclimategate e-mails\u201d (which have been examined by numerous panels and none so far have found evidence of fraudulent science). This sounds very much like an accusation of dishonesty. Yet in Round 2 Roy explicitly agreed that the hockey stick was likely honestly undertaken. Here is his exact phrasing: \u201cI won't contest that the derivation of the Hockey Stick was honestly undertaken. The errors were in selcting invalid proxies, not estalishing that the proxies had a physical tie to what was being measured, and using the poxies outside of the range for which they were validated\u2026\u201d It seems that Pro wishes now to recapture a conceded point here. And since none of these issues are related to Pro\u2019s original I cannot allow this. Pro fails to substantively discuss the details of the principal component analysis which underlays the primary critique of McKitrick and McIntyre against Mann. I showed how McKitrick and McIntyre failed and how Mann et al explicitly followed standard statistical procedure (whereas McKitrick and McIntyre explicitly FAILED to follow standard procedure). In order for Pro to make a valid critique of this as \u201cbad science\u201d he must show how the proper application of accepted statistical analyses was in error for Mann and how misapplication (incorrect truncation of the number of PC\u2019s) was somehow \u2018correct\u2019 for McKitrick and McIntyre. Wegman\u2019s testimony is very interesting. It would be great if Wegman would take his work to the statistics community via regular publication rather than just testimony before Congress. Perhaps this would open it up to peer review? (Note I am not questioning Dr. Wegman\u2019s statistics at all! Quite the contrary. If I am to believe Roy\u2019s point in the last post if this is a good, legitimate critique it would be best put to the broader statistical community and not just a Congressional Committee). It appears that Wegman spent an inordinate amount of time explaining \u201csocial networks\u201d FIRST before launching into a critique of Mann et al.\u2019s actual statistics. But it is also interesting that Wegman took a swipe at Wahl and Amman\u2019s 2006 paper. Interestingly enough if Wegman wished to question the use of real statisticians it appears that Wahl and Amman actually consulted the National Center for Atmospheric Research\u2019s Geophysical Statistics group head. But again, back on statistics, Wegman appears to have focused on the first PC (Pg 9 of the Testimony) and the impact on centering which was really not controversial to begin with. Wegman was by no means the only statistician in attendance. Hans Von Storch (coauthor of one of the leading books on statistics in climatology) also testified [2], and his testimony found that decentering had only a minor effect on the final outcome after all the PC\u2019s were added into the reconstruction. Interestingly von Storch himself found things he disagreed with in MBH and found the ensuing canonization of the hockey stick should have been moderated. This is par for the course in any scientific publication. This even happens to \u201cgood\u201d science! I addressed the regional effects of the choice of the Bristlecone and foxtail pine proxies by reference to the eigenvector-based CFR Technique as discussed in Wahl (2007) and how those were factored in. In addition I noted that Wahl removed that data and still found a single-bladed hockey stick shape to the data. This indicates that it is not clearly just \u201cbad\u201d form for MBH to utilize these techniques. There may be disagreements but is not dispositive for \u201cbad science\u201d. Pro\u2019s repeated reliance on some small circle of Mann\u2019s associates seems somewhat strange since easily more than half of the publications I cited do not include Mann. One is from LDEO, one is from NCAR, one is the IPCC. I feel I have shown a variety of independent sources. Pro also appears to want to expand the debate to the Holocene Optimum and other points in the earth\u2019s history. Indeed the earth has had very warm periods in it. However, these say nothing about the possibility of anthropogenic warming today. The debate here was limited to the proposition of the hockey stick as \"bad science\". I must say that Pro\u2019s continual reliance on non-peer reviewed citations, congressional testimony, Wikipedia and the Telegraph newspaper in critique of science is somewhat of a mystery to me. SUMMARY In order for science to bad it must be either: Undertaken dishonestly Reliant on such misapplication of standard scientific or analytical techniques as to make it patently obvious to a majority it was flawed In this debate Pro initially agreed that it was not #1 when he stated he felt it was honestly undertaken. And as to the application of standard scientific or analytical techniques I substantively responded to those points and even noted that the primary critiques of McKitrick and McIntyre relied on inappropriate truncation of the principal components.In order for science to be \u201cgood\u201d it must be: Honestly undertaken Rely on standard scientific and analytical techniques (or failing that to provide ample explanation of why different techniques were considered Show robust findings Be reproducible I have shown these things to be true of the hockey stick. We both agreed it was honestly undertaken (even if Roy seemed to attempt to backpedal on this point in the recent round), while some may disagree with the techniques chosen, it is not exclusive to MBH. I further provided evidence of the robustness of the analysis by reference to Wahl and Amman (2007). I provided evidence of the reproducibility of the hockey stick in a number of ways relying not just on alternate proxies, but also without reliance on the PCA technique! This does not mean the hockey stick is \u201cperfect\u201d. No science ever is. It cannot be. But it is \u201cgood\u201d science in that there is little reason to doubt the results since external groups have analyzed the results, found them acceptable, and even were able to reproduce the hockey stick without reliance on the statistical techniques. Mere disagreement over the outcomes (or rather what some would prefer the outcomes to be) does not equate to science being \u201cbad\u201d.

            "premise": "Hockey is also better then tennis becuase hockey players are tougher then tennis players. you dont see tennis players taking out there teeth on the bench then countinue playing the game. Here is a video of Dupuis pulling out one of his teeth during a game. http://www.youtube.com... the game he was interviewed and said that he would try to put his tooth back in when he got home.... himself. The new rules that they make for hockey are for safty reasons. They dont change any rules for tennis becuase they only have to be worried about getting hit with the ball. Were in hockey your being slamed into the boards and the ice and have to worry about getting hit with a hard fast flying peice of rubber. Hockey is a tough contact sport. Some players just cant learn to control themselves (look at the nasty flyers for example). they hit players with an illegal check (when the player makes the hit and they can only see the number of the person there hitting against the boards) those are cheap shots by dirty players. its nearly impossible for a hockey team to go a whole season without an injury, its pretty much expected for players to get injured when theres as much contact as there is. in tennis there is no contact, the players cant hit eachother. There is more action in hockey then tennis. in tennis theres 2 people hitting a ball back and forth. in hockey there are a total of 12 players on the ice at a time ( 3 offense, 2 defense, 1 goaly for each team) and there always moving.",

            "conclusion": "Ice Hockey Hardest Sport to Play at the Professional Level.",
            "premise": "I would like to start by thanking con for this exciting and fun debate, and wish him/her luck in the voting process. In my final argument I would like to reflect to the reader's that all sport's involve some aspect of hockey in their difficulty and gameplay, but hockey is the one sport where it all comes to together and is tested at a higher level than sports that have similar qualities. Skill 1: Swimming versus Ice Skating Con indeed I made an assumption that there are more swimmer versus ice skater because of conditions around the world, but let's look at which is harder since you seem to have latched onto swimming as your main sport. Swimming is a non weight bearing activity in a medium that supports the body. Ice skating is certainly not this. In swimming you pulled down less by gravity therefore there is less strain on the body than there is in ice skating. Also the water supports the body via buoyant force where as the open air of the real world does not support hockey players. Ice skating is a mutli direction, mutli skilled, serial skilled sport. This requires many changes in body position, direction, stance, coordination, balance, explosive potential. Swimming is a continous skill, which requires speed in a single direction. Therefore you need a lot less athletic ability to be able to professionally swim. Also your max heart rate will be lower in the pool compared to that ice skating(due to the non weight bearing activity). Therefore swimming is great for injured pro athletes to their little water aerobics in but as far as athletic ability goes ice hockey players are far more superior to swimmers, hands down. Skill 2: Hand-Eye Coordination Hand-Eye coordination is involved in all sports to some extent, but ice hockey takes it to the extreme. In Soccer you need hand-eye coordination to kick the ball, in basketball you need hand-eye to catch the ball and shoot, in football you need hand-eye to catch and throw, and in baseball you need it to hit. Now let's look at these examples. Which one sticks out? Baseball! The only other sport in this list that is similar to ice hockey in anyway is baseball. How so? Because the bat acts an extension of the body, in all other sports the athletes have the luxury of actually using their body. So throw the other sports out. Now baseball you only need hand-eye coordination to hit, throw, and catch. In hockey you need much more hand-eye coordination to perform a more wide range of abilities like: blocking shots, passing(w/stick), shooting(w/stick), one-timers(look it up), receiving the pass(w/stick), catching the puck(when necessary)and especially goaltending. I can not stress how much more you use hand-eye in this one particular sport than you do in any other sport, which makes ice hockey harder than them all. -So what? One skill that you need more than any other sport, that doesn't make it most difficult. Skill 3: Balance Football, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey are the main sports that I can think of off that top of my head that involve using intense balance. But soccer and baseball involve far less contact than football and ice hockey, so we'll focus on these two. Football is a fast-paced sport that involves brute contact and is probably one of the more dangerous sports in the world, you definitely need balance in football in order to break tackles, tackle, and stay on your feet. Wait, did you say feet? Oh, yes I forgot you have the luxury of using your feet on solid ground. You see folks, in hockey, players do not have this luxury as they are practically balancing themselves on two swords while other 200-pound men are coming at them try to murder them on ICE. Football players do not need nearly as much balance as hockey players do because they are on their feet, which are considerably wider than a skate blade therefore they have more surface area to balance on the ground which has more friction than ice does. Meanwhile hockey players are doing virtually the same thing only they are on thin blades of steal, on a almost friction-less surface. In addition players need great balance to simple things like shoot and pass whereas balance is not nearly as crucial in the acts of catching and throwing in football. Therefore we can conclude hockey players need more balance than football players. Skill 4: It's A Team Game I will concede defeat here con this where difficulty can be the same. But let me quickly rattle of some sports than are not a team game. Tennis(singles), Extreme Sports of any kind, NASCAR, SWIMMING!, gymnastics, boxing, UFC Wrestling, Martial Arts, Rodeo, Running, Cycling, and Golf. So we can throw all these sports out of contention because they have the luxury of only relying on their own talents, and not the talents and abilities of others as well as their own. Skill 5: Durability Soccer, Basketball, and Hockey are the only sports in the same hemisphere when it comes to durability, because they are the only sports that are constantly moving while the game clock is counting down. It is said that by the end of a soccer game, a soccer player has run 11 miles. I dont have a stat like that for basketball or hockey but that is pretty damn impressive. This is the part of the argument where I will also concede that these sports are similar in the way that all involve running or skating back and forth, but this is where I will call your attention, people of debate.org to our list. All these skills are in hockey, but some of these skills barely apply to all sports, and if they do not to the extent that they do in hockey. Hockey is the most intense sport out there and it involves are far more great range of athletic ability than any other sport. According to ESPN, this is the list of most difficult sports. http://sports.espn.go.com... According to this article by ESPN, THE WORLD WIDE FREAKING LEADER IN SPORTS, boxing is harder by 1 point while hockey is in second and harder than football by a full 3. Now last I will destroy boxing to make sure you all know hockey is better than them all. First boxing has and is known to have fixed matches. So that hurts boxings credibility as the hardest sport right off the bat. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com... In addition boxing gains most of its points in the article in strength and power which I would assume boxing would have being a sport based on strength. Also boxing accumulates eight points in the nerve category which requires no athletic ability what so ever. Meanwhile hockey scores no lower than a 6 in any category except flexibility which I highly disagree with considering NHL netminders are some of the most flexible men on the planet. Conclusion: I have provided an article that shows hockey is the second hardest sport according to ESPN. I then took the number one ranked sport boxing and showed you that it is in indeed inferior to hockey and ESPN made a mistake in their order of one and two. In addition hockey is a team sport where boxing is not, making accomplishments in hockey far more challenging. I have also shown the readers that swimming is far easier than ice skating, making ice hockey a harder sport than swimming, which is con's prime sport. I also took several skills and broke them down to show that ice hockey utilizes those skills to a far great extent than any other sport and that ice hockey uses more of these athletic skills than other sports that only use one or two of the main skills. I would like to thank Con for the debate, it was fun, but remember readers ice hockey utilizes far more athletic ability than any other sport, as stated above, and to VOTE PRO!",

As Boston may be the biggest team in the league, but that does not give them any excuse to cheap shot anybody. Just because you get mad you do not have the right to hurt other player and potentially end their hockey careers. The Boston bruins players were squirting water bottles and starting fights. If your a thirteen year old then that's fine to do harmless things like that. But when its your job to keep your cool and to show respect to your opponents. I would also like to add that they cannot take what they're giving. Ever time that they would get hit. They'd act like every time that a hit happened on them, it was the dirtiest thing ever, but if the equivalent was to happen to the Canadians, its a clean hit everytime. And to put the cherry on top, Milan lucic cant even say good series to his opponents. He has to make threats to their life and get them worried about their life. I mean cmon.

            "premise": "Firstly, from what I notice in both games, hockey requires much more skill. It is much harder to control a small cylinder with a stick while wearing a lot of padding on skates than running while bouncing quite a big ball. Also, you need to use your entire body in hockey, sometimes you need to kick the puck, or catch it and lay it down. Also you need to score on a net that is almost completely covered by a goalie. Secondly it involves more teamwork. In hockey, you constantly pass the puck to your other team mates, while another team mate helps out by screening the goalie. When I watch basketball, All I see is people running around to get the ball, and once someone does, he just runs to the other side, takes a shot, and boom, 2 points instantly. Lastly, in hockey, you need to be physical, and be willing to lay down your body for the game. In hockey, you hit others for the puck, and you even lay down your body just to block the puck. In basket ball, if someone touches your arm while you shoot, it's a foul. Those are my points for now, I await your response.",

            "premise": "Bad ScienceIf the hockey stick is good science, then ice skating on Dutch canals and ice festivals on the Thames during the Little Ice Age must have been faked. The Hockey stick shows them to be impossible. Con acknowledged that natural phenomena play a role in climate change. However, the Hockey stick shows that nothing whatsoever has happened in climate for a thousand years, until humans caused global warming in the 20th century. It was bad science for Mann et al to conceal how the hockey stick was derived, claiming it was proprietary. That defeats peer review.The hockey stick analysis ended on what is now widely recognized as a temperature spike caused by an unusually strong El Nino event in the 1990s, which had nothing to do with CO2. Does the good science of the Hockey Stick cancel the obvious El Nino transient. Con points to Mann and his colleagues being able to continue to construct hockey stick graphs. Every confirming paper con sites included Mann as a coauthor. No doubt about it, they know how to make hockey sticks. For a small fee, I'll make a hockey stick out of climate data as well. The method is to write software that heavily over-weights anything that looks like a hockey stick and underweight everything hat doesn't. Statistical Analysis is an expert specialtyCon attacks McKitrick as being a professor in the Economics Department of his university, the University of Guelph in Canada. He specializes in environmental economics. Economics is probably closer to the field of statistics than climate science, but no matter, the analysis stands on its own. McKitrick was also a consulting expert in statistical analysis of mineral exploration data for validity. People trying to sell mining claims would use every statistical technique available to attempt to establish the value of a claim from limited assay data. McKitrick sorted valid claims from every bogus use of statistics in the book,.Statistical expertise is not tied to a particular discipline. It is certainly possible for Mann to have been an expert in statistics; it just turns out that he was not. A PhD in climate science may not require s much as a single course in statistics. As part of the Senate hearings, the scientists who provided peer review for the original Mann paper all acknowledged they lacked the expertise in statistics needed to review it properly. Wegman showed that Mann confined his work to a small group o like-mined associates and never subjected it to mainstream statistical expertise. [8. http://www.uoguelph.ca...] Con suggests that Wegman only objected to one minor point that had no effect on the conclusion. Here are some excerpts from the Senate expert panel's report: \u201cIn general, we found MBH98 and MBH99 to be somewhat obscure and incomplete and the criticisms of MM03/05a/05b to be valid and compelling. \u2026 It is not clear that Dr. Mann and his associates even realized that their methodology was faulty at the time of writing the MBH paper. The net effect of the decentering is to preferentially choose the so-called hockey stick shapes. \u2026 [paraphrasing here:] MBH method creates a PC1 statistic dominated by bristlecone and foxtail pine tree ring series (closely related species). However there is evidence in the literature, that the use of the bristlecone pine series as a temperature proxy may not be valid (suppressing \"warm period\" in the hockey stick handle); and that bristlecones do exhibit CO2-fertilized growth over the last 150 years (enhancing warming in the hockey stick blade). \u201c [9. http://en.wikipedia.org...] Wegman separately stated, \u201cWe explicitly looked at the first principle component of the North American Tree Ring series and demonstrated that the hockey stick shows up when the data are decentered, but not when properly centered.\u201d [8, http://www.uoguelph.ca...] Wegman explicily stated that the hockey stick was \"bad science.\" McKitrick's book article was not peer reviewed, but all the material was also published in Geophysical Research Letters in 2005, and was nominated as a journal highlight by the American Geophysical Union. The Mann Team Wegman showed that Mann confined his work to a small group o like-mined associates and never subjected it to mainstream statistical expertise. [8.] They review each others papers, defend the hockey stick, generate new hockey sticks, and work to prevent critics from being published. The group is defined primarily by observing the small universe of paper reviewers that comprise the group, but they also contribute to Mann's blog, work together on committees, and sometimes e-mail is published. In the Climategate scandal, e-mail among global warming advocates revealed that they worked to prevent publication of any papers contrary to their theory. [9. http://reason.com... ] That has undermined confidence in the peer review process. Mann and his associates have continued to rationalize their methods, but they are amateurs at statistical analysis compared to McKitrick and rank amateurs compared to Wegman. Additional hockey sticks are generated by the Team. These pretend to be independent, but they actually share the methodology of selecting and over-weighting data that looks like a hockey stick, and they share faulty tree ring data that produces the hockey sticks. [10. http://climateaudit.files.wordpress.com... ] The trees exhibiting the hockey stick were resampled ten years later, and the new grown did not show a continuation of the hockey stick and, even more surprisingly, Simple taken as little as six inches away on the twisted trees from those selected for hockey stick inclusion showed a different pattern. [10] The Mann rationalizations they are weasel-worded with claims that the MWP was not proved to be warmer than the present, as if that were the key issue at stake. No, the key issue was that the Hockey Stick incorrectly wiped out all natural variations in climate for the past thousand years, a claim disproved by paintings of the Dutch ice skating, never mind McKitrick. As far as I know, everyone in paleoclimatology agrees that the Holocene Optimum, about 4000 to 8000 years age, was warmer than the present. So whether the MWP was few tenths of degree warmer or cooler than the present isn't significant.. Another weasel-wording is to produce curves that are sort of U-shaped and say they confirm the Hockey Stick.The MWP Con claims the Harvard study verifying the existed other MWP has been discredited. Only in the minds of the Mann Team. Many others disagree: The conclusion of Soon & Baliunas? That the vast majority of published, peer-reviewed papers on the MWP conclude that it was both geographically widespread (not, as Warmists and their amen corner in Wikipedia like to pretend, a little local anomaly confined to Northern Europe) and significantly warmer than now. This irritates Michael Mann and his Hockey Team no end, for it contradicts their view that late 20th century warming is both unprecedented and catastrophic. So how do they respond? Do they counter it with new, learned papers demonstrating in closely illustrated detail just where Soon & Baliunas have got it wrong? Of course they don't! Instead, what they do is gang up to shoot the messenger. They conspire to have Climate Research closed down; to have Chris de Freitas sacked; then, they write to the head of his university in Auckland to see if they can't get de Freitas deprived of his living too. Nice! http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk... We are not dead from the exponential rise in temperatures the curve predicted. Instead temperatures have bounced around at about the same level. Bad methods make bad predictions which make bad science.",

            "premise": "1. Embellishment- In soccer there are many players who love to fake injuries, as you can tell from the video in my last argument. It is very rare to see that happen in hockey. When a player embellishes an injury they are given a penalty. Accuracy- Hockey players have better accuracy. Under NHL rules, the opening of the goal is 72 inches (6 ft ) wide by 48 inches (4ft ) tall. In soccer, the uprights are 8 yards, or 24 feet, apart and the lower edge of the crossbar is 8 feet above the ground. Now take the goalies and place them in the nets. In hockey you have a goalie at least 6 ft tall with pads on. That is covering almost every opening of the net. In soccer you have a goalie of about 5'11\" standing in a large net with many openings. However the average score in a soccer game is about 2 (depending on the team). In hockey the average score is about 4. Toughness - A recent ESPN study concluded that ice hockey is the most demanding team sport in the world. Durability is a quality that hockey players display perhaps, paradoxically, more than any other athletes. They play a sport that is more physically demanding than any other - 60 minutes in a confined area with no \"comfort zone\" out of bounds. Hockey is non stop action. Either you are rushing on a break, or hurrying back to get into your defensive zone. There is no time, especially in the NHL, where a player would really have the chance to catch their breath during a game. In hockey you are constantly moving your feet. There is no such thing as standing still while on the ice. Each period lasts is 20 minutes long and there are 3 periods in a game. There are only 2 intermissions which last about 15 minutes so they can clean the ice. Each game lasts about 2 1/2 to 2 hours.",

Also, I will save all my rebuttals and sources/references for the final round and I hope that my opponent saves her rebuttals for the final round as well. Argument #1: Longer Games In a NHL, Olympic or almost every type of Hockey game the time frame is 60 minutes for a regulation game. Where as in MLS game or Premier League soccer game the time frame for playing is 90 minutes. This is good for two main reasons: first, this longer game makes it more enjoyable for the fans because the action is longer lasting with the game being a hour and a half. As a watcher of both sports, I can tell you that watching a 90 minute game is more enjoyable then watching 60 minutes of sports. Second, this longer game makes the soccer players have to play a lot more, which increases the stamina, toughness and knowing when to pace yourself a lot better for the player of soccer. Argument #2: Hockey Players are weaker/ break times I will again split this argument into groups, but this time three. First: Shifts. In hockey, a player is not out there for more than 1 minute 30 seconds at a time. They have to frequently shift, which shows weakness and low stamina. The average soccer player plays for 45 minutes straight, or until half time. What a shift! Second: Total play time. Some soccer players play a full 90 minutes where as the average defensive player in hockey plays around 25 minutes a game, and the average forward around 20 minutes. Thirdly: Intermissions. Adding to them not being able to play much at one time, they also have intermissions 3 times a game so they can rest. Soccer players only need one intermission, and that is after playing for 45 minutes. Sorry about this round being oh so short, but next round should be longer. Also, Thank you to pensfan for this debate.",

Hockey players are able to take so much more punishment while they plan than Basketball players (slapshot to the face compared to a twisted ankle). Hockey requires more athletic ability in the specific categories of flexibility, balance, hand-eye coordination, and strength. Basketball only has a larger fan base than Hockey because of major broadcasting stations over-hyping the sport. Hockey is mainly superior to Basketball because of to excitement a goal provides, rather than Basketball where a basket happens nearly every minute of the game. As seen by all of these points, Hockey is a much better sport than Basketball. Again I thank Pro for this debate! Vote Con!!!!",

            "premise": "Indeed hockey could be considered a tougher sport in a few aspects, but that does not even pertain to much as which sport is better. Basketball is an American sport, where just about every player is an American. In hockey every player is a cross eyed Czechoslovakian or a Canadian inbred. A hockey player is very rarely american, therefore it is not much of an \"American\" sport. Most Americans view it in a similar way. According to an article in the NY Times 90% of Americans would rather play or watch a game of basketball. They have an excellent point because if you think about it, how many more basketball hoops exist in the United States over hockey rinks/arenas. Most people don't even know how to ice skate, so playing a game of hockey is pretty much out of the picture for them. That is unless you consider floor hockey the same which is a gay sport hands down. This clearly shows that hockey is not an American sport. If you were to say for example its a sport for Canadians mostly, then lets keep in mind that Canadians are the ones who believe curling is a sport. Why don't we keep the Canadians out of the picture.",

            "premise": "Sorry I was unable to complete the last few rounds because I was in the hospital. This is what I started writing for round two but I will restart the debate with PRO in a few days when I am back to normal.--- I would like to rebut a few of your points. I have also played baseball so I know where you are coming from with your arguments, but what I have trouble understanding is what is so challenging about baseball. I will reiterate later. 1. \"A pitcher needs to throw 90-100 mph pitches, so that he can strike out a player, or make it extremely difficult to hit a single, double, or triple. This requires a great amount of practice, arm strength, and speed, added in with an accurate throw. Also, realize that a pitcher must throw the ball into a relatively miniature box over the home plate.\" -- A baseball is 5 oz and is pitched between 80 and 100 mph and requires strength, speed and accuracy because the baseball needs to fit into a relatively small box over home plate. I agree with all of this, however, I feel that the objective of hockey players is similar, but more difficult. Like in baseball, a hockey puck is 5 and is shot between 80 and 100 mph, which requires strength, speed, and accuracy because the puck needs to fit into a very small space between the pads of the goalie and the posts of the net. I feel that this is more difficult because of the shot to goal ratio compared to the pitch to hit ratio in baseball. In hockey, the typical save percentage of a goalie is about .90 and the typical batting average in baseball is around .250-.350. The goalie save percentage shows the greater difficulty of scoring compared to the success of pitchers making strikes against the average batter. Simply, it is harder to put the puck where it needs to go compared to where the baseball needs to go. 2. \"Pitchers also need to learn various, special types of pitches and memorize them and use them effectively in a real game.\" --I feel that pitchers have a great deal of the pressure put on them for the outcome of the game. Their performance is what depicts the score. He picks the pitches, throws them, and is the one responsible for making the hitter guess at their pitches. However, I feel it is a weak argument that the learning and memorizing of the pitches makes his job that much more difficult. Knowing how to properly throw the ball is key to being a successful pitcher. Tim Lincecum is my favorite MLB pitcher right now, because he has such a large repertoire or different pitches. Just because Tim has learned the pitches doesn't mean that makes him successful. He knows how to throw and when to throw the pitches and also needs to know the context of the situation (for example, a successful pitcher needs to know what to pitch in a 0-2 count versus a 3-1 count and how the base runners shape his decision.) With all that being said, pitchers only make up 1/9th of the team on defense. I feel that the responsibility of the fielders is way less than the amount that is placed on the pitcher. I must disagree with some aspects of this point though. I feel that hockey players depend on each other more so than baseball players. Hockey players are constantly changing between playing offense and defense and need to be well versed in both. Typically in baseball, the pitchers are not good hitters, and thus are not great on offense. Hockey players need to have skill sets that make you good at both offense and defense. On a side note, I feel that baseball caters to the needs of the pitchers. In the American League, the pitchers don't even go up to bat. Instead, they have a designated hitter to fill in for him on offense. This is not true in the National League but some collegiate organizations have taken up this rule in some manner. Pinch-hitters, designated batters, and pinch runners are what change the game of baseball in a negative fashion because it allows for specialized substitutes instead of well rounded athletes who shouldn't be excused from the sport. Hockey does have a \"free substitution\" aspect to it, but I will give a few situations to drive my point home. Suppose Kirk Maltby of the Detroit Red Wings is tripped from behind on a break away, he deserves a penalty shot. Now, if the NHL played by the AL MLB rules, the Wings could pull a \"pinch break away\" and put Pavel Datsyuk in instead of Kirk Maltby because Datsyuk is much better at penalty shots. I feel that it would take away from the game of hockey to allow the specialized players to fill in whenever they were needed. Unfortunately, there are not that many chances for that to happen because there are considerably less stops in play for hockey compared to baseball. 3. \"In \"spring training,\" a period of time before the baseball season in which a player gets into extreme shape and increases his fitness level, players must work hard to develop upper body strength, leg speed, and accurate throws. This training is not easy at all.\" -- Fitness is very important in every sport. Baseball has \"spring training\" where baseball players train, however, the sport itself is less physically demanding than hockey. Hockey players that",

He specifically posed the possibility of a debate on the Hockey Stick of Mann et al. (1998 et seq.)I propose to argue against the proposition that \"The Hockey Stick is Bad Science\". My position will be that the so called Hockey Stick graph as originally developed in 1998 by Mann, Bradly and Hughes, further expanded by Jones et al in 1998 (see references below) and Mann et al in 1999 is \"good science\" in that it fufills the following criteria:1. It represents a legitimate analysis of temperature and paleotemperature data using appropriate statistical tools and proxies2. It was honestly undertaken3. Relying on the information available it shows significant warming in the recent past that can be reasonably assumed to be in support of the anthropogenic climate change hypothesisI will also ask that other studies be allowed in evidence (in that science always benefits from repeated analyses from different viewpoints).
