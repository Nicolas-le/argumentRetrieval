According to several databases, including canadavapes.com, Propylene Glycol is the primary ingredient in the majority of e-liquids and e-cigarette cartridges on the marketplace today. Most e-liquid contains at least 80% and as much as 92% propylene glycol. This is the ingredient that produces the smoke-like vapor when the e-cigarette is exhaled. You are correct in saying people have choices if they want to use products that are safe or unsafe, but it seems more applicable if people are educated in the product they choose to use. And being that I am a parent and a grandparent, I am more concerned about the availability of this product to the younger generation. The idea that vaping can promote cigarette smoking is not good news, especially to our youth.

            "premise": "Are they safer than tobacco? Or are they a high-tech way to hook a new generation on a bad nicotine habit? Nobody knows yet. Research into the effects of e-cigarettes lags behind their popularity. But ready or not, the era of e-cigarettes is here. It\"s a booming, billion-dollar industry -- on track to outsell tobacco products within a decade. The number of teens and tweens using these products doubled between 2011 and 2012. The time to get informed about these products is now. So far, evidence suggests that e-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes. The biggest danger from tobacco is the smoke, and e-cigarettes don't burn. Tests show the levels of dangerous chemicals they give off are a fraction of what you'd get from a real cigarette. But what's in them can vary. \"E-cigarettes may be less harmful than cigarettes,\" Drummond says. \"But we still don't know enough about their long-term risks or the effects of secondhand exposure.\" E-cigarettes have triggered a fierce debate among health experts who share the same goal -- reducing the disease and death caused by tobacco. But they disagree about whether e-cigarettes make the problem better or worse. Opponents say that because nicotine is addictive, e-cigarettes could be a \"gateway drug,\" leading nonsmokers and kids to use tobacco. They also worry that manufacturers -- with huge advertising budgets and celebrity endorsements -- could make smoking popular again. That would roll back decades of progress in getting people to quit or never start smoking. Others look at possible benefits for smokers. \"Obviously, it would be best if smokers could quit completely,\" says Michael Siegel, MD, MPH, a professor at Boston University's School of Public Health. \"But if that's not possible, I think they'd be a lot better off with e-cigarettes. They're a safer alternative.\" Siegel compares replacing tobacco with e-cigarettes to heroin users switching to the painkiller methadone. The replacement may have its own risks, but it's safer. Some supporters believe that e-cigarettes could help people quit, just like nicotine gum. Research hasn't shown that yet, though. But there is no hard evidence that they are harmful OR safe. http://www.webmd.com...",

You claim that the e-cigarette \"juice\" is safe, do you have data to back up that statement? If so, I would urge you to give some concrete evidence.

            "premise": "The FDA is actually proposing extending its authority to cover additional products that meet the definition of a tobacco product under the proposed rule: Tobacco Products Deemed To Be Subject to the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. Currently FDA regulates cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco. Proposed newly \"deemed\" products would include electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, certain dissolvables that are not \"smokeless tobacco,\" gels, and waterpipe tobacco. The definition of a \"tobacco product\" according to the FDA is any product \"made or derived from tobacco\" that is not a \"drug,\" \"device,\" or \"combination product\" (except for accessories of deemed tobacco products). Examples of tobacco products include; hookah, e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, novel tobacco products, and tobacco products that may be developed in the future. To read this definition for yourself go to http://www.fda.gov... (It is on page 7 of the document.) Nicotine overdose has increased in not just adults, but also children. CNN did a story on this. In February there were 215 poison center calls involving e-cigarettes which is an huge increase from one per month in September 2010. The sad thing is 51% of those calls involved children 5 and under. http://www.cnn.com... E-cigarettes fall under the definition of a tobacco product according to the FDA. Manny of the E-cigarette devices contain nicotine the drug found in tobacco along with other substances and some have been found to contain carcinogens. There is not enough evidence to support that these devices are safe for those exposed to them and therefore should be categorized the same as any cigarette.

            "premise": "I'll start by highlighting why nicotine is a beneficial component of e-cigarettes and then finish with reasons why e-cigarettes are a healthier 'alternative' than marijuana. But first I will point out that young people are susceptible to copying most things they see older people doing regardless of what it is. Also the fact that e-cigarettes are not subject to tobacco laws doesn't really do much in terms of preventing young people from getting them. If a child or teenager wants something they'll find a way to get it. The large amount of underage smokers and drinkers in the US and UK would be an example of this. It's natural that an e-cigarette would contain nicotine; they're tailored towards smokers. The vast majority of e-cigarette users are either former cigarette smokers or people who are trying to quit smoking; in addition there is little evidence to suggest that non-smokers take up e-cigarettes. Now, if a tobacco smoker were to attempt using marijuana as an alternative there is a relatively high chance that they would relapse back to smoking tobacco once again. A tobacco smoker may not even give up tobacco even if they were to begin smoking marijuana thus becoming a \"dual user\" i.e. they would smoke both tobacco and marijuana. The latter point in itself would defeat the object of marijuana being used as an alternative (since the negative effects of the tobacco smoke would negate any positive effects marijuana presents). On the other hand, if a tobacco smoker were to attempt using e-cigarettes as an alternative the chances of a relapse are relatively low. A study showed that among former smokers who were regular used e-cigarettes, only 6% relapsed back to tobacco after a year. More importantly, among the \"dual users\", an amazing 46% quit smoking after a year. So actually it's the fact that e-cigarettes contain nicotine that makes it a healthier alternative than marijuana. This is because switching to a non-nicotine alternative would most likely lead to nicotine withdrawal and the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal include a series of negative effects: - feeling irritable - feeling or being aggressive - dysphoria - restlessness - poor concentration - increased appetite - weight gain - urges or cravings to smoke - night-time awakenings/sleep disturbance - decreased heart rate Thus by using e-cigarettes one still receives their 'nicotine fix' without the added negative effects that comes with tobacco smoke. A final point is to address the fact that nicotine is not a carcinogen. This means that it does not cause cancer. So the chances of a person acquiring cancer, of any sort, from smoking an e-cigarette would be the same, if not less, than smoking marijuana.

Let's start out with how E-cigarettes are dangerous and finish with how Marijuana is not. I will use the fourth round to add further points. I would also prefer if my opponent used round 5 to recap and please not use new arguments. E-cigarettes were introduced into the United States in 2007 after being created by a company is china. They are similar to regular cigarettes in terms of appearance. The e-cigarette uses a mechanism to heat up liquid nicotine which is then transformed into vapor and inhaled and exhaled by the user. Health experts agree, they may pose a serious threat to the the user of the device and the public. I will list and explain various ways that this is true. Health experts also agree they need to be tested and researched more to be deemed safe or unsafe to our health. Possibly the worst of the e-cigarette concept is that they are not subject to tobacco laws because they contain to tobacco. Meaning that they can be purchased with identification proof and can be purchased easily, particularly on the Internet. Meaning youngsters who have acquired enough knowledge to know that e-cigarettes are purchasable online might order one for themselves and keep it. These devices also come in Flavors: Chocolate, caramel, strawberry even bubblegum! Celebrities also use them which may attract children also. A couple examples are Johnny Depp and David Letterman. Katherine Heitgl even used one on a talk show and explained the to the audience! You are probably inquiring what is wrong with something like this? Well, I will get to that in a moment. The reason e-cigarettes are popular among 'former smokers' is because they contain nicotine. An addictive drug found in all tobacco cigarettes. This addictive drug is placed in products like e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes so people do become addicted and remain buying the specified product. This product may even contain MORE nicotine than a tobacco cigarette. Yes, more. Also manufacturers continue to deny testing from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Ushering us towards a more dreadful conclusion. Countries have realized the health risks and have banned them from the country entirely and/or made them lllegal. Examples are: Australia, Canada, Israel and Mexico. The FDA also claims that second vapor can cause some serious health hazards. Individuals have claimed that the vapor burns their eyes, nose and throat. Especially those with health problems and the elderly. These E-cigarettes and also cause damage to the wind-pipe. Scientists from Athens, Greece noticed the problem also. A test was done on 32 individuals that volunteered to do so, 8 of which have never smoked before. They were given E-cigarettes and asked to use them for 10 minutes. These are the Results. -Non-Smokers -raised airway resistance by 206% to 182% Which experts quoted was a significant increase. -Current and regular smokers -suffered a 220% to 176% increase in airway resistance. -Asthma patients -found no increase. Now I will explain the health benefits behind Marijuana. I will begin with a very truthful quote by The Economist. \"If Marijuana were unknown, it's discovery would no doubt be hailed as a medical breakthrough. Scientists would hail it's potential for treating everything form pain to cancer and marvel in rich pharmacopoeia; many of whose chemicals mimic vital molecules in the human body. before I begin I would like my opponent and the voters to watch this video it is very brief and contains a lot of information. www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mlfvklejuw Now with that in mind I will begin my statement on how marijuana has health benefits. Due to the fact that marijuana does not contain nicotine smokers of the product tend to smoke less because of the lack of the addictive drug. Marijuana also contains THC, a bronchial dilator, meaning it opens up the wind-pipe and lungs excreting dirt and other harmful membranes trapped inside the body. There has been absolutely no cancer resulting from the use of marijuana. Not even a death associated with the herb. There are also health benefits in the cannabis plant (basically marijuana). Like how earlier represented in the video link I posted that it can reduce the risk of cancer. The Journal of the American Medical association tested 5,000 individuals between ages 18-30 years old that used marijuana regularly.\"Had no discernible lung impairment in lung activity from non-smokers.\" There was also a test conducted at Harvard! It revealed the active ingredient in marijuana cute tumor growth in common lung cancer in half and significantly reduces the ability for cancer to spread.

Here we have to see that the businesses should have the right to naturally choose who to cater to and what group of people to serve to, before you go out and go on a tangent with illegal things, let's look at the status quo. Though many places do not need the law to ban smoking in their restraunts. Those that do not chose to do so to allow those who smoke eat and smoke at the same time. We have strip bars legal in the US, but do we require everyone to go to the strip club and see what they have \"on the menu.\" The answer is no, we also do not do the opposite. We do not go into these bars and mandate that they cannot strip nor do we mandate that they get rid of the \"entertainment\" to protect the \"common good.\" My opponent's stance declares that we should enforce the government's banning onto many other people's moral's and habbits. I mean let's observe this again with another example. The US has an obesity epidemic, but yet do we go around and lock people's refridgerators or state when they can and cannot eat? The answer is no, so if we cannot outlaw something like fast food or strip clubs under the same argument that you are clammering for here there is no reason for criminalisation of tabacco in order to get rid of smoking. Outlawing this industry would have immidiate economic impact. The Cigarette Companies make a toatl of $346 billion per year. [1] They have a total of 1.6 million jobs and a lot of the tobacco farmers, 136,000 farmers are entirely dependent on it's legalization. [2] We can thus see that if we push for the industry to be illegal we will see a massive amount of Americans join the unemployment lines and prices of other goods will go up. The reason behind this, as I have previously shown, 136,000 farmers out there use tobacco as their cash crop, but also grow a great deal of other things. If this resolution passes we will see a rise in food prices in result of this industry closing. We can see that tabacco is only 3% of the tabacco farmer's production while it amounts to 71% of their profit. They use way over double that to produce food products while 21% is a woodlen. [3] From 1950 to 2000 we can actually have seen that the tabacco industry's employment has decreased 16% each year due to the anti-tobacco ads causing a great deal of unemployment that has already devestated the economy. [4] Now if we compare Tobacco sales to national income from 1970 we can see that as the US wages have increased by 150% as Tobacco sales have actually decreased by $2-3 billion, note that this is adjusted for inflation. [5] Note that this was from the Contention 2: Benefits of SmokingYes you heard me right, benefits. There are several benefits here that actually help people when you smoke tobacco here. In 2007, Harvard released a study showing that smoking actually reduces the risk of Parkison's Disease. Parkinson's costs the average American $25 billion per year and hurts the economy due to worker's that would normally work until their 60s go out of work 20 years eariler and not only does this hurt the individual, but the overal American economy as well. [6] Next is obseity as I spoke about in my last contention. We all know that tobacco is a hunger representant and it also makes people more disgusted by food. This was why it was so big in colonial America as it helped people survive more because of it. [7] The obeseity rates are horrific. It costs the US over $190 billion per year which is 23% of all medical spending in the US. This is something that needs to be addressed. The next one is a biggie, reduces death risk after a heart attack. We can actually see that smoker's who have heart attacks tend to have a lower risk of death than those who don't. The reason behind this is that the smoking actually helps remove plaque from the atteries. The same can be done to a non-smoker, but this has to be done with balloons which is more ineffective and can even increase the risk for death. National Institute of Health mathematician Rosalind Marimont and Robert Levy have found that smoking death studies tend to neglect other factors like poor diet and excersize and have found that the numbers are inflated by 65%. [8] There are many things that they exclude. Let's look at some other smoking facts, they found that, \"Sure, these plant chemicals are measured in infinitesimal amounts. An independent study calculated 222,000 smoking cigarettes would be needed to reach unacceptable levels of benzo(a)pyrene. One million smoking cigarettes would be needed to produce unacceptable levels of toluene. To reach these estimated danger levels, the cigarettes must be smoked simultaneously and completely in a sealed 20-square-foot room with a nine-foot ceiling. Many other chemicals in tobacco smoke can also be found in normal diets. Smoking 3,000 packages of cigarettes would supply the same amount of arsenic as a nutritious 200 gram serving of sole. Half a bottle of now healthy wine can supply 32 times the amount of lead as one pack of cigarettes. The same amount of cadmium obtained from smoking eight packs of cigarettes can be enjoyed in half a pound of crab.\" [8] So here we can see that smoking isn't as dangerous as expected and if you want to ban smoking then you need to go after these more dangerous things that are found in our everyday diet first.Contention 3: Tobacco-like alternativesMy opponent gives this resolution, but he fails to observe that there are \"healthier\" alternatives to smoking that are still tobacco like. The Sweeds use a smokeless tobacco called snus. The Sweeds have found it to not have a link between it and cancer. Not to mention that one using snus saves you $582 per year. [9] This product contains no niccotine and has seen a 20% smoking and snus usage decrease as a result. We can easily see that this is one way to eventually ween a nation off of tobacco as Pro like's and it's more economically feasiable. The next key alternative with tobacco is that of Electronic Cigarrettes, AKA E cigs/E cigarrettes. These have been shown to decrease smoking rates by 81% of users. Not to mention that this is a lot cheaper than a pack of cigarettes as a single E cigarette costs $40 while a pack of cigarettes is about $4. In 10 packs the E cig has paid for itself.Sources 1.

            "conclusion": "should cigarettes be displayed for sale.",
            "premise": "Did you know that Most stores that sell cigarettes place them on counters between things kids like....candy, pretzels, and chips. Why do you suppose they do that???? Because tobacco companies pay them A LOT of money to keep cigarettes there. The tobacco industry tricks kids into thinking that smoking is \"cool\" through their advertising, promotions, sponsorships of sporting events, and by paying to get their brands of cigarettes to appear in the movies. But tricking kids is only part of the story. Another important part of their plan is to make it easy for kids to get cigarettes. They know that about 90% of the adults who smoke started before the age of 18. So they realize that if they are going to hook new customers, they have to do it when they are young. So what better way to get them hooked than by first making kids think smoking is \"cool\", then making it easy for them to get tobacco products? One way that they make it easy for kids to get cigarettes is through self-service displays (cigarettes that are on or in front of the counter.) They pay stores a lot of money to keep them there! This is one way that they spend over 16 million a day on advertising and promotions. Why do they feel it's worth it? Because it works at getting cigarettes into the hands of children. Children learn to group things that belong together at an early age. Do you remember when you were little, teachers had you match objects? You know, things like a raincoat, an umbrella, and boots. The tobacco companies know that kids make associations. When they pay stores to display cigarettes, candy, and chips next to each other on counters, they are sending a strong message to children. They are telling kids that cigarettes are in the same class as the food they like to eat, so kids think cigarettes are safe. People who run the tobacco companies are pretty clever, aren't they? They start tricking us when we are very young. Self service displays, besides being a \"point of sale advertisement,\" not only trick children into thinking that tobacco products are safe, they also provide an easy way for children to get them. The young can easily get their hands on tobacco products when they are on or in front of the counter. Many stores, like WaWa put candy or other items children like near the cigarettes. (At Easter WaWa placed Easter candy and coloring books on top of a large end cap display.Children wanting the candy and books had to reach over rows of cigarettes packs to get them!) It seems natural for children to hang around aisles in stores where there's candy or toys, so clerks don't pay attention to them. In addition, store clerks are often too busy waiting on customers to watch these displays. To make matters worse, the tobacco companies often package cigarettes with items that are attractive to kids; key chains, cameras, brightly colored pens...... The industry encourages children to shoplift cigarettes to get what is packaged with them. Once outside the store, they are tempted to try the cigarettes, or they give them to their friends. Cigarettes cost pennies to make. If kids initially get addicted by shoplifting, the industry knows they'll have lifelong paying customers. What a great investment for the industry! Self service displays should be banned because: They send the wrong message to children. The cigarettes are placed between things like candy and pretzels. By association, children think cigarettes are as safe as the food they eat. They provide easy access. Children are able to shoplift cigarettes, because the displays can not be monitored by busy clerks. Children are more likely to be sold cigarettes from self service displays than form those displayed behind the counter, and to conclude i will repeat Self service displays should be banned because: They send the wrong message to children. The cigarettes are placed between things like candy and pretzels. By association, children think cigarettes are as safe as the food they eat. They provide easy access. Children are able to shoplift cigarettes, because the displays can not be monitored by busy clerks.

I would like to scope this argument to the entirety of Australia, and define the topic as a complete ban of cigarettes. Meaning all use and possession of cigarettes will result in a heavy fine and possible community service and jail time. As the negative speaker I strongly disagree with this and believe that cigarettes should not receive a complete ban from society. I also believe that the effects of a complete ban of cigarettes will increase the level of crime in Australia, as well as create an additional struggle on the economy from the importation of the substance. The complete ban of cigarettes also will create another band of drug crime, and the illegal manufacturing of cigarettes will become unsafe as no standard amounts of nicotine or other chemicals will be controlled by regulations, such occurrences have repeatedly been recorded across other drug crime including that of cannabis and illegally manufactured supplements. However I believe that cigarettes should become more controlled in the factory process and use of cigarettes. This means there will be increased government promotion of e-cigarettes as a temporary alternative, and the ban of the use of cigarettes in all public places, as well as an increase taxation and a differing, safer formula in smokes overtime. I also believe that the job is not to completely ban cigarettes, but instead change and regulate the manufacturing process so a decrease in harmful substances and nicotine in each cigarette to create a controlled smoking environment that will assist in the deduction of smokers. I also feel those whom have placed 'cigarette user' on their medical records should receive an increase in mandatory checkups to maintain knowledge of possible diseases and to advertise counseling for cigarette users. I agree that cigarettes are an unhealthy way of life that circulates through families as a part of society, but I also believe that banning of dangerous substances in the past has led to an increase in long term effects and a complete, immediate ban is not a safe option. Cigarettes should not receive an complete, immediate ban from society. Thank you.",

            "premise": "Thanks to Pro for instigating this debate.Framework Per typical policy debate protocol, Pro will have the sole burden of proof because he is advocating for an alteration in the status quo, as cigarattes are currently legal. RebuttalsPro's argument is as follows: P1) Cigarettes are unhealthy P2) Things that are unhealthy ought to be illegalC1) Therefore, cigarettes ought to be illegal I don't contest P1, as almost anything can in fact be unhealthy if used excessively, and undeniably there is a link between cigarettes and cancers. I do, however, contest P2. As I noted, virtually anything can be unhealthy -- alcohol, excessive meat consumption, sugar cubes, you name it -- but this doesn't necessarily translate into justification for a ban. Moreover, Pro has done nothing more than make an \"is\" statement when our resolution requires that he make an \"ought\" statement. Consequently, he must not only be able to demonstrate that cigarettes are unhealthy, a point which I don't contest, but how this culminates in a case for illegalizing them. As Pro has offered no further argumentation, including no sources, I am now going to offer several constructive arguments. Note that this beyond my burden of proof. Negative Case I. Self-Ownership Principle Via Murray Rothbard: \"The right to self-ownership asserts the absolute right of each man, by virtue of his (or her) being a human being, to \u201cown\u201d his or her own body; that is, to control that body free of coercive interference. Since each individual must think, learn, value, and choose his or her ends and means in order to survive and flourish, the right to self-ownership gives man the right to perform these vital activities without being hampered and restricted by coercive molestation\" [1].This principle, which asserts a natural right to dominion over our own bodies, is important for several reasons. First, if we rightfully own ourselves, meaning that we are free from the coercion which would result from someone else owning or exercising constraint on us, we have the liberty to choose what goes into our bodies. Second, it treats people as fundamentally, intrinsicly valuable individuals capable of deciding for themselves whether it is best to engage in potentially harmful activites, such as smoking. Therefore, the government has no business in prohibiting substances in spite of whether or not it deems them to be dangerous.II. Black MarketThere are a number of severe trade-offs in illegalizing cigarettes. For one, it would not erase the existent demand for cigarettes. Instead, it would drive people to black markets, which would be more dangerous and more violent by virtue of the fact that they're completely unregulated. In fact, black markets for cigarettes already exist. \"Black-market cigarettes are costing many states hundreds of millions of dollars a year in lost tax revenue. And the lucrative, illicit trade is attracting violent criminal gangs that can be lethally ruthless.Across the nation, organized crime groups with ties to Vietnam, Russia, Korea and China are all competing for a share of the profits, says Edgar Domenech, who leads the Washington, D.C., field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives...Criminals buy cigarettes in bulk, in states with relatively low taxes such as Virginia or North Carolina. They load the cigarettes into tractor-trailers or rented trucks and drive them north, for example, to New York. They follow the same routes they would use to traffic illegal drugs...Because of high taxes in the city, selling contraband cigarettes at rates even slightly lower than their value in the store can mean big money for criminals.Fairfax County's Wilson says cigarettes are in some cases worth more money to criminals than illegal drugs. Undercover officers, he says, have 'even been able to trade large amounts of illicit drugs for the cigarettes.' For instance, the ATF and Virginia police broke up a smuggling ring last winter where traffickers traded cocaine, thousands of Ecstacy tablets and firearms for nearly 400,000 cartons of cigarettes. The cigarettes were worth more than $8 million on the black market\" [2].Pro's proposal only deals wth legality. It will not prevent people from using cigarettes nor will it remove the incentive for people to sell them for profit. In fact, cigarettes will be even more dangerous because, upon illegality, the government will have no mechanism by which to regulate them. Moreover, this may even result, as has been the case with alcohol, people refusing to self-report their illness or those of others after having used cigarettes out of fear either of being looked down upon for usage or of incarceration. III. Victimless crimeProhibiting cigarettes would require placing people in jail for substance ingestion, in spite of the fact that doing so does not impose a harm on anyone else sans the person opting to smoke. Via the self-ownership principle I delineated earlier, this is perfectly permissible. Moreover, the costs of incarcerating people, most of whom will be using cigarettes which happen to be highly addictive and thus in need of medical assistance [3], will far outweigh any of the benefits Pro outlines, especially in light of the resulting black market. IV. Economic Effects Prohibiting cigarettes would necessarily lead to displacement and unemployment, which would have dire economic consequences at a time when the economy is still in rough shape from the worst downturn since the Depression of the 30s. \"According to The Tobacco Atlas, estimates of revenues from the global tobacco industry likely approach a half trillion U.S. dollars annually. In 2010, the combined profits of the six leading tobacco companies was U.S. $35.1 billion, equal to the combined profits of Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and McDonald\u2019s in the same year. If Big Tobacco were a country, it would have a gross domestic product (GDP) of countries like Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and Venezuela\" [4].Moreover, it would remove the significant amount of tax revenue from cigarette sales -- about $17.65 billion in 2011 [5] -- and, by virtue of causing unemployment, increase government outlays on automatic stabilizers such as food stamps and welfare. At a time when the federal deficit is quite high -- $649 billion in fiscal year 2014 [6] -- this is not the time to significantly increase the burden on government expenditures. It may even cause rationing of current government funds, meaning that some people will be necesarily hurt. The point is that there are spillover effects of making cigarrettes illegal.V. Lack of Public SupportSince we live in a democracy, it is necessary that, for a law to be passed, the public should support that law. However, the vast majority of Americans do not approve of a ban on cigarretes. \"Given Americans' apparent reluctance to endorse increased government regulation of tobacco, it probably comes as no surprise that only a very small minority favor an outright ban on smoking in the United States. The poll finds just 17% of Americans saying smoking should be made \"totally illegal\" in this country. Gallup has never found widespread support for a universal smoking ban, ranging from 11% to the current 17%, since 1990\" [7].VI. Congressional GridlockThe current Congress is on track to be the least productive in history, with policymakers unable to agree on important legislation -- on issues that impact our daily lives such as taxing and spending policy [8]. Pro's proposal would necessarily exacerbate this not only by introducing into the fray a proposal that the vast majority of Americans support and that the tobacco industry would spend millions or even billions of dollars to actively oppose, but also by diverting their attention from issues that actually matter. There is an opportunity cost of time, and debating an issue such as this which is significantly less important than, say, the debt ceiling or the next budget, is futile and counter-productive.[1] - http://utahliberty.org...

As you can see in my first Contention, I explained why cars could be seen as a hazard to the people around you. It is the same principal with cigarettes. Also, obesity destroys families, and people get obese because they eat to much fast food, should we ban fast food? Contention 2:Lets take a look at \"why\" we are actually banning cigarettes. Cigarettes release very poisons smoke that can cause some serious health problems. However, cigarettes are comprised of multiple different ingredients, such as:- Arsenic- Tar- Carbon Monoxide (Fuel)- Battery Acid- Candle Waxand- MethaneIf you are going to ban cigarettes, you would have to ban all of these ingredients from the market as well. Don't ban cigarettes, ban some of the ingredients, within them? Same as banning sugar in schools, they wouldn't get rid of Apple Sauce completely, they would create Apple Sauce but with no sugar. So, instead of banning cigarettes, why not freely distribute electronic cigarettes, for everyone who has a problem with smoking? E-cigs help people quite smoking. Why not give them out in schools? Why not give them out at Walt-Mart? Because, smoking is bad, everything is mostly bad, and to take away smoking, because it is bad, is not a good reason. List of things that are bad:- Fast Food- Soda- Obama- SwearingIf we were to ban things because they were bad, or they could potentially harm others, then we would have to ban all of the things listed above.

Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said: \"It's vital we get across the message to children that smoking is bad. If that means stripping out vending machines or removing cigarettes from behind the counter, I'm willing to do that.\" the fact of influencing children is another major for the ban of cigarettes being displayed. She added: \"Children who smoke are putting their lives at risk and are more likely to die of cancer than people who start smoking later.\" Measures that make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches are also being considered. Children who are confronted with cigarettes in their local shops are more than likely to pick up the habit of this kind of behavior being ok, thus leading to youth smokers in our community. tell me do you want your child to suffer? than banning the display of cigarettes should be a major priority for the government.",

I also think we would be much better off if they weren't invented. The problem is that many people are already addicted to cigarettes. If we impose a ban, that would not stop many people. Smoking is similar, in my opinion, to certain mental health problems. I say this because many people cannot overcome their habit of smoking without seeking other people's help. Throwing them in jail for buying cigarettes won't help because it won't stop their addiction. Their brain is addicted to cigarettes, and jail won't stop the addiction. The addiction can be stopped, on the other hand, by letting the addicts decide that they need help to stop smoking and that they need to go to someone like a specialist to stop their addiction. Forcing them to go to jail will not help. Eventually, I hope that we can eliminate smoking, but I don't think it would be a good idea now because of how many people are still addicted to cigarettes. During the Prohibition, many people disregarded the alcohol ban and the ban actually resulted in many bad things for the country. Some of the same effects could happen with smoking.

            "premise": "Every week there is always something we learn about either by reading or listening to about how bad something is bad for us actually has beneficial health effects. They say coffee, then pizza - and every other day it's red wine and of course the smoking. I ask myself is this really something that is true? We can always find something wrong with everything if we dig and do enough research on it. Why is it that smoking is one that Pro and others emphasize on even when its stated as a fact that coffee is just as bad? Well the answer is: that depends how you interpret the facts. Pro still is geared towards the health and well being of others by stating facts of how much smokers smoke ie; the average, chain etc\u2026. It's been said by physicians and they'll tell you there are few things you can put in your mouth that are worse for you than a cigarette. By smoking does help the obesity issue which we have now a day's especially in children. This is a health issue as well which are commonly more so than ever in kids from their parent's lack of direction. This is one example of major health issues to come at an earlier age. So as adults if we have the choice to smoke that's our choice and we should not look down at for that. There are many people who never smoked and have cancer and died at young ages. So while smoking isn't all that bad we is it ok to support the obesity issue which is just as equal if not worse than smoking? Drug companies are already researching drugs with nicotine in to help these conditions removed from cigarette smoking and the first one has hit the market. The answer to that is the E-Cig. There is still nicotine in the cigarette but has been much more accepted in the world. Why, because, it does remove the bad smells, second-hand smoke, or cancer causing chemicals. World renown doctor, Dr. Panariello even suggested that while utilizing the electronic cigarette, there is virtually no risk of getting cancer. These conclusions come from studies which show that nicotine is about as equally harmful to your health as caffeine. So knowing this why is the coffee so much more acceptable everywhere. We can still smoke with this electronic cigarette now in airports, restaurants, bars, work place, homes etc\u2026 some benefits for this is as follows: \u2022No tar, tobacco, carbon monoxide, or ash. \u2022Get the same amount of nicotine as a regular cigarette. \u2022Each cartridge costs less than $2 and is equivalent to an entire pack of cigarettes. \u2022You can save over $1,000 each year. \u2022You won't \"smell\" like a smoker any longer. \u2022Different flavors are available. \u2022No more second-hand smoke In my conclusion the Pro should stop judging smokers.

            "premise": "As both of us agreed, children do suffer from a second-hand smoking. 6,8 children of the US population have already gotten asthma and yes, we do not know the causes of asthma in every particular case and yes, most of those children might not developed it by second-hand smoking. Yet asthma attack is not the lightest of asthma symptoms, it is a complete opposite. People, who are having asthma attack, feel difficulty of breathing, wheezing and coughing. A neck and chest muscles are tightened, person cannot talk, he is panicking and anxious. Daily, asthma attacks take lives of nine Americans. Moreover, in average 3285 deaths are caused by asthma per year. Yes, this illness is not the main topic right now; hence, second-hand smoking puts its part into making people\"s future unclear: no one knows how asthmatics will handle being in public and having an asthma attack as a result of someone smoking near them, because every asthma attack requires immediate medical help. Your second argument was banning smoking in public places will infringe private property rights. I can slightly agree on that point. However, smoking in public approaches the line of infringing the World Health Organization Constitution\"s point of having \"\"the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being.\" Simply saying, very human being has rights on being healthy. Smoking in public places will damage human\"s health. Therefore, it has to be banned. Special smoking places should be built in order to satisfy smokers\" needs, because no one can say a word about someone\"s decision to smoke as soon as person is old enough to do that. Yet smoking in public places, especially indoors, has to be forbidden. Taking a step back to the teen smoking, you understood one of my rhetorical questions in a reversed way. Shooting oneself does not mean that teenagers, who smoke, want to kill themselves. By following your logic, everyone, who smokes, simply wants to die, what is not true and both of us can agree on that. Comparing a bullet to a cigarette was the way to make statements \"smoking kills\" and \"smoking leads to premature death\" even more clear. \"Teens are less influenced now than ever to smoke cigarettes.\" It might be a result of restricting smoking and tobacco consumption age in several states. A purchase of tobacco products is illegal for everyone, who is under-aged, who is not 18 years old yet. In some states, it is legal to smoke even though person is not 18 years old. Their sense of \"responsibility\" is taking over and most of the teenagers start to smoke by being provocatively influenced. Electronic cigarettes, as a suggestion to decrease air-pollutions caused by cigarettes, is a good solution. Nevertheless, there are things about e-cigarettes that are also dangerous for our environment that you could not think about at the first place. Going a bit in-depth, there are two types of electronic cigarettes: rechargeable and non-reusable e-cigarettes. Non-reusable cigarettes do not cause a lot of waste as they have been thrown away; some of their part might be reused as something else made of metal. Unfortunately, smokers, who decided to switch to e-cigarettes, would not choose non-reusable electrical cigarettes because it would be costly for them: in average, these e-cigarettes last only for 300 to 400 puffs, which is not a lot for a daily-smoker. Why is not the other type of e-cigarettes better than normal cigarettes? Rechargeable cigarettes contain a small batteries, that could not been thrown away, they are harmful for the environment as any other batteries. All batteries contain toxic chemicals that cause damage for the environment. Second con of rechargeable e-cigarettes is their electricity consumption. According to The World Bank (IBRD and IDA), 83,6 percent of American\"s total electricity consumption is produced by burning fossil fuels. If all 40 million people, who smoke in the United States, did prefer to smoke electronic cigarettes over traditional cigarettes and their choice was be buying rechargeable cigarettes, they would be in need of electricity. As we know, burning fossil fuels causes bigger problems: greenhouse effect, acid rains, etc. Electronic cigarettes demand electricity to recharge; therefore, more pollutions in the atmosphere and our world is going to be contaminated. Of course, there are many advantages of e-cigarettes, as you mentioned: they help people cut down on smoking or quit doing it completely, they do not litter, if not thrown on the ground on purpose. However, it had to be mentioned, that there are cases of the electronic cigarettes\" explosions. The e-cigarettes are devices, which sometimes refuse to work and requires care. Negligent use of the e-cigarettes might lead to their explosion and following injuries after it. For example, CNN\"s report was dedicated to the e-cigarette explosion in costumer\"s pocket on the local gas station on February 25th year 2016 in Owensboro, Kentucky. \"Big fire, and he was burning,\" Jassie Singh, who was working the register at the time.(1 ) Man left with the third-degree burns all over his leg. Other incidents, mentioned in the same report, are spontaneous electronic cigarettes explosions, which leaded to man\"s hospitalization and 3-years-old child\"s first- and second-degree burns. These accidents are concrete examples of e-cigarettes being dangerous. The explosions may happen in public, where they will harm not only an owner of an e-cigarette, but also people around him/her. My conclusion is, problem of smoking has always been present and restricting the law by banning smoking in public places will be a small step to solving the problem in general. The United States is ranked as 51st country in a list of cigarettes consumption per adult per year, what is equal to 1,028 cigarettes. Hopefully, smoking ban in public would decrease this number and American will become a country of a dream for everyone.

To briefly restate my argument, saying \"cigarettes are addictive\" is inaccurate. The nicotine is the addictive ingredient in the big name cigarettes, but not all cigarettes contain nicotine. Therefore; If not all cigarettes have addictive qualities, making the statement that \"cigarettes are addictive\" is just simply not true. That would be like me saying \"only fish live in the water\". I'm not going to sit here and explain how a dolphin is not a fish. But you get what I'm saying.

            "premise": "Why the scenario in question is correct is simply because of the right to choice. Upon coming t a consensus that it would be very difficult to change the current legal situation of both Marijuana and Cigarettes then we should also agree that the current situation is justifiable because : 1.There has been more warning and information about Cigarettes than there was In the last decade. Its astounding in fact. So the harm that's caused is not because of its legal state but because humans have a choice. If a person decides to stab himself and cause himself great harm and even death should we illegalize Knives because they can cause harm to people or should we take it into consideration that people have a choice as to how they use a knife. Same concept applies to anything hazardous. 2. For those who suffer due to being in close proximity I think in France there are places where people can smoke, a place where they don't potentially harm those who don't. In the Arab Emirates there are places where people can effectively smoke or drink without inconveniencing those who don't . To conclude I will talk about Cannabis just like Con did about its effects and why its legal state is justified in relation to Cigarettes. First off I will like state that in recent years there has been a drastic improvement with Cigarette production and the introduction of E-Cigarettes which are a good way to have Nicotine in the body and that helps reduce the amount of people affected by second hand smoking. My conclusion: The recreational use of Cannabis brings about not only one effect but leads to an unfolding chain of effects that don't affect a person in a large way like cancer developments but instead smaller effects that amount to something rather big. 1. You see unlike Cigarettes, if cannabis is used at a young age it literally takes over and decides who a person becomes. If youth use Cannabis not only are they in danger of experiencing a great deal of psychological damage but also they become very vulnerable to the abuse of much stronger and eccentric drugs like Molly and Heroine and Cocaine which have damaged lives and broken apart families to bits. If we look at the displaced people in society that wander around looking coins to survive are usually Crack addicts or heroine addicts who started off by smoking a \"joint\" for fun. People have dropped out of school. This was a good argument and I'm not sure where people stand but I believe its justifiable that the state of legality of both Cigarettes should stay as it is as well as for Cannabis. Why? The damage has been done but, there have been different ideas that can reduce the amount of people that are dying and not only are they ideas but ones that have been put into practice. People are dying not because Cigarettes kill but they chose to smoke.",

In the comments you basically said you wanted the debate to be whether cigarettes are addictive or not. The problem with saying that cigarettes are addictive, is that its only partially true. The cigarette itself is not addictive, it is the nicotine. Nicotine is found in all tobacco products. However, dip and chew actually contain more nicotine than cigarettes. Holding an average sized pinch of dip in your mouth for half an hour, contains the same amount of nicotine as three cigarettes. The reason nicotine is so addictive is because of an \"up and down\" cycle it causes in your body. Once nicotine is in your body, it only takes about 10 seconds for it to reach your brain. Once reaching your brain, it causes your body to release adrenaline which creates a buzz. Once the buzz fades, you feel tired. This tired feeling leaves you with the feeling of needing another buzz. Now that we have established that the nicotine is what is addictive, I will get into what is wrong with saying \"cigarettes are addictive'\". I'm sure we are all aware that there are different brands of cigarettes. The top biggest brands being Marlboro, Newport, and Camel. But there are in fact cigarettes that are nicotine free. Smoke Free is a brand of completely nicotine free cigarettes. So without the addictive side effect of nicotine found in these cigarettes, it makes the statement \"cigarettes are addictive\" invalid since not ALL brands contain the addictive ingredient. Now if you had said \"cigarettes with nicotine are addictive\", that would be a completely different story and you would have been correct. http://nicotinefreecigarettes.com... https://www.sharecare.com...",

This is a side effect that the consumer is well informed of when purchasing cigarettes. Since Cigarettes are a choice, so are the side effects of it.\"Well from what I've learnt by parents, cigarettes were continually pushed on them, from a young age.\"I'm not sure exactly what you are saying at the beginning. You learned this from parents? Parents pushed cigarettes on them from a young age? It's one or the other, but I'm not sure. I'm going to guess you meant to say something like \"I learned that parents continually push cigerattes on kids from a young age.\" You can only purchase cigarettes at the age of 18 or above. You are a legal adult and must take full responsibility for your actions. You can't blame your parents for a bad upbringing. Cigarettes are still a choice regardless.\"Most people smoked, and you were deemed 'uncool' if you didn't.\"This is nothing but an incentive to smoke. You can look cool and smoke or choose not to smoke and look uncool. Again, you are a legal adult and must take full responsibility for your actions. There are also many incentives not to smoke also. The taxes, the side effects, and social unacceptableness of smoking lead people not to smoke.\"Now I'm not saying we can blame cigarette producers entirely for results of peer pressure, but what we can blame them for is the fact that 70% of current smokers would like to quit, but can't.\"Where do you get the 70% number? I'm just curious. They can quit, but are too weak minded to do so. As stated before, all you need to do is quit smoking. Cold turkey works the best as stated in my source in the opening argument. They also have an alternative to cigarettes, electronic cigarettes. They work well at helping even highly dependent smokers.

They are also paying for that hospital bed through both bills and excessively high taxes. Cigarettes are the highest taxed good in the United States. Check this website out: http://www.ehow.com...; We should also make unhealthy diets illegal since this would prevent countless hospital beds from being taken up by people with just cardiovascular diseases alone.

            "premise": "Alright, I'd like to thank my opponent for this challenge so let's jump straight in to this debate.Contention 1: Privacy and the Right to Choose.Though with me being a Conservative you'll probably never see me argue for the \"Right to Choose\" except in the case of economics. Here we have to see that the businesses should have the right to naturally choose who to cater to and what group of people to serve to, before you go out and go on a tangent with illegal things, let's look at the status quo. Though many places do not need the law to ban smoking in their restraunts. Those that do not chose to do so to allow those who smoke eat and smoke at the same time. We have strip bars legal in the US, but do we require everyone to go to the strip club and see what they have \"on the menu.\" The answer is no, we also do not do the opposite. We do not go into these bars and mandate that they cannot strip nor do we mandate that they get rid of the \"entertainment\" to protect the \"common good.\" My opponent's stance declares that we should enforce the government's banning onto many other people's moral's and habbits. I mean let's observe this again with another example. The US has an obesity epidemic, but yet do we go around and lock people's refridgerators or state when they can and cannot eat? The answer is no, so if we cannot outlaw something like fast food or strip clubs under the same argument that you are clammering for here there is no reason for criminalisation of tabacco in order to get rid of smoking. Outlawing this industry would have immidiate economic impact. The Cigarette Companies make a toatl of $346 billion per year. [1] They have a total of 1.6 million jobs and a lot of the tobacco farmers, 136,000 farmers are entirely dependent on it's legalization. [2] We can thus see that if we push for the industry to be illegal we will see a massive amount of Americans join the unemployment lines and prices of other goods will go up. The reason behind this, as I have previously shown, 136,000 farmers out there use tobacco as their cash crop, but also grow a great deal of other things. If this resolution passes we will see a rise in food prices in result of this industry closing. We can see that tabacco is only 3% of the tabacco farmer's production while it amounts to 71% of their profit. They use way over double that to produce food products while 21% is a woodlen. [3] From 1950 to 2000 we can actually have seen that the tabacco industry's employment has decreased 16% each year due to the anti-tobacco ads causing a great deal of unemployment that has already devestated the economy. [4] Now if we compare Tobacco sales to national income from 1970 we can see that as the US wages have increased by 150% as Tobacco sales have actually decreased by $2-3 billion, note that this is adjusted for inflation. [5] Note that this was from the Contention 2: Benefits of SmokingYes you heard me right, benefits. There are several benefits here that actually help people when you smoke tobacco here. In 2007, Harvard released a study showing that smoking actually reduces the risk of Parkison's Disease. Parkinson's costs the average American $25 billion per year and hurts the economy due to worker's that would normally work until their 60s go out of work 20 years eariler and not only does this hurt the individual, but the overal American economy as well. [6] Next is obseity as I spoke about in my last contention. We all know that tobacco is a hunger representant and it also makes people more disgusted by food. This was why it was so big in colonial America as it helped people survive more because of it. [7] The obeseity rates are horrific. It costs the US over $190 billion per year which is 23% of all medical spending in the US. This is something that needs to be addressed. The next one is a biggie, reduces death risk after a heart attack. We can actually see that smoker's who have heart attacks tend to have a lower risk of death than those who don't. The reason behind this is that the smoking actually helps remove plaque from the atteries. The same can be done to a non-smoker, but this has to be done with balloons which is more ineffective and can even increase the risk for death. Contention 3: Tobacco-like alternativesMy opponent gives this resolution, but he fails to observe that there are \"healthier\" alternatives to smoking that are still tobacco like. The Sweeds use a smokeless tobacco called snus. The Sweeds have found it to not have a link between it and cancer. Not to mention that one using snus saves you $582 per year. [8] This product contains no niccotine and has seen a 20% smoking and snus usage decrease as a result. We can easily see that this is one way to eventually ween a nation off of tobacco as Pro like's and it's more economically feasiable. The next key alternative with tobacco is that of Electronic Cigarrettes, AKA E cigs/E cigarrettes. These have been shown to decrease smoking rates by 81% of users. Not to mention that this is a lot cheaper than a pack of cigarettes as a single E cigarette costs $40 while a pack of cigarettes is about $4. In 10 packs the E cig has paid for itself.Sources 1.

My opponent also tried to argue that nothing good comes out of cigarretes except for short term pleasure. I don't actually see this as much of an argument in that if we just extend the time scale that would be true for pretty much anything. This argument seems a bit relative to me.

Despite popular belief, there is no verse in the Constitution that straight-out says \"You may do whatever you want.\" Many things have been around for dozens, if not hundreds, of years, but are now illegal or discouraged to sell because of recent science. For example, lead-based gasoline, lead crystal glass, and asbestos. A ban on the sale of tobacco would put an end to this needless, deadly, and highly-addictive ritual. When people smoke, they don't gain anything, other than a satisfaction of an addiction that wouldn't even exist if they haven't tried it in the first place. Kill it at the source.

            "premise": "First of all, my opponent needs me to clarify what we're debating about. I think there should be a sales tax on cigarettes but just a sales tax. I think cigarette taxes should not be higher than other goods. You make a very convincing argument. Think about it this way: The government exists to protect our life, liberty, and property from other people. It does not exist to save each person from their self. If legislators raise taxes on cigarettes then they are basically forcing people to quit. I mean you don't make someone \"religious\" by holding a gun to their head. Besides if people start smoking less cigarettes they will try to hold down more smoke for a longer time which will cause more cancers and diseases. http://www.healthcentral.com... http://www.mackinac.org... The Congressional Budget Office concluded (\"The external costs of smoking are already covered by existing taxes\")a calculation that includes treatment of cancer, lung disease and the vast array of other health problems directly linked to cigarettes.http://www.time.com... Congress and legislators are contradicting themselves with these taxes. The congress and legislators say we need the revenue from cigarette taxes, and it makes some people quit. But if people quit smoking than we don't get that revenue from cigarette taxes. When people are smoking they have to buy lighters, matches, ashtrays, and other things that go along with smoking. So the external cots of smoking exceed the cigarette taxes when people start to quit. So smoking pays for itself and then some. In conclusion, raising cigarette taxes can cause more disease, less revenue, and a loss in civil rights. I wish my opened luck.",

On the issue of choice, the governments responsibility to protect it's citizens outweighs its responsibility to protect freedom in this case. Yes, people can inform themselves about the dangers of smoking yet the mere fact that this education is necessary... The fact that there exists a product that effects health so negatively that it requires a warning label should be a screamingly red flag to legislators/the american people. The sad fact is that cigarette companies are too powerful. So powerful that even our schools can't fight them. Most children are taught at a young age that smoking is bad for them ( you do not see anti-rockclimbing or parachuting organizations) I wonder why we must invest so much time and energy and MONEY into warning children about a problem that could simply be eliminated. To address the blackmarket issue I will begin by agreeing with you. A blackmarket will undoubtably crop up. But since it is the cigarette companies who add addictive and dangerous chemicals to their tabacco (since they are huge and have the money, power & resources to do so) blackmarket tabacco would actually be cleaner/safer than the tabacco produced by companies. As for peer pressure, we must remember that it is media and ADVERTISING that first influence the peers. I would underline advertising if I could. Cigarette companies finance the idea that smoking is \"cool\". If cigarette companies were eliminated we can assume that the media portrayal of smoking would be very different. Not just the illegal status would effect film-makers but social opinion as well. And even if it were the case that cigarettes maintained their \"cool\" status, the illegal product (as mentioned before) would undoubtably be safer. Cigarettes are also completely useless to society.",

            "premise": "I'm new to this site, but it's my understanding that the instigator has the burden of proof. In this round, many of my opponent's arguments hinge on the fact that cigarettes are currently legal. If we pretended that the U.S. had no current policy on cigarettes and were debating whether legality did more good than harm, my opponent's case would be found wanting. As such, I believe that you should use a utilitarian framework when weighing this round: which policy does the greatest good for the greatest number of people? My opponent's case came down to three things: 1. Prohibition's failure I've refuted this at length by showing that Prohibition failed because 70% of Americans drank and there was a populist backlash against the law because no one wanted to quit drinking. There will be no populist backlash against a cigarette ban because cigarette users are a smaller group, most of whom want to quit (Gallup: 3 of 4 smokers want to quit). Also, it was easy to hide the speakeasies because people would hide in an underground bar at night to drink. Smokers cannot hide their habit at work, where they cannot smoke indoors and cannot smoke outdoors without fear of getting caught. Going 8 hours a day without smoking is excruciating if you're addicted; it would be easier just to quit, than to force yourself to smoke only at morning and at night. 2. Economy My opponent points out that smoking is a $2 billion industry. This is always going to be outweighed by the costs to society of smoking in terms of productivity losses and higher health care costs, which is $157 billion a year. And don't forget opportunity cost \u2013 tobacco executives might be put to much better use running solar power companies. The tobacco farmland may be put to better use growing switchgrass for ethanol. An end to smoking does not spell an end to these people's lives \u2013 there are other options out there for them. 3. It's A Right To win that there's a basic right to smoke, my opponent would have to answer my arguments that the government can take away a right when the right impinges on the rights of others, such as the right not to be exposed to secondhand smoke and the right not to pay for smokers health care costs through higher premiums for everyone. My opponent concedes that the government can take away the \"right\" to do heroin. My opponent points out that heroin can kill you. My opponent therefore concedes that the paternalism principle (passing a law to protect people from themselves) is a legitimate reason to create a law. Even though cigarettes stop short of killing people all in one dose, that doesn't mean that the government cannot employ the paternalism principle in this case as well. I wish we'd stop referring to it as the \"right\" to smoke. It's not a right guaranteed to us anywhere in U.S. law. It's not hiding somewhere in the First Amendment. I believe for the above reasons that my opponent's case fails the burden of proof and fails to justify why a law that makes smoking legal is a good idea for society. (Note on the mis-cited #4 source. Go to the source website \u2013 the word \"tax\" does not appear) Moving back to my own case: 1. Economy Productivity losses and higher health care costs from smoking add up to $157 billion a year or $7.18 per pack. My opponent keeps bring up how productivity means we should ban bad foods, but the reason we don't ban \"bad foods\" is that no type of food is categorically bad. Even McDonald's in moderation can be part of a healthy diet (Jamie Oliver). Cigarettes cannot be part of a healthy anything \u2013 moderation doesn't matter, exercise doesn't mitigate smoking. If McDonald's burgers put tar in your lungs and contained cyanide, they would be banned too. My opponent's main response to health care is that we pay for things we don't agree with, like the wars in the Middle East (his most recent example). We pay taxes to go towards things that benefit all of us (whether or not we agree with those things). The wars in the Middle East promise to increase global security and decrease terrorism, both of which benefit all U.S. citizens and thus justify the use of tax dollars. Cigarettes do not benefit all. Non-smokers pay $7.18 per pack, but gain no benefits from smoking. 2. Lives It's never been refuted that a smoking ban could save 440,000 lives per year. Three fourths of those people want to quit but need more motivation. Also, a ban ends the problems associated with secondhand smoke. The electronic smokeless cigarette does not solve this problem considering that so few smokers employ this device. There are other carcinogens in the air, but none as concentrated or poisonous as cigarette smoke. Remember that any exposure to secondhand smoke as a child doubles your risk of cancer as an adult. 3. Marketing to kids Cigarette companies claim not to market to kids, but check out this picture: http://nicotinetimes.com... It looks just like a tic-tac. Allison Ellis of Targeting Kids says, \"Is there anything about this product that isn't designed with kids in mind? Let's see\u2026 the candy-like flavor? The youthful colors and packaging? The cute camel silhouette?\" [1] Each ad they see makes kids 182% more likely to smoke. If smoking were a clear-cut choice, everyone would have made up their minds and not be swayed by advertising. Yes, lots of kids have \"tried\" marijuana once. That's very different from getting hooked on cigarettes for the rest of your life. Marijuana, lacking nicotine, does not have the same staying power. 90% of people start smoking as kids. Isn't there something wrong with a product when adults cannot be convinced to use it \u2013 only kids can? I love this Truth campaign PSA I saw today: http://shardsofglass.com... Watch the first video now if you don't want spoilers. It shows an executive announcing that his Shards of Glass products are being recalled because they are \"addictive and deadly when used correctly.\" What other product would we allow this with? When cigarettes were first put on the market, we were told they were safe - the tobacco industry later set up a scientific research institute to prove as much. When we found out that they were \"addictive and deadly when used correctly,\" why were they not recalled or banned, like any other product would be? Would we allow ice cream pops with shards of glass in them to stay on the market? Then why cigarettes? In conclusion, banning cigarettes would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It would add $157 billion to our economy by increasing our nation's productivity and decreasing our health care costs. It would end the unfair practice of non-smokers being charged $7.18 for each pack that smokers choose to buy. A ban would save countless lives and end the problems associated with secondhand smoke. A ban would be the impetus that smokers need to quit, considering that 3 out of 4 smokers say that they would love to quit if given the proper motivation. What other product is on the market where 75% percent of its users say that they want to stop using it but feel like they can't? Why are cigarette companies so ineffective at convincing adults to start smoking? (adults are only 10% of \"new smokers\") It's because cigarettes are a product that by all sane metrics does not belong on the market. We should have issued a recall on all cigarettes ages ago. It's high time to do the right thing. Affirmed I thank my opponent for an intriguing debate [1] http://www.shapingyouth.org...",

They transport people from one location to another, manufacturers are coming up with more fuel efficient models and the safety of many vehicles is being improved. When cigarettes are advertised, there is absolutely nothing good to say about them.\" Automobiles and cigarettes are actually remarkably similar. They both provide a service to the user. Automobile driver can move easiy and quickly from one place to another and cigarrete users can become very relaxed after they have smoked a cigarrete. And both products carry a significant risk. Thousands die every year in car crashes and thousands die every year due to lung cancer. They are similar in that a person of age has every right to use the product if they please. And whether it be a car company or a cigarette company, they both have the right to advertise their respective products. \"They influence children in a negative way and put many lives in danger; people that don't even smoke. 53,800 people a year die from second hand smoking.\" Please reas this excerpt from http://www.accidentattorneys.com... \"one pedestrian is injured by a vehicle ever 8 minutes, and one pedestrian dies as a result of injuries from an accident with a vehicle ever 111 minutes. That's more than 1 per hour-and-a-half. In the United States, 5,000 pedestrians die each year as a result of these accidents, and over 60,000 more are injured.\" These are people who did not choose to drive an automobile yet were injured or killed by one anyways. Earily similar to those who have died as a result of second hand smoke. Would you still wish to allow companies to advertise cars. Look at how many people they kill or injure every year. What is the diference between them and cigarrete ads? Nothing. \"Some children are not lucky enough to have guidance from a parent or guardian, so how are the supposed to know any differently if they are told by television commercials and radio ads that cigarettes are good?\" And what about people in T.V. shows or movies who smoke? Should that be banned? And what about violence on T.V. or movies? Is that to be banned too? Where do we stop? \"If a product is harmful to a person's health it should not be advertised in a positive way.\" I have shown conclusively that automobiles can be very harmful to one's health. Virtually anything can become harmful to one's healt actually. Should football or basketball not be advertised as they can certainly have adverse affects on one's health? How about sky diving? Should companies not be allowed to advertise sky diving because people can get hurt or die? And I always see army and navy commercial nowadays. You can't deny that thousands of people die in combat every year. But those are certainly advertised in a positive way. Where are we to draw the line?",

Cigarettes have higher taxes for a reason: Cigarette addicts will be more willing to pay higher for these products because they are so addictive, and the higher the tax, the greater the revenue. Also the people addicted to cigarettes are harmful to the rest of society just by smoking these addictive products; therefore it is a problem that should be tended to by raising the tax and reducing the amount of people suffering (while raising the tax, revenue will raise until a large amount of people quit). Governments purpose is defined by the state of itself: In the beginning our government surely existed to protect property over life and liberty (take slavery for example), but many laws have been put into place to protect us, not from our selves, but from others just like you said. Our government exists to protect our rights to property and liberty, but at the same time exists to protect us from exploitation and suffering caused by other people like the CIGARETTE COMPANIES (all according to the laws of this land). Religion isn't a very good example because it IS often forced upon children by their parents when they're to young to distinguish logic from fairy tale (just as teens are often pressured to start smoking by their older \"friends\"). Health Care costs per year usually amount to about $72.7 Billion per year. And what is that paid with? Taxes. We need cigarette taxes to pay for the average smokers Health Care, which is 40 percent higher than the average non-smoker. (http://berkeley.edu...) I'll state my conclusion: Cigarette Taxes provide a steady amount of income to pay for the improvement of society and the large amount of Health Care that addicts require. Cigarette taxes should also be raised to reduce the amount of people suffering from these Cigarette related problems: - 440,000 in the United States alone die from smoking related deaths per year. - Cigarettes kill more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicide, AIDS, homicide, and illegal drugs combined. - Cigarette smoking accounts for at least 30% of all cancer deaths. (http://www.cancer.org...) Finally I'd like to thank my opponent for the opportunity to debate this topic.",

A pc has to take a year to download a game, and the last time I checked, the pc, could not play angry birds, which is the best selling game for two consecutive years. Like I stated you can download android market, which has over millions of game choices for free. Some of the games on the pc is not free, or you have to be a member of some website. 3. Same. 4. The e reader can download music studio, video editor, and millions of movies. The e reader has different memory spaces, 16 gig, 32, gig, ect. A movie is not even 1,000 megabytes, which for me is plenty of movies. 5. Buy.. do I look like I want to buy a safe guard to protect my computer. Computer vary in prices from 350 to 1400, which to me is very ridiculous. Why would I want to spend all this money then buy a safeguard when all I have to do is buy a e reader, which saves 100's of dollars. There is no viruses which can attack you computer when you want to play a simple online game. Point conceded. 6. I can play all those games and more on my e reader,which takes less then 2 mins to download, all the the palm of my hand. When your walking across the street, or even in Starbucks, most people have a e reader handheld while few have computers. Point conceded",

            "premise": "Good, and thanks for accepting. So here's my main argument: Well, as you and i will know cigarettes have devastating effects on people, however once people start, the cannot stop, becasue of the nicotine in cigarettes. I'm not going to go into all the effects of cigarettes, however I'm sure you will know that effects include lung infections/cancer and lots of other diseases. Since you live in America, here is some more information, to back up my sources. The 1982 United States Surgeon General\"s report stated that \"Cigarette smoking is the major single cause of cancer mortality [death] in the United States.\" This statement is as true today as it was then. Also tobacco use is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 deaths in the United States. Because cigarette smoking and tobacco use are acquired behaviors; activities that people choose to do About half of all Americans who keep smoking will die because of the habit. Each year about 443,000 people in the United States die from illnesses related to tobacco use. Smoking cigarettes kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicide, AIDS, homicide, and illegal drugs combined. You might say well, if a person chooses to smoke, then they can. They can make there own choices, and if they want to potentially be a victim of a fatal disease, that's fine. However there are two things wrong with this statement. The first thing wrong with this statement, is that as you will know there is passive smoking. If one person decides to smoke, there kids or friends could easily start smoking by peer pressure, or by breathing in smoke from a near-by persons cigarette. (passive smoking) The second wrong thing with this statement is the fact that deaths and illnesses due to smoking are costing our health system, the NHS, an extraordinary amount of money. Here is the first paragraph from and article from the independent, written in 2009. Smoking costs the NHS more than \"5 billion a year - up to five times the previously accepted figure, researchers have revealed. Now, in out country today, smoking has been banned in public places, however, everywhere else they are still allowed. I think that is smoking was banned in our country, it would save many lives, it would save lots of money, and it would make our country a cleaner place. Even though you might say that some people just can't stop i'm sure if it was illegal and they were confiscated if they were seen smoking, then eventually they would stop and slowly smoking would come down to the level of illegal drugs in the present day. Finally i would like to say, that i think since cigarettes are actually a drug, they should, if they were made illegal, should be treated in the same way as illegal drugs and the same punishment.",

Also, studies by the Center for Disease control have shown that the air quality in New York is proven to be nine times higher than in New Jersey, where smoking remains legal. Next, those who live with smokers have a 20 to 30 higher percent chance of developing lung cancer, than those who do not live with them. Lastly, smoking is the impetus for bronchitis, emphysema, and stomach cancer in adults. Of course, they would be taxed with other detrimental activities like trash, sewage, and eating fast foods because cigarettes are classified as a domestic issue. Cigarettes are a cogent place to start with taxing because 43.8 million people use them and they're virulent in the United States. Also, if spending if the unstable area of analysis and not regulating the revenue, we should allot some money towards organization and steps to improve budgeting. I'm actually proposing a higher tax on cigarettes, in order for people to either stop buying them, which will lead to a healthier environment or buy the same amount for higher prices, which will lead to more money for the federal government, towards a more proficient budgeting program. Getting rid of the tax would be severely malignant because more and more packs of cigarettes would be bought at a lower price. By doing this we're not just giving money to the Washington Pit, but actually doing American citizens a favor and the money from the higher taxes on cigarettes could be allocated towards the educational system or infrastructure in the United States: Both need a lot of improvement and I'm sure many people would agree with that!",

            "discussionTitle": "Cigarettes Should be Illegal",
            "conclusion": "Cigarettes Should be Illegal",
            "premise": "Food: My opponent does not answer my essential assertion that eating unhealthy food is a choice much like smoking cigarettes are a choice. So I'll rephrase my argument again, My opponent's objections to cigarettes being illegal are that it is unhealthy, but why do we necessary have to live healthy lives? The meaning of life varies among many people, there are those who seek to live as long as possible, there are others who choose to live for the moment. If a man decides that smoking a cigarette is worth the risk of the illnesses and a short life, then who are we to prohibit that? Health care: My argument isn't limited to merely abortions, there are plenty of taxes that we pay for things we don't believe in. There are plenty of wasted U.S. dollars, at least in the case of cigarettes the money is used for the right to smoke. \"Proving we sometimes pay for things we don't do is not a good justification for legality.\" Which is my point. My opponent asserts that cigarettes should be illegal because it is expensive. Marketing to kids: The manufacturers that advertise the products is of fault, not the product itself. It is asinine to make cigarettes illegal because the manufacturers are subtly breaking the law. The product cannot be blamed for the fault of the producer. \"A lot of peer pressure happens older to younger, meaning an 18 year old, who can now legally purchase cigarettes, pressuring someone younger than him to start smoking. Illegality makes peer pressure more difficult.\" Almost half of the teens in the US have tried marijuana [1]. It is illegal, and yet does nothing to deter peer pressure or abuse. Making cigarettes illegal will provide minimal efficiency in deducing peer pressure. The same is with Alcohol, which is legal. Furthermore, an older teen distributing cigarette to younger kids is an illegal act, and therefore the older teen should be responsible in accordance to the law. Making cigarettes illegal because of an illegal act committed by teens is nonsensical. \"Many people (90%) get hooked as children when they think smoking is really cool, and they are less likely to worry about their health. They then find it hard to quit. Remember the Gallup poll that 3 out of 4 smokers want to quit but feel that they can't because cigarettes are too addictive.\" \"My opponent points out that people can choose to quit. I would assert that it's not as easy as he makes it sound. The fact that he cites a forum where people who are trying to quit congregate and help each other proves how difficult quitting actually is. If it were easy, no such forum would be necessary.\" I never said quitting was easy, but my opponent makes it sound like it's impossible. There are smokers that quit, meaning there is a choice factor involved. If one is resolute in his decision to quit, then one can do it. Secondhand smoke There are unhealthy particles all over the atmosphere. Forgive the informality, but sh!t happens. Secondhand smoke isn't deliberate, and usually smokers have the decency to flick the cigarette or distance themselves, if you ask them to. Cars drive by and spray smoke all over the atmosphere; it doesn't mean we are going to ban cars. Also, my opponent has yet to answer my Electronic Cigarettes alternative, which produces no secondhand smoke. Right to smoke: Heroin can be overdosed very easily, which leads to death. Long time users develop a tolerance for it, to a degree where the user needs to inject have amounts just to feel \"normal\". People do not overdose on nicotine, and neither does cigarette have nearly the potency to do what heroine does. I have already given my response as to why heroine is illegal in contrast to cigarettes. No one has ever overdosed on cigarettes, and the effects of cigarettes, which is at best, a \"buzz\". In the case of heroine, you feel something completely different that is incomparable to cigarettes. This is why heroine is illegal, while cigarettes remain legal. Prohibition: \"Also, keep in mind that unlike alcohol, which is usually consumed once a day, at night, inside a building, cigarettes are usually consumed multiple times a day, outside.\" Many smokers smoke indoors, in the privacy and comfort of their homes. My opponent asserts that quitting cigarettes is no easy deal, and yet he believes that all it will take to make people quit is to simply ban them. If it were that easy, there would be no crimes regarding drugs. Which brings me back to my initial point that banning cigarettes has no guarantee that smokers will quit. $7.18 My argument was that there are things that we spend money on that we don't agree on, such as the wars in the Middle East, along numerous others. My opponent might not agree with how his tax dollars are spent, but we must remember that there are those who do agree with them. \"My opponent must mis-cite his source (his #4), because I can't find any reference to tax dollars, but I also assume that $157 billion a year is much more than what he is referencing.\" I cited source #4 in reference to the amount of tax that is wasted. Employment My opponent has no answers for the unemployment that banning cigarettes would cause, such as the damage to tobacco farmers and cigarette companies, which harbor innumerable employees. My summary will be extended with additional details, In summary, banning cigarettes won't make people quit. If anything, it will become \"cool\" and more daring to try, especially for teens, which is counterproductive. At the same time, we lose all tax revenue from cigarettes, if we were to ban the product, while still having to pay for loss productivity and smoking related illnesses, in the case that cigarettes are banned, and smokers continue to smoke. Not to mention, myriads would be unemployed as a result. All of us are accountable for the choices we make in our lives, some choices will be bad, others good. It is ideal to make only good choices in life, but once we start enforcing the \"good\" choices, we have no choices to make at all. Regarding my opponent's objection that smoking is not a choice, if a smoker really wants to quit, they can do it. There are numerous ex-smokers, who CHOSE to quit. I thank my opponent for a good debate, and leave the rest to the voters. Sources: [1] http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov...",

Addicts become addicts completely on their own will. It is also not an addiction like cocaine. You can completely quit smoking or known as \"cold turkey.\" This isn't safe to do after a heavy addiction to cocaine. In fact, to quit smoking, all you need to do is quit smoking. Here is proof from an unbiased site (many sites will advertise their product, but his provides genuine research): http://whyquit.com... Cigarettes are profit A lot of tax dollars come from cigarettes. A lot of businesses rely on cigarettes (and also plenty that rely on people trying to quit). To completely ban them, you would severely impact the economy in a harmful way. 17.6 billion dollars were made from taxes in the year 2012 from cigarettes in the United States alone. This information can be found here: http://www.taxpolicycenter.org... Here is a list of businesses that would completely go under if cigarettes were banned, or at least suffer in the United States: http://www.revenue.nebraska.gov... This is not including anybody that profits from helping addicts quit smoking.Second Hand SmokeSecond hand smoke is indeed a real problem, however it can be solved. We don't need to ban cigarettes to keep non smokers safe from them. We need to add more regulations where it is acceptable to smoke. Here you can see a list of laws passed aimed at protecting people from second hand smoke: http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov... Many of these laws prevent smoke from ever polluting the air in the first place. This is also a side effect of taxes. Higher taxes on a good decrease the amount of the good sold. You can argue that more regulations are needed, but banning smoking would do more harm than good.Sources1. http://en.wikipedia.org...2. http://whyquit.com...3. http://www.taxpolicycenter.org...4. http://www.revenue.nebraska.gov...5. http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov...",

You seem to want to debate the fact that cars are harmful to human beings when in reality, everything is. Automobiles are a necessity in the life of a human, cigarettes are not. My point is that the advertisement of these harmful products are putting a positive image in children's minds.. it's not right. Children are starting to smoke at younger and younger ages, but you usually don't see a 12 year old behind the wheel of a car. Cigarettes are being advertised as a positive product, when in reality there should be pictures of lung cancer and yellow teeth to show the real effects of smoking. And you're probably going to debate that car commercials should have pictures of accidents, but showing a picture of a crash isn't going to stop anyone from driving. It is an essential and necessary part of life. We would be no where without transportation, people would not be able to function in the way they do today and many lives would be hindered by the lack of transportation. Many lives would be different. Showing a picture of lung cancer or yellow teeth, maybe gum disease, might lead someone away from smoking. It might even get someone to consider quitting. Without smoking, life wouldn't be any different and ciilization would be the same exact way it is now. We need cars, we don't need cigarettes. What the debate was actually supposed to be about was the influence that these commercials and ads have on young children. They are sending a positive message about a negative product. You can tell me up, down and sideways that a cigarette can make you feel good but how long does that last? About as long as the cigarette does. There os no need for smoking in our society and there is no need to advertise them in a positive way. These commercials are influencing youn generations in a negative way. There is absolutely no good thing to come of smoking. No parent is proud to say that their child smokes, while others may be proud that their child drives. The outcome of driving is in the hands of the driver. Safe driving is up to the person behind the wheel while the outcome of smoking is not up to the person. People are not going to stop driving because they might get into an accident, they might drive safer or slower in that case but they will not stop driving, but some people may not smoke if they know the dangers involved. Cigarettes are being advertised as a positive product when all they do is kill people, they do nothing else.",

            "premise": "Furthering and maintaining one's life may not be the intention of everyone, but it can be said that humans are alive to live. To purposely indulge in habits that would refrain one from being able to do so would go against what could be the intention of our existence. Though we are not required to live, while we are alive it's important, though not required, to take part in actions that will allow us to do just that. Smoking cigarettes prevents smokers from being able to partake in what one may call a human duty. Though no duty is required, it is certainly present. A rational, though sometimes selfish, decision can often be thought of as one that protects or ensures a person's longevity, If a person has the intention of staying alive, and while doing so staying healthy, it certainly is irrational for them to partake in smoking. A person should not smoke because when they do they are purposely shortening the span of their life, our lives being the only thing in this world that each of us have. By evidence to Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, one must will the maxim that can be made universal law. The smoking of cigarettes doesn't fall into this law. Yes, it may be deemed appropriate for a forty-five year old man to smoke a cigarette, but could the same be said of a three year old? There are already restrictions on the smoking of cigarettes (i.e., age restrictions, parameters in which smoking can be done, what actually goes into a cigarette). Smoking cigarettes cannot be made into universal law. It can not be said that in every circumstance there can ever be, a person should be able to smoke. Because of this, one should not smoke cigarettes because the action doesn't pass the categorical imperative set up by Immanuel Kant. By the same vein, another version of the categorical imperative states that one should treat others as ends, not simply means to an end. By smoking cigarettes, smokers treat their own bodies as means to an end. Smokers do not value the intrinsic good their bodies have, but instead soil and pollute it (as well as the environment and other humans). By doing so, smoking cigarettes fails to meet the standards of this version of the categorical imperative. Whether a smoker regrets their decision to smoke or not (often they don't) and whether or not they decide to quit is, indeed, a matter of personal framework. However, one can fall in and not regret their decision to smoke. In fact, many continue to do so until their bodies eventually give in to death. But because it is smoking that could cause their death, it's vital that smokers don't smoke. I do agree that if less people drove there would be fewer deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents. However, driving is more of a human necessity than smoking. Driving is, too, very dangerous \u2013 but there are in fact rewards to driving, while smoking provides virtually none. Though the risk and reward factor for driving still may not balance out, the margin would still be more appealing than that of smoking cigarettes. Even smoking in designated areas is dangerous, particularly to oneself. If people keep smoking, people will keep dying smoking related deaths. It is true that not all smokers suffer the same fate, but because they often do, one should not take the chance and simply not smoke.",

            "conclusion": "Cigarettes Should be Illegal",
            "premise": "Food comparison: My opponent advocates a healthy life, I advocate a life where one can choose between a healthy and unhealthy life. My opponent's objections to cigarettes being illegal are that it is unhealthy, but why do we necessary have to live healthy lives? The meaning of life varies among many people, there are those who seek to live as long as possible, there are others who choose to live for the moment. If a man decides that smoking a cigarette is worth the risk of the illnesses and a short life, then who are we to prohibit that? Health care: Certain rights are expensive, that does not mean we shouldn't have those rights. We pay for things we don't believe in all the time. Marketing to kids: Advertising cigarettes to kids are illegal, and it is illegal for \"kids\" to smoke cigarettes. If kids choose to break the law, why should cigarettes be illegal to adults? The same can be said about video games, which exploits sex, violence, crime, along many others. Simply said, the product cannot be banned because the producers may market to children. The choice: \"Cigarette smokers have the right to smoke. Non-cigarette smokers have the right not to be forcibly exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay the hidden health care costs for smokers.\" Smokers don't go around nonsmokers with a mission to give them second-hand smoke, furthermore there are laws put into place to minimalize second and third-hand smoking, such as banning indoor smoking. If you don't want to be around secondhand smoke, don't be around them. Compromises can be made, and have been made. [1] \"Although fast food and alcohol have some addictive properties, quitting either of them will not give you withdrawal symptoms.\" Actually quitting alcohol abruptly can kill you and alcohol does give you withdrawals [2], along with caffeine and sugar [3]. If anything that gives you withdrawals should be illegal, then sugar, caffeine, and alcohol must be respectively illegal. \"If we can remove a choice to do other addictive drugs like heroin, why can we not do so with nicotine? We recognize in our society that addiction is not truly a choice.\" Heroin can be overdosed very easily, which leads to death. Long time users develop a tolerance for it, to a degree where the user needs to inject have amounts just to feel \"normal\". People do not overdose on nicotine, and neither does cigarette have nearly the potency to do what heroine does. \"I'd like to note that at the end of the day, my opponent has no response to the fact that the hidden productivity and health care costs mean that non-smokers have to pay $7.18 for each pack of cigarettes that a smoker purchases. This unfair economic burden is why cigarettes should be banned.\" There are a plethora of wasted tax dollars [4], point being, we all have to pay for things we don't want to. In the case of cigarettes, we pay the price for the right to smoke. Prohibition: While agreeably, there are not as many smokers as drinkers, this does not mean that prohibiting cigarettes won't increase crime rates. It opens a new black market and makes America a hot zone for organized crime. Economic benefits of smoking: Banning cigarettes would mean that Tobacco farmers would lose their primary patrons. People can only chew so many nicotine gums, and competition to export tobacco to other countries will be fierce. The damage this would do to farmers is evident. In addition, the $2 billion added to the economy from smoking is completely outweighed by the $157 billion lost every single year from the economy from smoking due to lost productivity and higher health care costs. Banning cigarettes won't make smokers quit (Similarly to the Prohibition Era), there are plenty of drugs that are illegal and still widely abused, which means that the lost productivity and health care costs could face no real change. However, if we do ban smoking the tax revenue from cigarettes will be definitely lost, and millions of employees would lose their jobs as a result from it. If anything, rebellious teenagers will be more attracted to cigarettes if they become illegal. Right to smoke: \"Remember from before that others have the right not to be exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay higher health care premiums. Society must decide whose rights are more important.\" Secondhand smoke can be avoided by the electronic cigarettes. [6] \"In addition, people may have the right to do heroin, that doesn't mean that we should allow them to do so.\" No, people do not have the right to do heroin. That right is denied by the government. \"Maybe people should also have the \"right\" to have a consensual sexual relationship with a child.\" People don't have that right, and I don't see how sex with children is relevant to smoking cigarettes. Indeed, children do not have the ability to make the most rational choice, but that doesn't mean adults should suffer as a result of that. \"In summary, ban smoking because it is not really a choice \u2013 most people choose to smoke as children because they are inundated with advertising convincing them to do so.\" It is illegal to advertise cigarettes to children [7]. If anything, teens start smoking due to peer pressure [8]. In summary, banning cigarettes won't make people quit. If anything, it will become \"cool\" and more daring to try, especially for teens, which is counterproductive. At the same time, we lose all tax revenue from cigarettes, if we were to ban the product, not to mention, myriads would be unemployed as a result. All of us are accountable for the choices we make in our lives, some choices will be bad, others good. It is ideal to make only good choices in life, but once we start enforcing the \"good\" choices, we have no choices to make at all. Regarding my opponent's objection that smoking is not a choice. If a smoker really wants to quit, they can do it [9]. There are numerous ex-smokers, who CHOSE to quit. Sources: [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://alcoholism.about.com...

I agree that a law put into effect at the federal level leaves room for abuse so then I suppose that hiking up the tax on cigarettes would be a feasible option. People smoking tend to have severe health issues and if they cannot afford health insurance they end up causing the tax payers money. Something has to be done about the cigarette one way or another.

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his timely response. ~Refutations~ 1. Smoking hurts our economy Subpoint A: productivity I grant my opponent that cigarettes are unhealthy, but if everything that is unhealthy and unproductive should be made illegal, the government would have to criminalize a lot more than just cigarettes under the same criteria, such as junk food and fast foods. Obesity is becoming a national problem. [1] Subpoint B: health care costs We all pay for the expenses of having certain rights and privileges, though not all might agree with those rights. Similarly, while cigarettes can affect the cost of health care, that doesn't mean that right shouldn't exist. The health care also covers Abortions, and those who may not agree with Abortions pay for a health care program that does. Furthermore, there are always going to be things that will harm humans, both voluntary and involuntary, which is what necessitates the health care in the first place. The cost of health care shouldn't be the reason to criminalize a certain right and freedom. 2. Lives This argument can be applied to fast food, which poses a major threat to our nation. \"Although most of the health problems related to fast food aren't felt until middle age -- obesity and diabetes are at an all-time high --- the damage starts before children enter kindergarten. Hoping to shape eating habits, fast-food chains market heavily to children. About 96% of American school-aged children recognize Ronald McDonald, second only to Santa Claus. Almost every American child eats at a McDonald's\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd at least once a month.\" [2] Fast food markets to both children and adults, and their products start to damage the agent before they enter kindergarten. Should fast food be made illegal too? 3. Marketing (to kids) Because cigarette companies market their products to children, it should be illegal for those who are old enough to smoke? There is already a ban on advertising cigarettes. Cigarette companies that do market to kids are doing something that is already illegal. Teenagers are impressionable and reckless and will do what they want, regardless of what the law states. Making cigarettes illegal because it markets to kids is unreasonable. ~Arguments~ ~Prohibition Era~ My first counter argument is the Prohibition Era of 1920. The endeavor to ban alcohol ended in disaster, as crime rates skyrocketed and \"While Prohibition was successful in reducing the amount of liquor consumed, it tended to destroy society by other means, as it stimulated the proliferation of rampant underground, organized and widespread criminal activity.\" [3] A ban on cigarettes would only trigger another facsimile of the Prohibition of 1920. ~Loss of Revenue and Jobs~ Cigarettes also attribute to great economic opportunities, as well as jobs. \"California's smokers, who comprise only 17.2 percent of the state's population, paid more than $2.2 billion in cigarette-related revenue to the state in 2001. That's more than $6 million a day, or nearly $4,200 per minute.\" [4] \"In 1999, 2000 and 2001, smokers nationwide paid $88 billion in cigarette revenues.\" [4] American Cigarettes are also a popular import to other countries, which encourages trade and helps the economy. [5] Criminalizing cigarettes also will cause further unemployment, and millions of those who work for tobacco companies will lose their jobs, as well as farmers who grow tobacco. ~The Right to Smoke~ As adults, I believe we have to deal with the consequences of our actions and choices; even if the result of smoking cigarettes causes a user to die. http://www.helium.com...

It causes millions of smokers to die early, and get illnesses like Cancer and emphysema. Why should we allow something that causes so much harm? In fact, cigarettes and similar objects, are the only products that if used how the manufacturer intended, can kill you. Only cigarettes can do that. 2) Secondhand smoke. Smoking also has 2 nasty byproducts, toxic cigarette buts, and secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that bystanders involuntarily breath in. Studies have shown that secondhand smoke is just as dangerous, if not more dangerous then firsthand smoke. Smoking should be banned to prevent us from all that harm. As for smoking areas, why should businesses have to waste space and money building special areas to allow people to hurt themselves and others. Those people also could have kids, so where do they go? People also smoke at parks, hurting many kids who just want to play and have fun. If you have kids, smoking indoors and in the car with them can leave them with asthma and the same diesases as the parent. That is unfair. What is also unfair is for the people who walk outside in cities also have to breath in disgusting smoke all the time as smokers smoke on sidewalks. Why should that be harmed for a smokers disgusting habit? 3) Litter. Anyone who has walked on the sidewalks have seen tons of cigarette butts all over the ground. That is littering, which is against the law. So why are smokers not getting in trouble then? The butts look gross, and kids like to grab interesting things, which could be a ciggarette butt, which could then lead to dangerous situations where the kid eats the butt. Ciggarette buts are discusting and animals could also eat them. Conclusion: As you can see, smoking has many horrible effects, including harm to the smoker, harm to bystanders, harm to kids, harm to businesses, and harm to the environment. With all these downsides, there is absolutely no reason to allow smoking.",

            "premise": "Thanks for your arguments ColeTrain. I accept his Introduction.FrameworkThe burden of proof is shared as Pro said. I will prove that there should not be taxation of cigarretes by first banning smoking and giving some arguments about smoking. If I fill the BOP then I win. If Pro fills the BOP, Pro wins. I agree that this should be US-centered as to deflect disparity of current taxation and proposals. I need to show that we should not increase the taxation of the cigarettes. If I suceed, I win. However if my opponent shows in a logical way that we should increase the taxation of cigarettes, she will win.Arguments I will start my arguments. First of all, my first argument will be about banning smoking.1. Smoking BanOkay this argument is about smoking ban. It is not really in the topic, but it leads through the other arguments.Okay, first of all I think we should ban smoking. This goes in 3 different categories.My first category is that smoking is not beneficial for your health and gives you some diseases and bad organs. First of all smoking gives you bad lungs. This is basically like breathing right in front of the car's gas, it is pollution that you are breathing.I will give some pictures. Okay, this is the picture of you.1. I will go to the brain first. Nicotine is a very bad part of your health and will make you nervous and feeling bad.2. Next is the mouth. Tobacco stains your teeth and make your teeth bad. This is very bad for your health. Also it makes your breath smell bad. That is bad for you and the people near you. Also taste buds give you the sense of taste. Without taste buds, you cannot taste anything.3. Now I will go into the heart. The heart is a very important part of your body and what makes you live. The bad thing of tobacco is that it will increase your heart rate. If it is to high, you might have bad health. Also it is harder exercising and making you fit which is very important.4. Now it is the lung the problem. This is the picture of your lung if you smoke. The left is not smoking, perfectly good. However if you smoke, your lung turns rotten like it the right.5. I will go onto the muscles. Not much blood will go in the muscles if you smoke, which makes it harder to move or do anything with your muscles, meaning you cannot do anything.Okay, this was the section of that smoking is bad for your health. Now I will show you a picture of what happens if you stop smoking. Okay, this is the picture of your health with not smoking. It gives you a lot better health. There can be fast changes of you when you quit smoking. You will turn into a non-smoker and will be healthy and normal again.If smoking is bad, why do we need to increase the taxation of cigarettes? Cigarettes is basically what we smoke. Why do we need to increase the taxation of a bad thing that will kill us.2. No ReasonOkay, there is no reason to increase the taxation of cigarettes of a bad thing. It just makes more bad things expensive. We don't need this. No one will use cigarettes anyway because it is bad for your health. Do you think that someone will buy something that is bad for your health and it is expensive? No one will buy it if it has taxes because if it is cheap, you could. Why would you pay a lot of something for this bad thing. Even though taxes help the government, just tax other stuff that we need. We have to buy water for an example. This will help the government way better because that if we increase the tax of water, we need it which shows that we get more money because people need to buy these things, but not tobacco.3. Cigarettes are badCigarettes cause many bad things. It causes to bad things. The first bad thing is that this occurs labour. People will buy these slaves and will make them work and not even pay money to them. This is mostly the cause of smoking because tobacco is now very famous. Tobacco is just bad. Second of all, it is bad for your health as I explained in my first argument. Why should be tax and make higher prices for things that is bad for you. Because of this no one will buy these cigarettes because of the higher prices of the thing.ConclusionOur team believes that cigarettes and smoking is bad for your health and we should not have them. This means that we should not increase the tax because then also, no one will buy cigarettes again if we have the prices higher.

            "premise": "DEATHSI just want to make this point very, very clear.As Proctor states [3]:\"The cigarette is the deadliest object in the history of human civilisation. Cigarettes kill about 6 million people every year, a number that will grow before it shrinks. ... [A] billion could perish in our century unless we reverse course. Even if present rates of consumption drop steadily to zero by 2100, we will still have about 300 million tobacco deaths this century.\"Consider that: 1,000,000,000 dead people. Most estimates of nuclear war put the deathtoll at maybe 500,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 dead people. Stopping cigarette consumption is equivalent to preventing a nuclear war.REDUCING SMOKINGConsider that smokefree policies have reduced smoking, even though they're limited to just the premises of a building [1][2]. If smokefree policies work at a local level, why shouldn't they work at a larger level?LIBERTYAs Proctor states [3]:\"The primary reason for abolition, however, is that smokers themselves dislike the fact they smoke. Smoking is not a recreational drug, and abolishing cigarettes would therefore enlarge rather than restrict human liberties. Abolition would also help cigarette makers fulfil their repeated promises to \u2018cease production\u2019 if cigarettes were ever found to be causing harm. .... The freedom objection is weak, however, given how people actually experience addiction. Most smokers \u2018enjoy\u2019 smoking only in the sense that it relieves the pains of withdrawal; they need nicotine to feel normal. People who say they enjoy cigarettes are rather rare\u2014so rare that the industry used to call them \u2018enjoyers\u2019. Surveys show that most smokers want to quit but cannot; they also regret having started. Tobacco industry executives have long grasped the point: Imperial Tobacco's Robert Bexon in 1984 confided to his Canadian cotobacconists that \u2018If our product was not addictive we would not sell a cigarette next week\u2019. American cigarette makers have been quietly celebrating addiction since the 1950s, when one expressed how \u2018fortunate for us\u2019 it was that cigarettes \u2018are a habit they can't break\u2019. Cigarette smoking itself, though, is less an expression of freedom than the robbery of it. And so long as we allow the companies to cast themselves as defenders of liberty, the table is unfairly tilted. We have to recognise that smoking compromises freedom, and that retiring cigarettes would enlarge human liberties.\"A ban helps smokers quit; most smokers *want* to quit. We thus both increase liberty and prevent harm at the same time.CRIME & ILLEGAL SMOKINGAs Proctor states [3]:\"Another objection commonly raised to any call for a ban is that this will encourage smuggling, or even organised crime. But that is rather like blaming theft on fat wallets. Smuggling is already rampant in the cigarette world, as a result of pricing disparities and the tolerance of contraband or even its encouragement by cigarette manufacturers. Luk Joossens and Rob Cunningham have shown how cigarette manufacturers have used smuggling to undermine monopolies or gain entry into new markets or evade taxation. And demand for contraband should diminish, once the addicted overcome their addiction\u2014a situation very different from prohibition of alcohol, where drinking was a more recreational drug. And of course, even a ban on the sale of cigarettes will not eliminate all smoking\u2014nor should that be our goal, since people should still be free to grow their own for personal use. Possession should not be criminalised; the goal should only be a ban on sales. Enforcement, therefore, should be a trivial matter, as is proper in a liberal society.\"ECONOMYCon states: \"The second thing is the economy would go down. They would give up more than 150 billion dollars which is a lot. So we would not be in the best state. Sorry for this being so short.\"As Proctor states [3]:\"Apart from reducing human suffering, abolishing the sale of cigarettes would result in savings in the realm of healthcare costs, increased labour productivity, lessened harms from fires, reduced consumption of scarce physical resources, and a smaller global carbon footprint. Abolition would ... effectively eliminate one of the historical forces behind global warming denial and environmental obfuscation.\"Ending cigarette consumption is literally better than ending war, in terms of lives and money saved.As the New South Wales Dept. of Health states:Cigarette smoking costs \"$2.9408\" billion dollars in New South Wales, population 7.439 million. If we assume constant levels of cost across the world, then smoking would cost roughly 2.9 *trillion* dollars, per year.It's worth the tiny loss of profit, because of the gains from health, productivity, and elsewhere.[1] http://www.cdc.gov...[2] http://www.tobaccofreekids.org...[3] http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com...[4] http://www.health.nsw.gov.au...",

            "discussionTitle": "Cigarettes Should be Illegal",
            "conclusion": "Cigarettes Should be Illegal",
            "premise": "Food comparison: Two wrongs do not make a right. Just because people can eat themselves to an early death doesn't mean they should also be allowed to smoke themselves to an early death. The same logic would require us to legalize all hard drugs. People can make their own decisions regarding heroin. However, legalizing it would seem to sanction its use, make it more easily accessible, and allow companies to advertise that doing heroin is a desirable lifestyle choice. Cigarette use is much more widespread than it should be due to positive advertising from the cigarette companies that reach children (but do not necessarily \"target\" them). Eating cannot be criminalized, since there isn't a clear brightline between what fat or sugar content is considered healthy and what in considered unhealthy. It depends on the expert who is studying the issue and the metabolism of the individual eating the food. In contrast, cigarettes are all unambiguously unhealthy. However, I would argue that marketing fatty foods to children using fun characters like Ronald McDonald should be illegal, which answers your objections. In addition, Jamie Oliver on Food Revolution explains that fast food is okay when eaten in moderation, such as once a month. Oliver, in spite of his healthy eating credentials, admits to taking his children to fast food restaurants once a month. So eating McDonald's once a month is not incompatible with a healthy lifestyle. In fact, most children who become obese do so because of the food they choose to eat at home and the foods they pick at their school cafeteria (in addition to a lack of exercise), not because of fast food visits. Because obesity is not directly correlated to fast food, banning fast food would do very little. However, banning cigarettes would directly correlate to fewer smoking-related deaths and illnesses. Ingesting a quarter-pounder with cheese is not quite the same as sucking poison and tar into your lungs. Only one of those actions can be mitigated with daily exercise. Also, keep in mind that quitting fast food will not give you withdrawal symptoms. Cigarettes contain an addictive drug (nicotine) that the government should have the right to regulate/ban. Health care: Yes, a very small number of plans cover abortions. However, abortions do not raise the cost of health care for everyone in the nation by $75 billion a year. Marketing to kids: When every single cigarette advertisement that is viewed by a child increases the child's chance of smoking by 182%, you have to admit there is a serious problem. Our psychologies are complicated regarding advertising, especially when we are children. The \"choice\" that you keep falling back on is not as simple as weighing the pros and cons and making a rational decision of whether or not to smoke. The choice: It is society's job to adjudicate competing rights claims. Cigarette smokers have the right to smoke. Non-cigarette smokers have the right not to be forcibly exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay the hidden health care costs for smokers. It is now society's job to decide whose rights should supersede the other group's rights. Nicotine is an addictive drug, the only recreational addictive drug that is legal. Although fast food and alcohol have some addictive properties, quitting either of them will not give you withdrawal symptoms. If we can remove a choice to do other addictive drugs like heroin, why can we not do so with nicotine? We recognize in our society that addiction is not truly a choice. I'd like to note that at the end of the day, my opponent has no response to the fact that the hidden productivity and health care costs mean that non-smokers have to pay $7.18 for each pack of cigarettes that a smoker purchases. This unfair economic burden is why cigarettes should be banned. Prohibition: Cigarettes (today) are not analogous to alcohol (during the Prohibition Era). CBS News says in 2006 that: 71% of Americans drink alcohol regularly. [1] Prohibition obviously was going to fail when 7 of 10 Americans consumed the substance regularly. In contrast, many fewer people smoke cigarettes, approximately 20%. [2] In addition, the 7 of 10 Americans who drink alcohol mostly do not want to quit. Most of them drink socially and in moderation, which studies show can actually be healthy (riboflavin in red wine helps heart health). In contrast, most smokers actually want to quit because they know cigarettes harm their health, but they feel hooked. A Gallup poll in 2005 found that \"more than three out of four smokers want to kick the smoking habit.\" [3] A ban would help motivate those 3 out of 4 smokers to quit. Obviously, since most smokers actually want to quit, there would not be the same backlash that there was during Prohibition. Economic benefits of smoking: First, keep in mind that a smoking ban in the United States would not necessarily force farmers to stop growing tobacco. Farmers could theoretically be allowed to sell the tobacco to companies that don't make cigarettes (nicotine gum companies for example) or could sell the tobacco to other countries where cigarettes are still legal. In addition, the $2 billion added to the economy from smoking is completely outweighed by the $157 billion lost every single year from the economy from smoking due to lost productivity and higher health care costs. Right to smoke: Remember from before that others have the right not to be exposed to secondhand smoke and not to have to pay higher health care premiums. Society must decide whose rights are more important. In addition, people may have the right to do heroin, that doesn't mean that we should allow them to do so. Maybe people should also have the \"right\" to have a consensual sexual relationship with a child. Our moral repugnance to this example shows two things: 1) children cannot make fully informed decisions, which proves my advertising point (remember 9 out of 10 smokers start smoking as children) and 2) that we should pass laws that maximize the benefits for all society when rights are in conflict (an adult's right to have a sexual relationship vs. a parent's right to protect their child). In summary, ban smoking because it is not really a choice \u2013 most people choose to smoke as children because they are inundated with advertising convincing them to do so. 3 out of 4 of them later in life would like to quit, but feel like they cannot; a ban would help them quit. Smoking is unfair because it impedes on the rights of non-smokers. Non-smokers have the right to a smoke free environment that does not endanger their health or the lives of their children. Non-smokers also have the right not to have to pay for the costs of smoking. Remember, each $5 pack of cigarettes costs society an additional $7.18 in hidden costs. [1] http://www.cbsnews.com...

You said and I quote \" I choose to value the lives of thousands of people over the farming business of thousands of farmers.\" My argument's objective is to justify my case why the state of legality of the two drugs should stay as they are. Cannabis illegal and Cigarettes legal. Your response touched on why its very beneficial for those especially around cigarette smokers to be moved away from harm, that was valid and you also spoke about why it would be problem to illegalize cigarettes due to conflict between government and those that feel they have a right. If that's the case then its justifiable for cigarettes to stay legal, although their state of legality has brought so many deaths throughout the world. If we look at it from a neutral position then its best we illegalize both drugs but if we look at it from an intellectual view then we'll realize that we cant change what has been been done. We cant bring back the lives safely but one thing we have to come to terms with is how Cigarettes have \" May be hazardous to health' written clearly in bold white lettering, this shows how the manufactures understand how people need the Nicotine but it warns them meaning that the decision for people to go to the grave or to acquire diseases associated with smoking plays a role on the number of deaths and so we cant illegalize it due to health factors when people clearly make an informed decision. Illegalizing Cigarettes will cause a lot of problems for a lot of lives, mainly those that Con clearly values and those are the number of farmers that are in the Tobacco business, not only are they just farmers and Con perceives them but these are Thousands of farmers in continents but not only does a farmer represent his Tobacco but also his staff of hundreds or even thousands depending on the size of his/her farm, especially those farmers on African soil that provide not only money as a salary but a means to preserve and look after large families in places where there is shortage of food due to corruption in governments. (which isn't their fault ) Lets think of the poverty that could come forth from the taking away of Cigarette production. To take away a family of 7 or 8 the only way to buy food and other basic necessities and not luxuries but basic necessities like taking their children to school and to give them a roof over their head. THAT IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE Sir. To conclude I ask you to be open minded as to the consequences of illegalizing Cigarettes which out whey the benefits which although could save many lives but also could devastate the lives of many people. Because in no way are they disadvantaged on the basis that there is no clear warnings. I propose we find an alternative way to pump Nicotine which I the addictive drug into the bodies of those addicted because its not the nicotine that gives cancer but 200 substances out of 4000 found in cigarettes that give cancer.

Cigarettes also release nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanides and ammonia (1). Nitrogen Oxide is the binary compound of nitrogen and oxygen. There are many types of these compounds including Nitrous Oxide, also known as \"laughing gas\" and is used in surgery due to its anesthetic effects (2), Dinitrogen Tetroxide, which is used for rocket fuel (3), and Trinitramide, a type of rocket propellant oxidizer (4). There is a multitude of ingredients that also contribute to the deadliness of cigarettes. A very important difference between these two situations is that one does not inhale natural gas from a car through paper usually multiple times a day and for the rest of their life. Some more important differences between these two situations are that the inhalation of natural gas is not addictive, is not distributed to the public as a drug, and does not require one to be 18 to use it for public transportation. Cars have become electric and they are not banned because they are a necessity for transportation so that people can go to work, pay their bills, and keep food on the table for themselves and their families. Cigarettes have become electric and contain less deadly ingredients. The sale, distribution, consumption, and creation of traditional cigarettes need to be banned because smoking destroys families by killing and leaving some with permanent damage for the rest of their lives. Cigarettes are not a stress reliever. They create more stress. They are also considered to be poison. (1) http://www.tricountycessation.org... (2) http://en.wikipedia.org...
