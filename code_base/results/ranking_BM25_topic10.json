Because of the nature of our health system, these risks should be taken into account, and the risks that a parent wants expose their children to should be their own decision. Second of all, all public school systems and most private school systems already require the immunization of children. The fact that most parents send their children to school is clear sign that most children are already being vaccinated for the biggest diseases(such as hepatitis.) The few parents without children attending school would not have much risk of having their child exposed to such a diesease, as the vast majority of the population (attending public or private schools) are immunized. Therefore, it can be seen that an official mandate to REQUIRE all parents to immunize their children is unnessesary because the vast majority of our population, that attend public and private schools have already been vaccinized, and with a majority of the population immune, a spread of diesease is unlikely.",

The Ecowatch a website who concentrates on our economy and problems in the society stated in an article titled \" CDC Knew Its Vaccine Program Was Exposing Children to Dangerous Mercury Levels Since 1999\", \"Uncovered documents show that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) knew that infant vaccines were exposing American children to mercury far in excess of all federal safety guidelines since 1999. The documents, created by a FDA consulting toxicologist, show how federal regulators concealed the dangerous impacts and lied to the public...In 1997, Congress passed the FDA Modernization Act. A provision of that statute required the FDA to \"compile a list of drugs that contain intentionally introduced mercury compounds, and provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the mercury compounds on the list.\" In response, manufacturers reported the use of the mercury-based preservative, thimerosal, in more than 30 licensed vaccines...\". Based on this article published in 2017, how do we know our children will be safe? If they have exposed our children once to dangerous chemicals, how do we know it will not happen again. This demonstrates the government does not care about our children, what are these vaccines really for? We are not experiments to simply test how many chemicals our body can intake, and neither are our children. Vaccines are not safe and neither are our children if we allow them to receive them.

There is a reason we have vaccines and if a parent abuses a child , then they are held accountable , well in my eyes risking a childs health by not getting them vaccinated is a form of abuse, although it may not be as bad as hitting a child .. it is putting your child at risk to contract a disease that is preventable. The Government should have the right to rid our country of potential disease outbreaks and threats . Since I made the mistake of posting this below let me add more There are also elderly that are not vaccinated because a vaccine may not have come out until after they were older, and they can't get the vaccine at their age... why should these parents be allowed to chance their children infecting others.

            "premise": "Thanks to Miguel for accepting. I will now construct my case. I apologize for keeping my arguments rather short; I am running low on time.MY CASEParents have basic societal obligations to their children. By choosing to engage in actions that would lead to pregnancy, parents must accept the consequences of those actions, i.e. custodianship of a child or of children. It is a parent's job to act in the best interests of their child to ensure that he or she is healthy and capable of handling themselves in the broader world. I will contend that vaccinations are an essential part of meeting these parental obligations, inasmuch as they are in the best interests of the child. If that's true, then the resolution is affirmed.\"Vaccines have historically been the most effective means to fight and eradicate infectious diseases.\" [1] For example, \"In 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted. After the introduction of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. Fifty-four of those infections were associated with importation from another country, although only 13% were actually acquired outside the United States; 63 of the 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.\" [1]\"[I]mmunization currently averts more than 2.5 million deaths every year in all age groups from [diseases like] diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles.\" [2] By failing to immunize individuals in disease-prone areas, 2.1 million innocent people die every year from otherwise preventable ailments. Requiring immunizations will drastically reduce that staggering number. [2] Past experience confirms that vaccinations have reduced the amount of serious illnesses. Tetanus was reduced by 98.5% by using vaccines, Pertussis 92.1%, and the same with Diphtheria at 99.9%, and HIB 98.8%, as well as Polio with 100% eradication. [2] \u201c[I]f countries could raise vaccine coverage to a global average of 90%, by 2015 an additional two million deaths a year could be prevented among children under five years old. This would have a major impact on meeting the global goal to reduce child deaths by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. It would also greatly reduce the burden of illness and disability from vaccine-preventable diseases, and contribute to improving child health and welfare, as well as reducing hospitalization costs.\u201d [3] \u201cWith the exception of safe water, no other modality [treatment], not even antibiotics, has had such a major effect on mortality reduction.\u201d [3]In fact, a lack of immunization has led to outbreaks here in the U.S., which lacks the kind of unsanitary conditions of many developing countries. What this shows is that when you control for things like hygiene or even in environments are clean and otherwise healthy, vaccinations are still key components of warding off disease. \"California\u2019s worst episode of whooping cough, or pertussis, in 2010, likely spread among unvaccinated children to infect 9,210 youngsters...[N]ew research published in the journal Pediatrics reports that the high number of children who were intentionally unvaccinated also contributed to the rapid spread of the infection...The researchers of the Pediatrics study compared the number of intentionally unvaccinated children who entered kindergarten from 2005 to 2010 to the onset of the whooping cough outbreak in 2010. They were able to identify 39 regional clusters of kids with non-medical reasons for being unvaccinated, and two clusters that were significantly related to rapid spread of whooping cough. Children who are intentionally not vaccinated and become infected with diseases like measles or pertussis, can pass the illness on to those who can\u2019t be immunized, such as babies under six months and those with compromised immune systems, such as cancer patients.\" [4]Another example of this kind of contagion caused through failure to vaccinate can be found in Texas. \"In August, the Texas megachurch Eagle Mountain International Church made headlines after 21 members of its congregation contracted measles...The church...advocated abstaining from vaccinations over fears that they can cause autism. The outbreak was traced back to a church member who had traveled abroad on a mission trip and then spread measles among the unvaccinated congregation.\" [5]Therefore, it is clear the vaccinating children is in their best interest, to not only prevent a society where disease resistance is low, but to immunize the child against disease-carriers even in a largely vaccinated society such as the U.S. It is a simple, common sense precaution that parents are clearly obliged to undertake.SOURCES1 - http://en.wikipedia.org...2 - http://www.who.int...3 - http://www.vaccine-safety-training.org...4 - http://healthland.time.com...5 - http://www.healthline.com...",

Many parents that don't get their children vaccinated were vaccinated themselves. Would you rather the small chance of your child being vaccinated or risk them contracting diseases such as small pox, polio, hepatitis A , measles , mumps , rubella, hepatitis B , meningitis, some ear infections.

            "premise": "Thanks again to Con for the debate. I may quote him at times during my rebuttal, and so I will put his remarks in italics to distinguish them from my own.CON's CASE\"I'm a 18 year old boy, perfectly fine, I've taken only 3 or 4 vaccines in my entire life, and I never had any serious problem whatsoever.\"This is a cherry-picking fallacy. Just because one person, or even because several people, can live perfectly good lives having taken no or few vaccines does not mean, as a general policy, that it is a good idea to not vaccinate yourself or your children. There are two reasons why this is true. Firstly, the severity of the danger (the risk of catching serious illnesses like measles, chickenpox, or polio) outweigh any supposed benefits to not vaccinating yourself. Even if the risk of catching those diseases is low, these diseases are so serious that it is not worth even taking a low risk of catching them. For instance, before vaccines, measles killed about 545,000 per year, chickenpox killed about 8,900, and polio killed about 3,000. [1, 2, 3] These disease can also severely injure those they don't kill, for example, polio can lead to irreversible paralysis. [4, 5]\"In this world there's not right or wrong, there is just point of view. You say it's right to vaccinate, I say it's not, who it's really right?...So, you say that responsibility and obligations it's doing what everyone thinks it's correct, but maybe responsibility it's just freedom, doing what we believe, and not what everyone tells you to do.\"Pro makes a claim about moral relativism, but offers no philosophical framework or justification to ground his position, so as such, it is unsubstantiated. Moreover, Pro's position would invariably mean that we could never hold anyone accountable for anything because we do \"what we believe, and not what everyone tells [us] to do.\" So, if I believe wantonly torturing people for fun is moral, or if I believed that throwing a baby into a pool and watching them drown is moral, then, according to Pro's logic, I would be justified in doing those things. But clearly, this type of reasoning would lead to a totally unworkable society--morality creates implicit norms of behavior designed to bring order to humanity's chaos, and, therefore, if we were to embrace what Pro is saying, we would subsequently divorce ourselves from morality. In other words, Pro's argument subverts morality, which is not something we should countenance in this debate.But, even if we allow that when things are subjective we should leave people to their own devices (perhaps a more reasonable/charitable interpretation of Con's assertions), then we should still obligate action when things are obvious. The effectiveness of vaccines is not, as Con suggests, an issue of opinion; it is an issue of scientific fact. The overwhelming volume of evidence supports the fact that they work, and because it is fact--not opinion--that they are in the best interests of the child, we can morally compel parents to immunize their children.\"Who could you say for sure, that vaccines always had been the decisive point of decrease in eradicating diseases.\"I never made the claim that vaccines were always the \"decisive point,\" I merely claimed that they were significant contributors, and that the facts show them to be effective.\"From the 40 reasons why you should never vaccinate infants...there are some that I would like to reinforce, like the huge side effects that most of people are unaware of.\"First of all, you cannot just refer people to a source and tell them to read it themselves, as this could easily be regarded as an attempt to circumvent character limits. Secondly, that source is riddled with innaccuracies. Allow me to point out a couple:The Article Claims: \"The mercury, aluminum and live viruses in vaccines is behind the huge epidemic of autism (1 in 10 worldwide as per doctors in the USA), a fact that has been admitted by the US Vaccine Court.\"Reality: \"in the case of Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services (Case #98-916V), the battle over vaccine injuries moved into the courts. A panel of three special masters began hearing the first cases of the historic Omnibus Autism Proceedings in June 2007. The lead petitioners...claimed that Michelle's autism was caused by a vaccine...On February 12, 2009, the court ruled in three test cases that the combination of the MMR vaccine and thiomersal-containing vaccines were not to blame for autism.\" [6] In other like cases where the courts ruled in favor of the petitioners, they did not find that the vaccines were dangerous, rather, \"the case was conceded without proof of causation.\" [6]The Article Claims: \"Autistic children also suffer from severe bowel disorders. As per Dr Andrew Wakefield, this is due to the vaccine strain live measles virus in the MMR vaccine. Nearly all children become fully autistic after the MMR shot.\"Reality: \"Andrew Jeremy Wakefield...is a British former surgeon and medical researcher, known for his fraudulent 1998 research paper in support of the now-discredited claim that there is a link between the administration of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the appearance of autism and bowel disease.\" [7]There are no citations in the article, and the article of one man, who, as the abovementioned falsities suggest, is merely grasping at straws to make his case, cannot outweigh legions of other scientist and their more credible findings. Moreover, the writer of the article isn't even a medical expert: \"Chatterjee was once a journalist with a national English-language daily newspaper in India. He moved on to a public sector company, rising to be a regional director of the company.\" [8]As for the other sources Con cites, their credibility is equally dubious, and one even admits, \"Since they were introduced in the early 20th century, vaccines have been a tremendous medical and scientific success. Today perceived as a necessity, they are so familiar to us that their potential risks are rarely mentioned.\" Besides, even if you buy that there is an outside risk of autism, the proven benefits of vaccines outweigh that chance.Thus, I affirm.SOURCES1 - http://en.wikipedia.org...2 - http://en.wikipedia.org...3 - http://en.wikipedia.org...4 - http://www.who.int...5 - http://www.ct.gov...6 - http://en.wikipedia.org...7 - http://en.wikipedia.org...8 - http://encyclopediaantivaccinemovement.blogspot.com...",

            "premise": "Due to the character limit of 10,000 characters, simply refuting my opponent's case (as it is quite short) would take up very little space. As such, I will go ahead and defend my points. Please note that this doesn't give any advantage to me, but actually allows my opponent to refute my arguments in the next round. Thus, this allows more debate without imposing any unfair advantage to either opponent. -- I will begin with my opponent's case, and then move on to my own.Observations:1. \"Required by public schools\" will remain.2. I also agree you don't have full BoP. I explained this. 60-40 sounds fair, if that's how my opponent wishes to distribute it.However, it would be typical for the full weight to rest on my opponent, as he is promoting a shift from the status quo. Argument I: \"I think that if kids are required to get vaccines that there shouldn't be religious exemptions.\"1. My gives not logical reasoning behind his argument for this point.2. Religious exemptions should be permitted, as I have and will demonstrate.Argument II: \"The parents risk getting their kids seriously sick for there personal beliefs.\"1. It is a parent's job to do what they see best for their children.2. Their job description is as follows: \"Fill bellies, maintain home, cradle, protect, teach, guide, listen, empathize, communicate, accept, trust, check up on, love, discipline, role model, doctor, clean and wash, (and then clean and wash some more) tolerate . . . and enjoy.\" [1]3. They are the parent and subsequently have the authority to do what they feel is best for their children. If they feel that vaccinations are uneccesary for religious reasons, it is their choice.4. The correct use of \"there\" would be \"their\" in the context of the sentence my opponent used. [2]With my opponent's case refuted, I will move to my own, and his arguments against it.Contention I: Religious exemption is already permitted.\"There isn't really much to debunk here you basically just pointed out that most places allow religious exemptions. Just because most places allow it doesn't make it correct.\"1. Given that it is of a majority accepted lends evidence towards the idea that it *should* be accepted.2. My opponent proves nothing with his argument and uses no evidence. Thus, we remain with the only side that provided an argument. (Pro)3. I have and will demonstrate in other contentions as to how exemption should be permitted, and there should not be a change to the status quo.Contention II: Some vaccinations contain components which can violate religious beliefs.\"Yes it's true that there are ingredients that can violate the parents religious convictions. However when you are talking about getting first graders vaccinated, it's irrelevant. Because first grader don't have a religion. They have whatever there parents tell them they have. A first grader hasn't but any thought into it. He's whatever his parents tell him to be.\"1. My opponent concedes that these vaccinations violate religious freedom, whether of the parent or the child.2. My opponent earlier agreed that the resolution should refer to what is \"required by public school.\" By default, this would include every grades from kindergarten to senior year.3. Individuals are capable of choosing their religion in a majority of those grades.4. Moreover, children are often products of their environment. Logic demonstrates that, on general, if the parent is religious, the child will be religious as well.5. Parental guidance is necessary to help children grow and mature. Teens, and even children aren't fully matured until they are older. [3][4] Thus, parents can and should guide their children based on their beliefs (including religion).\"However my bigger issue with it, is that I don't think the religion of the parents of one kid should be allowed to endanger the health of all the other kids in that school. You address this later in your argument saying something along the lines of \" If my kid doesn't get vaccinated it doesn't matter if your kid is. The issue with this is that vaccines are not 100% effective. They work very well and everyone should get them, but sometimes they fail. So if one kid doesn't get vaccinated because his parents don't want him to and he gets say chicken pox, well he is a danger to other kids even if they have there vaccination because if the vaccination they got didn't work, well now that kid has gotten someone else sick because his parents don't personally like that vaccination.\"1. My oppnent has yet to mention a single instance in which religious exemption has resulted in getting other children fatally sick.2. My opponent also concedes that vaccines are not 100% effective, and that they sometimes fail.3. My opponent has only established a correlation between sickenss and non-vaccination, but has not linked the cause to religious exemption.4. Because of the lack of examples supporting his/her reasoning, you would vote for the status quo (including religious exemption).\"However even that isn't my biggest issue with religious exemption. My biggest issue is that parents are legally allowed to put there kid's health in danger because they personally don't like what's in the vaccine. If the parents don't want to get there kids the measles vaccine because they're religion doesn't like it and the kid gets measles then the parents religion put the child in danger. ColeTrain would you honest say that parents should be allow to risk getting there five and six year old children getting sick and even possibly dying all because the parents don't like it. It's the same reason i don't think faith healing should be allowed. Because the parents religion can't be used as a justification to put a child in danger.\"1. My opponent has not established the link between correlation and causation.2. Correlation =/= Causation3. Thus, my opponent cannot continue to say that religious exemption has *any* effect on others getting sick.4. Most religious individuals who decline vaccinations either believe in divine healing or still go to the doctor to treat diseases.5. Putting children at risk does not fit into this model if the children are actually still treated at the doctor or believe in divine healing already.6. His claim that I support putting 5-6 year olds in danger is totally bogus. I support divine healing, but these people also sometimes go to doctors. Moreover, it is not only 5-6 year olds that are affected. Net benefit is utilitarian, and thus, so is my position.Contention III: Religious exemption is protected under the US Constitution.\"You say religious exemption is protected under the first amendment. Well I disagree. Here is why. The first amendment protection is only when religion doesn't conflict with other peoples freedom or harm others. As I showed above not vaccinating your kid puts that kid and others around him in danger. So your religion is harming others and so is not protected under the first amendment.\"1. My opponent cites no interpretation except his own.2. I provided my interpretation, backed by Cornell University.3. The first amendment protects the free exercise or religion. Prohibiting that in any manner is an infringement on individual rights.Contention IV: Vaccinations aren't totally safe.\"Yes it's true vaccines can cause side effects. For most people it doesn't but it can. I am in favor of medical exemptions. If getting a vaccine poses a significant risk to a kids health and safety then yes they can be exempted. However that is rare and for everyone else they should get vaccinated. Also you bring up the vaccine and autism link. This has been disproved many times and in fact the author of that study lost his medical license and got thrown in jail because the study was so bad. So that's invalid.\"1. My opponent concedes; vaccinations do cause side effects and aren't totally safe.2. Medical exemption is irrelevant. This debate is about religious exemption. Presenting a counterplan in the Pro position, in the 2nd round, is not allowed.3. I was only referencing the RETRACTED study to show that there have been studies conducted about the topic.Contention V: Flawed arguments envelop anti-exemption.\"I have addressed everything in this argument. But I will address one thing. You say that if people accept the risks then let them take them. However this doesn't work because we are talking about kids. So the parents are not the one who are taking the risk. They are forcing there kids sometimes as young as six to accept life threatening risks. If a adult doesn't want to get vaccinated I don't care. However parent forcing little kids to take life threatening risks is unacceptable and should not be allowed.\"1. As I've said before, it is the parents moral and social responsibility to care for and guide their children as they see fit.2. If religious exemption is what the parents see best fit for their child, then that is what should happen.3. As I have demonstrated multiple times, in multiple ways, religious exemption should be permitted.Conclusion:I have explicitly demonstrated both moral and pragmatic grounds to preserve religous exemption in regards to vaccinations for students attending public schools. Thus, I have fulfilled my burden of proof and upheld my side of the resolution.Sources:[1] http://www.easternflorida.edu...[2] http://wsuonline.weber.edu...[3] http://hrweb.mit.edu...[4] http://www.livescience.com...",

            "conclusion": "THW make vaccines mandatory",
            "premise": "All around the world, human lives are being lost due to preventable diseases whose spread could be slowed through immunization. As such, I am proud to, as Pro, support legislation that would make immunization mandatory. Model For this debate, \u201cthis house\u201d refers to first world nations such as the United States or Canada, where the infrastructure necessary for creating and distributing vaccines is already present and well-maintained; this means that issues such as the economical burden vaccination places on health care systems will not be discussed in much detail. I believe that all people should be legally obligated to be vaccinated, except for those who can have severe allergic reactions to vaccines. The possible consequences of refusing vaccination include fines and forced vaccination. Signpost For this round, I will be making three points: firstly, that vaccines are safe and effective, and secondly, that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens\u2014even if it may result in less opportunities for people to choose personally, and finally, that vaccination should not be a choice since herd immunity means that one\u2019s decision not to vaccinate can affect others as well. Safety and effectiveness of vaccines Scientific research has shown vaccines to be safe and effective. As this debate has limited space, I will not list all of the vaccines that exist, and talk about the effectiveness of each one; instead, I will provide examples of safe and effective vaccines. Flu vaccines are an example of an effective vaccine. In a 1998 study involving children published by the New England Journal of Medicine showed that the intranasal flu vaccine increased antibodies in the bodies of its recipients, and decreased the likelihood of flu. Results showed that the vaccine was more effective than placebo. (1) A 2012 study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases showed that flu vaccines \u201cwas associated with a three-quarters reduction in the risk of life-threatening influenza illness in children.\u201d (2)For older adults, however, flu vaccines may have a lower efficacy\u2014but they still prevent 61.2% of flu hospitalizations. (3) At the same time, the flu vaccine is safe. Side effects are usually mild and short-lasting; they are generally limited to mild, flu-like symptoms, and may involve mild pain around the injection site. Severe reactions may, however, rarely occur. (4) MMR vaccines are also safe and effective. It has an efficacy of around 85-95% with one dose and 100% with two. In addition, the risk of getting hurt by the vaccine is low: there is a 0.65 to 1.8/1000000 chance of getting anaphylaxis from a shot.(6)(7)(8) Compare this to the dangers of the actual diseases: measles has a 2000/1000000 chance of causing death, and the rubella virus\u2014but not the vaccine\u2014has a chance of causing autism. (8) As you can see from above, scientific evidence has shown vaccines to be safe and effective in preventing diseases; as such, they provide a net benefit to society as a whole. Governmental responsibility One way someone can object to mandatory vaccinations is freedom of choice: people have the right to choose what they\u2019d like to do with their bodies, don\u2019t they? However, this objection falls apart as soon as one considers the issue of governmental responsibility. The government has the responsibility to keep us safe; this is why they us the law to require seat belts to be worn, and why we aren\u2019t allowed to drink and drive. Since vaccines keep us safe, the government ought to make them mandatory, just like how seat belts are mandatory. Why Vaccination should not be a choice When you drive without a seatbelt on, you are only compromising your own safety. However, when you refuse to be vaccinated, you are also harming those around you. Vaccines help protect us from disease, but that can only be the case if enough people get vaccinated; this is called herd immunity. With the MMR vaccine, for instance, 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated for it to have any effect. (5) Since one should not legally get the right to choose when one\u2019s choices can harm others, and choosing not to be vaccinated harms others, vaccination ought to be legally obligated. ConclusionIn this debate, I have shown that firstly, vaccines are safe and effective, that secondly, the government has the right to protect people from themselves, and vaccines do just that; and finally, that the government has the right to protect people from eachother, and vaccines do that also. As such, I have shown that we ought to make vaccination mandatory. Thank you.

            "conclusion": "Not getting children vaccinated",
            "premise": "First of all, I never said that vaccines are not worth their risks. I stated that one should have the right to consider the risks, and decide what to put into their or their children's bodies. And while I'm on the topic of free choice, you brought up an important point about people being exempt to due to religious beliefs. Now, proposing a mandate that would FORCE these individuals to vaccinate against their religion is clearly in violation of their Constitutional rights. However, lets move on to the point you brought up of certain dieseases spreading. The United States vaccination policy has used a concept known as \"herd immunity\" in which the majority of the population is vaccinated and immune. Now that we have established this \"herd immunity,\" many dieseases cannot spread very far. You stated that due to lack of use for the MMR, measles cases have increased. However, because most of the American population are immunized with MMR, then these cases can be quickly contained. Therefore, our system already works, and it does not seem worth the effort to mandate vaccinations. While, yes it would have benefits, the problems that come with a mandatory vaccination make it unfeasible. There are two levels in which mandatory vaccinations for children would be ineffective. One is on the federal level. In order to make sure that EVERY child in the United States gets the vaccinations (and future boosters to vaccinations), a great deal of effort and money needs to be spent. If you have seen our national deficit recently, along with Social security fund security, then it is clear that it is not feasible for the government to implement, and ENFORCE this vaccination policy to all children. The second level that we can look at is on the citizen's level. While you are right, a responsible parent should get their children vaccinated (unless of moral and religous beliefs), you are assuming that every parent in America has the capability to pay for such vaccinations. This is not the case. In America, 45 MILLION americans, including 9 million children, lack health insurance. Some of the vaccines that have been mentioned, such as the HPV vaccine, consist of multiple shots. According to the Center of Diesease control, the 3 HPV shots can cost up to 360 dollars PER SHOT. Other vaccinations cost less, however, the way that you have proposed mandating vaccinations creates a long list of vaccines that must be paid by these uninsured parents. Since the incomes of many of these uninsured families are low, it is difficult to concieve a low income family paying thousands of dollars for vaccinations. While many low-income parents will still put their Children's safety first, it should not be forced upon them to pay for EVERY ONE of the vaccines available. Also, mandatory vaccinations will raise insurance premiums for all members of society. And many insurances might not cover all these vaccinations, therefore hurting the pockets of even the insured. In conclusion, a mandated vaccination not only infringes upon a citizens right to religious beliefs and choice, but the costs outweigh the benefits because of simply an inability on the federal and citizen's level to pay for such vaccinations. You have stated before that parents that do not vaccinate their children are irresponsible, yet it is the duty of the parent to do what is best for their kids.",

            "premise": "Thanks again to Con for the debate. I may quote him at times during my rebuttal, and so I will put his remarks in italics to distinguish them from my own.First, it is important to note though that Con drops my entire case. At this point in the debate, it is too late for him to respond to it as that would constitute making new arguments. So, that means the entire debate comes down to whether the risks of \"side-effects\" Con mentions outweighs the proven efficacy of vaccines (and whether it outweighs that not vaccinating leads to the spread of disease and the onset of outbreaks). I will endeavor to show that it doesn't outweigh.Secondly, Con just posts links, he doesn't post into the round the substance of those links. That is a blatant attempt to avoid the character limits of the round, and unacceptable. Nothing that has not been explicitly stated in the round should be evaluated. That means that the so-called studies Con's references cannot be evaluated, since no quotes from them were posted here. But, even so, I will address the content of the articles anyway.\"Well, you see, it's proved that vaccines have side effects, and I don't say this just because I saw one time in a questionablewebsite, I say this because it's all over the web.\"This is a blatant ad populum fallacy. Just because a lot of people say something, that doesn't make it true. For instance, most people during Galileo's lifetime said that the solar system was Geocentric, even though it was actually Heliocentric. But, if we are going to use ad populum fallacies to make arguments, we should appeal to the most informed group of individuals, i.e. medical doctors. Most major medical organizations and doctors actually support vaccinations, and that says far more about immunizations that the \"web\" does. [1, 2]Moreover, of Con's sources don't give information about the sample sizes or reliability of any of the studies they cite. The Health Impact News link lists 49 sources that show the harmfulness of vaccines, yet the vast majority of those sources don't even mention vaccines or immunizations. Of those that do, they suggest that vaccines bear either slight risks for autism or cause harm by spurring brain encephalization in children. Yet, according to The Encephalitis Society, \"While vaccines are much safer than actually having the disease, they, like all medicines can carry a small risk of adverse reaction. The majority of adverse reactions are very mild, but can, very rarely include post-vaccination Encephalitis. The risk of developing vaccine-related Encephalitis is extremely small in comparison to the health risks associated with the diseases that vaccines prevent. Importantly, the data indicates that vaccines are in the order of 1,000 to 100,000 times safer than running the risk of contracting the disease.\" [3] Additionally, \"Evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism in children does not support such an association between thimerosal and autism. And a scientific review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that 'the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal\u2013containing vaccines and autism.' CDC supports the IOM conclusion that there is no relationship between vaccines and autism rates in children. Besides thimerosal, some people have had concerns about other vaccine ingredients in relation to autism as well. However, no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and autism.\" [4]Con's other links suggest that vaccines cause lymphoma or leukemia. Studies actually show no evidence for the notion that vaccines cause lymphoma: \"A link between SV40 and NHL is biologically plausible because SV40 causes hematological malignancies in laboratory rodents. However, detection of SV40 DNA in human NHL tumors has not been confirmed by other laboratories. Casting doubt on an association between SV40 and NHL, follow-up studies of recipients of SV40-contaminated poliovirus vaccines have not revealed these individuals to be at increased risk of NHL. Furthermore, 2 recent case-control studies of NHL documented only infrequent SV40 antibody reactivity among NHL cases, and the prevalence of SV40 antibodies was similar in cases and controls.\" [5] Regarding leukemia, \"there is some evidence suggesting that hepatitis B vaccination does not cause childhood leukaemia. During the period 1991 to 1998, when the rate of hepatitis B vaccination in American 2-year-olds was climbing from zero to over 80%, there was no corresponding increase in childhood leukaemia. According to the National Cancer Institute, 'Childhood leukemias appeared to increase in incidence in the early 1980s, with rate in the preceding years at fewer than 4 cases per 100,000. Rates in the succeeding years have shown no consistent upward or downward trend and have ranged from 3.7 to 4.8 cases per 100,000.'\" [6]Perhaps even more strikingly, one of the sources Con himself cites is in favor of vaccination, and reads in part: \"These troubling statistics show that the failure to vaccinate children endangers both the health of children themselves as well as others who would not be exposed to preventable illness if the community as a whole were better protected. Equally troubling, the number of deliberately unvaccinated children has grown large enough that it may be fueling more severe outbreaks. In a recent survey of more than 1,500 parents, one quarter held the mistaken belief that vaccines can cause autism in healthy children, and more than one in 10 had refused at least one recommended vaccine.\" [7]\"So imagine that you could say for sure that one of the vaccines have a bad side-effect. You are lowering the chance of having the possibility to contract some kind of disease to 0, because you have already contracted from vaccines. So you say that this is better? Doom yourself from the very start, just because \"the risk\" of catching something?\"This is an interesting hypothetical, but it doesn't really hold up. Most side-effects of vaccines are minor, and being inflicted by a guaranteed minor side-effect while ensuring that you avoid life-threatening illnesses like measles is completely worth it. And, more importantly, side-effects of vaccines are incredibly rare, and so, for parents looking at the cost-benefits, you have an extremely low risk of mostly minor side-effects compared with the danger of contract serious diseases. It's a no-brainer.\"In order to be free and be moral, we have to question ourselves. I don't believe you ever thought about vaccines having side-effects for example, and because you didn't know, and didn't questioned yourself before making a decision, that makes you moral correct? Moral: concerned with the principles of right and wrong behaviour.\"This is a kind of ad hominem, and has nothing to do with the debate. But, for the record, I did research the topic, and came to the conclusion that vaccines were net beneficial, so I did consider the possibility that they weren't. Furthermore, Con talks about the importance of freedom, but what freedom is death? When we fail to vaccinate our children and that results in their death or injury, we are denying them their freedom, and, to use Con's word, we treat them like \"cattle\" not has human beings. The effectiveness of vaccines is an objective fact, not subjective--and Con doesn't do much to rebut this.\"[Y]ou only cited things from one source mostly\"Actually, I cited 8 different sources. Each link led to a separate page, and each page referenced separate sources in its bibliography. Besides, quality should be preferred to quantity, and Con never contests that his primary source was riddled with errors and that some of his own sources supported vaccines. Con even writes: \"I admit that the website may not be the more trusted.\"1 - http://www.immunizeforgood.com...2 - http://www.pbs.org...3 - http://www.encephalitis.info...4 - http://www.who.int...5 - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...6 - http://www.cdc.gov...7 - http://www.scientificamerican.com...",

            "premise": "I. The Lives Saved The lives of 2.5 million children are saved by vaccinations every year, yet each year, 1.5 million children die from diseases that vaccines can prevent. [1] Not only that, but vaccines save you for your entire life. \"Vaccines teach your body's immune system to recognize infections so it can fight them off in the future.\" [2] But which diseases do vaccines prevent?\"Vaccines protect you by preparing your immune system to recognize and fight serious, and sometimes deadly, diseases including:\"Diphtheria\"Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib)\"Hepatitis A\"Hepatitis B\"Human Papillomavirus(HPV)\"Influenza(Flu)\"Measles\"Meningococcal\"Mumps\"Pertussis (Whooping Cough)\"Pneumococcal Disease\"Polio\"Rotavirus\"Rubella\"Shingles (Herpes Zoster)\"Tetanus\"Varicella(Chickenpox)\" [2]Every one of these diseases can be fatal. In fact, in the case of Diphtheria, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HPV, Measles, Mumps, Polio, and Rubella, there is no cure. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Every one of these has an effective vaccine. If we look at the Rotavirus vaccine, we see that it has prevented between 85% to 98% instances of the disease. [11] But what else happened when the Rotavirus finally got a vaccine?\"Millions of U.S. infants have received the rotavirus vaccine since it became available in 2006. Rotavirus disease among infants and young children has since decreased significantly in the United States. Each year, the vaccine prevents an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 hospitalizations among U.S. infants and young children. Rotavirus illness has also decreased among older children and adults that are not vaccinated; they are likely gaining indirect protection from rotavirus disease as vaccinated children are less likely to get the disease and spread it to others.\" [12]Not only is your life in danger of you don't receive one, but many people around you are at risk too. All of the diseases previously listed are highly contagious, hence the reason for a vaccine.II. The Rarity of Adverse Effects\"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in most cases vaccines effects are minor and go away within a few days. Side effects vary according to vaccine type, but generally mild side effects may include:\"Pain, redness, tenderness or swelling at injection site\"Fatigue\"Headache\"Itching at injection site\"Nausea\"Dizziness or fainting (most common in adolescents)\"Fever\"Mild rash\" [13]Now, let me compare this to the symptoms of, arguably, the least severe of the diseases listed previously, this being influenza. \"Fever or feeling feverish/chills.\"Cough\"Sore throat\"Runny or stuffy nose\"Muscle or body aches\"Headache\"Tiredness\"Some people may have vomiting or diarrhea; this is more common in children.\" [14] Not to mention that in extreme cases, the flu can lead to pneumonia, ear infections, dehydration, and possibly death. [14] The difference is that the flu is quite common, [15] While adverse effects from vaccines are quite rare. [16]\u201c'There are no surprises here; vaccines are being shown over and over again to be quite safe,' said Cornelia Dekker, MD, medical director of the vaccine program at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford, who chatted with me about the study earlier today. 'The safety record for our U.S.-licensed vaccines is excellent. There are a few vaccines for which they document that there are indeed adverse events, but the frequency is quite rare, and in almost all cases they are very easy to manage and self-limited.'\" [16] III. Recommendations From Major Health Organizations The CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Institute of Medicine (IOM), American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), UNICEF, US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), World Health Organization (WHO), Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Paediatric Society, National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) all recommend vaccines. [17] In fact, it's said to be one of the safest medical practices ever, despite its risks. [18]To add to this, the FDA and CDC are very strict when it comes to vaccinations. \"The United States has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in its history. Years of testing are required by law to ensure that vaccines are safe before they are made available in the United States. This process can take 10 years or longer. Once a vaccine is in use, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitor any possible side effects reported through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and other vaccine safety systems. Any hint of a problem with a vaccine prompts the CDC and FDA to carry out further investigations. If researchers find that a vaccine might be causing a problem, CDC and/or FDA can:\"Change vaccine labels or packaging\"Issue safety alerts\"Inspect manufacturers' facilities and records\"Withdraw recommendations for the use of the vaccine\"Revoke the vaccine's license\" [19]In conclusion, vaccines do move harm than good, as they save many lives, have few side effects, and are recommended by many major health organizations.

Religious objections should not be toleratedIII. Moral objections are noted, but consquensim and EskimosIV. Conspiracy theories are weakV. ConclusionsVI. SourcesI will be arguing that Compulsory vaccines should be enforced by law in the USA regardless of any religious, moral, or conspiracy theory objection.I. Vaccines save more lives than they cost and risk assessmentVaccines both save and cost humans lives. I will not misrepresent and present only one side, this would be cherry picking. A. Vaccines save livesThere are many scholarly peer reviewed articles showing the benefits of vaccines and other reliable sources.\"Vaccines given to infants and young children over the past two decades will prevent 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\" [0]B. Vaccines cost livesBetween adverse reactions, bad batches of vaccine, the pathogen is still alive and infects the patient, and medical errors. A good example of a medical error is the doctor and patient fail to communicate, and thus the patient is temporarily at risk due to other medical procedures. Yet, due to miscommunication the patient is given the vaccine treatment anyways. Vaccines occasionally kill the patient or cause harm. No treatment is 100% safe.\"Problems that could happen after any vaccine:Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at fewer than 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death.Older children, adolescents, and adults might also experience these problems after any vaccine: People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. Some people get severe pain in the shoulder and have difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. This happens very rarely.\" [1]Vaccines kill their patient less than one in a million . That's less than 1/1,000,000. C. Net of saving livesUnless, you believe in a major conspiracy theory there is very little doubt that vaccines save much more lives than they cost. Think of the lottery, most of the time people just squander their money. Yet, somebody must win eventually. You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery. Well, vaccines are like the lottery in reverse. Most of the time the benefits are helpful. Yet, someone always loses. We all take risks, driving or riding in a car. Mass transportation has its own risks. Walking and bicycling can be more risky. Then, there is random events, both man-made and non-man made. Tornadoes, hurricanes, crimes, and just plain old being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Life is full of risk, there is no way to avoid all risk.\"CONCLUSIONS:Patients and health care providers can be reassured that vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a rare event. Nevertheless, providers should be prepared to provide immediate medical treatment should it occur.\" [2]\"CONCLUSION:Anaphylactic reactions to MMR in the United States are rare. The reporting rate has the same order of magnitude as estimates from other countries. Almost one fourth of patients with reported anaphylaxis after MMR seem to have hypersensitivity to gelatin in the vaccine. They may be at higher risk of developing anaphylaxis to subsequent doses of other gelatin-containing vaccines. These people should seek an allergy evaluation before such immunization.\" [3]\"Known side effectsAdverse reactions to the HPV vaccine Ceravix, reported between April 2008 and 23 September 2009. Very few, and fairly mild.To put it simply: complications are more likely to arise from illness than from vaccination.What this means is that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks, by far, in every case. \" [4]II. Religious objections should not be toleratedThere is no logical reason to believe God exists. Religion has done a lot of harm lately. We see this mostly in the form of religious terrorists attacks, many of which are not Muslim based. Yet, being against vaccines has caused much harm in the world in a quiet more predicable way. \"But some mullahs in Bengal spread the rumor that the vaccine led to impotence and diarrhea (a bad combo) and urged mothers to keep their children away from the nurses and physicians\" [5]Don't vaccinate be like Afghanistan.III. Moral objections are noted, but consequentialism, senilicide, and EskimosI can understand some people having moral objections. Yet, if we look at native American Indian Eskimos we see an odd connection. That some Eskimos tribes leave their old in the snowy waste lands to die. That there is simply not enough resources to support the old. This action gives the young, healthy, and fertile a better chance at surviving and reproducing. Yes, animals are experimented on in vaccine research and people will die from vaccine medical treatments. Yet, this doesn't mean we should abandon reason and practically in the name of unrealistic ideologies. In an utopia society we would have a way to research vaccines without causing suffering to animals. That nobody would die from vaccine treatments. Yet, we have to face reality. More people will die if we reject vaccines.As for loss of freedom, how about the people's freedom who don't want to be infected? How about those too young, weak, or old to be vaccinated? The immunocompromised and people with contraindications to vaccines shouldn't be vaccinated, and thus are at risk. As I see the freedom dilemma is that your freedom ends at the other person's nose. My argument is that by not vaccinating you are infringing upon the people's around you freedom. IV. Conspiracy theories are weakConspiracy theories are weak and the supporting evidence for the theories have been disproven repeatably. The real conspirators are the quacks that promote the anti-vaccine movement for financial gain. Exploiting people's fears for profit is immoral. Furthermore, autism is caused by air pollution from car exhaust. V. Enforcement As for enforcement of mandatory vaccines, I assume reasonable measures are taken. Starting with a phone call from the doctor and a letter from local law enforcement. A reasonable grace period is granted if the non-compliant citizen responds to the phone call and letter. After the grace period or a brief time if there is no answer the law breaker is fine a reasonable fine, $100 a day per vaccine missed. This should be reasonable economic pressure on the non-compliant to comply with the law. VI. ConclusionsThere can only be one conclusion. That vaccines should be compulsory the benefits far outweigh the negative. The risk of complications from illness is greater than the risk from vaccines. The only reason the anti-vaccine movement is alive today is due to the depths of deception quacks and political machines like infowars will sink to. The deaths of children from non-vaccination is proof that some people will mislead and misinform the public at any cost. VII.

            "premise": "I'd like to start right away. Refutations \"However, only the parents who do choose to not vaccinate their children will find that their child has the sickness. According to my opponent himself, the children who are vaccinated should be okay. Therefore, the parents' decisions will not impact other children, if vaccinations are as useful as my opponent suggested.\" Exactly. That's the problem. Their child will have the sickness. They think they're safer off without the vaccination, however, that is untrue. They will obtain diseases, spread it onto other children who think they're safe without the vaccination, and then spread it to the kids who were going to get a vaccination. One child can get infected, due to a careless or careless parents, and then spread the danger to all his classmates or friends. The argument is not that the vaccinated kids will be sick, it's that one child can spread it to many others. The only ones who, in a sense, \"benefit,\" are the vaccinated ones. \"Thank you for giving us a lecture on the usefulness of the Hepatitis B vaccine. However, judged by your [#] symbols that is not normal for you, I believe that you have copied and pasted this from a website. If not, you still produced many statistics that require a source; Readers, please grade accordingly\" Who are you to judge me as such? If you did research, you would have found that in many of my recentd debates, I decided to use the brackets and the number. I found it a very useful tool to ensure that you are not lying, and I am not. So please refute my argument that vaccinations actually benefit people, as seen in previous argument. \"Vaccines are often unnecessary in may cases where the threat of death from disease is small. During the early nineteenth century, mortality for childhood diseases whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever fell drastically BEFORE IMMUNIZATION BECAME AVAILABLE. This decreased mortality has been attributed to improved personal hygiene, water purification,effective sewage disposal, and better food hygiene and nutrition.\" Plagarized from here [4]. Vaccines are very necessary, even if percentages of death is small. Vaccine deaths are even smaller. The sicknesses I previously listed out are all very harmful and potentially death-threatening diseases. They cause an extreme amount of suffering. Imagine if you were a child, suffering from a very horrible disease, and you know you could've been saved if you just took one needle in the arm. That's it. Whooping cough (pertussis) was the cause of 5,000 to 10,000 deaths in the United States a year [1]. Tell me that's not small. As my source states, pertussis was a deadly killer BEFORE VACCINES WERE CREATED [1]. The annual amount of deaths are now only 30 [1]. Measles is a much less serious circumstance, however, there are 20 million cases each year when children get them [2]. That could be stopped with one vaccination! Also, this rash is contagious and can be spread among kids. Why would these diseases just suddenly decrease in numbers before vaccines became available? Why would there suddenly be improved hygiene, purification, and other methods? Where is the source for this? \"Common childhood vaccinations may cause rare yet serious reactions including anaphylactic shock, paralysis, and sudden death. This risk is not worth taking, especially considering most diseases vaccinated against are not necessarily life threatening.\" Plagarized. The \"risk\" is most certainly worth taking, as the percentages of problems are very, very, very, very small. Most diseases cause huge amounts of suffering among children, and all that could be ended with a vaccine. \"Vaccines can trigger auto-immune disorders such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and other disorders.\" Plagarized as well from previous site. However, no vaccines means a child can obtain these numerous diseases: Anthrax Chickenpox Diphtheria Hepatitis A and B Hib HPV Japanese Encephalitis Lyme Disease Measles Meningococcal Mumps Pertussis Pneumococcal Polio Rabies And many, many more [3]! \"Vaccines clog and disrupt the lymphatic system with large foreign protein molecules (the active ingredients contained within vaccines) which may lead to lymphatic cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma.\" Plagarized from the same site, as well. I have to once again weigh down on this one refutation. The good of the vaccination far outweighs the bad of the vaccination. There is a very small chance you will obtain such diseases. \"All 50 states require vaccinations for children entering public schools even though no mandatory Federal vaccination laws exist.\" Plagarized. What's the argument here? \"Over 5,500 cases alleging a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism have been filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the US Court of Federal Claims between 2001 and 2009.\" Plagarized. However, vaccines do not cause autism. Researchers at the John Hopkins University School of Public Help and Centers for Disease Control reject the idea that vaccine and autism are linked. The US Court of Federal Claims has said that, \"theory of vaccine-related causation [of autism] is scientifically unsupportable.\" My opponent has listed several facts to \"support\" his case. They are all plagarized, but nonetheless, they are very strong supporting evidence... until you read the fifth argument from the site he copied from. \"According to a 2003 report by researchers at the Pediatric Academic Society, childhood vaccinations in the US prevent about 10.5 million cases of infectious illness and 33,000 deaths per year. [4]\" Clearly, this benefit outweights so many of the numbers my opponent has listed. Arguments 1. Because of a few ignorant parents, their children are at risk, putting even more children at risk of being infected with a horrible disease. 2. Most childhood vaccines have a 90-99% success rate in stopping disease [5]. When children who have been vaccinated do get sick, they usually have milder symptoms with less serious complications than an un-vaccinated child that gets the same disease. For example, an un-vaccinated child with mumps can become permanently deaf and spread the disease to more students, but the vaccinated child won't. 3. Children especially need to get vaccinated. Children have weaker immune systems than adults and thus, are more susceptible to various diseases than adults. The Proposition should currently be winning this debate due to the reason that I have refuted all of my opponent's arguments, and he has never completely refuted all of mine and some were left untouched. All of my opponent's arguments are plagarized and they are not his own work.

            "premise": "Introduction: I am impressed by Pro's reply. I have more time to work on my argument now, so hopefully this argument will be better than the last. Analysis of the Resolution: Pro didn't say that this was a public forum debate. I'm only pointing out that the debate shouldn't hinge on things that the resolution is vague about. Rebuttals: CA1: Solvency Vaccination improves quality of life. It doesn't follow that it should be mandatory. Yacht ownership improves quality of life, but mandating it would be a harmful misallocation of resources. Pro's case is founded on unwarranted fears. In the United States today, there are only two states in which vaccine exemption is not allowed for any reason other than medical necessity: West Virginia and Mississippi [1]. I also stated that even among parents who believe vaccines are risky, 86% still fully vaccinate their children [2]. The percentage of people who believe that vaccines are dangerous appears to be small [3], and the majority of people, who believe vaccines are safe, use them at an even higher rate (98%) [2]. There is no immediate danger of falling below Pro's 90-95% herd immunity threshold. The crux of this argument is the following: if herd immunity is achieved without mandates then Pro cannot claim it as an advantage. I will further repeat my argument that government involvement in vaccination is the cause of irrational fears of vaccines in the first place. See: crazy Alex Jones type conspiracy theorists. Providing vaccines through sources that people trust instead of through a legitimately frightening bureaucratic mechanism of total state power would alleviate much of these worries. By trying to force their beliefs on everyone else, the scientific community is creating resistance to an idea that people could otherwise be reasonably persuaded to accept. Turn Pro's graph: we don't have vaccine mandates today, but numerous diseases have been eradicated or significantly reduced. CA2: Community This whole argument is predicated on the assumption that herd immunity will be lost without mandatory vaccination. We have herd immunity and no mandatory vaccination, so that can't be true. In spite of what Pro (and seemingly every other person who I've debated this with) thinks, I fully understand the concept of herd immunity. My argument is that herd immunity is achieved through voluntary vaccination. Pro claims that the number of parents choosing to exempt their children is rising so rapidly that herd immunity will be lost in the future. She has no evidence for that prediction. At the current moment, herd immunity is secure, and the backlash from the scientific community against the anti-vaccination movement has been significant. It is just as likely that vaccine resistance will once again decline. I want to reply to a specific comment from Pro: \u201cMy opponent also claims that at different times, different vaccinations are needed. This is outrageous - a constant vaccination of children is vital to ensure the safety of the people from the disease returning.\u201d I don't see how my claim is disputable. In areas where disease X is more common, more vaccination against it is necessary than in areas where it is less common. When swine flu broke out, it was necessary to vaccinate against it. Now it is mostly gone, and there is no more need to vaccinate against it. Pro's argument seems to lead to the conclusion that we need to be fully vaccinated against every disease, all the time. But it should be obvious to everyone why vaccinating everyone against hundreds of strains of the common cold all the time would be an uneconomic waste of resources that could help people in other ways. Once this fact is conceded, we can see how it extends to every disease: total immunization isn't necessary. Voluntary choice has so far proven more than sufficient to meet the minimum threshold. CA3: Money I have found Pro's reply here difficult to understand. On the issue of people who cannot afford vaccines: I argued that it is non-topical. They can be provided with money to purchase vaccines without being required to do so. My calculations were simple arithmetic. Pro said that vaccines will save $231 billion over the next ten years. Assume this could be increased 10% through a mandate (very generous because more than 90% of children are fully vaccinated). That's $23.1 billion, which we divide by ten to get the annual savings: $2.31 billion. Now divide by the number of people in the US (about 350 million) to get the savings per person: it comes out to $6.60, which I rounded to $5. It is reasonable to assume that it would cost more money than this to implement a vaccine mandate. It will require an increase in administrative and law enforcement costs, which are already notoriously high. In 2011, there were 75 million children in the US[4]. That means that Pro has only about $30 to spend per child, which is considerably less than the cost of a single vaccine. In order to have the possibility of saving money, Pro's program would have to vaccinate more children than there are unvaccinated children. You will not save money by mandating vaccines for the same reason you will not save money by mandating teeth brushing: the savings of the mandate are so small compared to ordinary behavior that they will be outweighed by the cost of enforcing it. CA4: Authority I am going consider this argument conceded by Pro and not address it again. Affirmative Arguments: C1: Economic Calculation I am calling this argument dropped. Pro's reply was a complete non sequitur. The economic calculation argument says that you can never know whether an intervention in the free market is beneficial or not because the interactions between market variables are too complex. Any attempt at economic policy is just groping in the dark. Pro's reply had nothing to do with this. Just putting the same heading in and writing unrelated words isn't a response. It's not up to me to waste space repeating myself. Pro's own rule says that a drop is a concession. She must admit that she has no idea whether a vaccine mandate is really a better use of those resources than what the market would otherwise do. Replying with a non sequitur is a borderline abusive argument because I have to waste limited space explaining it. C2: Biopolitics This is a consequentialist argument based on Pro's criterion of justice: it says that by eroding certain barriers to political power, we risk grave expansions in government power. The difference between a free society and a totalitarian society is the existence on legal barriers to the state's use of force against the citizen's person. When we remove this restrictions, we create an environment that is legally and philosophical partial to totalitarianism. Pro's contention on authority does not address this. All it says is that it would be legal for the state to do this. I am talking about the consequences of actually doing it. Pro's argument just begs the question anyway: if I don't think the state has the authority to make these decisions, the fact that the state says it does isn't going to persuade me. The fact that the resolution applies to children does it help. It means that the state replaces the parent as the arbiter of the child's biological life. This is just as disastrous. If the state is responsible for stopping \u201cbad parenting\u201d as Pro says, then children are really wards of the state who their parents are allowed to care for at the state's whim. Conclusion: Pro's argument seems to assume that we have mandatory vaccination now (and this is commonly assumed). Far from it. Non-medical excuses are allowed in 48 states. Anyone who does not want their child vaccinated can cook up a religious or philosophical reason why. Thus, people who are against vaccination do in fact vaccinate their children at lower rates. But in spite of this, public vaccination has been remarkably successful. Sources: Will post all sources for the debate next round. Out of time and space. I can post them early if needed.",

[1]My opponent has consistently stated that \"without vaccinations diseases will spread.\" However, only the parents who do choose to not vaccinate their children will find that their child has the sickness. According to my opponent himself, the children who are vaccinated should be okay. Therefore, the parents' decisions will not impact other children, if vaccinations are as useful as my opponent suggested. [2]Thank you for giving us a lecture on the usefulness of the Hepatitis B vaccine. However, judged by your [#] symbols that is not normal for you, I believe that you have copied and pasted this from a website. If not, you still produced many statistics that require a source; Readers, please grade accordingly [3]To defend myself, the fact that vaccines frequently cause unintentional deaths is a well known fact that has been proven by many scientists. However, to support this, over 5,500 cases alleging a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism have en filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the US Court of Federal Claims between 2001 and 2009. Also, The US Court Federal Claims Office of Special Masters, between 1988 and 2009, has awarded compensation to 1,322 families whose children suffered brain damage from vaccines. To top it off, about 30,000 cases of adverse reactions to vaccines have been reported annually to the federal government since 1990, with 13% classified as serious, defining serious as \"associated with permanent disability, hospitalization, lifetaking illness, or death. I would like to bring some of my points into this debate. [1]Governments should not have the right to intervene in the health decisions parents make for their children.31% of parents believe they should have the right to refuse mandated school entry vaccinations for their children, according to a 2010 survey by the University of Michigan. [2]Many parents hold religious beliefs against vaccination. Forcing such parents to vaccinate their children would violate the 1st Amendment which guarantees citizens the right to free exercise of their religion. [3]Vaccines are often unnecessary in may cases where the threat of death from disease is small. During the early nineteenth century, mortality for childhood diseases whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever fell drastically BEFORE IMMUNIZATION BECAME AVAILABLE. This decreased mortality has been attributed to improved personal hygiene, water purification,effective sewage disposal, and better food hygiene and nutrition. [4]Common childhood vaccinations may cause rare yet serious reactions including anaphylactic shock, paralysis, and sudden death. This risk is not worth taking, especially considering most diseases vaccinated against are not necessarily life threatening. [5]Vaccines can trigger auto-immune disorders such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and other disorders. [6]Vaccines can cause brain inflammation (encephalopathy) which can le to death or permanent brain damage and disorders such as autism, ADD/ADHD, and other developmental problems. In addition, the vaccine additive thimrosal (found in most pre-1999 vaccines) has been associated specifically with the development of autism and is still found in certain meningococcal, tetanus, and flue vaccines such as the H1N1 vaccine. [7]Vaccines clog and disrupt the lymphatic system with large foreign protein molecules (the active ingredients contained within vaccines) which may lead to lymphatic cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. [8]All vaccines cause immune system suppression, and can permanently damage the natural immune system. Unvaccinated children build and strengthen their immune systems through fighting off infection and developing natural immunity to diseases like measles and chickenpox. Artificial immunity, generated through vaccination, weakens the immune system and leaves children more vulnerable to all other diseases and infections. I would like to top this off by giving some facts and statements to support my points. [1]All 50 states require vaccinations for children entering public schools even though no mandatory Federal vaccination laws exist. All 50 states issue medical exemptions, 48 states (excluding Mississippi and West Virginia) permit religious exemptions, and 20 states allow an exemption for philosophical reasons. [2]over 5,500 cases alleging a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism have been filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the US Court of Federal Claims between 2001 and 2009. [3]The US Court Federal Claims Office of Special Masters, between 1988 and 2009, has awarded compensation to 1,322 families whose children suffered brain damage from vaccines.

            "premise": "Thanks you to my opponent for accepting my debate. I would like to address two things before I really get into the argument. 1. Yes I was using necessary to mean \"required by public schools\" 2. I don't think I have 100% BOP because I'm arguing against the current accepted policies. However I would agree I have more BOP then pro does. Most likely 60-40 I will now debunk all of you're contentions. -Contention 1 There isn't really much to debunk here you basically just pointed out that most places allow religious exemptions. Just because most places allow it doesn't make it correct. -Contention 2 Yes it's true that there are ingredients that can violate the parents religious convictions. However when you are talking about getting first graders vaccinated, it's irrelevant. Because first grader don't have a religion. They have whatever there parents tell them they have. A first grader hasn't but any thought into it. He's whatever his parents tell him to be. However my bigger issue with it, is that I don't think the religion of the parents of one kid should be allowed to endanger the health of all the other kids in that school. You address this later in your argument saying something along the lines of \" If my kid doesn't get vaccinated it doesn't matter if your kid is. The issue with this is that vaccines are not 100% effective. They work very well and everyone should get them, but sometimes they fail. So if one kid doesn't get vaccinated because his parents don't want him to and he gets say chicken pox, well he is a danger to other kids even if they have there vaccination because if the vaccination they got didn't work, well now that kid has gotten someone else sick because his parents don't personally like that vaccination. However even that isn't my biggest issue with religious exemption. My biggest issue is that parents are legally allowed to put there kid's health in danger because they personally don't like what's in the vaccine. If the parents don't want to get there kids the measles vaccine because they're religion doesn't like it and the kid gets measles then the parents religion put the child in danger. ColeTrain would you honest say that parents should be allow to risk getting there five and six year old children getting sick and even possibly dying all because the parents don't like it. It's the same reason i don't think faith healing should be allowed. Because the parents religion can't be used as a justification to put a child in danger. -Contention 3 You say religious exemption is protected under the first amendment. Well I disagree. Here is why. The first amendment protection is only when religion doesn't conflict with other peoples freedom or harm others. As I showed above not vaccinating your kid puts that kid and others around him in danger. So your religion is harming others and so is not protected under the first amendment. - Contention 4 Yes it's true vaccines can cause side effects. For most people it doesn't but it can. I am in favor of medical exemptions. If getting a vaccine poses a significant risk to a kids health and safety then yes they can be exempted. However that is rare and for everyone else they should get vaccinated. Also you bring up the vaccine and autism link. This has been disproved many times and in fact the author of that study lost his medical license and got thrown in jail because the study was so bad. So that's invalid. -Contention 5 I have addressed everything in this argument. But I will address one thing. You say that if people accept the risks then let them take them. However this doesn't work because we are talking about kids. So the parents are not the one who are taking the risk. They are forcing there kids sometimes as young as six to accept life threatening risks. If a adult doesn't want to get vaccinated I don't care. However parent forcing little kids to take life threatening risks is unacceptable and should not be allowed. So I think I have debunked all of your points I would like you respond to my points I made.",

            "premise": "Introduction:The utilitarian framework of this debate (as implied by the definition of \"justified\" in R1) means that the resolution is primarily an empirical question: does state-mandated vaccination improve human welfare? The next logical question is always, \"As compared to what?\" The alternative to a state controlled system is a private market in vaccines. My thesis is that the benefits that Pro proposes are still present when the state does not control the vaccine market, and that there are significant disadvantages associated with the switch.Analysis of the Resolution:The resolution is not clear on the details of how mandatory vaccination will be carried out. For instance, is the state or the consumer paying for it? I'll try to abstract away from these and other questions that the resolution leaves open.Rebuttals:CA1: SolvencyI agree that vaccines help prevent diseases and that they are not dangerous. This is uncontroversial. However, it is an argument for vaccination in general, not an argument for mandatory vaccination. Without mandatory vaccination, large numbers of people will still voluntarily choose to vaccinate themselves. If anything, the demand for vaccinations against diseases like the flu is so high that it often cannot be met (though this may be due to under pricing)[1][2]. A huge majority of parents choose to vaccinate their children even when it is optional: 98% of parents who think vaccines are safe and even 86% of those who do not give their children full vaccination [3]. Getting the government out of vaccination will reduce these people's irrational worries, and focusing on education will improve vaccination rates better than simply resorting to force.CA2: CommunityCross-apply the argument above that this point supports vaccination generally, not mandatory vaccination. This advantage is obtained just as well by voluntary means because so many people voluntarily vaccinate.I also turn this argument against Pro. Herd immunity is a more complex concept than simply \"if we immunize everybody nobody will get sick.\" Depending on the cost of vaccination, how individual people weigh risk, the damage of disease, etc. there is an optimal percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated. It is not 100%: having just one un-vaccinated person will clearly not have a negative effect because there will be no one to catch the disease from. [4]People choose to vaccinate themselves according to their perceived risk, the costs of the vaccination and the disease, their personal feelings, the behavior of others in the community (the more others vaccinate themselves the less you need to, and vice versa). They also alter their behavior depending on the prevalence of disease (the H1N1 outbreak prompted mass voluntary vaccination)[5]. A market for vaccines will allocate them to people according to the impact of the vaccines on each person. Mandatory vaccination just crudely allocates vaccines to everyone, resulting in inefficient overproduction. People are forced to spend money on vaccines when something like food, rent, or their electric bill might be a higher priority.It's true that there is human error involved: many people in the United States foolishly choose not the vaccinate. This is a public relations failure. Imposing vaccines by force on people who fear them will only lead to more resentment and distrust. A better long-term strategy is to make vaccination optional and teach people to voluntarily adopt it.CA3: MoneyCross-apply the CA1 argument again: this money is saved through vaccination whether it is mandatory or not. The large majority of people will vaccinate anyway so almost all this benefit is lost by Pro.Giving the disadvantaged access to vaccines does not require mandatory vaccination. The government and/or charities can provide money to the poor, women, and other people who might not be able to afford vaccines. The aid would simply be optional. This advantage is lost entirely.Turn this point on Pro: Mandatory vaccination creates unnecessary costs. Cf. CA2: it results in over-production of vaccines. There are also administration, enforcement, and judicial costs, which as with any government program are notoriously high. If mandatory vaccinations (very optimistically) account for 10% of savings due to vaccination (based on the CA1 data), that's about $2 billion dollars per year. In order to stay in the black Pro's program would have to cost about $5 per person-year in the US, which clearly seems impossibly low (assuming about 350 million people live in the US). It is very likely that we would lose money on such a program simply due to the costs of checking that everyone is indeed vaccinated. As Pro says, unless we successfully vaccinate everyone, there's no advantage over the voluntary system that only gets nearly everyone.CA4: AuthorityThis is all irrelevant because justice is defined as what \"does more good than harm to the people.\" Whether the state has the authority is unrelated, and Pro's argument is silly anyway because she just says that the state has the authority because they say they do.Affirmative Arguments:I don't have as much space for these as I would like because I have a full 8k of Pro's arguments to respond to, so I may expand somewhat in the next round.C1: Economic CalculationShould we build more bicycles or more iPods? This is an overwhelmingly complex question that concerns more variables than we could ever consciously account for. A government could never rationally decide the answer. The price system on the free market is able to solve this problem because the price of goods and the profit rate from their industries is determined indirectly by the supply and demand not just of the good itself, but by every other good. The price of a bicycle is determined by the price of building materials, factory machines, labor, alternate forms of transportation and exercise, and unrelated but more urgently needed goods. The same is true of the price of vaccines. Mandating that everyone be vaccinated would have the same effect as mandating everyone own a bike: too many vaccines will be produced, and worse other things that would have been produced won't be. Pro's policy must bear the hidden, unknown cost of diverting law enforcement, medical production and labor, and government administration away from other uses that the open market would deem more valuable. It's simply impossible for Pro to take as much information into account as is required to justify this trade-off; she focuses only on what is seen and ignores the unseen. See: [6][7]C2: BiopoliticsThe \"liberal\" (broadly speaking) view of government that arose out of the Enlightenment views the relationship between the state and the citizen as political: there is a legal relationship based on mutually acknowledged rights, responsibilities, and privileges. The power of the state is not directly foisted upon the citizen's bare biological life. By contrast, under totalitarianism the relationship between the state and the citizen is biological: the citizen's body is an instrument of the state which can be used directly without political interface. The foisting of the state's power on the citizen's bare life has a profound impact on the community's philosophy. If this practice is accepted, we move into a world where anything goes. This change in the fundamental nature of political life, from a relationship between the citizen's mind and the state to a relationship between the citizen's body and the state, has had horrific consequences in history [8][9]. Even the slightest transgression of this type cannot be risked at all and should fill any reasonable person with grave dread.Conclusion:The advantages of mandatory vaccination are not much greater than those of voluntary vaccination. Mandatory vaccination involves unnecessary costs, is inefficient, and sets a terrible philosophical precedent that has lead to brutal expansion of state power.SOURCES IN COMMENTS",

            "premise": "First, thank you to Malthelate for joining me in this discussion. To my opponent, please pause to reflect on the Rules and Structure enumerated in Round 1. Thank you. Since R1 was \u201cacceptance\u201d I will not rebut Con\u2019s informal arguments except to say that moving forward please provide evidence/citations for claims like \u201cit gives autism\u201d. I promise to do the same and I will formally rebut the \u201cautism\u201d claim in round 2. Constructive Cases: (1) Vaccination has greatly reduced the burden of infectious disease in other countries [1]. (a) It seems like every time we talk about vaccinations we refer back to our own country. Well, it turns out, that the whole world has seen success in this arena. Each year, immunization averts 2-3 million deaths from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and measles. In 2011, 123 countries immunized over 90% of infants against measles. Between 2000 and 2011, vaccination resulted in a 71% drop in measles deaths worldwide\u201d [2]. UNICEF, the WHO and the UN all confirm that even in destitute countries we see declines in mortality. Yet, Americans continue to refer only to data FROM the U.S. [This is especially useful because vaccine opponents often cite declines in mortality (death) rates within the US prior to the introduction of vaccines using a misleading graph that does not include morbidities (prevalence)] - for reference alone. Not an argument [3]. (b) This graph paints a nice picture in terms we can understand about the clear decline of death rates from Measles across the globe. Please note that many of these countries do not have the medical care/economic means that vaccine opponents so often claim as proof that vaccines were/are unnecessary in the U.S. CEE: Central EuropeanSource: UNICEF, 2010 (2) Vaccine-preventable diseases haven\u2019t gone away. (a) It\u2019s easy to forget that these diseases still exist. Most of us haven\u2019t seen what happens to a child with Polio or a baby with Whooping Cough (WC) and so it just doesn\u2019t resonate with us. When considering immunization, one must weigh the options. On the one hand \u2013 in this example \u2013 we have WC. On the other, vaccines. So how do we weigh just these two examples against one another? Well, let\u2019s start with the easy stuff. (Note: this is how we should compare vaccines to diseases in other cases as well) [4]. Risk factors: Whooping Cough* Immunizations** Pneumonia - 1 in 4 children Fever - 1 in 4 children Apnea/Dyspnea (no/difficult breathing) >1 in 2 children Redness or swelling \u2013 1 in 4 children Seizures - > 1 in 100 children Seizures \u2013 1 in 14,000 children Brain Damage - 3 in 100 children High Fever >105F \u2013 1 in 16,000 children Death \u2013 1 in 100 children Serious Allergic reaction \u2013 1 in 1 million children Source: * https://www.cdc.gov... ** https://www.cdc.gov... (b) There\u2019s some scary stuff going on here. Though, WC is scarier. And guess what? You get the same sort of results for Polio, Diphtheria, Measles, Mumps etc [4]. In each case the disease is significantly more dangerous than the immunization against it. Vaccines may cause mild fever and redness in one out of four children but only 1 out of every million have an allergic reaction. Now look at WC around the world. 1 out of every 100 children DIE. Approximately 1 out of every 100 children have SEIZURES. ~1 out of every 300 may suffer BRAIN DAMAGE. Nearly 1 out of 4 catch PNEUMONIA and greater than half have respiratory problems. Now ask yourself. \u201cWould you rather risk Whooping Cough or Immunization?\u201d So we see that vaccines have decreased disease incidence worldwide AND the dangers of disease far outweigh the dangers of vaccines. So we must conclude that ON BALANCE thus far, our children should be vaccinated. SOURCES: [1] http://www.who.int... [2] https://www.unicef.org... [3] https://vicskeptics.wordpress.com...

            "premise": "I do concede that the family moving was a poor example but what of animals or bugs that spread parasites, there are no visas for them. I cringe when the Con said these vaccines would be a waste of resources because he obviously did not study this topic. I will use another example (this will be whooping cough) and this article will explain what happens if you don't get a vaccine because you think the disease is \"gone\". http://www.dailycamera.com... This shows that diseases can come back over time and affect those unprotected. The Cons use of the words \"wasteful\" in the sense of the vaccinations would be received quite badly in places like Colorado. The Con also refuses to answer my arguments so I will go into detail why you should vote Pro and vote Manditory Vaccines. Herd Immunity: This is a proven theory that 94% of the world's population must be vaccinated against a disease for it to stop spreading. If we allow parents to not require their children to get a vaccination it will affect the child's health along with the rest of the world's. Milder Symptoms: As mentioned before (by the Con) it is possible to get an effect from the vaccine like an allergic reaction. And as I mentioned before the chance of getting a reaction are much more rare than getting the actual disease. And if you do (however slim) get the disease you are vaccinated against the affects are much milder (such as the difference between death and a fever). Dangers and Affects: Diseases can also cause other diseases such as Hepatitus B (which the Con says can't be contracted in the US although can due to my previous argument) which can cause cancer if contracted. Economic: The last reason to make it manditory (vaccines) is money. It is shown that on average every one dollar spent on vaccines can save six dollars in later medical costs. Those arguments are not only solid but prove the importance of vaccines and why they must be manditory for everyone. Besides my reasons, the Con side shows little to no understanding of this topic. They also use resources such as Wikipedia which is not very reliable. Vote Pro because of the importance, lack of Con argument, and the obvious win by myself (not being self-centered).",

            "premise": "I may have taken some of my points from a source, however, this means that everything that I say is backed up, whereas your source for the hepatitis B vaccine has yet to be stated, although I requested it previously. \"If not, you still produced many statistics that require a source;...\" \"Measles is a much less serious circumstance, however, there are 20 million cases each year when children get them. That could be stopped with one vaccination!\" Excuse me, Strike, but how would one vaccination cover 20 million children? Just pointing that out there. Also, by exclaiming that I \"plagiarized,\" you directly contradicted your statement \"Where is the source for this?\" At the end of the same exact paragraph. Also, isn't it obvious why there would be improved hygiene, purification, and other methods? The government set out to improve our daily lives. Thank you for needlessly asking that question. \"Whooping cough (pertussis) was the cause of 5,000 to 10,000 deaths in the United States a year.\" First of all, let my draw your attention to \"was.\" That signifies that this is in the past. Second, draw your attention to \"a year.\" This does not specify which year, and I can naturally assume that it was in the begginnings of its emergence, back when people did not develop a resistance to it. Also, 5,000 deaths is actually not a lot. Influenza kills just as many people. 5,000 people, out of the massive amount of citizens in USA, is not a lot. \"The \"risk\" is most certainly worth taking, as the percentages of problems are very, very, very, very small. Most diseases cause huge amounts of suffering among children, and all that could be ended with a vaccine.\" The number of problems are pretty big, as I told you already. [1]over 5,500 cases alleging a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism have been filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the US Court of Federal Claims between 2001 and 2009. [3]The US Court Federal Claims Office of Special Masters, between 1988 and 2009, has awarded compensation to 1,322 families whose children suffered brain damage from vaccines. [4]About 30,000 cases of adverse reactions to vaccines have been reported annually to the federal government since 1990, with 13% classified as serious, defining serious as \"associated with permanent disability, hospitalization, lifetaking illness, or death. That point is pretty much useless, based on the statistics above, WHICH YOU DID NOT REFUTE. \"They think they're safer off without the vaccination, however, that is untrue. They will obtain diseases, spread it onto other children who think they're safe without the vaccination, and then spread it to the kids who were going to get a vaccination\" Thank you for pointing out that they think that they are safer without the vaccinations. Where, in my arguments, do I state that they think they are safer? They merely don't take the vaccinations, believing that it stands in the way of God, Allah, or whatever they believe, NOT THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SAFER. STATING THAT THEY ARE SAFER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS DEBATE, that argument is easily refuted by the statistics above, and, in the moral sense, by your basic human rights. Um..as far as I know, stating statistics with the exact wording is not called plagarizing. Thus, I can ignore all your refutation here: \"Plagarized. What's the argument here? \"Over 5,500 cases alleging a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism have been filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the US Court of Federal Claims between 2001 and 2009. Plagarized. However, vaccines do not cause autism. Researchers at the John Hopkins University School of Public Help and Centers for Disease Control reject the idea that vaccine and autism are linked. The US Court of Federal Claims has said that, \"theory of vaccine-related causation [of autism] is scientifically unsupportable.\" \" However, scientifically unsupportable is not a big issue. There are many things that we do not know in science, and you cannot ignore the fact that 5,500 cases of autism have occurred. \"\"All 50 states require vaccinations for children entering public schools even though no mandatory Federal vaccination laws exist.\" Plagarized. What's the argument here?\" If you had kept on reading, they still forced them nonetheless. This is abolishing human rights. You stiill haven't refuted my point about human rights. I consider this untouched. Refutations: 1. Because of a few ignorant parents, their children are at risk, putting even more children at risk of being infected with a horrible disease. First of all, i would like to point out that if other children are vaccinated, they should be safe...? Also, if their children are at risk, that is their problem. They decided, using their rights, not to vaccinate their children and therefore should be allowed to make that decision for a minor. 2. Most childhood vaccines have a 90-99% success rate in stopping disease [5]. When children who have been vaccinated do get sick, they usually have milder symptoms with less serious complications than an un-vaccinated child that gets the same disease. For example, an un-vaccinated child with mumps can become permanently deaf and spread the disease to more students, but the vaccinated child won't. Plagurized... right back at you, hypocrite. Also, using my point, developing a natural immune system is important for other reasons and diseases. Vaccinations include anti-body depressants which allow you to get sick easier. We must allow our own bodies to fight back. 3. Children especially need to get vaccinated. Children have weaker immune systems than adults and thus, are more susceptible to various diseases than adults. Tell this to the parents. It is their choice, and this debate is about mandatory or not, not whether or not it is good or bad for you. IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS DEBATE IS ABOUT MANDATORY OR NOT, NOT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS GOOD FOR YOU. THEREFORE, MOST OF MY OPPONENTS POINTS CAN BE REFUTED BY THIS. ALL OF THEM ARE IRRELEVANT. IT IS THEIR RIGHTS TO CHOOSE FOR THEIR CHILD, AND THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS BASED ON WHETHER THEY THINK IT IS GOOD OR BAD. THESE MAJOR POINTS HAVE BEEN UNTOUCHED BY MY OPPONENT. Also, in your ridiculous conclusion, I would like to point out that you started first, giving me less time and space to refute your arguments, whereas you had two speeches. And you can only truly claim that after I have finished posting that debate. Also, you gave a fallacy stating that you have refuted all of my points. However, the fact that it is the parents' rights to choose is untouched. According to the above notice, most of your major points are fallacies, giving examples of the benefits of vaccination. However, the fact remains that their parents have the choice to vaccinate or not to vaccinate, and they can make that choice based on those statistics. However, in this debate they are irrelevant and are present as a red-herring fallacy. New POints: 1. Many people are severely allergic to some chemicals in the vaccine. Doctors may not know this, and the result of the vaccine may be disastrous. Again, it is very evident that CON should win.",

            "premise": "I agree that there is no evidence currently that vaccinations cause autsim. I also wouldn't vaccinate my child for any reason. Autism seems to always been seen as the reason parents don't vaccinate and I can tell you that, for me, it couldn't be farther from the truth. The multitude of other reactions (Guillain-Barr\u00e9, SIDS, Juvenile Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, anaphylactic shock, death, etc.) had a much larger impact on me. Also, I'm not inherently distrustful of the medical industry (I conceived through IVF so I LOVE modern medicine!) but when they are pushing a HepB vaccine on a 12 hour old infant their motives become suspect. It is frustrating to me that the vaccine debate swirls around Autism, MMR, and Jenny McCarthy. It is like this is a *new* problem! Have we forgotten Barbara Loe Fisher and her fight to get DTP off the market? It was killing kids and causing developmental disabilities in others and they've since changed it (to DTaP, the \"a\" being acelular). For some reason the media loves the Autism link - perhaps because it is so pervasive and not understood disorder? Regardless, it is the least of the problems with vaccines - so please research beyond Autism when you are exploring vaccines. I also wanted to point out a major flaw in the panelists discussion of non-vaxers. There is this persistent idea that vaccinating is a societal obligation and moral imperative. This theory stems from the thought that non-vaccinated children are relying on the \"herd\" to protect them from illness. Also, since some people can't get vaccines for medical reasons that non-vaccinated children are posing a threat to them. There are several major flaws with this idea. the largest of which is children are only a minority of the human \"herd\" - what about the adult population that harbor NO IMMUNITY to illnesses because they have waned from vaccines and were never developed naturally through illness. Even the CDC shows grave numbers for adult vaccination.http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/vaccinations-for-grown-ups/ \"only 2.1 percent of adults ages 18 to 64 are immunized against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, the journal reports. A vaccine against shingles is recommended for all adults over 60, but only 1.9 percent of adults have been immunized.\" How can the non-vaccinated children be responsible for the lack of eradication of these vaccine available diseases? If herd immunity requires 70-90% immunity levels, how can we pretend to have herd immunity? Second, if you believe that vaccine's work, why are you worried about your vaccinated child? This doesn't apply to those too young to be vaccinated and those who can not - however I've heard parents of vaccinated kids blame the non-vaccinated kids. Why aren't they upset at the medical community because their vaccine didn't work? Lastly, read up on what vaccines actually do. Many don't prevent transmission of an disease but decrease the severity of the illness. Whooping Cough, for example, does not stop transmission. That means your vaccinated child can have the pathogen and pass it to others but may not have any symptoms or very light symptoms. If a baby or immuno-compromised person gets Pertussis how do we know it is a non-vaccinated person's fault? Once again, why aren't we railing at the medical community that these vaccines aren't living up to their *miracle status*? I respect anyone's decision to vaccinate or not vaccinate. Trust me, thinking that my child would be the one that got HepB from some freak accident and died kept me up late at night! It isn't an easy decision but let's protect everyone's right to make an informed decision.",

            "conclusion": "Vaccines are needed and do not cause Autism",
            "premise": "Abstract Although child vaccination rates remain high, some parental concern persists that vaccines might cause autism. Three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We will discuss the genesis of each of these theories and review the relevant epidemiological evidence. A worldwide increase in the rate of autism diagnoses\"likely driven by broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness\"has fueled concerns that an environmental exposure like vaccines might cause autism. Theories for this putative association have centered on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines currently administered. However, both epidemiological and biological studies fail to support these claims. MMR On 28 February 1998, Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist, and colleagues [1] published a paper in The Lancet that described 8 children whose first symptoms of autism appeared within 1 month after receiving an MMR vaccine. All 8 of these children had gastrointestinal symptoms and signs and lymphoid nodular hyperplasia revealed on endoscopy. From these observations, Wakefield postulated that MMR vaccine caused intestinal inflammation that led to translocation of usually nonpermeable peptides to the bloodstream and, subsequently, to the brain, where they affected development. Several issues undermine the interpretation by Wakefield et al. [1] of this case series. First, the self-referred cohort did not include control subjects, which precluded the authors from determining whether the occurrence of autism following receipt of MMR vaccine was causal or coincidental. Because W64;50,000 British children per month received MMR vaccine between ages 1 and 2 years\"at a time when autism typically presents\"coincidental associations were inevitable. Indeed, given the prevalence of autism in England in 1998 of 1 in 2000 children [2], W64;25 children per month would receive a diagnosis of the disorder soon after receiving MMR vaccine by chance alone. Second, endoscopic or neuropsychological assessments were not blind, and data were not collected systematically or completely. Third, gastrointestinal symptoms did not predate autism in several children, which is inconsistent with the notion that intestinal inflammation facilitated bloodstream invasion of encephalopathic peptides. Fourth, measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine viruses have not been found to cause chronic intestinal inflammation or loss of intestinal barrier function. Indeed, a recent study by Hornig et al. [3] found that the measles vaccine virus genome was not detected more commonly in children with or without autism. Fifth, putative encephalopathic peptides traveling from the intestine to the brain have never been identified. In contrast, the genes that have been associated with autism spectrum disorder to date have been found to code for endogenous proteins that influence neuronal synapse function, neuronal cell adhesion, neuronal activity regulation, or endosomal trafficking [4]. Although no data supporting an association between MMR vaccine and autism existed and a plausible biological mechanism was lacking, several epidemiologic studies were performed to address parental fears created by the publication by Wakefield et al. [1] (table 1). Fortunately, several features of large-scale vaccination programs allowed for excellent descriptive and observational studies\"specifically, large numbers of subjects, which generated substantial statistical power; high-quality vaccination records, which provided reliable historical data; multinational use of similar vaccine constituents and schedules; electronic medical records, which facilitated accurate analysis of outcome data; and the relatively recent introduction of MMR vaccine in some countries, which allowed for before and after comparisons.

View largeDownload slide Studies that fail to support an association between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism. Ecological studies.Researchers in several countries performed ecological studies that addressed the question of whether MMR vaccine causes autism. Such analyses employ large databases that compare vaccination rates with autism diagnoses at the population level. In the United Kingdom, researchers evaluated 498 autistic children born from 1979 through 1992 who were identified by computerized health records from 8 health districts [5]. Although a trend toward increasing autism diagnoses by year of birth was confirmed, no change in the rates of autism diagnoses after the 1987 introduction of MMR vaccine was observed. Further, MMR vaccination rates of autistic children were similar to those of the entire study population. Also, investigators did not observe a clustering of autism diagnoses relative to the time that children received MMR vaccine, nor did they observe a difference in age at autism diagnosis between those vaccinated and not vaccinated or between those vaccinated before or after 18 months of age. These authors also found no differences in autism rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated children when they extended their analysis to include a longer time after MMR exposure or a second dose of MMR [6]. Also in the United Kingdom, researchers performed a time-trend analysis using the General Practice Research Database\"a high-quality, extensively validated electronic medical record with virtually complete vaccination data [7]. More than 3 million person-years of observation during 1988\"1999 confirmed an increase in autism diagnoses despite stable MMR vaccination rates. In California, researchers compared year-specific MMR vaccination rates of kindergarten students with the yearly autism case load of the California Department of Developmental Services during 1980\"1994 [8]. As was observed in the United Kingdom, the increase in the number of autism diagnoses did not correlate with MMR vaccination rates. In Canada, researchers estimated the prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder with respect to MMR vaccination in 27,749 children from 55 schools in Quebec [9]. Autism rates increased coincident with a decrease in MMR vaccination rates. The results were unchanged when both exposure and outcome definitions varied, including a strict diagnosis of autism. Additional population-based studies considered the relationship between MMR vaccine and the \"new variant\" form of autism proposed by Wakefield et al. [1]\"specifically, developmental regression with gastrointestinal symptoms. Although it is difficult to analyze such a phenomenon when it is unclear that one exists (which complicates the formulation of a case definition), conclusions may be gleaned from the data with respect to developmental regression alone (i.e., autism irrespective of coincident bowel problems). In England, researchers performed a cross-sectional study of 262 autistic children and demonstrated no difference in age of first parental concerns or rate of developmental regression by exposure to MMR vaccine [10]. No association between developmental regression and gastrointestinal symptoms was observed. In London, an analysis of 473 autistic children used the 1987 introduction of MMR to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts [11]. The incidence of developmental regression did not differ between cohorts, and the authors observed no difference in the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated autistic children. Two conclusions are evident from these data. First, the explicit consideration of developmental regression among autistic children does not alter the consistent independence of MMR vaccine and autism. Second, these data argue against the existence of a new variant form of autism. Retrospective, observational studies.Four retrospective, observational studies addressed the relationship between MMR vaccine and autism. In the United Kingdom, 71 MMR-vaccinated autistic children were compared with 284 MMR-vaccinated matched control children through use of the Doctor's Independent Network, a general practice database [12]. The authors observed no differences between case and control children in practitioner consultation rates\"a surrogate for parental concerns about their child's development\"within 6 months after MMR vaccination, which suggests that the diagnosis of autism was not temporally related to MMR vaccination. In Finland, using national registers, researchers linked hospitalization records to vaccination records in 535,544 children vaccinated during 1982\"1986 [13]. Of 309 children hospitalized for autistic disorders, no clustering occurred relative to the time of MMR vaccination. In Denmark, again using a national registry, researchers determined vaccination status and autism diagnosis in 537,303 children born during 1991\"1998 [14]. The authors observed no differences in the relative risk of autism between those who did and those who did not receive MMR vaccine. Among autistic children, no relationship between date of vaccination and development of autism was observed. In metropolitan Atlanta, using a developmental surveillance program, researchers compared 624 autistic children with 1824 matched control children [15]. Vaccination records were obtained from state immunization forms. The authors observed no differences in age at vaccination between autistic and nonautistic children, which suggests that early age of MMR vaccine exposure was not a risk factor for autism. Prospective observational studies.Capitalizing on a long-term vaccination project maintained by the National Board of Health, investigators in Finland performed 2 prospective cohort studies. Researchers prospectively recorded adverse events associated with MMR-vaccinated children during 1982\"1996 and identified 31 with gastrointestinal symptoms; none of the children developed autism [16]. A further analysis of this cohort revealed no vaccine-associated cases of autism among 1.8 million children [17]. Although this cohort was analyzed using a passive surveillance system, the complete absence of an association between gastrointestinal disease and autism after MMR vaccination was compelling. Thimerosal Thimerosal\"50% ethylmercury by weight\"is an antibacterial compound that has been used effectively in multidose vaccine preparations for >50 years [18] (thimerosal is not contained in live-virus vaccines, such as MMR). In 1997, the US Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act mandated identification and quantification of mercury in all food and drugs; 2 years later, the US Food and Drug Administration found that children might be receiving as much as 187.5 \"g of mercury within the first 6 months of life. Despite the absence of data suggesting harm from quantities of ethylmercury contained in vaccines, in 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service recommended the immediate removal of mercury from all vaccines given to young infants [19]. Widespread and predictable misinterpretation of this conservative, precautionary directive, coupled with a public already concerned by a proposed but unsubstantiated link between vaccination and autism, understandably provoked concern among parents, which led to the birth of several antimercury advocacy groups. However, because the signs and symptoms of autism are clearly distinct from those of mercury poisoning, concerns about mercury as a cause of autism were\"similar to those with MMR vaccine\"biologically implausible [20]; children with mercury poisoning show characteristic motor, speech, sensory, psychiatric, visual, and head circumference changes that are either fundamentally different from those of or absent in children with autism. Consistent with this, a study performed by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention years later showed that mercury in vaccines did not cause even subtle signs or symptoms of mercury poisoning [21]. Despite the biological implausibility of the contention that thimerosal in vaccines caused autism, 7 studies\"again descriptive or observational\"were performed (table 2). Four other studies have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [28] but are not discussed here because their methodology is incomplete and unclear and, thus, cause difficulty in drawing meaningful conclusions.

Ecological studies.Three ecological studies performed in 3 different countries compared the incidence of autism with thimerosal exposure from vaccines. In each case, the nationwide removal of thimerosal\"which occurred in 1992 in Europe and in 2001 in the United States\"allowed robust comparisons of vaccination with thimerosal-containing and thimerosal-free products, as follows: In Sweden and Denmark, researchers found a relatively stable incidence of autism when thimerosal-containing vaccines were in use (1980\"1990), including years when children were exposed to as much as 200 \"g of ethylmercury (concentrations similar to peak US exposures) [22]. However, in 1990, a steady increase in the incidence of autism began in both countries and continued through the end of the study period in 2000, despite the removal of thimerosal from vaccines in 1992. In Denmark, researchers performed a study comparing the incidence of autism in children who had received 200 \"g (1961\"1970), 125 \"g (1970\"1992), or 0 \"g of thimerosal (1992\"2000) and again demonstrated no relationship between thimerosal exposure and autism [23]. In Quebec, researchers grouped 27,749 children from 55 schools by date of birth and estimated thimerosal exposure on the basis of the corresponding Ministry of Health vaccine schedules. School records were obtained to determine age-specific rates of pervasive developmental disorder [9]. Thimerosal exposure and pervasive developmental disorder diagnosis were found to be independent variables. Similar to previous analyses, the highest rates of pervasive developmental disorder were found in cohorts exposed to thimerosal-free vaccines. The results were unchanged when both exposure and outcome definitions varied. Cohort studies.Four cohort studies that examined thimerosal exposure and autism have been performed, as follows: In Denmark, researchers examined >1200 children with autism that was identified during 1990\"1996, which comprised W64;3 million person-years. They found that the risk of autism did not differ between children vaccinated with thimerosal-containing vaccines and those vaccinated with thimerosal-free vaccines or between children who received greater or lower quantities of thimerosal [24]. They also found that the rates of autism increased after the removal of thimerosal from all vaccines. In the United States, using the Vaccine Safety Data Link, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined 140,887 US children born during 1991\"1999, including >200 children with autism [25]. The researchers found no relationship between receipt of thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. In England, researchers prospectively followed 12,810 children for whom they had complete vaccination records who were born during 1991\"1992, and they found no relationship between early thimerosal exposure and deleterious neurological or psychological outcomes [26]. In the United Kingdom, researchers evaluated the vaccination records of 100,572 children born during 1988\"1997, using the General Practice Research Database, 104 of whom were affected with autism [27]. No relationship between thimerosal exposure and autism diagnosis was observed. Too Many Vaccines When studies of MMR vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines failed to show an association with autism, alternative theories emerged. The most prominent theory suggests that the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system and creates an interaction with the nervous system that triggers autism in a susceptible host. This theory was recently popularized in the wake of a concession by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program with regard to the case of a 9-year-old girl with a mitochondrial enzyme deficiency whose encephalopathy, which included features of autism spectrum disorder, was judged to have worsened following the receipt of multiple vaccines at age 19 months [29]. Despite reassurances by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program's action should not be interpreted as scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism, many in the lay press and the public have not been reassured. The notion that children might be receiving too many vaccines too soon and that these vaccines either overwhelm an immature immune system or generate a pathologic, autism-inducing autoimmune response is flawed for several reasons: Vaccines do not overwhelm the immune system. Although the infant immune system is relatively naive, it is immediately capable of generating a vast array of protective responses; even conservative estimates predict the capacity to respond to thousands of vaccines simultaneously [30]. Consistent with this theoretical exercise, combinations of vaccines induce immune responses comparable to those given individually [31]. Also, although the number of recommended childhood vaccines has increased during the past 30 years, with advances in protein chemistry and recombinant DNA technology, the immunologic load has actually decreased. The 14 vaccines given today contain <200 bacterial and viral proteins or polysaccharides, compared with >3000 of these immunological components in the 7 vaccines administered in 1980 [30]. Further, vaccines represent a minute fraction of what a child's immune system routinely navigates; the average child is infected with 4\"6 viruses per year [32]. The immune response elicited from the vast antigen exposure of unattenuated viral replication supersedes that of even multiple, simultaneous vaccines. multiple vaccinations do not weaken the immune system. Vaccinated and unvaccinated children do not differ in their susceptibility to infections not prevented by vaccines [33,\",35]. In other words, vaccination does not suppress the immune system in a clinically relevant manner. However, infections with some vaccine-preventable diseases predispose children to severe, invasive infections with other pathogens [36, 37]. Therefore, the available data suggest that vaccines do not weaken the immune system. Autism is not an immune-mediated disease. Unlike autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, there is no evidence of immune activation or inflammatory lesions in the CNS of people with autism [38]. In fact, current data suggest that genetic variation in neuronal circuitry that affects synaptic development might in part account for autistic behavior [39]. Thus, speculation that an exaggerated or inappropriate immune response to vaccina-tion precipitates autism is at variance with current scientific data that address the pathogenesis of autism. No studies have compared the incidence of autism in vaccinated, unvaccinated, or alternatively vaccinated children (i.e., schedules that spread out vaccines, avoid combination vaccines, or include only select vaccines). These studies would be difficult to perform because of the likely differences among these 3 groups in health care seeking behavior and the ethics of experimentally studying children who have not received vaccines. Conclusions Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism. These studies have been performed in several countries by many different investigators who have employed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods. The large size of the studied populations has afforded a level of statistical power sufficient to detect even rare associations. These studies, in concert with the biological implausibility that vaccines overwhelm a child's immune system, have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism. Further studies on the cause or causes of autism should focus on more-promising leads.

            "premise": "Thanks Pro for this debate. By this round, it was already time to learn from my errors, and that's why I'm here to learn, and as a self-observer and thanks to Pro, I couldn't ignore some lack of form and presentation in my arguments, and I see this last round as a way to clean my mistakes and to make my point clear. First, by Pros rules, in last round it isn't allowed to create new arguments, and he/she says that 'the entire debate comes down to whether the risks of \"side-effects\"'. This shows that Pro evades completely two of my arguments on the previous round, and by quoting and reinforce those statements, I'm not breaking the rules. [1] The fact that our government, and all the powerful entities that are on top of the pyramid may not act in offspring of the button of the hierarchy, or in other words, us, the lower and middle classes, and may only look to keep the power and money, and not watch the means to get to the end. -From a TED interview to Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and a \"philanthropist\", says himself this \"The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that [number of 9 billion] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. But there we see an increase of about 1.3 [billion].\" If we notice the sutle way he says this, we can see that we have the information in from of our eyes, we just have to be alert. \"The worst blind is the one who doesn\"t want to see\" .() [2]The way I presented my argument about morality wasn't the perfect one, and the way PRO refutes my argument its by lowering its importance, and I'm going to show why. -\"Freedom stands for something greater than just the right to act however I choose\"it also stands for securing to everyone an equal opportunity for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" The way Pro stands about this, is that most probably is that if we don't vaccinate our children, they most likely die. If we had another round, he/she may say that it's the probability and the PROS and CONS of vaccines that make not vaccinating denying freedom. But, we have to consider many many more variables to state with certainty something like that. The possibility that they may live a healthy life, the possibility that vaccines has side-effects, like Bill Gates sayed, the possibility that if children reach a certain age were they already can make their choices, may not want to be vaccinate or didn't wanted, and many many more. PRO makes vaccines a objective fact, but it is more subjective than we think. As parents, we choose what it's best for our children, and what is best for ours, may not be the best for other parents to their children, and PRO states viously that it's a objective subject. Choosing the fate of our children comes from moral, the kind of moral I talked earlier, the kind of moral that isn't something ready-made, but is spontaneously and that comes from a conscious mind. (http://ieet.org...) -\"Consciousness is the quality or state of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.\" Going more wide about PROS arguments, and using his refute to me against him/her, \"This is a blatant ad populum fallacy. Just because a lot of people say something, that doesn't make it true... But, if we are going to use ad populum fallacies to make arguments, we should appeal to the most informed group of individuals...\" Well, he says that my argument is a populum fallacy, and says that if I do that he is justified to do so too, and from the beginning he is basing is entire research the principle that \"If most people say it's good, it's because it's good\". He tries to attack me, but by doing that is attacking himself/herself. (http://en.wikipedia.org...) PRO denies any form \"logical reasoning\", only standing his/her point about vaccines with studies. If most of medical enterprises which dominates the market don't what to lose power and don't want people informed, it's obvious that official websites are never going to have other things but saying that vaccinating our children is good, and we should vaccinate them despite everything. Do you believe that every study, everything they tell us is true? I advise you to see \"Zeitgeist\" for example, and then rethink your ideas about society. But transcending all this, going beyond the purpose of this debate, beyond who is going to win or who is really right (and in my opinion there is not a fully right or wrong answer to this question), we have to think. I'm not obsessed with theories of conspiracy or anything like that, but there are some things that just doesn't make sense. Plato himself told this with is cave allegory. The Myth of the Cave The myth talks about prisoners (from birth) living bound in chains in a cave and spend all the time looking at the back wall which is illuminated by the light generated by a fire. This wall statues of shadows are cast representing people, animals, plants and objects, showing scenes and the day-to-day. The prisoners are giving names to images (shadows), analyzing and judging the situation. \" Let's imagine that one of the prisoners were forced out of the chains in order to explore the cave and the outside world. Get in touch with reality and realize that spent his life analyzing and judging only images projected by statues. Leaving the cave and get in touch with the real world would be delighted with real beings, with nature, with animals and etc. Return to the cave to pass all knowledge acquired outside the cave to his colleagues also arrested. But it would be ridiculed by telling all he saw and felt, as his colleagues can only believe in the reality they see the illuminated wall of the cave. The prisoners will call you crazy, threatening him with death if not stop talking of those ideas considered absurd. What Plato meant by the myth Humans have a distorted view of reality. In the myth, the prisoners are we that we see and believe only in images created by the culture, concepts and information we receive in life. The cave symbolizes the world, as it has in images that do not represent reality. You can only know reality, when we free ourselves of these cultural and social influences, that is, when we left the cave. (http://www.suapesquisa.com...) - I copied this from a Portuguese website, because it was better synthesized. I couldn't find a better way to finish this round, and I hope we all get out of the cave sometimes, and don't believe in the masses, but in ourselves. Thanks again PRO for this debate.",

It will be based on logic arguments and sources (\"Would you prefer a deadly disease, or asthma?\") Going further, lets have a look at your references: [1] http://www.niaid.nih.gov... You have based your only argument on the table that can be seen in link above. Let me brake it a bit. As you can see in the First Row, second column, it mentions the number/baseline of cases pre (before) vaccination in the 20th century. Then, at the very end, it can be observed the Percent Decrease. This percentage/value does not indicate that those numbers have been in fact reduced by that value due to the effects of vaccines (ie. some people built their own immunity) just because the reported cases have decreased it does not mean that it is due to the vaccines. This applies to all the diseases/infections in that table. Provide more arguments to support your case. Defense: 1. Distrust in the Pharmaceutical Industries True that the Vioxx is not a vaccination, but the only difference is the way it is administered. I do not want to get into medical terminology, but, in short, some drugs cannot be swallowed, so they have to be injected directly into the blood stream vs others can. The point I was trying to prove is that the Pharmaceutical Industries do have a percentage error/mistake (humans make mistakes) but this can result in negative results for the individual ranging from mild pains all the way to death. (The old saying \"Engineers fix/repair their mistakes, but doctors bury them\") 2. Side effects of vaccines \"My first two children have had febrile seizures after routine vaccinations, one of them a serious event. These events did not stop me from vaccinating my third child, however, I did take some proactive measures to reduce the risk of similar adverse effects. I vaccinated my child in the morning so that we were aware if any early adverse reaction during the day and I also gave my child a dose of paracetamol 30 min before the vaccination was given to reduce any fever that might develop after the injection\" [1] I copied the above statement from your source #2. This is an example of a real life individual who has spoken to the authorities/press. This proves to be that for example I, as a sick individual, who is required to take a certain medication/vaccine have to comply to the exceptions/rules that are associated with that drug (side effects) just so I will no get sicker or to conquer/overcome my disease. Here are some examples of side effects and the associated vaccines: Chickenpox Vaccine Vaccine strain varicella zoster infection after vaccination without other organ involvement; Vaccine strain varicella zoster infection and subsequent infection resulting in pneumonia, encephalitis, meningitis or hepatitis in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiences; [2] Two Canadian flu vaccines were linked to oculo-respiratory syndrome characterized by conjunctivitis, facial swelling, and mild respiratory symptoms.

Vaccines have been portrayed as humanity's savior from diseases like Polio when they really weren't. Polio was already on the decline before the vaccine. Every year we are recommended to get the flu vaccine, but the flu shot is unnecessary and unsafe to get. Vaccines are suppose to stimulate the reaction of a real virus, but the way this is artificially done is dangerous. Babies should avoid as much immune stimulation as they can. One study done showed that Immune molecules in the brain during neural development is damaging and can cause autism. So why are babies getting so many vaccinations? [1] Also the amount of toxic substances in vaccines is way more than the amount that anyone should get at one time. Premature neonates should not receive more than 4 to 5 micrograms of aluminum per kilogram of body weight. An 8 pound healthy baby = max of 18.16mcg of aluminum. The Hep B vaccine has 250 micrograms. [2] We are told that vaccines don't cause any other problems, but In a study of 11,000 children the chances of getting asthma were cut in half if vaccinations were delayed. [3] After inoculation for that zostavax a person has a large chance of testing positive for the varicella zoster virus. Because of this, vaccinated individuals have the potential to spread the disease. [4] Vaccines are filled with toxic ingredients, and deserve another critical look by parents.

            "premise": "You want to do what is best for your children. You know about the importance of car seats, baby gates and other ways to keep them safe. But, did you know that one of the best ways to protect your children is to make sure they have all of their vaccinations? Immunizations can save your child\"s life. Because of advances in medical science, your child can be protected against more diseases than ever before. Some diseases that once injured or killed thousands of children, have been eliminated completely and others are close to extinction\" primarily due to safe and effective vaccines. Polio is one example of the great impact that vaccines had have in the United States. Polio was once America\"s most-feared disease, causing death and paralysis across the country, but today, thanks to vaccination, there are no reports of polio in the United States. Vaccination is very safe and effective. Vaccines are only given to children after a long and careful review by scientists, doctors, and healthcare professionals. Vaccines will involve some discomfort and may cause pain, redness, or tenderness at the site of injection but this is minimal compared to the pain, discomfort, and trauma of the diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare. The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children. Immunization protects others you care about. Children in the U.S. still get vaccine-preventable diseases. In fact, we have seen resurgences of measles and whooping cough (pertussis) over the past few years. Since 2010, there have been between 10,000 and 50,000 cases of whooping cough each year in the United States and about 10 to 20 babies, many of which were too young to be fully vaccinated, died each year. While some babies are too young to be protected by vaccination, others may not be able to receive certain vaccinations due to severe allergies, weakened immune systems from conditions like leukemia, or other reasons. To help keep them safe, it is important that you and your children who are able to get vaccinated are fully immunized. This not only protects your family, but also helps prevent the spread of these diseases to your friends and loved ones. Immunizations can save your family time and money. A child with a vaccine-preventable disease can be denied attendance at schools or child care facilities. Some vaccine-preventable diseases can result in prolonged disabilities and can take a financial toll because of lost time at work, medical bills or long-term disability care. In contrast, getting vaccinated against these diseases is a good investment and usually covered by insurance. The Vaccines for Children program is a federally funded program that provides vaccines at no cost to children from low-income families. To find out more about the VFC program,. Immunization protects future generations. Vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago. For example, smallpox vaccination eradicated that disease worldwide. Your children don\"t have to get smallpox shots any more because the disease no longer exists. By vaccinating children against rubella (German measles), the risk that pregnant women will pass this virus on to their fetus or newborn has been dramatically decreased, and birth defects associated with that virus no longer are seen in the United States. If we continue vaccinating now, and vaccinating completely, parents in the future may be able to trust that some diseases of today will no longer be around to harm their children in the future.",

Nonetheless, if everyone had vaccines, they wouldn't contract the disease.\" I asked: \"...how would one vaccination cover 20 million children?\" - my opponent replied \"i know that in some countries, parents may not be able to afford vaccines for their children - completely irrelevant to the question. \"Why would that just suddenly happen in that time period?\" - maybe it was a coincidence...? - contradiction: \"why would that suddenly happen in that time period?...even when they dissapear for a while\" - you denied the existence of the improvement in hygiene, etc, yet acknowledged it a couple of sentences later. \"saved those 5,000 to 10,000 lives lost\" You cannot save lives that are already lost. \"Pertussis came about in 1906, and hurt people until the vaccine came around. An average of 7,500 people are dying a year. This lasts for approximately 24 years. This is plain ridiculous. It comes out to 180,000 people dying! Tell me that's not big!\" Frankly, if that number is big, then vaccines don't work. If you consider the number that vaccines fail to save \"big,\" you are saying that vaccines do not save this \"big\" amount of people. \"According to a 2003 report by researchers at the Pediatric Academic Society, childhood vaccinations in the US prevent about 10.5 million cases of infectious illness and 33,000 deaths per year.\" This amount of deaths is because we are too reliant on vaccinations! A recent study in 2006 conducted by Dr. James Marswell, quotes: \"...[vaccinations]can cause many deaths, not because it isn't used for some people, but because it is used by the majority. I recently conducted a study and gave two people the influenza vaccine. I gave another [pair]of people no vaccine. Two weeks later, I infected them with chicken pox bacteria...The latter proved to fight against bacterial germination better...\" \"There's absolutely no need to yell\" There is no way to italicize nor bolden, so I must (sadly) sustain to capital letters. According to the Constitution, (to refute your later statements,) people have the right to: a. express or perform their religion b. parents are allowed to treat their minors as they please, not to the extent of child abuse How is one person not being vaccinated a risk to others? If they are vaccinated, they should not be in danger! you don't show the \"moral sense.\" Thank you for your wonderful conduct. To plagiarize (I spelled it wrong before) means \"to take without referencing from someone else's writing or speech.\" However, listing statistics is not plagiarizing. You even plagiarized yourself from the same source! Also, I listed tons of sources, just not in the same way that you did. Do I have to bother to do it? Also, your entire speech is without sources! \"Things that we don't know about are things outside of this universe and in the deepest corners of the Earth. \" Can you scientifically explain how we got our consciousness? How minerals, unliving elements, can create a living being? Life is right in front of our eyes! There are many things that we do not yet know. \"People should not have the right to put themselves and others at risk.\" As I stated a myriad of times, if the others are vaccinated, they should be safe! \"'First of all, i would like to point out that if other children are vaccinated, they should be safe...? Also, if their children are at risk, that is their problem. They decided, using their rights, not to vaccinate their children and therefore should be allowed to make that decision for a minor.' If you read my entire argument, you would find that vaccines are beneficial, but children aren't 100% safe. They will just have better defense against it and won't be effected as much.\" They will not have better defense against it and will be affected as much, if not greater, according to the study I quoted above. \"It was not plagiarized. I cited my source. Anyways, this refutation is ridiculous. What happens when people try to get a \"natural immune system\"? They get the disease and THEY DIE. There is no way to develop a natural immune system on your own, or even with help, with the knowledge we currently possess. Vaccinations are beneficial and they prevent diseases from seriously harming your body.\" Hm...then how come our own history teacher last year stated \"I don't believe in Western Medicines. I believe in Chinese Herbs, to build up our own natural defenses?\" Putting personal experiences aside, I have a source to back this up: \"to work boosting your immune system at the same time.\" -http://probiotics.mercola.com... \"Immune boosters...\" -http://www.askdrsears.com... All these sources talk about making your immune system stronger. Can you deny that there are ways do it? Plus, consider the source above that I stated, the experiment in 2006 \"Vaccines should be mandatory because they are helpful\" If they are helpful, they are a good way to help prevent sicknesses! That doesn't mean that it should be mandatory. If you read above, you would've seen me say that some people are allergic to chemicals that can cause bad effects on a person. Therefore, those people should be allowed to not vaccinate! THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLERGIC SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE A CHOICE TO NOT VACCINATE, WHICH THEREFORE WINS THIS DEBATE! I did indeed tell you to start first, but you cannot take that to your advantage and say that I didn't touch some of your arguments. Taking it from there, please forfeit the last round, making us both go three times, stabilizing this debate. IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS, STRIKE, THE READERS WILL NONETHELESS NOT GRADE YOU FOR YOUR FINAL SPEECH. Your meager two sources are not linked up with any of your refutations or statements I must add, your three last points are not allowed to be brought up in the final round. REaders, I have refuted his points and he has brought up illegal points on the refutation round. [1]Governments should not have the right to intervene in the health decisions parents make for their children.31% of parents believe they should have the right to refuse mandated school entry vaccinations for their children, according to a 2010 survey by the University of Michigan. [2]Many parents hold religious beliefs against vaccination. Forcing such parents to vaccinate their children would violate the 1st Amendment which guarantees citizens the right to free exercise of their religion. [3]Vaccines are often unnecessary in may cases where the threat of death from disease is small. During the early nineteenth century, mortality for childhood diseases whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever fell drastically BEFORE IMMUNIZATION BECAME AVAILABLE. This decreased mortality has been attributed to improved personal hygiene, water purification,effective sewage disposal, and better food hygiene and nutrition. For these reasons, I have clearly won this debate.",

If you want a link, I'll give you one. http://www.who.int... \"...some drugs cannot be swallowed, so they have to be injected directly into the blood stream vs others can.\" This says that some injections can be mistrusted.

            "premise": "Well it is time for me to expand on my previous two points. My first point is that people do have dangerous reactions to vaccines. The probability of these dangerous reactions are different depending on the vaccine. Each vaccine has a different probability of a bad reactions and different types of bad reactions (1). By forcing everyone to take a vaccine forces some to take something harmful, and in rare situations even lethal. Currently working at a bio-lab with a safety level of 3 requires mandatory vaccines, but its reasons for being mandatory are far more justifiable since it deals with working with harmful pathogens as part of the job. But the requirement points out crucial effects of making vaccines mandatory, it prevents people with harmful reactions to vaccines from being able to be in the job. For example, Nancy Jaax couldn't get vaccinated without negative reactions so she had no chance of working in biosafety level 3. Instead she had to try to get into biosafety level 4 since the diseases there had no vaccines or cures. If vaccines were to be mandatory, it would force people with bad reactions to either do something that makes them sick or even worse kill them, or be force to go through any punishments for not following the mandate. My second point is that the government should not be able to force people to have a substance injected into their body. There are certain things that should not be in the governments power do to the possibility of abuse. While it may currently seem that the government cannot do anything wrong, that doesn't mean that it can't go down hill in the future. The last thing you need in the future is a corrupt government that can inject the citizens with what it deems fit. In addition mandating vaccines encroaches on our rights. People should have a right to decide what doesn't go into our body. Sources 1 http://www.cdc.gov...",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for opening this challenge and allowing me to accept. As he as not specified a structure for the debate, I'll do my best to do so in a fair and common manner.Round 1: Con's CaseRound 2: Pro's Case, Con's RebuttalsRound 3: Pro's Rebuttals, Con's Defense & RebuttalsRound 4: Pro's Defense & Rebuttals Con's Closing StatementsRound 5: Pro's Closing Statements, Con (ends debate)With that in mind, I'd like to move to some housekeeping, particularly in regards to the resolution.The resolution is quite wordy and slightly incoherent. I'll try to reword the definition in a manner that both preserves the context and intent of the instigator but that also is more coherent and effective. Hopefully my opponent will agree to the stipulations, as the implications of the two resolutions are quite frankly the same.Resolved: Religious exemption of necessary vaccinations should be permitted.As Con, my opponent, the instigator is negating this notion, arguing that there shouldn't be exemptions for vaccinations based on religious beliefs. As Pro, I will be arguing the converse; that religious exemption should be accepted and permitted. The burden of proof, or BoP, will rest primarily upon Pro to affirm the resolution and exemplify why a change to the status quo (e.g. disallowing religious exemptions) is better than allowing it. My primary duty will be to negate these arguments. However, for the sake of balancing the BoP, I will also provide a case of my own, open to scrutiny by my opponent, to give a more equal balance to the BoP in the debate.Definitions:Vaccinate: \"medical : to give (a person or an animal) a vaccine to prevent infection by a disease\" [1]Religious exemption: \"The religious exemption is granted based on the U.S. Constitution First Amendment right to freely hold and exercise religious beliefs.\" [2]Necessary: \"absolutely needed\"With those items out of the way, I will present my case.Observations:I would like to note that my opponent has used the word necessary to define the vaccinations of which he/she believes should be utilized regardless of religion. It is imperative to realize that my opponent has not stipulated how this word should be interpreted. As it is highly subjective, it is quite difficult to perceive exactly what my opponent intended. However, for the purpose of this debate (and that my opponent mentioned parents), we will simplify this word to mean the following: any vaccination *required* to attend a public school. This focuses the resolution towards children and more definitively interprets necessary.Contention I: Religious exemption is already permitted.In various states, and actually a majority, religious exemption for vaccinations are already permitted. [4] [5]A change from the status quo would subsequently require a policy change. As the current policies are already in place, it is evident that the majority of states accept the religious reasoning behind denying vaccinations. It has been accepted in the past, and should thus be accepted and permitted now.Moreover, there are instances which support the idea of religious exemption. For example, a women in New York won the right to not vaccinate her son, based on religious convictions. [8] This is another example of how religious exemption is already accepted and permitted.Contention II: Some vaccinations contain components which can violate religious beliefs.It is fact that the vaccinations themselves, and their components could violate religious beliefs. For example, some religions (such as Jews and Muslims) do not condone the consumption of pig. [6] It is also fact that some vaccinations that could be deemed *necessary* contain forms of pig. [7]Forcing individuals to vaccinate their children with vaccines that are derived from organisms which violate religious convictions of the parents and/or the children themselves is a direct and specific example of an infringement on religious freedom.Contention III: Religious exemption is protected under the US Constitution.The First Amendment of the Constitution shows the government cannot prohibit the exercise of a religion. [9] This means that the government cannot make a law interfering or prohibiting the exercise of a religion. [10] In regards to vaccinations, the free exercise clause allows exemption from vaccinations. Former editor-in-chief of USA Today explains, \"the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment mandates state accommodation for members of religious groups who object to the vaccinations on religious grounds. The free-exercise argument follows the logic that requiring children to perform an action (in this case to receive a vaccination) that is abhorrent to their religious beliefs and/or practices places a significant and undue burden on their free-exercise rights.\" [11]Because the constitution allows a free exercise of religion, and exemption is neutral and not favoring a religious establishment, permitting religious exemptions is the most pragmatic option.Contention IV: Vaccinations aren't totally safe.Religious reasons for denying vaccinations is quite widespread. One of those reasons is also safety. Beyond moral convictions, these stretch to safety, and how they could harm the body. The Institute of Medicine admits, \"Vaccines are not free from side effects, or \u201cadverse effects.\" [12] Moreover, the link of MMR autism suggested in 1998 isn't the only thing parents should be worried about. Many vaccinations aren't totally safe. [13] For religious reasons, parents do not want to put their children in danger. As there is a possibility, this is another reason to permit religious exemption.Contention V: Flawed arguments envelop anti-exemption.Many people opposed to the idea of religious exemption claim that most religions don't hold the view that vaccinations are unacceptable. However, religious exemption goes further than the base \"religion\" itself. Pro-life activist Eric Schleidler explains, \"You can have a more scrupulous moral position than the official teaching of the church.\" [14] This is very true. As vaccine laws sometimes require an explanation [2], this religious moral position even moreso dictates we accept and permit religious exemption.Another argument is that it's always too easy to get religious exemptions. However, more and more states are tightening the law in this regard, making it more difficult and more explanatory to receive religious exemption. [14] Instead of abolishing it altogether, tightening the existing policies is more effective at a) protecting liberty and religious freedom, and b) protecting utilitarian health.Furthermore, there exists arguments that religious exemption is a major health hazard. While vaccinations have considerably helped curb diseases our society once suffered, the exemptions we have don't pose as large a threat as propaganda proclaims. With most individuals vaccinated, would that not prevent those individuals from contracting and being affected by the disease in the first place? If exempt people accept the risk (which they do) then why not let them? Further, there have not been near the hazards or outbreaks of which propaganda loves to exclaim.Conclusion:I have provided a host of arguments backing my position, showing the logical and moral reasons as to why religious exemption from vaccinations should be both accepted and permitted, thus fulfilling the resolution and effectively affirming it.Sources:[1] http://www.merriam-webster.com...[2] http://www.nvic.org...[3] http://www.merriam-webster.com...[4] http://www.ncsl.org...[5] http://www.pewresearch.org...[6] http://www.themodernreligion.com...[7] http://www.pewresearch.org...[8] http://nypost.com...[9] https://www.law.cornell.edu...[10] https://www.law.cornell.edu...[11] http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org...[12] http://www.hrsa.gov...[13] http://www.theguardian.com...[14] http://www.chicagotribune.com...",

Andraz Melansek notes \"Many vaccines have significant adverse effects, of which the most serious can result in death.\" [1] Dangerous vaccinations exist, and if we make vaccinations compulsory, we can't avoid these effects. Holland explains \"There are several major safety concerns: (1) inadequate testing of vaccines, individually and cumulatively; (2) insufficient attention to vaccine additives; (3) the failure to screen out vulnerable subjects; (4) insufficient incentives and funding for vaccine safety; and (5) government discouragement of discourse about vaccine safety.\" [2] There are a lot of factors which go into making vaccinations dangerous, but it's conclusive they do have detrimental effects.

Forcing such parents to vaccinate their children would violate the 1st Amendment which guarantees citizens the right to the free exercise of their religion.\" Frankly I don't care what rules the parents think they are breaking of some book written thousands of years ago, I stand for the well being of the children. If I prove that vaccines have health benifits then this point falls. \"Vaccines are often unnecessary in many cases where the threat of death from disease is small. During the early nineteenth century, mortality for the childhood diseases whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever fell drastically before immunization became available. This decreased mortality has been attributed to improved personal hygiene, water purification, effective sewage disposal, and better food hygiene and nutrition.\" Yes I agree with you. There is a lot less disease, and the black plagues gone. It's true this isn't entirely due to vaccin ation. But the fact is there are still many infectious diseases rampant in all socieites, and hepititus is a plague. You're closing your eyes to a very important problem-disease still exists and spreads very regularly. \"Vaccines interfere with natural law and God's plan for humanity. Disease is a natural occurrence, and humans should not interfere with its trajectory.\" Yes I agree! Let's all be literal Darwinists and kill the babies who are born with deformations in the hospitals because God obviously wanted them to die! People with leprosy are being punished for sins in a past life! Oh wait this isn't the dark ages any more, if a member of our society is sick we do our best to cure them and prevent sickness. Gods plan for humanity is a future without disease. \"Common childhood vaccinations may cause rare yet serious reactions including anaphylactic shock, paralysis, and sudden death. This risk is not worth taking, especially considering most diseases vaccinated against are not necessarily life threatening.\" Can I have some sources for this ourageous claim? Just because HPV isn't life threatning we don't protect our children from it? Vaccines aren't supposed to be life savers all the time-their job is to stop the spread of infectious diseases around our society. As for these reactions you talk of, first please source. Secondly, they are proabably one in a million scenerios and the child is surrounded by health proffesionals will make it a minor issue. I agree that they might happen, but we still go to surgery even though their are risks of side effects yes? Vaccines destroy an immediate risk to our health. \"All vaccines cause immune system suppression, and can permanently damage the natural immune system. Unvaccinated children build and strengthen their immune systems through fighting off infection and developing natural immunity to diseases like measles and chickenpox. Artificial immunity, generated through vaccination, weakens the immune system and leaves children more vulnerable to all other diseases and infections.\" You're trying to prove that un-vaccinated children are more resistant then vaccinated children? Do you even know why children get vaccines? It's to protect them from the diseases thier bodies can't cope with on their own. Vaccines don't push out a natural defense-they provide the only defense. Having your child contract hep C won't toughen him up. It will kill him or her. \"Children should not receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B is a blood-born disease and is primarily spread by sexual intercourse and intravenous drug use. Children are not at great risk of contracting the disease. In addition, researchers have found that immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis.\" When the subject is children and disease, well to be honest any risk is enough to warrant vaccination. Plus, you need to source the information that shows there's more than a one in a million chance for a child to contract a disease from a vaccine. There's also a chance kids can contract bone cancer from cell phones, but that doesn't mean we outlaw cell phones-the risk simply isn't larg enough. \"Vaccines are promoted primarily to generate profits for manufacturers and financial donations for medical organizations that endorse vaccines. In 2003, a House Committee on Government Reform report revealed that the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had members with significant financial ties to vaccine companies. The American Academy of Pediatrics, a leading pro-vaccination organization, receives millions of dollars from vaccine companies.\" Of course the vaccine companies make tons of money...people buy their products because it makes them immune to diseases..supply and demand...I think there's a large market for people who want to stop the spread of disease.. MY ARGUMENT P1. Vaccines make children immune to certain diseases and illnesses p2. Being Immune to certain diseases and illnesses is good p3. Any Parent who does not want their child to be immune to certain dseases and illnesses is not acting in the childs best interests p4. It is the role of the state to act in the childs best interests C. The state should administer vaccinations",

            "conclusion": "Vaccination with the MMR vaccine should be mandatory",
            "premise": "Alright, let\"s kick this thing off with the case. The U.S. Federal Government will require that all individuals before attending school receive the vaccination. All individuals who are beyond schooling age and under the age of 65 would have to get the vaccine within 5 years. These will be subsidized on an as-needed basis, ensuring that it is broadly affordable. Failure to vaccinate oneself or one's family results in a fine that scales with income. There would be other exclusions based on allergies, pregnancies, and those individuals who are immunocompromised. Before I transition into some contentions, I\"ll start with some general overview of this issue. This debate is fundamentally a comparison between individual choice and public good. I think both agree that vaccines are a public good, at least insofar as having vaccines available to the public is a net benefit to society. It is generally beneficial for people to be able to protect themselves against potentially deadly viruses and bacteria. These are infectious, so there is also a benefit to others around us. If Con wishes to argue that this is not the case, he\"s welcome to do so, but for now, I\"ll function under the assumption that we agree on the efficacy of vaccines. We know that there is also a fundamental level of value to individual choice, which I\"m certain Con will get into in his argument. So, how do we balance freedom vs. health? As a society, we do this quite often. Think about traffic laws. We require people to follow certain rules of the road because not doing so makes them a danger to both themselves and others. And this isn\"t the only instance where our government goes against basic beliefs in the general population. Despite widespread acrimony over drug tests, workplaces are still allowed to require them. We are taxed despite the protestations of individuals who don\"t like certain taxes. All of this is allowed not because the government is being overbearing, but because we\"ve accepted an aspect of shared responsibility for our actions. We accept that individual rights do not always trump that responsibility, particularly when doing so could cause harm to others. So, when is it justified to subvert individual choice to the public good? That requires that two conditions to be met. Whatever is being regulated or mandated must be safe and effective, and the risk of not participating in said behavior must outweigh any risk from the behavior itself. I would argue that vaccines meet these criteria. Vaccines are both safe and effective, and they have a track record of reducing illness and death from the diseases they prevent. Again, if my opponent wishes to challenge this, I will be more than happy to provide evidence to support this argument (some of the coming arguments will support this), though I believe it\"s a point on which we agree. All of this puts Con in a difficult position. He\"s going to try and argue that vaccines are markedly different from other issues that encounter the liberty vs. public good question, and he\"ll have to show that the personal freedoms lost outweigh the widely evidenced good that vaccines provide. To do that, he\"ll have to counter life and quality of life lost, which comes with numerical weight, with a vaguer conception of impact, as personal freedom isn\"t clearly quantifiable. I look forward to seeing what he comes up with. With that, onto my contentions. 1. Disease Spread We must recognize that vaccination is not a choice that solely affects the individual being vaccinated. The decision to get the MMR vaccine affects everyone around you. Measles, mumps and rubella are all transmitted through droplets that are sprayed into the air, making them airborne pathogens with a high likelihood of transmission to those around the infected.[1, 2, 3] The mere fact that others are put at risk by people who refuse to take these vaccines creates a substantial societal harm in the status quo, as many are allowed to refuse to get the vaccine. We're living this harm today, seeing a resurgence in these entirely preventable diseases in the U.S. and abroad.[4] This resurgence is most marked with measles, a disease that the U.S. had eliminated by the year 2000, but which returned in 17 outbreaks among 222 people just in 2011.[5] Mumps has had 4 reported outbreaks this year alone, and has had several small and two large outbreaks in the last 5 years, encompassing thousands of people.[6] Rubella has also returned from a long absence, appearing in three cases in the U.S. in 2012 after being eliminated back in 2004.[7] This change resulted mainly from a false public perception that vaccines have been linked to autism.[8] In order to understand why vaccinating a large portion of the population is necessary, we have to understand the term \"herd immunity.\" This has been defined differently by different authors, but I will use the term in this fashion: \"a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in the incidence of infection.\"[9] What that means is that if someone becomes sick with a given disease, herd immunity would ensure that that person is so much more likely to run into someone vaccinated against that disease than someone who is vulnerable that they would be extremely unlikely to infect other people. We cannot possibly vaccinate everyone and achieve absolute immunity because of the necessity of the exclusions I listed in my case, but we can seek to achieve herd immunity. What does that threshold look like for these diseases? For measles, this is 95%.[10] For mumps, it's at least 88%, though it \"may need to be higher\" than this previously established threshold.[11] For rubella, it sits at 90%.[12] Only through mandatory vaccination could we ever hope to reach those numbers. 2. Disease Impact My first contention established a threshold for harm in status quo, but I will now show that that threshold has a tremendous impact on society. In order to understand that, we have to know what the impact of these three diseases is. Measles: \"Prior to the vaccine, 3-4 million people were infected in the U.S. each year, resulting in 48,000 hospitalizations, 400-500 deaths and approximately 1,000 who developed chronic disabilities. Even with modern medical care, the disease can lead to serious complications, including blindness, pneumonia, otitis media and severe diarrhea. Despite the availability of a vaccine it remains a leading cause of death among young children worldwide, with deaths mainly attributable to the complications of the disease... More than 90 percent of susceptible people, usually unvaccinated, develop the disease after being exposed. There is no treatment except to make the patient as comfortable as possible by keeping them hydrated and trying to control the fever. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant women are at the highest risk for measles and its complications, including death.\"[13] Mumps: \"Mumps is not normally a fatal disease, and up to 30% of mumps infections are asymptomatic. There can be serious complications, however, including aseptic meningitis, orchitis, oophoritis, mastitis, pancreatitis, and deafness. Meningitis occurs in up to 10% of mumps cases; it is usually subclinical and self-limiting. Symptoms of mumps-related meningitis include fever, headache, vomiting, and neck stiffness, which peak for a period of 48 hours before resolution and might appear up to 1 week before parotid swelling. More serious neurologic symptoms are rare and are due to encephalitis. Hearing loss following mumps infections is rare (1 in 2000 to 30,000 cases) and usually results in mild to moderate hearing loss. Orchitis [swelling of the testicles] occurs 4 to 8 days after the onset of parotitis and is a common complication, affecting 20% of men who develop mumps after puberty. Of those cases, 40% will develop testicular atrophy and 30% will have lasting changes in sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology.\"[14] Rubella: While the disease usually only results in a light fever and small rash, this disease is mainly problematic for pregnant women. \"In 1964-65, America had a major rubella epidemic, with more than 12 million cases and 20,000 babies born with congenital rubella; of these, 13,000 were deaf, 3,500 were blinded by congenital cataracts, and 1,800 more suffered severe cognitive impairment.\"[7] Since pregnant mothers are among the few who cannot get the vaccine, every single person who decides not to get the vaccine is putting these mothers at risk. Taken together, this means these three viruses present as enduring, broad threats to public health that are made dramatically worse in the absence of herd immunity. As we have clearly not reached a level of herd immunity in the absence of a mandate to vaccinate with the MMR vaccine, my plan solves for this harm. With that, I await Con's argument. 1. http://www.cdc.gov... 2. http://www.cdc.gov... 3. http://www.cdc.gov... 4. http://www.npr.org... 5. http://www.cdc.gov... 6. http://www.cdc.gov... 7. http://www.thedailybeast.com... 8. http://online.wsj.com... 9. http://cid.oxfordjournals.org... 10. http://www.theguardian.com... 11. http://jid.oxfordjournals.org... 12. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... 13. http://guardianlv.com... 14. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...",

            "conclusion": "State-mandated administration of childhood vaccines is justified.",
            "premise": "Well, I thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and I'm actually 14 ;)C1: SolvencyVaccines will prevent diseases, because vaccines develop immunity in people. Vaccines, granted, do have side effects, but what doesn\u2019t? For example: annually, 350 people die from bath/shower related incidents, 200 are killed when they choke on food, and 100 are killed by lightning [1]. On average, data from 1988-2008, a 20 year span, annualy 335.1 people are compensated for injuries because of vaccines by the government [2]. Furthermore, they don't all neccessarily die because of vaccines - compensation is also given based on factors such as medical costs, lost of productivity, etc. Childhood vaccines are 90-99% effective in preventing diseases through immunity [3]. Most of the time, children with vaccinations have less complications then children without vaccinations. Vaccinations are successful in reducing human suffering and death. Past examples show that vaccines are efficient. Cuba have literally eradicated measles and polio due to compulsory immunization. Vaccinations have saved an estimated 250000 lives every year there [4].\"Vaccines are among the 20th Century's most successful and cost-effective public health tools for preventing disease and death. Not long ago, diseases such as polio, measles, pertussis, diphtheria, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (known as Hib) were commonplace. Today, cases of most vaccine-preventable diseases are at or near all-time lows, and childhood immunization rates have never been higher. In less than a decade, the use of Hib conjugate vaccines nearly eliminated Hib invasive disease among children. During the course of the century, we have eradicated smallpox worldwide and, as of 1991, have eliminated wild polio virus from the Western Hemisphere.School laws requiring immunizations are effective in ensuring that high numbers of children are immunized\" [7].Quite recently, vaccines have saved countless lives and advanced living conditions. Therefore, vaccines help individuals and prevent diseases C2: Community Mandatory vaccinations protects societies, because our community would be ravaged by dangerous diseases if we don\u2019t develop enough immunity. Herd immunity is a form of immunity where a certain percentage of the population is innoculated agaisnt a disease, hence stopping the spread of it and saving the community. In order to protect public health, up to 95% of our population needs to be vaccinated [5].\"The CDC has determined that \"nonmedical exemptions to vaccinations are a factor in the development of...diseases outbreaks\" -[6]Measles outbreaks in New York City, San Diego, and other communities around the US, involved children whose parents refused vaccination, and another CDC report released in 2008 found that rates of undervaccination are even greater than previous studies showed and have a horrible impact on herd immunity [6]. In Colorado, vaccination rates started to lower, and when they did, the whooping cough worsened and spread. At the end of 2004, there were 1,200 cases of disease - higher than any year since 1964 [4]. The return of whooping cough shows the importance of constantly maintaining herd immunity. Mandatory vaccination has also protected societies from polio and small pox. Childhood vaccinations stop around 10.5 million cases of infectious illness every single year and save 33,000 lives annually [3].Since the introduction of routine childhood vaccination, Diphtheria has dropped from a peak of 206,939 cases in 1921 to only four cases in 1990 [11]. In conclusion, mandatory vaccination protects the community and improves public health.C3: Money With the prevention of 6.4 million childhood deaths, 2 studies report a $231 billion dollar gain over the next 10 years due to routine vaccinations.Childhood vaccinations also reach out to poor families and women, with some vaccines such as the HPV vaccine. HPV leads to cervical cancer, and poor families as a group usually don't see doctors as often and get scanned for cervical cancer, and were also unlikely to give up $50-75 for the vaccine [4]. However, vaccine mandates were able to protect these women at the most cost-efficient way. The CDC also estimated that every $1 spent on the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine saves the heatlh care system $21, and every $1 spent on oral polio vaccinations save $6; and for every $1 spent on the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine saves $30 [9]. C4: The State has the AuthorityIn the past, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of vaccine mandates.One historical case would be Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, where the Supreme Court stated that states have the right to enforce compulsory immunization, and that these were reasonable measures to protect public health and safety [10]. The restraints put in place are for the common good of the people. Furthermore, the police power of the state must protect the public. In the 1922 case of Zucht vs. King, the Supreme Court once again adressed the constitutionality of childhood vaccination mandates, stating that \"these ordinances confer not arbitrary power, but only that broad discretion required for the protection of the public health\" [10].The Arizona Court of Appeals denied the argument that the right to education would defeat the state\u2019s need to protect against the spread of infectious diseases [10].Individual rights do not include liberty to expose the community or the child to transferable diseases and sabatoge the well-being of others. Individuals themselves have the moral obligation to vaccinate their children. Generally, individuals are free to make decisions that impact their own lives, but in the case of vaccinations, your actions affect other individuals, removing this freedom [12]. The failure to vaccinate your children results in unintentionally passing on contagious diseases.On the grounds of potentional harm to outside parties, parents must vaccinate their offspring.Conclusion:The government has the right to enforce mandatory childhood vaccinations, along with a compelling state reasons. Vaccines, also, generally saves more lives than it harms, and provides monetary benefits to the people who use vaccines. The ultimate conclusion is that the government should force vaccinations, in order to maximize public health and do what is best for the common good.Sources:(Please forgive me, because I don't have the links to some of the sources.)[1] Dr. Paul, Univ. of PA Medical & Dr. Louis, Pediatrics Chief, Children\u2019s Hospital of Physicians.

            "conclusion": "Vaccination with the MMR vaccine should be mandatory",
            "premise": "Thanks to Smooosh for his arguments. Time to kick off R3. I\"ll start with some overviews. OV1: Concessions and Drops So, right off the bat, Con is conceding the vast majority of my case. He concedes the effectiveness and safety of vaccination, concedes all the numbers I provide (including the thresholds for herd immunity) and concedes the need to have vaccines in society. However, the key issues are the drops. Con drops much of my overview. I\"ll get into this more on his contentions, but I must point out that I stipulated two conditions that are required for a mandate: they are both safe and effective, and the risk of remaining unvaccinated far outweighs the risk of vaccination. Con doesn\"t challenge this, nor does he accomplish anything along the lines of what I pointed out next. He hasn\"t shown that vaccines are markedly different from issues like traffic laws (more on that shortly), and he hasn\"t even attempted to compare the harms caused by loss of personal freedoms to the societal good vaccines provide. He has no quantifiable impacts for any of his arguments. Con also drops the text of my plan. He mentions an uncertainty when it comes to enforcement, but it\"s quite clear how the case functions: \"Failure to vaccinate oneself or one's family results in a fine that scales with income.\" That means all the penalties of this policy are directed at the parents. If a child is not vaccinated, it\"s up to the individual school (as in status quo) to decide whether they can attend. This penalty is solely restricted to not getting vaccinated, so any harms that come from a decision to pay the fine instead would not be subject to legal action. Much as Con calls this \"an egregious violation of the constitution\", he doesn\"t justify this statement. There is no freedom of choice in the Constitution, and the Constitution often weighs societal good over personal freedoms. That\"s the reason you can\"t shout \"fire\" in a crowded theater, or refuse to pay your taxes. OV2: Lack of evidence Con\"s case is also severely lacking in the source department. He makes a lot of assertions without any evidence to support them. That makes it impossible for him to quantitate his impacts, much less explain how they weigh against mine. Con will have to do a lot more in R3 if he hopes to have any chance in this debate. Onto Con\"s contentions. I\"ll reorganize these a bit. I. Warranting a Mandate Con is protests my case by arguing that the damage done by measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is relatively minor compared to other issues. Multiple responses. 1. Con concedes my numbers, which show a clear harm to society in the form of lost life and reduced quality of life for many. He presents no numbers of his own to show that any of the issues he presents outweigh the harms caused by MMR. 2. Even if they did somehow outweigh, we can accept that there are a lot of issues that could and should be resolved for the public good while still resolving this clear problem. Con concedes that MMR are harmful, and that vaccines are effective against them. Any lives saved by increasing the spread of vaccines in the US is sufficient reason all by itself to implement this policy. Con hasn\"t presented a reason that MMR doesn\"t meet the threshold required to act, whereas I have provided extensive evidence supporting this kind of action. Just because the government cannot feasibly protect individuals from all potential sources of harm does not justify Con\"s side of this debate, as this is clearly an instance where the harms can be effectively stemmed and peoples\" lives can be saved. 3. Con didn\"t respond to my overview, and that\"s pretty damning to this argument. The reason we have traffic laws is to prevent a great deal of car accidents that would happen if they did not exist. They are also the reason we require individuals with a car to have a license when they drive, to get the car registered, and to have insurance. Car accidents represent such a significant danger that cars and their owners are highly regulated, and their personal freedoms are abridged to protect others from drivers who would put them at risk because of their poor choices. The same logic applies to vaccines: individuals pose a significant risk to others by carrying around a potentially deadly and easily transmissible disease. They made a poor choice by not receiving a vaccination. In doing so, they were free to harm others who could not make such a choice. Con\"s argument may be driving at a slippery slope, but this is one instance where that slope favors my case. Vaccines should be mandatory because that\"s what the law demands right now. Con also argues that addressing immigrants would be difficult and require other means than I\"ve stated. He\"s absolutely right \" I provide no means to address an influx of immigrants that will almost certainly bring diseases with them. Neither does Con, nor does this reduce the impact of my arguments. Turn this argument against Con. He\"s conceding that there will always be an influx of potential disease vectors into this country. The mandate offers the only possible means by which herd immunity can be achieved (remember how high those numbers are), and therefore the only means of protecting the population from these foreign diseases. There will always be a risk that immigrants will transmit deadly diseases to the population, but only my case effectively dilutes the effect. II. Convincing vs. Mandating Con argues that scientists should convince the masses to vaccinate, rather than having the government require people to do so. My response to this is simple: scientists have been trying their damnedest to clear up the misconceptions surrounding vaccinations, and people still aren\"t listening. The evidence of just how successful vaccines have been (particularly the MMR vaccine) is readily available and commonly supported in public service announcements and in the news.[15-18] People are educated by their doctors, their schools, and by scientists in the news and communities.[19-22] Con keeps stating that they could do more, yet he provides no specific ideas beyond just educating them more and better. How, exactly, does Con think this can be accomplished? He doesn\"t say. His point that people who are afraid of needles may be convinced is similarly unwarranted. He provides no basis by which people who are so afraid of the process could be convinced. I do agree with Con that there is a disconnect between science and much of society. However, I don\"t agree with the unsupported assumption he\"s making that it can be solved by simply educating more people. A lot of the people who aren\"t getting vaccinated simply don\"t accept the scientific findings, no matter how well supported they are.[23] Con will have to provide some means to overcome this barrier. In the meantime, mandating vaccination does two things. First, it ensures that these individuals do not endanger others by getting MMR. Second, it functions as a personal empirical evidence of their safety. Many of these people believe that vaccines are dangerous to their health, even when the evidence is very much against them.[24] Receiving a vaccine provides them with clear evidence that those concerns are overblown. III. Backlash This comes in a couple of different forms. Con asserts that many of the people who do not get vaccinations are antivaxxers who are convinced that the government is out to get them, that religious people will effectively lose their freedom of religion due to their inability to act on their religious beliefs, and that there will be violators who \"wreak havoc on the public.\" I\"ll respond to each in turn. Con acknowledges several times that antivaxxers are objectively wrong. He concedes that their behavior (i.e. their unwillingness to get vaccinated) is damaging to other people in society, even deadly to some. Yet he\"s justifying a system that continues to leave those people in danger based on these same people. Con is effectively yielding to their demonstrably false concerns. Yet at the same time, Con drops my arguments regarding taxation, drug tests, and traffic laws. All of those have detractors as well. Why are they allowed to exist, despite the backlash? Because they provide a greater societal good than harm, and some subset of the population being upset about it doesn\"t detract from that. He talks about \"legitimiz[ing] their fears\", yet he provides no substantive harms that they would cause. They already don\"t get vaccinated, so a continued will not to be vaccinated doesn\"t make them any more of a threat. If they pay the fine, then they are providing funds to society to address health issues that result from their injurious behavior. If they get vaccinated and are still upset, they are no longer a risk to those around them. That outweighs their negativity. The religion point looks remarkably similar to the religious freedom point, and it\"s no more convincing. The only difference here is that Con points to freedom of religion instead of freedom of choice. However, this would hardly be the first instance where this freedom was abridged; there\"s a reason you can\"t get married at 12 or engage in human sacrifice, despite the restrictions those laws impose on religion.[25] There is no such thing as absolute freedom, even when it comes to religion. More importantly, Con provides no reason why religious freedom outweighs societal wellbeing. Some people being upset that they aren\"t allowed to express their religious beliefs by allowing themselves to get measles seems like a rather petty issue compared to lives lost. 15. https://bit.ly... 16. https://bit.ly... 17. https://bit.ly... 18. https://bit.ly... 19. https://bit.ly... 20. https://theatln.tc... 21. https://bit.ly... 22. https://on.ny.gov... 23. https://bit.ly... 24. https://nyti.ms... 25. https://bit.ly...",

A survey of 1997-2002 data showed that those never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month were 200% less likely to have autism.

            "premise": "Responses: \"I do not quite think my opponent understands my debate topic: vaccines do not cause autism. If this is my debate topic then the opposing simply has to prove that vaccines do cause autism. I did not ask whether high fevers in pregnant women cause autism but rather vaccines. I agree we are debating whether or not vaccines \"cause\" autism. The key word being \"cause\", which as I previously defined means to bring about and at no point specifies in what manner it needs to bring about. My opponent then present an alternative definition of the word cause: \"According to this exact definition by thefreedictionary, the opponent is required to prove that VACCINES are responsible for a result(autism)\" However logically we can see this simply supports my previous definition, as this definition in no way specifies that the \"result\" has to be occur in one single step, rather it simply needs to be the logical resolution(autism) of an event (vaccination) through any pathway(high fever). But for the sake of clarifying the framework beyond all doubt we can look to the definition of \"result\" as used by Merriam Webster [3]: \"to happen because of something else that happened or was done before \" As we can see my interpretation of the resolution clearly conforms to this definition as the result(autism) occurred because of and action(vaccination) that occurred before it. So regardless of how my opponent wishes to frame this debate one can clearly see that my interpretation subscribes to the exact wording of the resolution. \"Common side effects of vaccines include: injection site reactions (pain, swelling and redness) mild fever. shivering. fatigue. headache. muscle and joint pain. Therefore, we can conclude that a more severe and rare side effect is a high fever.\" Regardless of how rare high fever may be, it is still a side effect and thus has the possibility of resulting in autism. Note, the the resolution does not ask that i prove that autism is a frequent occurrence, but rather has the possibility of occurring. Moreover, readers should recall the the affirmative agreed to this interpretation of the resolution in round 2. \" A pregnant woman would be required or strongly recommended to get these vaccines to protect her unborn child: Rubella, Hepatitis B, flu, and whooping cough. \" My opponent is again attempting to shift the framework of the debate. We are not debating whether or not an individual should get vaccinated but rather if there is some risk of autism associated with vaccination, regardless of how small. \"According to the opponent's source, high fevers were not listed as any of the side effects for any of these vaccines, but rather simply a fever. Because the fever was listed as a mild side effect, one can assume that it is a mild fever. The opponent's source does not claim that any fever in a pregnant woman is linked to autism, but rather a high fever.\" I'm not sure why my opponent continues to deny the contents of my sources, but if readers are truly concerned they can feel free to read through them. \"Source [1] states: Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at fewer than 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Assume that a high fever is a severe allergic reaction.\" This simply further supports my position as the net result of this is: vaccines->allergic reaction->high fever-> autism. This is simply another pathway by which the end result can be reached. Again ignore the red hearing my opponent presents in regards to low probability as all the resolution requires is an above a probability above zero. \"High fevers are said to be 103 F-104 F. If a pregnant woman goes against the odds and get's a high fever resulting from the vaccine and the baby gets autism, given the slim chance, the fever resulting from the vaccine CAUSED the autism, not the VACCINE itself.\" Again my opponent is essentially arguing the since the mechanism is indirect is doesn't count, which seems to be the crux of her argument. However, as I have stated ad nauseam, there is absolutely no justification in the definition of the word cause as defined by ANY party in this debate to indicate that the mechanism must be direct. \"Since the source did not state that all cases of a high fever in a pregnant woman were due to the vaccine itself, it is safe assume that some of these cases are linked to influenza. According to the opponent's argument that the high fever resulting from the vaccine causes autism, would it also be safe to assume that high fever from the influenza virus is linked to autism as well? How about the fever as a result of a bacterial infection such as strep throat? Would that be linked to autism too?\" Yes. Any high fever during pregnancy increases the risk of the child having autism regardless of the source. \"Conclusion: An accidental relationship is a correlation that exists without any causal relationship between variables. In this case, autism and vaccines are the two variables and there is an accidental relationship between these two. Does autism not occur in children at a very young age? About the same age that they receive vaccines? If so, it's entirely possible that these two variables have no real relationship and are simply coincidental that autism resulted after a vaccine. Below are credible, scientific studies that show that there is absolutely no relationship between vaccines and autism:\" To consolidate, my opponent is claiming that my arguments are entirely correctional and then lists some sources that indicate that there is no DIRECT relationship between autism and vaccination. Her first argument can be dismissed as again it is simply an unsupported claim. In regards to her second claim I urge readers to recall that i am NOT advocating for a direct mechanism but rather an indirect one, and posting a series of articles that advocate ones position and not elaborating on them is generally grounds for ignoring those articles in the context of a debate. I have successfully demonstrate that there does exist the possibility of contracting autism as a result of vaccination and thus urge a negative vote on this resolution. 3) http://www.merriam-webster.com...",

Vaccines for kids - The argument is really pretty simple: there is absolutely no reason for kids to die of preventable illnesses. Vaccines work by imitating infection and training the body to fight those infections[1]. Weak, dead, inactive and/or incomplete viruses are put into the body and the body's immune system is able to use these viruses to produce antibodies against them. It's no different than using a training simulation to teach someone how to do something in real life. [1] http://www.cdc.gov... Vaccines are also important for protecting those who can't be vaccinated due to health reasons or age. Some vaccines require children to be a certain age before they can take them, so by making sure that other children are vaccinated on schedule we keep otherwise deadly viruses from spreading through a phenomena called 'herd immunity'[2]. When everyone who can be vaccinated is vaccinated, we create a sort of buffer which keeps the disease from spreading further. It would be like if you surrounded a fire pit with stones - sure there are things outside of the pit that could still catch on fire, but those stone create a buffer that makes the spread unlikely. [2]http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk... There is rarely any reason not to vaccinate a child. Sometimes a child's specific medical history may warrant avoiding or putting of vaccination entirely if they have an autoimmune disease or some other medical problem, but these specific instances are ones that a child's pediatrician will diagnose. On balance, there is a net benefit to vaccinating children. Vote Pro.",

            "premise": "I will start off with rebuttals. And I'd like to point out that my opponent didn't refute any of my arguments in the previous round.Rebuttals1. It's important to remember that vaccine manufacturers fund the research on vaccines. Therefor vaccine researchers are less likely to be honest about their findings. There is a conflict of interest. Vaccine manufactures also spend 100million dollars a year on advertisements. That's more than any other industry including the oil industry.My opponent states that because vaccine manafacturers fund the research on vaccines, they're less likely to be honest about their findings. This isn't solid evidence that they lied about anything, and until there is, this isn't a valid point. My opponent also states that vaccine manufacturers spend 100 million dollars a year on advertisments. My opponent provided no sources to prove this, so this point is also invalid until there is a source to prove it.2. It's also important to note that there is little science on the molecular cellular level about vaccines.I'm not entirely sure what my opponent is trying to say here. Because the molecular biology is the mainly deals with the interactions of various systems inside a cell. Also, the \"molecular cellular level\" isn't an actual thing. Living organisms are classified into different levels, starting at the molecular level, THEN the cellular level, and then tissue, organ, and system level. I'd like my opponent to better clarify what they mean by \"molecular cellular level\" in the next round.3. The vaccines we have did not go through a 4 year clinical trial but a 16 month trial. This was very irresponsible and dangerous.My opponent does not provide any evidence for this. And they also don't give any reason as to HOW this was \"very irresponsible and dangerous.\"3. Mercury and aluminum both cause brain damage. Eating aluminum is less likely to cause brain damage because it is excreted quickly. But aluminum is vaccines is made to stick around. Aluminum in vaccines causes brain damage. Vaccines also contain mercury.Again, my opponent provides NO SOURCES. Specifically, ALUMINUM SALTS are used in vaccines, they are non-toxic, and there is no evidence that these are related to any health effects[1]. As for mercury, specifically in vaccines, they use thimerosal, and that contains very low doses of mercury. These have not been linked to any bad side effects, but still, in 1999, vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal levels should be reduced, but only as a PRECAUTIONARY measure[2.]4. Chris shaw a pediatrician did an experiment with mice, giving them aluminum and mercury. The test found that after receiving the mercury the mice became more irritable and suffered cognitive and physical damage. No one had debunked dr Shaws study. If he is wrong than the pro vaccine doctors should be able to debunk it but they.a won't because can't.My opponent provides very little detail on this, and no sources. They do not give any link to Chris Shaw's study, and the best I found from an internet search was a biased source conducting an interview with him, that provided no information at all. Obviously, high doses of aluminum and mercury are dangerous, but vaccine manufacturers use aluminum in very low doses, following standards set by the World Health Organization, and mercury is being phased out only as a precautionary measure, as it was used safely for 100 years in vaccines. 5. Vaccines affect everyone differently. However the vaccine industry acts as of it is a one size fits all matter, as if all people will react to vaccines the same way. Children who get autism from vaccines are more allergic than children who don't get autism from it.The amount of people who have had negative side effects is very small, and they are isolated cases, which have proven no link between vaccines and diseases. My opponent says children who get autism from vaccines are more allergic than children who don't, and she doesn't provide any sources, again. This point is invalid until there is a legitimate source provided.4. It is common knowledge that mercury and aluminum cause brain damage and yes autism. Both mercury and aluminum are found inside of vaccines. It was in July of 1999 that the American association of pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers made a statement saying that Mercury should be lessened of eliminated from vaccines. The amount of mercury put in vaccines was reduced but not eliminated.My opponent keeps saying the same thing over and over again. And, as I said before, the lessening of mercury from vaccines is just a precautionary measure, because the low doses haven't been linked to any diseases for many years.5. In the film \"a greater good\" a little boy named Jordan king is featured. Jordan was a happy healthy baby. Than he was vaccinated. His family noticed that he became more irritable, began to walk on his toes and that he would jump up and down and flap his hands when excited but in a strange way. He also became unable to speak. John Green Jordan's doctor tested him for mercury and found that Jordan had very high levels of mercury. His parents tested the pant in their house, the saw dust in the basement but found no mercury. It is undeniable that the mercury had come from the vaccines he was given. Jordan along with 5,600 other people in the omnibius autism proceedings that examined the link between vaccine snake autism in 2001My opponent provides no sources for this story again, it's just a film. My opponent doesn't even provide a link to John Green's research, or Jordan's case. Until there is a valid source for this, this is an invalid point.6.!Many vaccine Injuries have resulted in law suits. One such case includes graham vs Wyeth lab and resulted in 15 million dollars being payed to the Grahams to make up for a severe vaccine injury. Than there's Johnson vs american cynamind ended up resulting in the Johnson's winning 18 million dollars. 7. There are so many vaccine injuries that a program called the vaccine compensation program fund was set up. Every time you receive a vaccine you pay a 75 cent tax that will go to a family who has been affected by a vaccine injury.My opponent again, provides no sources, not for the case, or for the tax. But of course there's a vaccine compensation program, because there will always be isolated cases in which a person is harmed, but these cases aren't solid evidence of a link between vaccines and diseases.For point 8, my opponent references that film, and again, provides no sources. This is another isolated case, and is no solid evidence for vaccines.10. The full study was out one the translational nuerodegeneration site and is called \"mmr vaccine timing and autism in young African American boys reanalysis of cdc study\". This study was retracted in 2014 [3.] It obviously had major flaws in the research, which is why it was retracted. So this point is invalid. ConclusionMy opponent provided NO SOURCES to prove any of her points. Instead, she referenced isolated cases, and one study that was later retracted. Isolated cases cannot be counted as solid evidence. And the one study was retracted, which shows there was major problems in the research against vaccines. http://www.webmd.com... http://www.cdc.gov... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...",

            "conclusion": "Should people be forced to get vaccinated",
            "premise": "Argument 1: There are health risks involved in getting vaccinated.We might be tempted to think that vaccines help prevent disease with no problems. But according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are documented side effects of all known vaccinations. For example, the Adenovirus vaccine has reportedly given 1 out of 10 people diarrhea.[1] Diarrhea is a serious problem, especially for small children. In fact, the CDC claims that diarrheal diseases account for one in nine child deaths worldwide.[2] It seems, then, that if we were to vaccinate everyone (as my opponent proposes), we might actually be risking the lives of children.Adults are not completely safe, either. Vaccines that contain tetanus toxoid, whole cell pertussis bacteria, the rubella virus, or the polio live virus can all lead to \u201cany acute complication or sequela (including death) of an illness.\u201d[3]There are other non-deadly side effects associated with other vaccines, but these are still irksome and unpleasant. There is, for instance, a possible correlation between receiving the Smallpox vaccination and getting a fever within two weeks of the shot.[4] For these reasons, we should really be careful before we propose that everyone in the US should be vaccinated.Argument 2: Free will may be compromised if people are forced to get vaccinated.I believe there are certain cases where free will trumps our health. Do we have the right to force people not to skydive, even though we know that some people could die? Do we have the right to tell people that they cannot go to war? In the same way, I feel that we do not have the right to force people to get vaccines if they do not want it. James Wilson writes, \u201cOnce again, government is grimly determined to make us better despite the fact they always manage to make things worse. Forced vaccination is another case of government meddling in private business and ought to be resisted, even by people like me who like the concept of vaccination but hate the coercion and bullying that comes along at no extra charge.\u201d[5]When people are struggling against receiving a vaccination, it is possible that the needle can break. This sometimes happens even when patients do not appear to be struggling.[6] We should think about the consequences of applying a needle to someone who is struggling against receiving the shot. In some cases, this can lead to more harm than good.Argument 3: Vaccinating everyone would be costly.My opponent\u2019s proposal to vaccinate everyone seems extremely costly and outlandish. Consider that there are 319 million people in the US,[7] and there are many vaccines that cost over fifty dollars.[8]How will we pay for all these vaccinations? And this is if everyone only receives one shot. Remember, there is no miracle vaccine that cures all people for good. Each person needs specific treatment. Some people may need to go to the doctor multiple times. Other people might not be at risk, and any vaccine they receive is wasted money.For all these reasons, I suggest that people should not be forced to be vaccinated.Rebuttals: My opponent\u2019s whole argument is a bare assertion.[9] This means that Pro\u2019s entire argument is logically fallacious. Therefore, the BoP is still on Pro to provide good reasons why people should be forced to get vaccinated.Sources:[1] http://www.cdc.gov...[2] http://www.cdc.gov...[3] http://www.hrsa.gov...[4] http://www.historyofvaccines.org...[5] http://www.westernjournalism.com...[6] http://www.dailymail.co.uk...[7] https://www.google.com...[8] https://www.google.com...[9] http://www.toolkitforthinking.com...",

Moreover the chances of getting ill have increased from the past when there were no vaccinations. Pharmaceutical Companies Can\"t Be Trusted.

Fully Vaccinated Children are the Unhealthiest, Most Chronically Ill Children I Know.A Number of Vaccines Have Already Had Problems/Been Removed from the Market so you can't trust all vaccines maybe you would take the vaccine now but later you come to know that the vaccine is faulty. You Can Always Get Vaccinated, But You Can Never Undo a Vaccination. Vaccination does not guarantee even immediate immunity, and boosters are necessary for all vaccinations. I think there is no care taken of our body,immune system or our health by ourselves ... we don't want to prevent it by natural methods and take vaccinations which gradually weaken your immune system. There are new diseases which have originated recent days because of our practices. So I conclude on saying that children must not be given so many vaccinations that their body becomes weaker.",

            "premise": "Medical exemptions These are allowed when a child has a medical condition or allergy that may make receiving the vaccine dangerous. All 50 states allow medical exemptions. For school entry purposes, these exemptions require a physician's note supporting the medical necessity of the exemption. Religious exemptions These are allowed when immunizations are not in agreement with the parents' religious beliefs. Forty-eight of the 50 states allow these exemptions. Philosophical exemptions These are allowed when non-religious, but strongly held beliefs, prevent a parent from allowing their child to be immunized. Twenty states allow these exemptions. In certain situations an exemption can be challenged by the state. These situations include those that would put the child at a higher risk of disease than is reasonable (medical neglect) or those that would put society at risk (e.g., epidemic situations). Also, in some states, if an unvaccinated child is found to transmit a vaccine-preventable disease to someone else, the parents may be liable in a civil suit. Because vaccines are considered medically necessary (except in the medical cases mentioned above), they are considered to be \"best-care\" practices. Therefore, if parents choose not to immunize their children, doctors will often have them sign a statement that they have discussed the risks and benefits of the vaccines and they understand that they are taking a risk in refusing vaccines for their children. Risking disease Many people incorrectly assume that a choice not to get a vaccine is a risk-free choice. But it isn't. The choice not to get a vaccine is a choice to risk the disease that the vaccine prevents. Studies have shown that unimmunized children are more likely to get vaccine-preventable diseases if there is an outbreak than those who have been immunized. Unimmunized children will be barred from school during an outbreak to protect them from the disease. Here are some things to consider before making a decision not to immunize a child: Vaccines are considered the best way to protect your child against diseases that could cause liver damage, liver cancer, suffocation, meningitis, pneumonia, paralysis, lockjaw, seizures, brain damage, deafness, blindness, mental retardation, learning disabilities, birth defects, encephalitis or death. Vaccines are studied extensively for their safety before being recommended for children and continue to be monitored after recommendation (see How Are Vaccines Made?). Because vaccines are given to healthy children, they are held to the highest standards of safety. Vaccines are considered by some to be a civic duty because they create \"herd immunity.\" This means that when most of the people in a community are immunized, there is less opportunity for a disease to enter the community and make people sick. Because there are members of our society that are too young, too weak, or otherwise unable to receive vaccines for medical reasons, they rely on \"herd immunity\" to keep them well. Harm to others There are four ways that others in the community may be harmed by a parent's decision not to immunize their child: If the unimmunized child gets a preventable disease, he or she may pass that disease to other unimmunized people in the community. Even when people are immunized, there is always a small percentage of them for whom the vaccine did not work or their immunity has waned; so these people will also be at increased risk if an unimmunized child gets a preventable disease. If a person cannot receive vaccines for medical reasons, they rely on those around them for protection from the diseases. Families that have received vaccines and contract a vaccine-preventable disease from an unimmunized person will need to pay the medical costs incurred by the disease. Treatment for the diseases cost much more than the vaccines, so the unimmunized child's family or society will bear these costs. Those who choose not to immunize their child may be considered to be \"free riders\" by those who have immunized their children. For example, a mother whose son recently experienced a severe bout with pertussis was angry that other children in the classroom were not immunized. In discussing vaccine safety as the reason that many parents give for not wanting to immunize, she wondered why their children should be protected by herd immunity when her child and all of the other immunized children bore the small risk of side effects. In addition, she wondered why she wasn't made aware that so many of the children in the school weren't immunized due to personal beliefs. She concluded by saying, \"Had I known . . .I would never have enrolled him in that school.\" BACK TO TOP Requirements versus recommendations Are requirements and recommendations the same thing? No. Recommendations made by the CDC are based on health and safety considerations. Requirements, on the other hand, are laws made by each state government determining which vaccines a child must have before entering school. To use an example, consider smoking. Experts tell us that smoking is bad for our health, but it is still our choice whether we smoke or not; that is like a recommendation. In contrast, no-smoking laws prohibit people from smoking in certain places and vary from state to state; this is similar to a requirement. It is important to remember that even if a vaccine is not required, it may be the best health choice. Talk to your doctor about vaccines that are available and whether they are important for you or a loved one to receive. BACK TO TOP Vaccine recommendations and package inserts I understand that the information included with a vaccine sometimes differs from more commonly available information. Can you explain why? While a package insert provides information about the vaccine, it is important to realize that it is being provided by the company and, therefore, has legal requirements that must be followed in its preparation. During the development of a vaccine, safety studies are completed by comparing a group of people who received the vaccine to a group of people who did not, called the placebo group. If a side effect occurs more times in the vaccine group, it may be a result of the vaccine. However, the company, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), must report any side effects that occurred in the vaccine group, even if the number of occurrences was similar to those in the placebo group. All of these side effects are then listed in the package insert. Groups that make recommendations about vaccines to healthcare professionals, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), don't use the same criteria as the FDA to determine whether a side effect is caused by vaccines. When these groups make recommendations, they review the data in the context of whether a particular side effect occurs significantly more often in the vaccine group than the placebo group. If it does, these side effects are listed in educational materials to physicians. For this reason, the number of side effects listed in the package insert is much greater than that listed by the CDC and AAP. https://www.chop.edu...",

            "premise": "As my opponent hasn't rebuted any of my arguments, I'll respond to both of the arguments my opponent has given so far. I'd like to point out that it appears that my opponent has no original arguments. He copied and pasted them from the following citation. [1] All he did cite a source and he was done. Because of this, he may not even take the time to respond to my arguments, as he clearly can't come up with any original content. Anyway, first I'll go through my opponent's first round. \"According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that 732,000 American children were saved from death and 322 million cases of childhood illnesses were prevented between 1994 and 2014 due to vaccination.\" [1]The amount of lives saved trumps minor adverse effects. Let's look at the rates of the allergic reaction anaphylaxis that my opponent discusses. In the sources words, it describes it as a\"...life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) [that effects] about one per million children.\" This is in every vaccine, mind you. While that happens in one per million children, 2.5 million children are saved by vaccines every year, as well as there being 322 million cases of childhood illness prevented between 1994 and 2014, according to the quotation used above.With those statistics in mind, we can assume that, for every 2.5 million children saved by vaccines, 2.5 children are affected by anaphylaxis. For the 322 million cases of childhood illness prevented in the twenty year period described above, 322 were affected by anaphylaxis. Again, it's rare.\"Anaphylaxis may occur following exposure to allergens from a variety of sources including food, aeroallergens, venom, drugs, and immunisations.\" [2] Oh yes, not just vaccines are guilty of this.\"More than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts.\"Other foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include:\"nuts\u2013 such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts\"milk\"fish and shellfish\"eggs\"some types of fruit\u2013 such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberries\" [3]This is the most common cause of anaphylaxis. Does that mean we shouldn't let anyone eat peanuts because of the effects it may have on some people? In the case of vaccines, it saves more lives than it harms, as shown by the statistics provided earlier.Again, like I said in my arguments, these effects and all the others proposed are incredibly rare, if not non-existent. We shouldn't risk the lives of many when we're trying to potentially save the lives of some.Now on to my opponent's next round about harmful ingredients in vaccines.\"It\u2019s true that these chemicals are toxic to the human body in certain levels, but only trace amounts of these chemicals are used in FDA approved vaccines. In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC,formaldehydeis produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there isno scientific evidencethat the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.\" [4]\"Children are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk and infant formula than they are exposed to in vaccines.Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in one day of normal activity than are in vaccines.\" [1]In fact, all of the components proposed are used in trace amounts, so it does no harm to the vaccinated children.Thank you. I look forward to my opponent's rebuttals, if he has any.Citations[1]http://vaccines.procon.org...[2]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...[3]http://www.nhs.uk...[4]http://www.publichealth.org...",

            "premise": "I will do my best to fix those original links at the end of this argument. 1. It's good for health policy. You haven't defined what you mean by \" good health policy \". I can only presume by you showing evidence HPV is linked to several types of cancer(most cases of which that won't kill you until you are close to 60) , that you are arguing that public policy which increases the average lifespan is good health policy. So why not castrate every male once they reach an age where they are likely to reproduce? You could increase the average male lifespan by 20 years prevent the spread of HPV and put a stop to unwanted pregnancy. this would cause a huge jump in the average life expectancy more so then any vaccination.[1] You haven't made clear what your definition of good health policy is. I can only assume by what you said that you are referring to life expectancy. If you are then I have shown a better alternative strategy to increase life expectancy not only over all but for over 50% of the population. If you more narrowly define good health policy as something that prevents HPV then I have shown you a strategy that would require a procedure that would only have to be performed on 50% of the population and also eliminate HPV. The arguments you have used to say HPV vaccination is moral can also be used to show castration is moral 1. Disease is not individual in any sense of the word, so individual liberties should not be paramount in assessing the worth of this castration program. 2. A castration program ( aka sterilization program ) is nothing new there is precedent for this and it also has a longer track record then any vaccination program. A sterilization program has been used in 33 states[2] and many ancient cultures. I do contest the other points you made that vaccinations are moral. I will not use them here, but they do apply to castration as well. 2-it's morally correct. The health concerns of various vaccinations have been debunked. However, the health concerns of an HPV vaccine have not been debunked. Not only have they not been debunked they aren't even completely known. The long term affects of these vaccines are a complete mystery. Gardasil didn't get approval from the FDA until 2006 [3] cervarix wasn't approved by the FDA until 2009 [4]. What your doing is asking the bulk of the population to throw caution to the wind and take a chance on a newly approved vaccine, when we don't know what the long term health risks associated with them will be. You also argued that a single injection of vaccine isn't facing a major loss of decision making. What we are talking about here is not a single shot but 3 shots within a 6 month period. [5]this is in fact atleast 4 times less autonomy then you first calculated. You say that a vaccination isn't unprecedented either. This is no normal vaccination though. Most if not all of the current vaccinations are to prevent diseases that are spread through casual contact such as chicken pox. HPV isn't spread through casual contact it is spread from sexual contact. You also argued that this wouldn't be a major loss of decision making power either because a refusal to vaccinate could still be done it would just be fined. This is just another way of saying \" if your poor you get vaccinated if you have financial means then you get the choice\". People belonging to a racial minority would be the most likely to not be able to afford the fine associated with these vaccines[6] . Creating a public policy that forces minorities to be vaccinated against std's but letting whites choose if they want to be vaccinated or not, would be racist and therefore unfair.It would also insinuate that minorities and poor people need to be vaccinated to protect the wealthy from disease. I would argue that racist public health policies are immoral. Sources [1] http://www.huffingtonpost.com... [2] http://www.uvm.edu... [3] http://www.fda.gov... [4] http://www.fda.gov...

In addition, childhood is the most important time to get vaccinated to build strong antibodies and be able to fight off disease in their adulthood. Parents shouldn't be able to stand in the way of their children's good health because of radical and incorrect suppositions. Another reason would be herd immunity. Everyone has the right to protect everyone else by being vaccinated. That way, if someone who physically cannot get the vaccine (such as someone with an allergy, an elderly person or a baby) is almost as immune as everyone else because nobody else has the sickness. This only works if everyone around them is vaccinated, so in order to protect this, we need to keep people vaccinated. Vaccinations work well. A couple of diseases that are no longer majorly present in first-world countries because of vaccinations are smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and so on. There is proof that vaccines are the reason: Recently, in California, there was an outbreak of measles because so many people there are not vaccinated and in a crowd. The measles disease rapidly spread and now many people are infected. This is another example of why herd immunity is so important. In conclusion, children indisputably need to get vaccines. They promote health well, and provide herd immunity.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: State mandated administration of childhood vaccinations is justified.",
            "premise": "Not a full case yet.. Just some little points I put together... Governments should not have the right to intervene in the health decisions parents make for their children. 31% of parents believe they should have the right to refuse mandated school entry vaccinations for their children, according to a 2010 survey by the University of Michigan. Many parents hold religious beliefs against vaccination. Forcing such parents to vaccinate their children would violate the 1st Amendment which guarantees citizens the right to the free exercise of their religion. Vaccines are often unnecessary in many cases where the threat of death from disease is small. During the early nineteenth century, mortality for the childhood diseases whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever fell drastically before immunization became available. This decreased mortality has been attributed to improved personal hygiene, water purification, effective sewage disposal, and better food hygiene and nutrition. Vaccines interfere with natural law and God's plan for humanity. Disease is a natural occurrence, and humans should not interfere with its trajectory. Common childhood vaccinations may cause rare yet serious reactions including anaphylactic shock, paralysis, and sudden death. This risk is not worth taking, especially considering most diseases vaccinated against are not necessarily life threatening. Vaccines can trigger auto-immune disorders such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Guillain-Barr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Syndrome (GBS), and other disorders. Vaccines can cause brain inflammation (encephalopathy) which can lead to death or permanent brain damage and disorders such as autism, ADD/ADHD, and other developmental problems. In addition, the vaccine additive thimerosal (found in most pre-1999 vaccines) has been associated specifically with the development of autism and is still found in certain meningococcal, tetanus, and flu vaccines such as the H1N1 vaccine. Vaccines clog and disrupt the lymphatic system with large foreign protein molecules (the active ingredients contained within vaccines) which may lead to lymphatic cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. All vaccines cause immune system suppression, and can permanently damage the natural immune system. Unvaccinated children build and strengthen their immune systems through fighting off infection and developing natural immunity to diseases like measles and chickenpox. Artificial immunity, generated through vaccination, weakens the immune system and leaves children more vulnerable to all other diseases and infections. Children should not be required to receive the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine. Some studies have shown that children who receive the DPT vaccine exhibit shallow breathing which has been associated with sleep apnea and may be a causal factor in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Studies of infants whose deaths were recorded as SIDS show a temporal relationship with DPT vaccination (these infants tended to die at similar time intervals in relation to when they were vaccinated). Children should not receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B is a blood-born disease and is primarily spread by sexual intercourse and intravenous drug use. Children are not at great risk of contracting the disease. In addition, researchers have found that immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. Young girls should not receive mandatory vaccination for HPV (human papilloma virus). The vaccine was approved in 2006 and the long-term effects are unknown. Since approval, adverse side effects such as severe allergic reactions, Guillain-Barr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd syndrome, spinal cord inflammation and pancreatitis have been reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. Although these adverse reactions may be rare, they are not worth the risk since the vaccine only protects against two of the 15 strains of HPV that may cause cancer of the cervix (20-40 years after an individual is infected). Vaccines are promoted primarily to generate profits for manufacturers and financial donations for medical organizations that endorse vaccines. In 2003, a House Committee on Government Reform report revealed that the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had members with significant financial ties to vaccine companies. The American Academy of Pediatrics, a leading pro-vaccination organization, receives millions of dollars from vaccine companies.",

I would just like to note, for absolutely no relevant reason, that he is my classmate and that I was very excited to take this, due to the previous fact. I am on the Proposition, arguing that, \"Vaccination for children under 13 should be mandatory.\" Many thanks for allowing me to go first. I will begin with a refutation of the first, small quote my opponent has stated, which, to my disappointment, does not have a source. Refutation \"This quote is from a man whose daughter suffered devastating side-effects from the mandatory Hepatitis B vaccination on his 5-week-old little girl.\" This Hepatitis B vaccine is still good, no matter how many deaths (very small amount) occur. Would you rather like to possess this horrible disease. If so, the very small bacteria of this disease will cause liver inflammation, vomiting, jaundice, and, sometimes, death. Chronic Hepatitis B will result in liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, which means the chances of death are greatly increased [1]. A third of the world's population, more than two billion people, is infected with this disease. The most infection occurs within areas in Asia, mostly China, and Africa. There are also 350 million carriers of chronic Hepatitis B [2]. Chinese vaccinations are not mandatory. They are voluntary or optional. If more of the Chinese were treated with a Hepatitis B vaccine, then most would not have this disease. Africa is a very poor country. Many families can't afford vaccinations for their children and thus, get sick. Arguments 1. Vaccinations help children. Vaccinations help children. There can't be any doubt about it. Without vaccinations in America, many children would be sick and subject to violent diseases. Diseases will simply make children suffer more compared to a small dose of that disease. Diphtheria is an small respiratory sickness where a membrane forms that covers the throat and then makes it very hard to breathe. Whooping cough is named after the whooping sound that is made by its victims during one of their coughing periods. Mumps is another disease that can cause swollen glands on the face, but can be prevented with a vaccine. Tetanus is a horrible disease due to the fact that if obtained, you can die. You have a 50% chance of survival if you contract this sickness. There is also Rubella, Polio, Chickenpox, Measles, and Meningitis. All of these diseases are life-threatening and can only be stopped with a vaccination. There will be dangers when parents don't get their child vaccinated. In Boulder, Colorado, half of the 292 students attending Shining Mountain Waldorf School did not receive all vaccinations, with some not receiving any. The result of this has been a case of spreading whooping cough. In Colorado, all a parent needs to do have a child exempt from vaccinations is to sign a sheet of paper. 2. Vaccinations should be mandatory because diseases can spread. Children can get diseases that they could have prevented with a vaccination, and spread it to others who think they are safe without a vaccine. Children touch many things, such as park structures, and then others will get sick. There are some diseases that seem very small at first, but then develop to be potentially dangerous. The only ones that can be free of this disease are the vaccinated children. Just look at countries in Africa. They have numerous children with diseases, not because bacteria separately went and touched them all, but because they spread it among each other by playing, working, and using the same supplies. An African child dies every minute due to Measles [3]. This could be stopped with vaccinations. I eagerly await for the response.

Just to sum up the main arguments: 1. Without a mandate, herd immunity will be threatened. A mandate is the only way to make sure that enough people will get vaccinated, and will ultimately remain healthy. Furthermore, it is not right to put someone else in danger if it can be helped. By depriving their children of vaccines, parents are not only putting their own children in danger, but also putting the children of others in danger. Referring back to my Contention 2, subpoint B, when people fail to vaccinate their children, kids with weak immune systems etc. can and will be hurt. 2. Parents don't always make the best choices for their children. Diseases that cannot be be protected through herd immunity, such as tetanus, creates a greater need for everybody to get vaccinated. A child should not be forced to endure diseases such as tetanus because of a bad decision of their parents. 3. Vaccines are expensive. If vaccines were mandated, those with less money would be able to get the vaccines. 4. All of my opponent's \"religious beliefs\" claims have been proven to be incorrect. First and foremost, biblical word isn't taken literally. All of the religions my opponent brought up allow vaccinations. 5. The constitution does not provide absolute rights. Furthermore, because my opponent cannot proven that any religions explicitly prohibit vaccines, this point falls in my favor. 6. Vaccines are safe. If a parent is concerned about certain ingredients, they can get an alternative brand of vaccines. 7. Vaccination is preferable to natural immune systems. (Refer to my Japanese example) 8. It is preferable to give children vaccines: So they're safe throughout their life. It's more effective when given to children. Because of these reasons, I can only urge a Pro vote.",

However, scientifically seen this arguments is flawed in many aspects. \u00a0 First of all many of the examples used in arguments suggesting vaccination is dangerous and therefore should not be used, is very old. Many refer to examples from the 60s or 70s, which in medicine is highly flawed as science every few years significantly advances, improves the level of knowledge and reduces possible side effects. And even though many believe in the damages caused by vaccines retrospective studies disprove this point:\u00a0 1. Autism Scientists at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health's Center for Infection and Immunity and researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Trinity College Dublin, evaluated bowel tissues from 25 children with autism and GI disturbances and 13 children with GI disturbances alone (controls) by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA. Samples were analyzed in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis, including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between measles virus and autism had been reported.\u00a0[1] \"Our results are inconsistent with a causal role for MMR vaccine as a trigger or exacerbate of either GI difficulties or autism,\" states Mady Hornig, associate professor of Epidemiology and director of translational research in the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Mailman School, and co-corresponding author of the study. \"The work reported here eliminates the remaining support for the hypothesis that autism with GI complaints is related to MMR vaccine exposure. We found no relationship between the timing of MMR vaccine and the onset of either GI complaints or autism.[2] Many parents came to believe that\u00a0vaccines\u00a0caused their children's\u00a0autism\u00a0because the symptoms of autism appeared after the child received a vaccination. On a psychological level, that assumption and connection makes sense; but on a logical level, it is a clear and common fallacy with a fancy Latin name:\u00a0post hoc ergo propter hoc\u00a0(\"after this, therefore because of it\"). They just need someone to blame for the disease of their child.[3] 2. Allergies and vaccines A recent (2011) study of a German Health Institute concludes that in comparing the occurrence of infections and allergies in vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. These include bronchitis, eczema, colds, and gastrointestinal infection. The only difference they found is that unvaccinated children and adolescents differ from their vaccinated peers merely in terms of the frequency of vaccine preventable diseases. These include pertussis, mumps, or measles. As expected, the risk of contracting these diseases is substantially lower in vaccinated children and adolescents.[4] [1]\u00a0 Science Daily, No connection between Measels, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine and Autism, Study suggests 09/05/2008http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080904145218.htm [2]\u00a0Ibid.

            "premise": "I do not quite think my opponent understands my debate topic: vaccines do not cause autism. If this is my debate topic then the opposing simply has to prove that vaccines do cause autism. I did not ask whether high fevers in pregnant women cause autism but rather vaccines. definitions: cause: The one, such as a person, event, or condition, that is responsible for an action or result. According to this exact definition by thefreedictionary, the opponent is required to prove that VACCINES are responsible for a result(autism) For the purpose of the argument below, assume that the opponent's argument is valid according to my debate topic: Common side effects of vaccines include: injection site reactions (pain, swelling and redness) mild fever. shivering. fatigue. headache. muscle and joint pain. Therefore, we can conclude that a more severe and rare side effect is a high fever. A pregnant woman would be required or strongly recommended to get these vaccines to protect her unborn child: Rubella, Hepatitis B, flu, and whooping cough. According to the opponent's source, high fevers were not listed as any of the side effects for any of these vaccines, but rather simply a fever. Because the fever was listed as a mild side effect, one can assume that it is a mild fever. The opponent's source does not claim that any fever in a pregnant woman is linked to autism, but rather a high fever. Source [1] states: Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at fewer than 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Assume that a high fever is a severe allergic reaction. High fevers are said to be 103 F-104 F. If a pregnant woman goes against the odds and get's a high fever resulting from the vaccine and the baby gets autism, given the slim chance, the fever resulting from the vaccine CAUSED the autism, not the VACCINE itself. Since the source did not state that all cases of a high fever in a pregnant woman were due to the vaccine itself, it is safe assume that some of these cases are linked to influenza. According to the opponent's argument that the high fever resulting from the vaccine causes autism, would it also be safe to assume that high fever from the influenza virus is linked to autism as well? How about the fever as a result of a bacterial infection such as strep throat? Would that be linked to autism too? Conclusion: An accidental relationship is a correlation that exists without any causal relationship between variables. In this case, autism and vaccines are the two variables and there is an accidental relationship between these two. Does autism not occur in children at a very young age? About the same age that they receive vaccines? If so, it's entirely possible that these two variables have no real relationship and are simply coincidental that autism resulted after a vaccine. Below are credible, scientific studies that show that there is absolutely no relationship between vaccines and autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... http://pediatrics.aappublications.org... http://cid.oxfordjournals.org... 1.http://www.cdc.gov... 2.http://www.cdc.gov...",

            "premise": "Well, this is a very complicated subject, and we needed more than just a view rounds to cover every single detail. But I'll try not to make it too long, so it won't became long and ponderous. So you could understand my point of view, the better way it's to state my background, to make it a live example, not just some doubtful story. My parents always wore the kind of person that doesn't follow the herd. Just because millions do something, doesn't mean it's good. And when it came to vaccines, they took the same principles. I'm a 18 year old boy, perfectly fine, I've taken only 3 or 4 vaccines in my entire life, and I never had any serious problem whatsoever. We are humans. We make errors. That's our nature. And when we talk about parents, it's not a exception. They had parents like us, and they were taught by their beliefs before me. In this world there's not right or wrong, there is just point of view. You say it's right to vaccinate, I say it's not, who it's really right? As Osho said \"What do I mean by responsibility? You are not responsible to your parents, and you are not responsible to any God, and you are not responsible to any priest \" you are responsible to your inner being. Responsibility is freedom!\" So, you say that responsibility and obligations it's doing what everyone thinks it's correct, but maybe responsibility it's just freedom, doing what we believe, and not what everyone tells you to do. http://www.osho.com... I don't know if you read this book called \"FREAKONOMICS\", but basically the main idea that I took from it, it's that we can't make \"assumptions\" based on every study and report they give us. Who could you say for sure, that vaccines always had been the decisive point of decrease in eradicating diseases, when we live in a unpredicted world, were millions of variables take place, and basing studies on a case were those variables can take place and we don't even notice? \"Art of Thinking Clearly\" it's another interesting book. It says that the human mind suffers from Confirmation Bias. We tend to ignore other factors and only pay attention to those who proves our point. If you think about it, you may agree with me. But with this, I'm not saying that those \"studies\" you stated are wrong and I'm right, I'm just saying that maybe it's not fully correct, and you should take other perspective. With this sayed, I'm gonna focus on the vaccines itself. http://freakonomics.com... http://www.goodreads.com... We live in a world were power and money it's the most important thing for almost everyone, and those with then, will not abdicate and will do everything to oppress the weak and to maintain the hierarchy pyramid. If you look around, it's visible everywhere, and people more and more starts to see this. To clarify something, I just wanna say that this may not be the reality, it's just the way I see things. What makes people think that they, the ones in the top of the pyramid, that the politics, medics, economics, and the others who rules the world wants us to be happy, healthy our rich? If they wanted that, would most people live in poverty? Would most people live their lifes struggling for just a \"piece\" of the cake, when they make a banquet? Don't think so, and don't think that when it comes to vaccines, there are only good purposes. Well, after many research on the web to argue my point of view, I found the perfect resume of information, but if you want to search for yourself, you will find many more stuff. From the 40 reasons why you should never vaccinate infants (http://www.swaraj.org...), there are some that I would like to reinforce, like the huge side effects that most of people are unaware of, and the confirmation that big companies may test their vaccines on the population directly, makind the world a live testing lab, the lack of scientific study to determine whether vaccines have really prevented diseases, and many more.. I could be here talking and talking for no purpose, because you will only believe if you see for your self, so I give here some other sources if you want to see. There is many more, and the evidences are all over the place. https://archive.org... http://www.theosociety.org... http://topdocumentaryfilms.com...",

            "premise": "Hi a little introduction if you don't mind, My name's Will, A Sixteen year old boy, living in the Austin Metropolis and I'd like to thank JakeLamotta for making this debate. At a young age I was diagnosed with ADHD and later on Asperger\u2019s Syndrome to which none of the people in my family other than my mother believe. I am severely allergic to most of the tree-pollens. I grew up in a predominately Christian household later to become an agnostic gamer. Now, onto what we came here for. Definitions: Autism: A mental condition, present from early childhood, characterized by difficulty in communicating and forming relationships with other people and in using language and abstract concepts. Source: Google \u201cDefinition of autism; http://www.google.com... Vaccine:any preparation used as a preventive inoculation to confer immunityagainst a specific disease, usually employing an innocuous form of thedisease agent, as killed or weakened bacteria or viruses, to stimulateantibod--y production. Source: http://dictionary.reference.com... Brain Damage: injury or harm, congenital or acquired, to the tissues of the brainresulting from inadequate oxygen supply, trauma, or other cause. Source: http://dictionary.reference.com... It makes very little sense to link the causes of Severe or Minor cases of brain damage to Medical Vaccines nor does it make sense to link the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with vaccinations meant to combat disease. C1: There is no link between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Medical Vaccinations According to the CDC vaccine safety concerns page: \u201cThere is no connection between Autism and Medical Vaccinations.\u201d1 To further this argument the same page says \u201cVaccine ingredients do not cause autism\u201d1 Why would the CDC a government agency lie to its own people about the possible chance of a child contracting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Minor to Severe Brain Damage? The answer is in the simplicity itself; they don\u2019t. The CDC exists to protect the people and in order to do that they need to share their relative knowledge on the subject at hand. Contrary to popular belief the CDC isn\u2019t part of some ridiculous agenda, I digress. With utmost certainty I can also clarify why there is little if not absolutely no connection between ASD and Medical Vaccinations. Sources: 1: http://www.cdc.gov... C2: Vaccine Studies prove the \u201cVaccines-Cause-Autism arguments to be false\u201d and Autism as it Develops In an article done by the Huffington Post expressing the findings of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) after multiple tests the CDC and WHO have both confirmed \u201cThere is no link to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Medical Vaccinations\u201d The following is taken from the Article: \u201cWhen examined in the light of Hill's other six criteria, the vaccines-cause-autism arguments still do not hold up Consistency: Autism also occurs in unvaccinated children. Specificity: Autism does not occur in every (MMR) vaccinated child. Temporality: The development of autism is not related to the time of vaccination. Biological gradient: The incidence of autism among vaccinated children does not increase with the number of vaccines received. Coherence: Follow up studies show no significant elevation in blood mercury levels following vaccination. Experiment: Most vaccinated children do not develop autism.\u201d1 To further my argument I will go on to say that Autism is a Neurodevelopmental disorder, that is to say, Autism is a disorder that mentally affects one\u2019s developmental process deterring a \u201cNormal Life\u201d if you will. The definition of Vaccine as stated above is known to be a medical process before a sickness to neutralize the viral agent that causes said sickness. As we are all aware of a Vaccine is comprised of many numerous ingredients in order to: 1: Preserve a Vaccine 2: Combat a known Viral Agent I will delve further in the later rounds and express the effects of Vaccinations and how there is no relevant or significant data to prove that Autism and minor and/or severe cases of Brain Damage do not occur because of Vaccines. Sources: 1: http://www.huffingtonpost.com... SN: This Post is short since I didn\u2019t have time to fully complete it and I hope the people reading this take that into consideration. I will respond to my opponents argument if there is one to respond to with a 8000 character response, and I look forward to continuing my debate with Pro and hope that this will be an entertaining and enticing debate.

            "conclusion": "Vaccines Cause Autism",
            "premise": "Thanks for debating with me! 1. It's important to remember that vaccine manufacturers fund the research on vaccines. Therefor vaccine researchers are less likely to be honest about their findings. There is a conflict of interest. Vaccine manufactures also spend 100million dollars a year on advertisements. That's more than any other industry including the oil industry. 2. It's also important to note that there is little science on the molecular cellular level about vaccines. 3. The vaccines we have did not go through a 4 year clinical trial but a 16 month trial. This was very irresponsible and dangerous. 3. Mercury and aluminum both cause brain damage. Eating aluminum is less likely to cause brain damage because it is excreted quickly. But aluminum is vaccines is made to stick around. Aluminum in vaccines causes brain damage. Vaccines also contain mercury. 4. Chris shaw a pediatrician did an experiment with mice, giving them aluminum and mercury. The test found that after receiving the mercury the mice became more irritable and suffered cognitive and physical damage. No one had debunked dr Shaws study. If he is wrong than the pro vaccine doctors should be able to debunk it but they.a won't because can't. 5. Vaccines affect everyone differently. However the vaccine industry acts as of it is a one size fits all matter, as if all people will react to vaccines the same way. Children who get autism from vaccines are more allergic than children who don't get autism from it. 4. It is common knowledge that mercury and aluminum cause brain damage and yes autism. Both mercury and aluminum are found inside of vaccines. It was in July of 1999 that the American association of pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers made a statement saying that Mercury should be lessened of eliminated from vaccines. The amount of mercury put in vaccines was reduced but not eliminated. 5. In the film \"a greater good\" a little boy named Jordan king is featured. Jordan was a happy healthy baby. Than he was vaccinated. His family noticed that he became more irritable, began to walk on his toes and that he would jump up and down and flap his hands when excited but in a strange way. He also became unable to speak. John Green Jordan's doctor tested him for mercury and found that Jordan had very high levels of mercury. His parents tested the pant in their house, the saw dust in the basement but found no mercury. It is undeniable that the mercury had come from the vaccines he was given. Jordan along with 5,600 other people in the omnibius autism proceedings that examined the link between vaccine snake autism in 2001 6.!Many vaccine Injuries have resulted in law suits. One such case includes graham vs Wyeth lab and resulted in 15 million dollars being payed to the Grahams to make up for a severe vaccine injury. Than there's Johnson vs american cynamind ended up resulting in the Johnson's winning 18 million dollars. 7. There are so many vaccine injuries that a program called the vaccine compensation program fund was set up. Every time you receive a vaccine you pay a 75 cent tax that will go to a family who has been affected by a vaccine injury. 8 Victoria christener was also featured in the greater good. She died at 6 moths old due to vaccines. Immediately after the vaccinations she would get fevers ect. Than one day she stopped breathing and passed away. 9. In Wichita Kansas a girl named gabby swank was injured from 3 gardisil shots. She now has had two stokes and has partial vision, partial paralysis in the right side of her face and has many seizures. 10. In 2014 William WxThomas a former lead researcher in vaccine studies done by the cdc blew the whistle and admitted that he was complicate in the cdcs cover up of their own findings that autism and vaccine were linked. He spoke to Brian Hooker sa man whose child was injured from vaccines, and admitted that the cdcs vaccine study published in 2004 had been falsified and that evidence showing a link between autism and vaccines was taken out. Colleen Boyle who helped falsify the study testified under oath that vaccines didn't cause autism. With the help of congressman Bill Paisley they obtained the data showing that there is a 340% risk of getting autism for boys who had the mmr shot on time compared to those who had it later. The full study was out one the translational nuerodegeneration site and is called \"mmr vaccine timing and autism in young African American boys reanalysis of cdc study\". It also found that young black it's were twice as likely to get autism from vaccines than young white boys. A youtube video called \"CDC whistle blower revealed\" on the autism media channel has the interview with Mr. Thomas. It can be found in the site \"cdc responds: admits omitting vaccine rates of autism\". Thanks!",

            "conclusion": "THW: make vaccinations against deadly diseases mandatory unless there is a medical exemption",
            "premise": "I'm glad to hear that my opponent agrees that vaccines are safe and effective. My opponent's points seem to be as follows: 1) Making vaccines mandatory will not convince antivaxers of the safety of vaccines. 2) It is cruel to force someone to take something they get, even if it is good for them. 3) It could not be enforced. In response: 1) The point of this motion was never to convince antivaxers of the safety of vaccines (although of course such a goal is desirable). The point is to protect the health of those who cannot be vaccinated and of children whose parents are negligent by failing to vaccinate them. 2) Though it is preferable not to have to force someone through a moment of discomfort for their own health, their children's health, or the health of those around them, it is a so-called \"necessary evil\"; the alternative is to risk the health of that individual or of others. People have died- and will continue to die- as a result of antivaxers' reckless negligence and it should be made illegal to fail to vaccinate oneself and one's children as a result. Sometimes it is necessary to violate the consent of someone for the health of that person or those around them- we recognise, for instance, that it is necessary to force-feed someone with severe anorexia in order to protect them from starving themselves to death, or to place someone with an infection disease in quarantine in order to prevent them from infecting others. It is in a similar way that we must force people to vaccinate themselves and their children, even if they (falsely) believe that vaccines are harmful- there just simply isn't time to convince them- people are dying- and we will never be able to convince them all. 3) Though I recognise it would be impossible to identify- and therefore charge- the individual responsible for an outbreak, it would be considerably more practical to check everyone's medical records and to ensure everyone has had their vaccine, and to apply some kind of statutory penalty like a fine until they have had them. My opponent mentioned that this would be \"unconstitutional\", but: 1. This is a debate on an international forum, so the US constitution needn't apply; I'm speaking from the UK. 2. So, of we must obey the US constitution, then part of this motion would be to amend the US constitution such that a vaccine mandate is allowed. 3. People are still dying. We should therefore apply the \"Quod Est Necassarium Est Licitum\" principle (that which is necessary is legal*). So, to summarise my case: Making vaccines mandatory is necessary in order to save lives; vaccines are safe and effective, and do save lives both of those who are vaccinated and if those who cannot be vaccinated through herd immunity. Saving lives with a mandate in vaccines makes such a mandate necessary, and overrides the (false and irrational) fears of antivaxers, and any constitutional concerns. *https://en.m.wikipedia.org...",

And I don't think you made any substantial connection at all. \"the Autism rates are up about 10000% in just two generations- the rates are about 1000 times higher in vaccinated vs unvaccinates\" Yes, but they fell ever since the mercury compound was removed. http://www.medicalnewstoday.com... So this doesn't help your point that we should stop vaccinating our children. The vaccines may have been dangerous before, but they're fine now. \"SIDS is UNKNOWN in unvaccinated infants, and is ALWAYS within 2 weeks of vaccinations being administered\" SIDS is unknown everywhere. A British study showed that vaccinations may have helped to PREVENT SIDS though. And the chance of your kid dying from SIDS is lower than the chance of your kid dying from diseases that vaccines defend against. \"there are 1000s of cases of children coming down with illness or being permanently retarded from massive vaccinations at a young age\" Actually, there is no direct correlation. And even if it were so, my argument still stands. Vaccines are safe today. \"my child was personally affected - she got ITP\" I'm sorry, but I don't see the correlation and how you can assume that. \"If youre such a medical expert (you are a LIAR just by your tag line and age) why dont you explain to me what ITP is and the causes and cures\" In order for me to be a liar, I would first have to tell a lie, wouldn't I? I never said I was a medical expert Solarman. I'm just a pharmacy student with a pretty good grasp of Biochemistry. But I think this is what you meant http://en.wikipedia.org... Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. No connection with vaccines at all. \"If you cant , it proves youre just a government hack liar\" No, if I can't, it just means I can't read your mind. \"More government settlements to come More coverups to come More govenment lies to come DONT VACCINATE YOUR INFANTS ! you have been warned SOLARMAN\" You're not a superhero. And I know who you are, you don't have to sign your name to look cool. Not that this matters, but the government doesn't make any money off vaccines. They lose money off vaccines. Why would they want to defend it? The compensation money doesn't come from deep pockets, they come from our taxes. They won't care about covering this up. There are plenty of other things the government covers up, with good purpose. Vaccine related illnesses aren't one of them. Besides, you still have yet to show that vaccines are still dangerous today. The data shows that the mercuric compound was removed, and the autism rates are dropping. I await your final response.",

For whatever reasons an individual has, be it religious or Moral, they have the right to NOT have there children vaccinated. \"Vaccinations have proved to be more good than harm children and if you decide to to not vaccinate you should not be able to enter your child into a school that requires vacvcinations as a standard.\" No Schools require children to be vaccinated, as of saying this.

Almost every sexually active person will acquire HPV at some point in their lives. Vaccine - I think this is relatively obvious, but to be specific, the two main vaccines are from Gardasil and Cervarix, and are meant to prevent this disease from infecting new patients. These vaccines would be made available at no cost to individuals. Mandatory: required or commanded by authority; obligatory. In other words, should someone be unwilling to comply, they would have to pay a fee. The proceeds of those fees will be used to supplement costs of purchasing vaccines. I am taking the position that requiring everyone in the U.S. to get vaccinations against HPV before the age of 18 is not only good health policy, but is morally correct. I do not mean to provide arguments in this first post, and whoever agrees to accept this must use their first post just to agree, and perhaps (as I have) give a sentence laying out their general position.

Aside from that, I would appreciate debating someone who has more than a cursory knowledge of vaccines and health policy.

Well, you see, it's proved that vaccines have side effects, and I don't say this just because I saw one time in a questionable website, I say this because it's all over the web. http://www.activistpost.com... http://healthimpactnews.com... http://www.scientificamerican.com... http://articles.mercola.com... http://vactruth.com... Well, it may not cause autism, or any disease in particular, but the amount of information about it's side-effects must be put on the balance. I don't believe that every vaccine has side-effects, and that aren't good things attached, but I don't believe either that there is only good in this. Pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable business in the world. Millions of pills are made every year, and people are more and more sick. My father is a natural doctor, and I see that every day. How is this possible? Profit! So it's logical that vaccines can be a mean to make their hospitals running. Going back a little, you mentioned that it's better to vaccine even if in a lifetime we never would need them. You say that the the risks overweights any benefits. So imagine that you could say for sure that one of the vaccines have a bad side-effect. You are lowering the chance of having the possibility to contract some kind of disease to 0, because you have already contracted from vaccines. So you say that this is better? Doom yourself from the very start, just because \"the risk\" of catching something? \"I don\"t say cultivate morality; I say become more conscious, and you will be moral. But that morality will have a totally different flavor to it. It will be spontaneous; it will not be ready-made.\" OSHO http://www.osho.com... I guess you have misconceived my words. You talk of moral like some kind of code you have to follow, like the 10 commandments, but that isn't morality. That isn't freedom, and you are mistaking liberty with libertinism. Moral is good, the kind of moral that makes us human beings, not the kind that make us cattle. In order to be free and be moral, we have to question ourselves. I don't believe you ever thought about vaccines having side-effects for example, and because you didn't know, and didn't questioned yourself before making a decision, that makes you moral correct? Moral: concerned with the principles of right and wrong behaviour. Just following what they tell us doesn't make us moral people, because if we lived in a different society were killing wasn't bad, If I kill someone, does that would made me moral? Well, you make a distinction between the article I cited and reality, and you say that my sources may be dubious, and while this, you only cited things from one source mostly, while I putted here various sources from different entities, what in my opinion makes a more reliable source, that just stating things from one website. And you still affirm \" is merely grasping at straws to make his case, cannot outweigh legions of other scientist and their more credible findings.\". I admit that the website may not be the more trusted, but with the new sources I linked here. You also say that I cannot refer sources and tell people to read it. I just told you that so you understand better why I say and affirm my point, because I still have more than all the words to use.. Thank you",

            "conclusion": "Public Health Concerns Justify Compulsory Immunization",
            "premise": "Thank you for starting this debate. I'm going to start off by saying that this is the first time running this case, so if I can improve my case, please tell me. Good luck to my opponent! I affirm the resolution \"Resolved: Public health concerns justify compulsory immunization.\" .:|Definitions|:. public health- the art and science dealing with the protection and improvement of community health by organized community effort and including preventive medicine and sanitary and social science; concern- an uneasy state of blended interest, uncertainty, and apprehension; justify- to prove or show to be just, right, or reasonable; compulsory- obligatory; required; immunization- the process by which an individual's immune system becomes fortified against an agent (For the purposes of this debate, the terms immunization and vaccination are synonymous). .:|Value|:. LIFE, \"the general or universal condition of human existence.\" .:|Value criterion|:. UTILITARIANISM, \"the greatest good for the greatest number of people\". .:|Link|:. Utilitarianism leads to life because maintaining the greatest good for the greatest number of people in terms of public health means to keep them alive. One of the best ways to keep people alive is by acquiring immunizations, which should become compulsory when public health concerns arise. When people become vaccinated they will stay alive, and under compulsory vaccinations this will achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. I offer two main contentions in this debate. .:|First Contention|:. My first contention is that vaccinations help save lives. Subpoint A: History tells us that mass vaccinations have led to a decrease in the cases of the disease it was intended to prevent. An example is the Haemophilius Influenzae Type B (HiB). With widespread use of HiB conjugate vaccines beginning in 1990, the incidence of reported HiB invasive disease among children aged <5 years declined from an estimated 100 per 100,000 in the pre-vaccine era to a record low of 0.3 in 1996 [1]. This is more than a 300% decrease in the number of cases. Without vaccinations, these children would have died preventable deaths. Compulsory vaccinations, however, would require that in a case of disease such as HiB, all children would be required to be immunized, and thus would live their lives without the threat of that disease. Subpoint B: Lack of complete vaccine coverage increases the risk of disease for the entire population, including those who have been vaccinated, which leads to a loss of life and utilitarianism. One study found that doubling the number of unvaccinated individuals would increase the risk of measles in vaccinated children anywhere from 5\u201330%.[2] A second study provided evidence that the risk of measles and pertussis increased in vaccinated children proportionally to the number of unvaccinated individuals among them, again highlighting the evident efficacy of widespread vaccine coverage for public health.[3]. This means that a lack of vaccination results in a loss of life because those who did not get vaccinated are capable of being hosts of the disease and can transmit it to other beings. This is the opposite of my value; thus, in order to prevent a loss of life, compulsory vaccinations are necessary in times of public health concerns. Subpoint C: In several countries, reductions in the use of some vaccines were followed by increases in the diseases' morbidity and mortality. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, continued high levels of vaccine coverage are necessary to prevent resurgence of diseases which have been nearly eliminated. In Stockholm, Sweden, smallpox was present between 1873 and 1874. An anti-vaccination campaign motivated by religious objections, by concerns about effectiveness, and by concerns about individual rights, led to the vaccination rate in Stockholm dropping to just over 40%, compared to about 90% elsewhere in Sweden. A major smallpox epidemic then started in 1873. It led to a rise in vaccine uptake and an end of the epidemic. [4] This shows that vaccines have an inverse relation with deaths: as the number of vaccines go up, the number of deaths goes down, promoting my value and value criterion. .:|Second Contention|:. My second contention it is cheaper to get vaccinated than to get the treatment for a disease, while still promoting life, and eventually promoting utilitarianism by saving money and using it towards different items, benefiting the economy. Subpoint A: The cost of a vaccine is far less than that of the treatment for a disease that could have been prevented by the vaccine. For example, the polio vaccine costs $28.50 [5]. However, treatment for polio costs $500 per day, for fourteen days, totaling to a whopping $7000 [6]. Failure to get the vaccine for polio results in a waste of money in the treatment for polio. Why decline a vaccination when, in the possibility of one's contraction of a disease, you waste money in paying for the treatment, when in the end, once you take either option, you are remedied from the disease. Subpoint B: Commonly-used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health, compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease. In the U.S. during the year 2001, routine childhood immunizations against seven diseases were estimated to save over $40 billion per birth-year cohort in overall social costs including $10 billion in direct health costs, and the societal benefit-cost ratio for these vaccinations was estimated to be 16.5 [7]. I now stand ready for cross-examination. .:|Sources|:.

Many believe that because of this they will have a weakened immune system and also suffer from long term body harm.\u00a0 The evidence suggests this is not the case, and that combined vaccinations cause no adverse harm in the vast majority of cases. A University of Louisiana study, in which more than 1,000 children underwent in-depth neuropsychological tests after receiving a series of vaccinations, found that \u2018there was no evidence of neurodevelopmental delays or deficits associated with on-time vaccination\u2019.[1] Further, multiple vaccinations, which ensure not only that children get their vaccinations but that they do so as quickly as possible, are associated with \u2018improved performance\u2019 compared with a control group that received the vaccinations individually and therefore more slowly[2]. Therefore, not only are multiple vaccines harmless, they are a better choice for parents hoping to ensure their children are inoculated from certain diseases. This is nothing but scare-mongering by the press. No evidence exists that there is a link between MMR or any multiple vaccine and the development of autism. Pseudo-experts are exploiting the pain of families that have children which have this unfortunate disease. They should be ashamed of themselves.

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting and good luck. I will post my sources at the end. I would like to start off by talking about different types of vaccination, their ingredients, and how they are administered/ work. There are a few different types of vaccines. There are attenuated (live virus), inactive, subunit, toxoid, and conjugate vaccines. Each serves a different purpose and is extremely beneficial. The attenuated vaccine contains microbes of a certain disease or bacteria that has been weakened in a lab so the disease is strong enough so the body can fight back, but not so strong any damage is done. These vaccines are the closest to natural infection so they are able to essentially teach the body how to overcome it. Though these vaccines are extremely effective, there is the slight chance (as with anything) that the microbe will mutate and cause disease. These anomalies generally occur in people with extremely weak immune systems. In a healthy person, the body learns how to fight the disease but doesn't get sick. Inactive vaccines are created by using heat and chemicals to destroy the microbes. These vaccines are not as strong as live vaccines but they work better for those with weaker immune systems. Because they elicit a weaker immune response, these shots are administered over a period of time with several boosters. They don't require refrigeration so they can be shipped anywhere, essentially. Subunit vaccines only contain certain antigens of a microbe, the ones that will cause the strongest immune reaction. As it does not contain the whole microbe, there is a severely decreased chance of a complication. Recombinant subunit vaccines were created and tested to treat hepatitis B. Scientists testing this vaccine inserted specific antigens into bakers bread and the yeast reproduced the antigens allowing them to collect more. Doctors and scientists are currently testing similar techniques to treat hepatitis C. Toxoid vaccines are used when a toxic bacteria is concerned. When the body is introduced to the toxoid created in a lab (harmless to the body) it learns to fight it off, creating an immune response. The body produces antigens that lock onto and block the toxoid. These vaccines have been used to treat diphtheria and tetanus. Conjugate vaccines are used to fight against bacterium with a polysaccharide coating. Many harmful bacteria have this coating, and the immune system, especially those of infants and young children, do not recognize it immediately, allowing the body to become sick. These vaccines are administered in small doses so the immature immune system becomes familiar with these bacteria and learns to fight it. When being made, scientists use antigens and microbes of the bacteria that the body will recognize and be able to fight. Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) is a conjugate vaccine. Many people have recently been refusing to get their children, or themselves, vaccinated. Their theories about vaccines are wrong. For example, many people believe that if other people are getting vaccinated, then they don't need to be. Skipping vaccinations can put children or babies at risk for possibly fatal diseases. In order for vaccines to work, there needs to be a certain number of people vaccinated. Scientists estimate that, \"Unfortunately, the level of immunization required to prevent diseases such as measles from spreading from child to child is high as 95 percent.\" (Thomas Saari, M.d., Wisconsin Medical School) With many people refusing to vaccinate themselves and their children, there is not enough people vaccinated to provide \"herd immunity.\" Approximately 80% of elementary school children are vaccinated. Though many people believe that because major likenesses are rarely seen in America anymore we don't need vaccines, that is a very dangerous misconception. Though for the most part major disease such as polio are not seen anymore, many America communities still have outbreaks of disease such as pertussis and other respiratory diseases. The goal of vaccinatons is to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as measles and mumps. They protect the public health. When vaccines first became prevalent we saw the eradication of disease like polio. Vaccinations provided protect against diseases that can lead to other serious health complications, and even death. These diseases include rotavirus, hep B, pneumococcal, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hep A, varicella, meningococcal, and influenza. As with any medication, vaccinations can cause a minor reaction like redness or soreness or a low grade fever. None of these side effects result in long term damage, only discomfort for a few days. Professionals have stated that \"the proven preventive benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks of the minimal side effects associated with them.\" Vaccinations have been proven to be 90-100% of infections, and people who are 100% immune protect those with weaker systems. Many say that because we have eradicated many disease through vaccines, there is no need for immunizations. This misconception can cost lives, as those diseases are gone because of immunizations. Another myth people have about vaccines is that there is a connection between vaccinations and autism. People say the MMR vaccine contains thimerosal, a chemical that causes the brain disorder. In fact, the MMR virus has never contained thimerosal, and neither have the vaccines for chicken pox or inactive polio. If these vaccines were not administered we would see a rise in diseases that can be contagious and fatal. Though you say you receive vaccines and still get sick afterwards there is no way you do. It is impossible. Let's take the flu virus for example. The flu vaccine is an inactive immunization, so there are antigens from the virus in it. The sick feeling you may get after a shot is only the body fighting the vaccine after being introduced to it. That feeling is only your immune system growing stronger and protecting you but also the people you sit next to and the person you see on the bus or the person who gives you change at a convenience store. Vaccinations are necessary. They may seem like they do nothing because we do not see diseases like polio anymore but we don't see those anymore because we have vaccines. If we didn't have vaccines, we would see an uncontrollable rise in disease and death.",

            "premise": "Introduction:I'm fine with my opponent attempting to argue that the private market protects people better than a government controlled market in vaccines.Analysis of the Resolution:Generally, public forum debates do not require plans. The resolution also doesn't seem to imply any sort of call to action.Defending the Affirmative ContentionsC1: Solvency My opponent conceded that vaccines improve people's lives, and that without vaccines lives will be lost. This is critical, because the government's responsibility is to maximize and improve public health and safety. There is a great, compelling state reason to require immunization, because of the countless lives that have been saved through it. Risking lives through a lost of mandate will be the last thing that the government will want to do - because it will cost lives.My opponent has been attempting to assert that people can handle themselves - and the only interference needed is education by the government. This is failing. The Wall Street Journal reported on how doctors are practically giving up on their patients and dismissing them, because of their stubborn belief that vaccines can hurt their children [1] [3].False claims that have been disproved by numerous studies, such as the claim that their is a link between autism and vaccines, continue to trick parents even today, even as doctors try to explain to the parents [1].In fact, around 39% of parents refused/delayed vaccines for their children back in '08, up from previous years [2].In a study published last year, some 30% of doctors claim that, at least once, they asked a family to leave because of their constant refusal of vaccines [1]. Another source provided a similar but lesser number - 21% of doctors have dismissed families because of vaccination issues [3].Attempting to \"focus on education\" has been tried by doctors - and failure is evident. Making the government leave vaccine mandates will reduce people's irrational worries, to some extent. Obviously, parents will become scared with the return of horrible diseases. Due to the fact that vaccinations now prevent diseases, many people have begun to forget the horrible impacts of some diseases [3]. Do you see why some parents no longer remember?C2: CommunityMy opponent doesn't gain the same benefits, because without mandates - the number of vaccinations will quickly reduce. Voluntary vaccinations are not likely to stay at high rates, but mandates keeps them high enough.The fact remains that there simply isn't only going to be that one crazy parent who doesn't vaccinate their children. A rising amount of people are choosing to exempt themselves or delay vaccinations [4] [5]. With this growing trend, we can expect the loss of herd immunity - which is usually around 90-95%.My opponent also claims that at different times, different vaccinations are needed. This is outrageous - a constant vaccination of children is vital to ensure the safety of the people from the disease returning. With people believing these false hopes, vaccination rates will start to lower, with people believing that the vaccine is no longer needed, and the disease will return. My example of how whooping cough worsened in Colorado because of lowering vaccination rates perfectly captures this scenario. More and more parents choosing to exempt or delay will harm the general public.C3: MoneyFor the maximization of gained money, mandates are needed. Without them, we cannot hope to save a similar amount, when considering the high exemptions.My opponent also claims that aid has to be given to the poor, in order to pay for the vaccines. I doubt that there is actually that many people who need aid, to actually amount to anything. My opponent's own evidence seems to imply large amounts of \"voluntary vaccinations\", whereas the overwhelming majority of people pay for themselves.Also, vaccine mandates generally aren't that hard to enforce. Currently, the main punishment for rejecting vaccination is that you cannot go to public schools (private schools also have similar vaccine requirements to enter), unless if you state allows some sort of religious/moral/philosophical exemptions (and most states do allow some exemptions).Also, Con's calculations are rather confusing. To be honest, I don't see how he got the $2 billion dollar savings figure and how the government needs to spend $5 on every person.C4: AuthorityI was expecting my opponent to throw a constitutionality/parental freedoms argument out there, but I guess I was wrong. Also, the constitution is generally seen as the document keeping power and freedoms in balance, both by the people and the government. I don't see any other way to find whether or not the government has the authority other than the legal process.Con ArgumentsC1: Economic CalculationGenerally mutation rates in bacteria are about one mutation per one hundred million genes per generation. Bacteria can produce billions of new bacteria daily, each with possibly thousands of genes. Within some forms of diseases, you can expect quick mutations and a rapidly worsening and harming sickness. Constant awareness is needed to fight this - a worthy use of the government's time and money considering the rising number of parents failing to protect their children. Quite frankly, you can't take a risk by letting parents have their own freedoms about this.Also, my opponent has conceded that vaccines have beneficial individual effects. Creating more vaccinations and enforcing mandates will lead to the general improvement of life.C2: BiopoliticsThis might be relevant if we were talking about vaccine mandates in general - concerning adults too. However, children simply do not have the same exact rights as adults.Also, my contention about \"authority\" is supposed to relate to this. The Constitution is the method by which the people and the government decide whether or not a new law is infringing too much on individual freedoms.There currently exists no alternative to mandates - \"educating\" parents on the safety and benefits of vaccines is ineffective in increasing numbers. As the government's duty is partially to protect public health and safety, they must take action to protect the lives of individuals. Without life, you cannot enjoy freedoms.Furthermore, I don't see any logical reason why a parent would have to refuse vaccines other than religious/moral/philosophical objections, which states usually give exemptions to. My opponent has agreed that vaccines have almost no risk at all, and provide much more advantages to people.This sort of bad parenting needs to be stopped.Individual rights cannot be respected if they harm the general public. People are free to do what they will until their actions begin harming others [6].Conclusion:Voluntary vaccination cannot accomplish as much as mandatory vaccinations. Voluntary vaccination leads to higher exemptions, delays, and ultimately will result in a tremendous loss of life. Not to mention that voluntary vaccination leads to the loss of benefits such as herd immunity and won't save as much money for society and the government. Compulsory vaccination protects these benefits and people.I await your response, Con ;)Sources:[1] http://online.wsj.com...[2] http://abcnews.go.com...[3] http://www.usatoday.com...[4] http://www.kdheks.gov...[5]http://www.usatoday.com...[6] Paul Offit, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia",

I had hoped you would actually use an argument rather than post an article that cites books many of which are horribly rated, haven't been rated, or are written by authors who have been shown to be wrong here time and time again. It's actually disappointing you used such debunked and proven to be wrong sources. The ingredients in vaccines have not been show to be related to autism what so ever. Studies have shown this over and over again. All of those quotes from those books that you posted basically do not assert anything they just posit and wonder about if maybe vaccines could cause autism. They have no proof behind them and nothing to back them up. \"Myth: The measles vaccine causes autism. Fact: \"There's absolutely no scientific evidence to support this claim. There is, however, a slew of research that shows the complete opposite: that vaccines do not cause autism,\" says Richard Rupp, M.D., director of the office of vaccine clinical trials at the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. This myth persists because of a fraudulent study in which the lead researcher, a British doctor who has since lost his medical license, lied about finding a connection between the measles vaccine and autism. It doesn't help that the more noticeable signs of autism tend to appear around the 12-month mark, after a child gets a series of vaccines. \"Often, signs of the disorder were present when the baby was younger. It's just that autism becomes easier to detect when a child starts missing milestones,\" says Dr. Rupp. Studies show that both vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally at risk for autism.\" \"Myth: Vaccines contain mercury, and that's bad. Fact: Vaccines used to contain thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, but is a different compound than mercury. More important, it hasn't been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, when the FDA opted to remove it even though studies show it's safe. Thimerosal's purpose was to keep bacteria from growing in multidose vaccine solutions. Vaccines that were once preserved with thimerosal are now put into single-dose vials or syringes that aren't susceptible to bacterial contamination.\" https://www.google.com... \"Vaccine ingredients do not cause autism. One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used to prevent contamination of multidose vials of vaccines. Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004 scientific review by the IOM concluded that \"the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal\"\"containing vaccines and autism.\" Since 2003, there have been nine CDC-funded or conducted studies[PDF - 357 KB] that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children. Between 1999 and 2001, thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for some flu vaccines. This was done as part of a broader national effort to reduce all types of mercury exposure in children before studies were conducted that determined that thimerosal was not harmful. It was done as a precaution. Currently, the only childhood vaccines that contain thimerosal are flu vaccines packaged in multidose vials. Thimerosal-free alternatives are also available for flu vaccine. For more information, see the Timeline for Thimerosal in Vaccines. Besides thimerosal, some people have had concerns about other vaccine ingredients in relation to ASD as well. However, no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.\" https://www.cdc.gov... These are facts. You have provided exactly what I said, overwhelming evidence contrary to vaccines being harmful or causing autism. ,",

            "premise": "I would like to ask of my opponent that she define her position on this debate as I, Con shall argue that being vaccinated isn't worth the risks that follow. I shall begin by refuting what my opponent has said. My opponent asked in round 1 if being vaccinated is worth the risks that might follow. However, she also said that with many different vaccines out there nowadays such as subunit and toxoid vaccines, they make a safer alternative to standard vaccines. Clearly, my opponent has contradicted herself by agreeing that most vaccines are still dangerous. Now onto my arguments. Firstly, we must know the risks of being vaccinated in order to ask ourselves whether or not being vaccinated is worth the risks that follow. Among the identified and acknowledged risks by The Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) are : 1. Brain Inflammation/Acute Encephalopathy 2. Chronic Nervous System Dysfunction 3. Anaphylaxis 4. Febrile Seizures 5. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) 6. Brachial Neuritis; 7. Acute and Chronic Arthritis 8. Thrombocytopenia 9. Smallpox, polio, measles and varicella zoster vaccine strain infection 10. Death (smallpox, polio and measles vaccine) 11. Shock and \"unusual shock-like state\" 12. Protracted, inconsolable crying 13. Syncope 14. Deltoid Bursitis Now, my opponent may argue that these risks are a one in a million thing but think about it. What if you are the one? In fact, my first point has something to say about this as well. 1. We are not as immune as we think we are when vaccinated. In 2012, the IOM published a report, Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality, and acknowledged that there are high risk factors not yet identified by medical science that can increase \"individual susceptibility\" to vaccine reactions: \"Both epidemiologic and mechanistic research suggests that most individuals who experience an adverse reaction to vaccines have a pre-existing susceptibility. These predispositions can exist for a number of reasons \" genetic variants (in human or microbiome DNA), environmental exposures, behaviors, intervening illness or developmental stage, to name just a few, all of which can interact. Some of these adverse reactions are specific to the particular vaccine, while others may not be. Some of these predispositions may be detectable prior to the administration of vaccine; others, at least with current technology and practice, are not.\" \" Institute of Medicine, 2012 2. The risks are just not worth it. I shall present an example to support my point. The Swine/Brid Flu 'Pandemic' Hoax of 2009-2010 The Fall & Winter of 2009 saw an unprecedented propaganda campaign, conducted worldwide, spearheaded by the Rockefeller-founded World Health Organization (WHO) in league with pharmaceutical giants and the governments of America and Great Britain principally, to convince all of us that we were in the grips of a dangerous \"Swine Flu Pandemic\" that would supposedly kill millions if they didn't rush out and line up for our Swine Flu vaccination. Many people fell for that deceitful campaign and some paid the ultimate price for their misplaced trust and gullibility. They came very close to having mandatory vaccination forced upon us, or face the possibility of being quarantined in our home or in a detention camp. I wish all the best to my opponent for the next round and hereby end my argument for now by saying this...Your move, Pro. Sources : (a) http://www.nvic.org... (b) http://educate-yourself.org...",

            "premise": "Multiple vaccines do the job of individual vaccines, but more efficiently and faster. Vaccines work because our body has a natural defense system called the immune system. The immune system recognizes foreign bodies such as viruses and bacteria and creates antibodies to destroy them. Once your immune system has had contact with a particular virus or bacteria it knows how to protect the body against it. Vaccines use the body\u2019s ability to do this to help protect us against diseases that may otherwise be deadly. Vaccines contains part of the virus or disease and when injected stimulate the body to create antibodies to fight and neutralize the disease. Multiple vaccines specifically are more efficient in delivering such vaccines than separate, individual injections. Combined vaccines reduce the number of necessary injections by a third, meaning less pain and less possible side-effects. Combined vaccines also reduce the time that children are at risk from the diseases being vaccinated against, leading directly to fewer cases of such diseases in the population[1]. The MMR combined vaccine, for example, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, has led to an \u2018all-time low\u2019 number of children catching these diseases since being introduced in the United Kingdom[2]. Let us be absolutely clear. The alternative to multiple vaccinations are single vaccinations, which take time and expose risk. Undoubtedly children\u2019s lives have been endangered or lost for a completely fictional harm.

            "premise": "At this point I'm going to defend my argument. \"I Life of humans is far superior than animals\" Con Bare assertion, you must elaborate. I perceive no further evidence to back up this claim. \"The bare assertion fallacy is a fallacy in formal logic where a premise in an argument is assumed to be true merely because it says that it is true.\" [18] \"I will agree that they can suffer pain, but my opponent fails to show on how this relates to vaccines.\" Con I thought I made the relevance of chicken's ability to feel pain clear in section II. Proving animal suffering in relation to vaccines. To reiterate, if a chicken can feel pain, it can suffer. Thus the suffering in animal testing to develop a new vaccine and breeding of chickens is relevant. Here's why chicken's ability to suffer is relevant to vaccines \"The discovery and development of new medicines, vaccines and medical devices for people and animals is a long and complex process with a number of stages, many of which involve animal experiments. National and international regulations currently require that new medicines are tested on animals before being licensed for use. Around 5 million animals including mice, rats, fish, chickens, rabbits, dogs and primates are used across the EU for this purpose each year.\" rspca.org.uk [7] \"What animals experience The degree of suffering, which may include both physical pain and psychological distress, depends on the nature of the experiment. Generally, animals are 'given' a disease or condition then experiments are done to investigate: \" rspca.org.uk [7] \"Animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of the medical product.\" fda.gov [8] \"How many animals are killed in animal testing in the US? Around 10 million a year.\" numberof.net [9] \"Hens used for egg production come from hatcheries, where male chicks (none of which can lay eggs) are killed immediately after hatching. Each year, hundreds of millions of these vulnerable beings are suffocated or ground up alive to produce fertilizer or feed.\" Humanemyth.org [10] \"Vaccine testing in particular consumes an estimated 2.5 million animals every year because vaccines are often produced by weakening, inactivating, or detoxifying a virulent microorganism or toxin. Each batch of the finished product is then tested on animals, causing them pain, suffering, and death.\" [11] As you can see animal suffer from vaccine research. Specifically physical pain, psychological distress, and death. 2.5 million animals suffering from vaccine research qualifies as animal suffering. \"However, he later on provides the reason on how this relates to vaccinations where my opponent claims that chickens suffer from vaccinations.\" Con The baby roosters being ground up into fertilizer. Suffering from research and development which I already stated. \"\"This way you can prevent your birds getting the disease\". Without this vaccination, flocks of chickens would die and recieve diseases which is much worse than a simple shot. As well as that disease can potentially spread putting humans lives at risk. Possible diseases that can potentially spread if not vaccinated include: Pox, Avian Flu, and so much more (2).\" Con Because the disease might kill a chicken that is already in terrible living conditions existing only for human use. If you look at the humanemyth [10] and peacefulprairie [19] links you might see why disease and death might be preferable to the conditions these chickens are kept in. That's assuming the vaccine works. Which I'm not so sure if vaccines work as seen in my round section VI. Doubts about vaccines effectiveness. \"Debeaked with a hot bloody blade at one day old with no anesthetic. \"\"Force molted (intentionally starved to shock the body into another laying cycle).\" [19] \"Then my opponent argues that any animal suffers from vaccinations. This is false for many reasons because animals actually benefit from vaccinations than what my opponent claims. I ask my opponent how do animals suffer? If the suffering is by giving them an injection, then that isn't truly suffering. Suffering would be long term effect of negativity, and animals do not feel that pain for that long.\" Con You don't seem to understand the entire suffering caused by animal testing of vaccines. Nor that these animals are bred in captivity. The conditions of captivity seem far from ideal, and thus suffering of the animals before animal testing. Let, alone the previous generations, the father and mother of the animals bred in captivity for animal testing purposes. Finally, even if vaccines prevent disease in poultry, the factory farmed poultry weren't exactly living a humane lifestyle to begin with. Second, this doesn't negate the cruelty to develop the vaccine. You seem to be making an ends justify the means argument. Inflict pain on chicken A and develop a vaccine so chickens B and C can live disease free. \"Also, the percentage of animals with one of the common diseases rabies. \"In the U.S., rabies represents a serious threat to the health of people and animals. Every year, it is estimated that 40,000 persons receive a rabies prevention treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) due to a potential exposure to rabies\" (5). The solution, vaccinate your animals in order to help them live longer as well as protect your own family.\" Con There is evidence of disease transferring from a non-human species to humans. I have doubts about the effectiveness of such treatments. \"Not only do vaccinations promote safety in health for children and adults, vaccinations also support the economy.\" Con Cigarettes and alcohol also support the economy. \"In my opponents argument for Section III, he quotes that if vaccines are no longer demanded animal suffering would drop. Where is your evidence on that? There is no evidence that he provided, and neglects the fact on how much money is made for vaccination use.\" Con I already made it very clear that animals suffer from animal testing to create vaccines. I didn't think I needed evidence to backup such a simple statement. Nevertheless, simple logic if vaccine research came to a halt, the animal suffering I already established would be reduced. If vaccines were banned then vaccine research would stop. \"fact on how much money is made for vaccination use.\" Con Thank you for bring this up. Many times in history powerful and rich people have abused their power like Rockefeller. \"Critics accused Rockefeller of engaging in unethical practices, such as predatory pricing and colluding with railroads to eliminate his competitors, in order to gain a monopoly in the industry. In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court found Standard Oil in violation of anti-trust laws and ordered it to dissolve.\" [20]. 1 Timothy 6:10 \"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.\" [21] Now which is there more money and profit? The absence of smoking and maintaining a healthy weight, or vaccines? The answer is there is more money and profit in vaccines. Ran out of characters to fully address each of your points. Since animal suffering is involved, I don't have to prove vaccines are dangerous or ineffective, only enough doubt that they should be banned. That the animal suffering is not worth the benefits of vaccines. Some go so far as to say the germ theory is a fraud.

            "premise": "I want to start by thanking pro for giving me an oppurtunity to participate in this debate. Pro has to prove 2 things to win this argument. He needs to prove forced inoculation is moral. He also has to prove that it is good health policy. This is what pro has said himself that he has to prove to show vaccines should be mandatory. Let's first look to see if he has proven it to be moral. \"A person's ability to weigh the pros and cons for themselves doesn't mean they have the right to do so for someone else\" 1. This seems absurd that you would argue someone doesn't have the right to weigh the pros and cons for someone else.Yet you have weighed the pros and cons for not only someone else, but everyone else and have decided for them that they should be forced to get vaccinated. 2. Anyone old enough to be engaging in sexual intercourse is also old enough to have access to the knowledge that nearly everyone contracts HPV. So the person engaging in that sort of behavior if they have chosen not to get vaccinated before they do so, accepts the risk. In full knowledge of the risks. By pro's own admittance weighing the pros and cons of getting vaccinated for another person is immoral. Oddly his whole argument is attempting to justify doing the one thing he has already admitted was immoral. \" The poor are most vulnerable to HPV \" I have showed you how under pro's program the poor would be forced to take the vaccine while the rich and maybe the middle class would have an option not to take the vaccine. I have also shown you how minorities are more likely to be poor then whites. Even if you ignore the fact that \"poor\" is a code word for minorities it is still immoral to take freedom away from the poor but allow the wealthy to keep theirs. When you don't ignore the fact that \"poor\" is a code word for minorities, pro by saying \" The poor are more vulnerable to HPV\" is actually saying \" minorities ( blacks and Hispanics ) are more likely to have STDs\" . Let me remind you also pro has provided no sources to show that minorities are more likely to have STDs then whites as he asserts. Any public health policy that forces a disproportionate amount of minority individuals to get forcibly inocculated because \" the poor\" are more likely to have STDs is immoral. We should be trying to end these type of generalizations not go out of our way to create policy that reinforces them. Is this good public health policy? My opponent defines good health policy as \" How long we live with the best possible health\" I would agree with my opponent that male castration is absurd. To prove something is good health policy you should at the very least be able to prove its a better option then castration. Let's see if my opponent has done so. \" it ( castration ) forces permanent physical harm on patients and completely removes their capacity to reproduce\" This is simply untrue. I would call it permanent physical alteration not harm. If your calling that permanent physical harm then you would have to call circumcision permanent physical harm. This does not remove your capacity to reproduce either. One option is to freeze your sperm before getting castrated. This could also be an oppurtunity to take the best of what the world has to offer freeze their sperm and maybe push evolution forward just a little faster. Also within the next 10 or so years technology will probably be in a position to allow us to reproduce without sperm or any sex required. Source-http://www.theguardian.com... \" affects a persons quality of life both mentally and physically \" This is where me and my opponent agree. It does affect a person's quality of life physically in a big way. It adds a bunch of healthy quality years to your life. As far as mentally is concerned. Castration reduces testosterone levels. High testosterone levels have a direct correlation with your general attitude, how likely you are to commit a crime and your income level. A lower testosterone level is a good thing in these studies. My guess is that if you have a better job a better attitude and aren't in prison then mentally you are probably doing a little bit better. Sources- http://www.medicalnewstoday.com... http://www.crimetimes.org... Pro argues that I provide no way to fund my alternative as well. My alternative could be funded the same way his is. I could do what he does by creating a fine for people who can afford not to participate ( predominately whites) while forcing all people who can't afford not to opt out ( predominately minorities ) to participate. I believe I could fund my program without being racist though. Since increased testosterone is linked to crime then the dramatically reduced amount of prison funding neccesary could go towards castrating individuals. Also the reduced visits to the emergency room as a result of the castrations would mean hospitals would need less subsidies and that money could go towards my procedures. So take a look at my program for increasing the health span of the general population. If it meets all the moral obligations he lays out for vaccinations and also does a superior job of adding health span to the general population. Then he has failed to meet the criteria he set for himself in showing that vaccines are good health policy. Miscellaneous rebuttals ( referring to Gardasil and Cervarix ) \" this is a pretty extensive monitoring program and it's been going ongoing for 7 and 4 years\" This is not nearly long enough to know the long term affects these vaccines has on people's health. For all you know being on these has some very harmful side affects that happen in a small enough segment of the population and far enough down the road that clinical trials would not have picked them up. These side affects could happen at a larger rate then cervical cancer and be worse then cervical cancer and we wouldn't know until it was too late and your program had already affected thousands upon thousands of people. \" FDA and CDC closely monitor the safety of all vaccines through the vaccine adverse event reporting system ( VAERS ) \" It's nice that you read that much of my links to know it listed those reporting systems. If you would have read further you would have noticed that they also stated that Cervarix hasn't been on the market long enough for them to have a large enough sample size for them to provide any useful information on it. Even the CDC is telling you they lack adequate information on something and you still want to push full steam ahead and force it on everyone. These drug companies have a lot of incentive to get their product written into law and forced on the general population. There is billions of dollars at stake here. The drug Gardasil put out an enormous propaganda campaign to have their vaccine mandated by law. Pro you may have fell for this propaganda campaign , but you know who didn't fall for it ? The CEO of Gardasil didn't. Here is a link showing where the company backed down because even they realized what they were doing was wrong. Source http://www.reuters.com... Cervical cancer doesn't affect most people until extremely late in life. 3900 people die each year of cervical cancer. To put into perspective how small a number that is then compare it to the 600,000 people who die each year from heart disease in America. Source- http://www.cdc.gov... You could save more people by cutting national salt intake nationwide by 10 % . Which has got to be cheaper then requiring everyone to get $360 shot.

If they were, than we would not have this whole hype about Universal Healthcare Plans among the Democrats! Therefore the reasons that I gave before in 2nd round still stand. Also you stated that all vaccines except for HPV should be made mandatory. This is quite a long list of vaccines, and insurance would not completely cover the entire list without making premiums go through the roof. This would also raise the strain on the state health insurances that you have mentioned, leading to possible raised taxes, cut education funds. If in the event, that a diesease does pop up upon an unvaccinated population, it can be quickly controlled. It is very unlikely that a child with symptoms of measles would be allowed to contact your child at a party. Quarentine of the sick child is likely. Yes, vaccines are meant to prevent dieseases, however vaccines also work in creating \"rings of immunity\" around outbreaks. This is how small pox was eradicated. By immunizing in regions AROUND out breaks, the disease was contained. A similar infrastructure is already in place in the United States with our current usage of immunizations. Now, there are carriers of dieseases with no visible symptoms. However, a person can be a carrier of diesease even with a mandatory immunization. The government does have the right to protect the citizens of a country, however there are limits to how far the government can go. Our federal government does not have the right to completely disregard one's religious beliefs, like I said before. This is one of our base constitutional rights and would be violated if your plan were to be enacted. However, I also find it disagreeable that the government should have a right to dictate what goes into our bodies without personal choice. I do not completely disagree with your statement about parents needing to be responsible-- in fact quite the opposite. Parents should be given their own reins to how to best protect their children, for children are the Parents responsbility, and not the responsibility of politicians in our government.

You're the one who is screaming by writing in caps, I did most certainly not \"falsely accuse\" you, and you only listed these sources now. You insulted me by calling me a hypocrite. \"another false accusation: \"I bet you didn't want ANYONE to know you were even plagarizing!\" Well, I mean, why didn't you bother citing your source? Citing your source is a good thing! But those were not your words and it was complete plagarism. \"completely irrelevant to the question.\" Is this honestly your response? If everyone was vaccinated, then no one would be dramatically effected by any of these dangerous diseases. You gave no refutation and this point stands. \"contradiction: \"why would that suddenly happen in that time period?...even when they dissapear for a while\" you denied the existence of the improvement in hygiene, etc, yet acknowledged it a couple of sentences later.\" What are you talking about? There was no contradiction and no refutation here. You even said \"coincidence?\" You have no evidence to back up this point. \"You cannot save lives that are already lost.\" Vaccines didn't exist back then. If they vaccines back then, then those lives would have been saved and people could have lived much longer. \"Frankly, if that number is big, then vaccines don't work. If you consider the number that vaccines fail to save \"big,\" you are saying that vaccines do not save this \"big\" amount of people.\" That number is extremely big for a disease. Vaccines do work. That's why all those deaths have been stopping. \"This amount of deaths is because we are too reliant on vaccinations!\" No... Vaccines prevent many illnesses and prevent deaths as well... How does it make any sense that vaccines would cause that much damage? \"...[vaccinations]can cause many deaths, not because it isn't used for some people, but because it is used by the majority...\" - Dr. James Marswell Are you kidding me? Everyone, type this name in Google. The guy doesn't even exist and the argument isn't even thoroughly explained! \"How is one person not being vaccinated a risk to others? If they are vaccinated, they should not be in danger!\" Once again, one person contracting a disease can spread it to more and more people through germs. Vaccinated people can still catch it, but they will have smaller symptoms. \"However, listing statistics is not plagiarizing. You even plagiarized yourself from the same source! Also, I listed tons of sources, just not in the same way that you did. Do I have to bother to do it? Also, your entire speech is without sources!\" You listed 3. In the final round. If you even have been looking at my argument, I have given numerous sources. Copying arguments word for word without citing them is plagiarism. \"Can you scientifically explain how we got our consciousness? How minerals, unliving elements, can create a living being? Life is right in front of our eyes! There are many things that we do not yet know.\" This is more complicated things and is irrelevant to the matter at hand. \"They will not have better defense against it and will be affected as much, if not greater, according to the study I quoted above.\" Fake study. Never sourced. No website. They will be affected a little less, according to the site you plagiarized from. \"If they are helpful, they are a good way to help prevent sicknesses! That doesn't mean that it should be mandatory.\" People will not take vaccines if they are optional. But vaccines are good for everyone. You need to take them so that your body will be benefited and there will be good. \"For these reasons, I have clearly won this debate.\" Obviously, I disagree. You had poorer conduct by constantly using caps, meaning you are shouting, you plagiarized from sites, and you insulted me. Spelling and grammar was okay. I saw a few errors, but I guess that's okay. Arguments are poor and will soon be refuted. Sources is what I dominated in, seeing as I listed more and you only mentioned yours in the last round. Refutations of CON Main Arguments 1. My opponent has stated that people have religious rights and should be allowed to not be vaccinated. This is a very ignorant move. They are putting their entire society at risk of contracting a virus or disease and putting everyone's lives at stake if there is a life-threatening disease. I have never heard that it is a sin to take a vaccine and my opponent has never explained this. 2. Vaccines can be harmful. No, this is wrong, vaccines saves many lives and prevents many diseases. The vaccine causes more benefit compared to the harm done and helps many people in the world right now. It has prevented disease breakouts and we know lives are safe. These are the main arguments that I got from the Opposition. Proposition's Arguments 1. The vaccine is good for everyone. It has saved lives, stopped diseases, and helped everyone. Not taking it means you are missing out on something very good. Many people have died before vaccines were invented and when they were, all those deaths dropped a huge amount. 2. People who are un-vaccinated can obtain harmful diseases and spread it to their families and friends who will suffer because of ignorance. You are putting everyone at risk and you should not be doing so. For these reasons, please vote PRO.",

            "premise": "Refutations \"I may have taken some of my points from a source, however, this means that everything that I say is backed up, whereas your source for the hepatitis B vaccine has yet to be stated, although I requested it previously. That is due to the fact that you plagarized and copied word-for-word every argument and fact from the website I previously listed, which you did not even bother to source because I bet you didn't want ANYONE to know you were even plagarizing! I listed sources. You gave none. I doubt you even looked at my sources for the Hepatitis B argument because the facts are there, in that document. \"Excuse me, Strike, but how would one vaccination cover 20 million children? Just pointing that out there.\" I know that in some countries, parents may not be able to afford vaccines for their children. Nonetheless, if everyone had vaccines, they wouldn't contract the disease. \"Also, isn't it obvious why there would be improved hygiene, purification, and other methods? The government set out to improve our daily lives. Thank you for needlessly asking that question.\" Why would that just suddenly happen in that time period? Why couldn't it happen before? Improved hygiene and such is a valid argument for reduction of germs and bacteria. But I mean, there are still going to be diseases that can be caught, even when they disappear for awhile. The best way to stay protected is to get a vaccine and everyone needs these vaccines. \"That signifies that this is in the past. Second, draw your attention to \"a year.\" This does not specify which year, and I can naturally assume that it was in the begginnings of its emergence, back when people did not develop a resistance to it. Also, 5,000 deaths is actually not a lot.\" Yes, very good job, it was in the past. A year means every year, not just one year. But to be specific, the Pertussis vaccine was developed in the 1930s, and saved those 5,000 to 10,000 lives lost. My opponent decides that 5,000 (the smaller number) is not a big amount of deaths. Pertussis came about in 1906, and hurt people until the vaccine came around. An average of 7,500 people are dying a year. This lasts for approximately 24 years. This is plain ridiculous. It comes out to 180,000 people dying! Tell me that's not big! \"The number of problems are pretty big, as I told you already.\" Sure, as you plagarized already. Anyway, the benefit is much bigger, as I told you already... According to a 2003 report by researchers at the Pediatric Academic Society, childhood vaccinations in the US prevent about 10.5 million cases of infectious illness and 33,000 deaths per year. Look in the previous round for the source. \"Thank you for pointing out that they think that they are safer without the vaccinations. Where, in my arguments, do I state that they think they are safer? They merely don't take the vaccinations, believing that it stands in the way of God, Allah, or whatever they believe...\" There's absolutely no need to yell. I know you have poor conduct and you're certainly not helping it out here. Anyway, when I pointed out that vaccines are safer, I felt like adding some additional info. Anyway, that's exactly the problem. Children should not be allowed to skip vaccinations because of their religious beliefs. They're putting every single child at risk, including themselves! If this argument \"is easily refuted\" then why can't you properly refute it? You didn't list any statistics or sources, and you don't show the \"moral sense.\" \"Um..as far as I know, stating statistics with the exact wording is not called plagarizing. Thus, I can ignore all your refutation here:\" You yourself is not a source. You don't bother to list sources. To plagiarize (I spelled it wrong before) means \"to take without referencing from someone else's writing or speech.\" That is exactly what you did. \"However, scientifically unsupportable is not a big issue. There are many things that we do not know in science, and you cannot ignore the fact that 5,500 cases of autism have occurred.\" Scientifically unsupportable is a big issue. Universities studied it and found that there is absolutely no link to autism and vaccines. Things that we don't know about are things outside of this universe and in the deepest corners of the Earth. Not right in front of our noses. 5,500 cases doesn't mean it truly happened. Some could be false claims and lies, and the others could be true, however, that doesn't mean vaccines are the cause for autism. There is a theory that Ultrasound causes autism, as well. Basically, my opponent argues \"human rights.\" People who believe they have \"rights\" and decide to skip out on vaccines put their entire environment at danger. They can pass the disease onto other people who will suffer as well. They can die themselves, just because of their \"right\" to not protect themselves and in turn, harm themselves. People should not have the right to put themselves and others at risk. \"However, scientifically unsupportable is not a big issue. There are many things that we do not know in science, and you cannot ignore the fact that 5,500 cases of autism have occurred.\" \"First of all, i would like to point out that if other children are vaccinated, they should be safe...? Also, if their children are at risk, that is their problem. They decided, using their rights, not to vaccinate their children and therefore should be allowed to make that decision for a minor.\" If you read my entire argument, you would find that vaccines are beneficial, but children aren't 100% safe. They will just have better defense against it and won't be effected as much. \"Plagurized... right back at you, hypocrite. Also, using my point, developing a natural immune system is important for other reasons and diseases. Vaccinations include anti-body depressants which allow you to get sick easier. We must allow our own bodies to fight back.\" It was not plagiarized. I cited my source. Anyways, this refutation is ridiculous. What happens when people try to get a \"natural immune system\"? They get the disease and THEY DIE. There is no way to develop a natural immune system on your own, or even with help, with the knowledge we currently possess. Vaccinations are beneficial and they prevent diseases from seriously harming your body. \"IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS DEBATE IS ABOUT MANDATORY OR NOT, NOT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.\" This makes absolutely no difference in the debate. Vaccines should be mandatory because they are helpful! It's as simple as that! \"Also, in your ridiculous conclusion, I would like to point out that you started first, giving me less time and space to refute your arguments, whereas you had two speeches. And you can only truly claim that after I have finished posting that debate.\" I would like to point out that you told me to start first. I complied. \"Also, you gave a fallacy stating that you have refuted all of my points. However, the fact that it is the parents' rights to choose is untouched.\" The point was never clear. However, I have now refuted all of your points. \"Many people are severely allergic to some chemicals in the vaccine. Doctors may not know this, and the result of the vaccine may be disastrous.\" According to this site [2], a small percentage of people are at a small risk due to vaccinations. Precautions must be taken if you ever have an allergic reaction, as well. Don't be careless. Arguments: 1. Vaccinations are beneficial and should be mandatory for this reason. 2. People can spread contracted diseases to others and putting everyone at risk. 3. There is much more benefit than harm. I await the response.

I also believe that those parents who decide not to vaccinate their children, should not be denied an education but should be denied the ability to integrate their children into the public school system. That being said there are other methods of learning and accessing a proper education outside of public school also this debate is nothing more than hypothetical scenario for me. I will further support my points below. Contention 1: The Constitution makes no mention of education reserving it as a right given on the state level, See the 10th amendment. The state ultimately has the power over educational institution and ultimately makes all the laws. There is a universal right to an education but there is no universal right to attend any specific public education institution. This would not infringe upon the free will of an individual at all seeing as they have the right to vaccinate or not vaccinate, but access to state regulated public schools can be restricted for good reason without infringing on rights or being unlawful. (students who have been expelled). (1)Contention 2: See my above point. No free wills are being broken here.\"What Social Contract do you speak of, I've never heard of it. For whatever reasons an individual has, be it religious or Moral, they have the right to NOT have there children vaccinated.\"By Social Contract I mean parents typically know better than to send a sick child to school because their child could infect the others. Children contract viruses and diseases from each other at school all the time. Vaccinated children are still capable of spreading diseases to the unaffected, leaving them at a very high risk and allowing that child to be a powerful vehicle for the disease. (2)\"No Schools require children to be vaccinated, as of saying this. Vaccinations are very effective, and carry little side effects, but as stated, people have the right to not vaccinate there child.\"That is a bold statement, the CDC says otherwise: \"No federal vaccination laws exist, but all 50 states require certain vaccinations for children entering public schools. Depending on the state, children must be vaccinated against some or all of the following diseases: mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, partisans, tetanus, and polio.\" (3)\"What Studies do you have the Say not vaccinating your child \"Reverses\" our progress against nearly eradicated diseases That sounds completely made up. You make another Statement based on opinion, rather then fact. \"Measles was declared eliminated in the US by 2000 and its recent comeback can be attributed to the growing population of unaffected children. This is a reference to a CDC study supporting my point. \"Sporadic importations of measles into the United States have occurred since the disease was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 (1). During January--July 2008, 131 measles cases were reported to CDC, compared with an average of 63 cases per year during 2000--2007.* This report updates an earlier reporton measles in the United States during 2008 (2) and summarizes two recent U.S outbreaks among unaffected school-aged children. Among those measles cases reported during the first 7 months of 2008, 76% were in persons aged <20 years, and 91% were in persons who were unaffected or of unknown vaccination status. Of the 131 cases, 89% were imported from or associated with importations from other countries, particularly countries in Europe, where several outbreaks are ongoing (3,4). The findings demonstrate that measles outbreaks can occur in communities with a high number of unaffected persons and that maintaining high overall measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage rates in the United States is needed to continue to limit the spread of measles.\" (4)\"That's not for you to decide. You may or may not Vaccinate your child, if you have one, but Making decisions for others is Unjust, and Unconstitutional.\"This is irrelevant to my argument.

Despite all the good vaccines do, they still have negatives. There are people who cannot get vaccinated without getting very sick. Some people even die from getting a vaccine. These side effects can often run in the family so it makes sense that those who have a family history of bad reactions to vaccines may not want their child to be vaccinated. I also believe vaccines should not be used unless there is some goal. For rabies, it is saving the person. For small pox it was eradicating it.

            "premise": "That's fine. I appreciate that you've chosen to take part in this debate, and I look forward to reading your arguments. So, as I said, I have two main blocks of argumentation. I will provide those, and, just as a reminder, this round of debate is for argumentation, not rebuttal, so Con should not use this round to debate the merits of my arguments, but rather to make his own points apparent. Of course, as I will do, some of your argumentation can be preemptive or responsive, but it all has to be your argument, not direct response. 1. It's good for health policy I will start by posting much of the information about the disease in order to ensure that we are all on the same page when it comes to understanding what makes HPV so important. HPV, as I stated in the first post, is the most common sexually transmitted infection. There are more than 40 types of HPV, and they infect the genitals of both males and females, as well as the mouth and throat. Nearly all sexually active men and women have this virus, and it is easily transmitted. It can only be transmitted through sexual contact of one sort or another, though it can also be passed on to a growing child in a mother's womb. Symptoms include genital warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (warts in the throat) and, most importantly, certain cancers, though I will get to that shortly. These symptoms don't always occur, and viral infection may be cleared by the patient's immune system alone. As such, we should not consider it similar to herpesviruses or HIV, which also have separate symptoms. [1] There are a number of cancers linked to this disease. This is a very strong relationship - over 90% appear to require this as a necessary factor for their development. [2] This is no small issue, either. With 12,340 new cases in 2013 and over 4,000 deaths, cervical cancer is a significant health concern. [3] This is despite Pap smears being an adequate detection mechanism for this cancer type. Other less common cancers are caused by HPV as well, though some are linked to other factors. 2,100 vulvar cancers, 500 vaginal cancers, 600 penile cancers, 2,800 anal cancers in women, 1,500 anal cancers in men, 1,700 oropharyngeal cancers in women, 6,700 oropharyngeal cancers in men. What's more, about 21,000 of these cancers are potentially preventable by HPV vaccines. [1] So preventing these infections has obvious medical benefits, and as patients often do not realize they are infected, these vaccinations are essential to preventing the spread of HPV, and therefore of these cancers as well. 2. It's morally correct This is mainly going to be my attempt to preempt my opponent's response, though I feel very strongly that this is a morally correct mode of action, for multiple reasons. First, it's not restricted to one individual. My opponent will likely bring forward the fact that this takes away individual liberties. However, as disease is not individual in any sense of the term, individual liberties should not be paramount in assessing the worth of such a vaccination program. When your choice affects other people, your access to that choice becomes less simplistic. The possibility that this individual will engage in behaviors that endanger other people takes the choice out of their hands. Second, we already require vaccinations for children entering public schools through state laws. This isn't just a few outliers, either. All 50 states require these vaccinations, and while almost all of them have medical and religious exemptions, this shows that the kind of law I'm professing here is nothing new. [4] Third, an argument that morality is lost relies on some level of harm occurring to those individuals. A single injection of a vaccine, I would argue, is not facing a major loss of decision-making. And since the health harms have all been variously debunked - the supposed ties between vaccines and autism [5], and the view that vaccines have dangerous levels of toxins in them [6] - the only harm that can be pointed to is one of lack of autonomy. I would argue that they do have a choice between paying a fee and taking the vaccine, so the choice still exists, just not with the one that endangers everyone around them. I would also argue that the harm is not sufficient to counter the health benefits explained above. Alright, that's it for me. I eagerly await my opponent's own arguments. 1. http://www.cdc.gov... 2. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com... 3. http://www.cancer.gov... 4. James G. Hodge, Jr. and Lawrence O.

I will now put forward my first argument. Vaccines have dramatically lowered the rates of many diseases around the world.

Influenza: 20000, 243, 99% Hepatitis A: 117333, 11049, 91% Hepatitis B: 66232, 11269, 83% Measles: 530217, 61, 99% Mumps: 162344, 982, 99% Pertussis (whooping cough): 200752, 13506, 93% Pneumococcal disease: 16069, 4167, 74% Polio: 16316, 0, 100% Rubella: 47745, 4, 99% Congenital Rubella: 152, 1, 99% Smallpox: 29005, 0, 100% Tetanus: 580, 14, 98% Varicella: 4085120, 449363, 89% Think of all the lives saved in just the US. Around the world, vaccines have saved millions of lives. Looking at the evidence, I think it's an understatement to describe vaccines as having a net benefit. Vaccines are one of the greatest medical breakthroughs of all time.",

            "premise": "I accept. Resolved: Should doctors be allowed to be allowed to give you vaccines? I'd like to note, of course, that my adversary misspelled \"allowed\" when crafting this resolution. \"Aloud\" is not a verb, and clearly we can draw \"allowed\" from this resolution and his opening remarks contextually. With that said, let's define \"allowed\": \"to permit (something) : to regard or treat (something) as acceptable\" [1]. Note that to allow is to permit, NOT to mandate. Simply because a doctor is allowed to administer a vaccine to a patient does not allow him or her to mandate it nor to require it. That is up to the patient. By prohibiting doctors from giving you or recommending vaccines, not only are you denying people the right to self-defense, but you are restricting freedom of choice. People should be able to do as they wish provided that they don't hurt others, so therefore patients should be allowed to accept or request from a doctor a vaccine. Not to mention, vaccines provide a substantive benefit to our lives in preempting harmful, vicious diseases. Con's opening remarks, however, are highly deceptive. First, allowing doctors to give vaccines does not require that patients, kids included, undergo it. Second, it isn't even a regular procedure, but even if it were, you're allowed to deny it. Third, especially in the case of kids, parents are making these decisions, and prohibiting doctors from giving vaccines is undermining parental authority, not to mention casting a blind eye to advancements in medicine. I'll pass back to Con at this moment, as he hasn't offered much substantive argumentation in Round 1, so I don't feel the need to go into more detail at this point.

            "premise": "Thank you for providing your arguments, Pro. The first thing I shall note is that my opponent has plagiarized her argument from an a CBS article-- \u201cVaccines and autism: a new scientific review\u201d[8] by \u201cfailing to put a quotation in quotation marks\u201d and/or \u201ccopying words and ideas from someone else without credit\u201d [1]. For this, I ask voters to deduct points of conduct from her, though it remains for me to refute her \u201cargument\u201d. Moreover, my opponent has provided such an article as the only proof for her case. I will be trying to refute it and make my own arguments in regards to other aspects of the theory. Moreover, I will be addressing Helen V. Ratajczak's own article first and then the excerpt Pro has provided. Rebuttal to Ratajczak and my opponent______________________________________________________________________ Since both the article\u2014and my opponent's case\u2014hinges on Ratajczak's article as proof for their stance, I will take time to deconstruct her argument\u2014to the best of my ability. This will also serve as my general arguments as I refer to the three common arguments for Pro's position, in contrast to my specific rebuttal to the article\u2014and to Ratajczak's statements.:) Helen V. Ratajczak's article-- \u201cTheoretical aspects of autism: Causes\u2014A Review\u201d [2] is, as its title stated, a presentation of the wide range of proposed links; while it certainly does not challenge the genetic base of autism, the article speculates on the causes\u2014whether \u201cby a defective placenta, immature blood-brain barrier, the immune response of the mother to infection while pregnant, a premature birth, encephalitis in the child after birth, or a toxic environment\u201d, as well as theories related to the vaccine and pertaining to metabolism, and etc. Ratajczak's article thus, not as implied by Pro's arguments, is not necessarily groundbreaking and presents an overview of previous theoretical claims that have been shown to be discredited and false. Ratajczak, in perhaps a reference to the popular theory-- that the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system, notes that it is possible that the immune system's performance may be compromised by such. Evidence however is contrary [4]; studies have already demonstrated that, while particularly sensitive and weak at such an age, as stated by Ratajczak, the immune system is still capable of generating protective responses and is not overwhelmed by vaccines [3]. Other factors, whether the lack of relevance of the extent of susceptibility to infections by vaccinated and un-vaccinated children that suggest no true suppression of the immune system (that would, otherwise, create a discrepancy), the irrelevance of such a matter compared to the factor of genetic variation (which something Ratajczak herself writes about the \u201cgenetic component\u201d of autism), and so forth also undermine both Ratajczak's and the theory's statement. Moreover, she refers (again, this is not a comprehensive rebuttal to the section devoted to vaccines) to both information about Therimosal and mercury poisoning, extending her review to sources of metal and so forth. Ratajcak's own statement, which refers to the theory that \u201cthimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system\u201d, of the harm of thimerosal, can be viewed as odd: thimerosal itself has been poorly documented, in terms of its effects on humans, and whatever can be accrued about its toxicity was derived from reports of poisoning by accidental exposure or intended suicides [7]. Thus, it is somewhat odd to read Ratajczak's statement on the effect of Thimerosal on the immune system. Like many proponents, Ratajczak also relies on the similarities of autism with mercury poisoning induced by exposure to Thimerosal: she writes of similarities in psychiatric disturbances, neurobiological structures, and so fortht that enable her to state that \u201cdue to the extensive parallels between autism and mercury poisoning, the likelihood of a casual relationship is great\u201d (p. 70). Unfortunately, it should also be noted\u2014from my rough research\u2014that such similarities, while not non-existent, are glossed over by dissimilarities. It is true that mercury is neurotoxic as Ratajczak writes\u2014and perhaps responsible for stimulating such effects; however, Ratajczak, in attempting to establish \u2013or imply a casual relationship, fails to mention the fact that \u201cchildren with mercury poisoning show characteristic motor, speech, sensory, psychiatric, visual, and heads circumference changes...fundamentally different...or absent in children with autism\u201d [4] or distinguishable aspects absent in children with autism. Apart from the distinction between the repetitive behaviors (stereotypes) and the more varied findings of mercury poisoning, one may also note the discrepancy. As for the final matter, the posited metal metabolism disorder, which rests solely on supposed high concentrations of \u201cheavy metal...in the blood and urine of autistic subjects\u201d, is unfortunately refuted by the fact that the very authority that Ratajczak sources\u2014Bernard--fails to explicitly provide references to anything in literature \u201cthat reported an abnormal body bruden of mercury, or an excess of mercury in hair, urine, or blood\u201d [9], even in a paper that seeked to establish a link or association between the two variables. Thus, with both a biological implausibility and failure to manifest as a sympton, the concept that Thierosmal is responsible for autism is largely discredited. As for an actual response to the article and in regards to the Measles Mumps Rubella Vaccine \u201cThese changes [suggested by an examination of the continuing prevalence of autism] could contribute to increases in incidence of autism. Another change was....vaccine\u201d (p. 71-72). This is what is alluded in the excerpt of the article. Unfortunately, a simple causation-correlation fallacy can be seen there: while the two variables may occur, in trends, at the same time, she has not set any evidence to imply a link of causation between the two, and neither has she given evidence to corroborate her speculation. In fact, one can dispute her later speculation: how could the homologous recombination turn the cell into an \u201caltered self\u201d (it should still be human DNA making human proteins) and yet, how would produce an autoimmune disease? As one response to such an article details [5], numerous conditions\u2014arrival into the neural system and undergoing homologous recombination at a detectable scale, would need to be fulfilled, making her statement highly implausible. It is also unfortunate that my opponent has chosen this article to represent her view. Note that while the concept of a link between vaccines is uphold, in its variant forms, Ratajczak however, does support the very notion that factors in coalition procure such a result, writing that \u201cIt is possible that autism results from more than one cause, with different manifestations in different individuals that share common symptoms\u201d (p. and even suggesting an incorporation of the theoretical cause(s) explored\u2014environmental agents, the chiefly genetic component, conditions explored therein\u2014the blood barrier, pregnancy, and so forth. My opponent has named only one cause of autism that is viewed, even here, as secondary to other aspects; in essence, there is a difference between what my opponent emphasizes as a chief and sole cause and what her argument supports as being only one force in understanding the theoretical cause of autism. And with that, I rest my case. I also remind my opponent that she should restate her case while rebutting mine in the final round.For the background and sources, see: http://www.debate.org...",

Beyond that it's imperative for herd immunity among other variables that the majority of people be vaccinated and thus should be mandated First, What is herd immunity? the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune to the disease, especially through vaccination. Why is this important? according to vaccines.gov Germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, the germs can\"t travel as easily from person to person \" and the entire community is less likely to get the disease. That means even people who can\"t get vaccinated will have some protection from getting sick. And if a person does get sick, there\"s less chance of an outbreak because it\"s harder for the disease to spread. Eventually, the disease becomes rare \" and sometimes, it\"s wiped out altogether. Who does community immunity protect? Community immunity protects everyone. But it\"s especially important because some people can\"t get vaccinated for certain diseases \" such as people with some serious allergies and those with weakened or failing immune systems (like people who have cancer, HIV/AIDS, type 1 diabetes, or other health conditions). Community immunity is also important for the very small group of people who don\"t have a strong immune response from vaccines. Essentially, when the vast majority of people are immune to a disease, it protects those of us who can't get vaccinated. Now to address my opponent's points. He claimed that it's a waste of time and money, However, both of these are not priority issues. saving the few minutes it takes to get vaccinated cannot hold up to saving lives with herd immunity. the same can be said for saving a paltry sum of money. This is a not a priority issue at best and selfish at worst. Protect our communities, save lives. vote con.",

Smooosh, if you have any concerns about the way this debate is structured, send me a PM and we can iron them out. I'll start with some housekeeping. Some basic definitions: Vaccine: a preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease The MMR vaccine: the acronym stands for measles, mumps and rubella, three single-stranded RNA viruses, and the vaccine is meant to impart a protective immunologic response to those who take it. The vaccine is composed of live attenuated viruses, meaning that their virulence has been strongly reduced, but the virus is still viable. This ensures that the vaccine will have the strongest and longest-lasting effect, meaning that the vaccine only has to be taken in its two-shot series once over a person's lifetime. Should be mandatory: it is net beneficial that these injections required for individuals under the law. I will stress two terms in that last definition: net beneficial. This is the criteria on which the burdens for each side in this debate are based. While I carry the burden of proof, that only means that I must show that my case is net beneficial over whatever alternative Con provides, whether that's the status quo or a counter plan. Con can either show that my case is not net beneficial, or outweigh my case with whatever alternative he presents. I'll define the specific limits of my case in my opening round.

There are many different reasons, some of which are more absurd than others. However, I would like to start off with some reasons why perfectly reasonable people might not vaccinate: 1. They have heard of the \"dangers\" of vaccination and wish to be cautious. Online, there are thousands of trash blogs talking about how vaccines cause ASD and other \"terrible diseases.\" Due to the sheer amount of these blogs, a mother trying to research about vaccinations may come across one. Unless the mother has been completely informed on vaccines and their benefits, it is completely possible that she will be swayed by their arguments. 2. They want to have their own decision. Now, don't get me wrong. I completely support having your own opinions. However, studies show that parents who think about vaccines instead of trusting their doctor are 8x more likely to reevaluate the decision to vaccinate (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...). With all the mistrust in the government as well as the power of anecdotal online blogs, that number shouldn't be a surprise. 3. Religious beliefs. I completely respect religions, even though I am an atheist (hopefully that doesn't cost me votes), and I am completely aware of what the Constitution may say. However, no one will allow an Islamic radical to blow up their family for \"religious freedom.\" The difference here is the freedom of religion vs. the welfare of the public. There are religions that prohibit vaccinations, and many anti-vaxxers are falsely saying that they are part of a religion to get a free \"get out of getting vaccinated\" ticket. When weighing religion against vaccinations, I would support vaccinations all the way.",

Terrible side affects. Vaccines cause TERRIBLE side affects. This includes (CDC) Pneumonia Tiredness Fussiness Non-Stop Crying Vomiting Seizure Fainting And much moreAccording to TIME magazine, some 12/47 countries that used the H1N1 Flu vaccine reported spikes in narcolepsy cases. WHO\u2019s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said that it agreed with Finnish authorities that there was a \u201cstrong association\u201d between the vaccination, the genetic makeup of the patients, and the narcolepsy cases. As you can see, vaccines cause a huge number of cases of illness and side effects - TIMEAsk the parents of autistic children whether they believe childhood vaccines can cause autism, and the answer will probably be yes. They have heard of too many cases of babies who were perfectly normal until they got their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot and then, within weeks--if not days--started throwing tantrums, losing language skills and generally tuning out.2. The vaccine industry is badThe vaccine industry over vaccinates us. This is the only way they make money sicne they charge for vaccines. We are vaccinated on things we don\u2019t need to be vaccinated on. The Guardian reports: Professor Maria Zambon, a virologist and head of the Health Protection Agency's Influenza Laboratory said\"Within the last century we have had four major flu epidemics, along with HIV and Sars. Major pandemics sweep the world every century, and it is inevitable that at least one will occur in the future.\u201d The Telegraph reports: We now give our children 25 different vaccines, in various combinations, before the age of 15 months. We are in danger of becoming dependent on immunisation, rather than on our immune systems, for our future health. This may appeal to vaccine manufacturers, which operate in an increasingly profitable market, but should concern the rest of us. As you can see, the vaccine industry is thus making billions of dollars. If they gave everyone a cure to all the sicknesses in the world, the vaccine industry won\u2019t continually make money. They are sucking government funds dry while making the world dependent on immunisation. 3. Economic HarmVaccines can cause harms to the economy. One example is that it ruins some doctors. The American Academy of Pediatrics came up with estimates for indirect expenses, concluding they range from about 17 percent to 28 percent of the purchase price of vaccines. So at least 17 percent should tacked onto the purchase price for doctors to have a shot at breaking even, the group concluded. By that measure, 47 percent of immunizations are money-losers, the athenahealth data show. If the 28 percent figure for indirect costs is used to calculate break even, then it's an even grimmer picture: 79 percent of vaccination payments fall short. 4. (if time) International CommunitySince state represents any government in the world, this contention will talk about the international community. In the international community, we know that places like UK are just like the US, vaccination wiseHowever, think about the poor countries, which consists of most of the world. Many of the countries there don\u2019t have clean and steralized vaccine needles. Taking these vaccines would mean death! Why should this be state mandated!The people giving them are untrained! In some cases, like in the Middle East, the government hate the people, and try to poison and kill them with vaccines! The vaccines are like a weapon!",

            "conclusion": "Ban vaccines",
            "premise": "To begin my argument, I like to first Rebuttal some points about my opponents argument of why vaccines shouldn't be banned. I. Life of humans is far superior than animalsII. Vaccine Industry Economic BenefitsIII. Vaccines help humansI Life of humans is far superior than animalsIn my opponents opening argument of section I, he argues that animals, specifically chickens, suffer pain. Can they? I will agree that they can suffer pain, but my opponent fails to show on how this relates to vaccines. It doesn't because quoted by his sources \"\"Domestic chickens display signs of empathy, the ability to 'feel another's pain' that is at the heart of compassion, a study has found\". How does this relate to the usage of vaccines? However, he later on provides the reason on how this relates to vaccinations where my opponent claims that chickens suffer from vaccinations. In reality, they don't knowing from personal eperience as well facts to support my claim that chickens don't suffer from vaccinations. According to \"The Chicken Vet\" (1) \"Vaccination is commonly used in commercial poultry and increasingly in backyard birds to control disease. Vaccines mimic natural infection, allowing the birds to build up immunity to the disease without any of the harmful effects. This way you can prevent your birds getting the disease\". Without this vaccination, flocks of chickens would die and recieve diseases which is much worse than a simple shot. As well as that disease can potentially spread putting humans lives at risk. Possible diseases that can potentially spread if not vaccinated include: Pox, Avian Flu, and so much more (2).Then my opponent argues that any animal suffers from vaccinations. This is false for many reasons because animals actually benefit from vaccinations than what my opponent claims. I ask my opponent how do animals suffer? If the suffering is by giving them an injection, then that isn't truly suffering. Suffering would be long term effect of negativity, and animals do not feel that pain for that long. According to \"National Office of Animal Health\" (3), \"Vaccination also reduces the amount of pharmaceutical treatments (such as antibiotics) used to control established diseases and, in many instances, has prevented long term suffering and death\". They protect the animals from multiple diseases (3), and without that vaccination they would suffer more than just taking a simple shot. Like this graph (4): In the graph, it is seen that animals become more immune to these diseases with a vaccination, than not recieving one at all.Also, the percentage of animals with one of the common diseases rabies. \"In the U.S., rabies represents a serious threat to the health of people and animals. Every year, it is estimated that 40,000 persons receive a rabies prevention treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) due to a potential exposure to rabies\" (5). The solution, vaccinate your animals in order to help them live longer as well as protect your own family.II Vaccine Industry Economic BenefitsNot only do vaccinations promote safety in health for children and adults, vaccinations also support the economy. According to World Health Organization (WHO) (6), it states: \"The potential benefits of expanded vaccine coverage are evident among the following five emerging economies: Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa \u2013 often referred to as BRICS. These countries have seen high economic growth in recent years \u2013 expanding their capacity to produce, procure and provide health care\". As well as the market for vaccinations is about at the same rate as the marijuana tax revenue given in the chart (7): As it is seen, the market is growing for this and if we deny it, it will end in tragedy.In my opponents argument for Section III, he quotes that if vaccines are no longer demanded animal suffering would drop. Where is your evidence on that? There is no evidence that he provided, and neglects the fact on how much money is made for vaccination use. And in my opponents argument for Section IV, he argues that people have endured a long time without vaccines. I will agree that this is true, however we shouldn't ban vaccines just because theres a potential that they are immune. There are certain diseases still existing today, and the only way to help cure them are vaccinations. One example is polio, \"By 2002, the incurable and deadly disease of polio had also been eradicated from much of the world. This included the UK, the rest of Europe, the western Pacific and the Americans because of vaccinations\" (8). If we eliminate vaccinations right now, certain diseases may never be found with a solution. In fact, vaccinations is the core of a lot of cures for diseases, and is the best way to study these diseases (9).III Vaccines help humansThis is an obvious argument, but is the most reasonable one of why vaccinations shouldn't be banned. Vaccinations help humans, and has healed many people. The percentage of death with a vaccination is only a 1% chance (10). That is pretty low, and actually has more benefits than consequences. In my 11th source, it can be checked out on all the benefits for vaccinations (11). And to conclude my opening argument, I like to point out one common miconception of vaccine usage. My opponent claims that vaccines cause autism. This is factually wrong because according to doctor Neal Hasley (12): \"'The evidence is overwhelming,' he said. The Institute of Medicine has investigated and repeatedly said it's not true. A special federal court, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, ruled against three families in 2009 who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been 'misled by physicians who are guilty \u2026 of gross medical misjudgment'.

Mandating vaccinations imposes on the individuals ability to deny these vaccinations without being seen (in the legal world) as a criminal. \"How many children actually get these rare yet serious side effects?\" More than 12,000 adverse reactions to vaccines are reported each year. If the rate of under-reporting is considered, this number should be closer to 120,000. Vaccine-related deaths occurring each year may be over 1000. The compensation portion of the Vaccine Injury Act awards up to $250,000 if a child dies from a vaccination or millions in dollars to cover lifelong medical bills, pain and suffering in the case of a brain-damaged child. By 1997, more than $802 million had been awarded for hundreds of injuries and deaths (5000 cases, 700 of which were deaths). Thousands of cases are still pending and the estimated future liability for the government exceeds $1.7 billion. \"What scientific studies prove your second contention, subpoint B?\" Joseph Mercola, \"Vaccines and Immune Suppression,\" www.mercola.com (accessed Jan. 5, 2010). Feel free to also examine http://www.whale.to.... \"Are you advocating that instead of vaccinating, children should choose to strengthen their immune systems naturally?\" Not necessarily, but I do not think it is right to believe or claim that vaccination is the only way to protect public health and ensure that diseases disappear. The possibility that a child's immune system can overcome diseases still exists and is an alternative to vaccination. Practicing sanitation and cleanliness also helps to minimize the impact of diseases. \"Aren't very young children (under 1 year old) especially susceptible to disease, especially without vaccinations?\" Young children are susceptible to diseases, but this does not necessarily mean that vaccination is the reasonable alternative. Adults who come into contact with these young children, should be made aware of the impact of cleanliness and sanitation. \"Do you believe that if a large percentage of the population favors/opposes something, the government should do as the population says?\" It is in the governments and peoples best interest to keep opinion in mind. There is no legal coverage under which the federal government could reasonably mandate vaccination (as it is also, again, constitutionally violation), and this will be known if they were to attempt to ball a law similar to the one proposed. \"Is one of the duties of the government to protect its citizens?\" Protecting the citizens entitles protecting their constitutional rights as individuals. \"Should the government intervene when parents deprive their children of food?\" And the answer is yes, but the difference between food and vaccination is that the lack of food means direct physical harm to the child without any room for doubt. Not being vaccinated does not mean that the child is going to, without a doubt, catch a deadly or harmful disease. The difference lies in the effect it has on the child, and your comparison of these two items is unreasonable and shocking. These are two entirely different entities, as they also reflect two different mind-settings of the parent. If the parents denies a child food than they are, in one way or another, trying to inflict harm or deny the child of something that they couldn't live without. This is not the same for vaccination. A child CAN live without being vaccinated, and the child can pursue a happy life. Vaccine, as defined by dictionary.com, is \"a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products...\" This means that vaccinations themselves introduce small amounts of these diseases into the child's bodies in the hopes that their immune system can build up defenses against it. What is the possibility that these introduced organisms could be detrimental to the child's physical or mental health? What are the long-term effects of the HPV vaccination you said should be mandated, in Contention 1 Subpoint B? What evidence do you have that vaccination is always effective (using Measles, mumps, small pox, polio and Hib as examples)? Why is vaccination a reasonable alternative to the naturally developed immune system? What legal heading could the Federal Government put mandated vaccination under? What Religions are not opposed to vaccination? In terms of percentage, how effective is this vaccine after the first dose? After each subsequent dose? Quantifiably speaking, what are the child's chances of catching Disease X if vaccinated? Unvaccinated? What about catching AND spreading it? Do you have a list of ingredients for these vaccine/s suggested? Has there been any independent, longitudinal research on the safety of these ingredients? Can you please tell me about studies done proving the safety of adjuvants, particularly aluminum?

            "conclusion": "The Thimerosal found in vaccines causes autism",
            "premise": "http://www.prweb.com... For nearly ten years, Brian Hooker has been requesting documents that are kept under tight wraps by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His more than 100 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have resulted in copious evidence that the vaccine preservative Thimerosal, which is still used in the flu shot that is administered to pregnant women and infants, can cause autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Dr. Hooker, a PhD scientist, worked with two members of Congress to craft the letter to the CDC that recently resulted in his obtaining long-awaited data from the CDC, the significance of which is historic. According to Hooker, the data on over 400,000 infants born between 1991 and 1997, which was analyzed by CDC epidemiologist Thomas Verstraeten, MD, \"proves unequivocally that in 2000, CDC officials were informed internally of the very high risk of autism, non-organic sleep disorder and speech disorder associated with Thimerosal exposure.\" When the results of the Verstraeten study were first reported outside the CDC in 2005, there was no evidence that anyone but Dr. Verstraeten within the CDC had known of the very high 7.6-fold elevated relative risk of autism from exposure to Thimerosal during infancy. But now, clear evidence exists. A newly-acquired abstract from 1999 titled, \"Increased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to Thimerosal containing vaccine in first month of life\" required the approval of top CDC officials prior to its presentation at the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) conference. Thimerosal, which is 50% mercury by weight, was used in most childhood vaccines and in the RhoGAM\" shot for pregnant women prior to the early 2000s. The CDC maintains there is \"no relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism rates in children,\" even though the data from the CDC\"s own Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database shows a very high risk. There are a number of public records to back this up, including this Congressional Record from May 1, 2003. The CDC\"s refusal to acknowledge thimerosal\"s risks is exemplified by a leaked statement from Dr. Marie McCormick, chair of the CDC/NIH-sponsored Immunization Safety Review at IOM. Regarding vaccination, she said in 2001, \"\"we are not ever going to come down that it [autism] is a true side effect\".\" Also of note, the former director of the CDC, which purchases $4 billion worth of vaccines annually, is now president of Merck\"s vaccine division. Dr. Hooker\"s fervent hope for the future: \"We must ensure that this and other evidence of CDC malfeasance are presented to Congress and the public as quickly as possible. Time is of the essence. Children\"s futures are at stake.\" A divide within the autism community has led to some activists demanding that compensation to those with vaccine-injury claims be the top priority before Congress. Dr. Hooker maintains that prevention, \"protecting our most precious resource \" children\"s minds,\" must come first. \"Our elected officials must be informed about government corruption that keeps doctors and patients in the dark about vaccine risks.\" Referring to an organization that has seen its share of controversy this past year, Dr. Hooker remarked, \"It is unfortunate that SafeMinds issued a press release on my information, is accepting credit for my work and has not supported a worldwide ban on Thimerosal.\" Brian Hooker, PhD, PE, has 15 years experience in the field of bioengineering and is an associate professor at Simpson University where he specializes in biology and chemistry. His over 50 science and engineering papers have been published in internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Hooker has a son, aged 16, who developed normally but then regressed into autism after receiving Thimerosal-containing vaccines.",
