            "premise": "I would like to begin this round by laying down one fact. First, there are between 7 and 20 million illegal immigrants in the United States. http://www.csmonitor.com.... Additionally, I would like to ask my opponent one question: if all these illegal immigrants came into the United States legally, would you turn any away, and would you be supportive of them? America was, of course, founded by immigrants, and is currently populated with the sons and daughters of immigrants, so I think most Americans should be supportive of immigration in principle. Because my opponent has not stated his opinion on this idea, I will assume that he or she is supportive of large-scale legal immigration unless he or she were to say otherwise in a response. This preface leads me to the following argument: Illegal immigrants are often portrayed as being leeches who suck away American jobs, and in most other scenarios, I would be against illegal immigrants. They don't pay taxes, and receive much of the benefits normal citizens do receive. However, I believe the current illegal immigrants should be granted amnesty for one reason: if you are poor, it is nearly impossible to immigrate legally, let alone become an American citizen. Many of America's immigrants in the past would not have been able to immigrate legally, because they would be too poor in the current system. To immigrate legally, you need all sorts of documentation, and while I believe these papers are a noble attempt to stop the people like drug dealers from getting in to America, most of these Latin American immigrants simply do not have the paperwork necessary. When you are living in total poverty under an oppressive government, it is difficult to keep track of things like birth certificates, if you even had them in the first place. http://www.alternet.org... Therefore, I believe that until the immigration process stops becoming a bureaucratic nightmare, all illegal immigrants should be granted amnesty. In addition, the United States should allow its immigration process to be more open, and allow immigration on a larger scale.",

            "conclusion": "Allowing Illegal Immigrations To Still Get Benefits",
            "premise": "Thanks, Pro. == PRO CASE == R1) Causes 1. This is just a moral case for allowing illegal immigration; that is not what this debate is about. In fact, Pro is actually hurting his case by showing that the US has such superior living conditions that simply allowing them to be here is a substantial improvement on its own, regardless of whether or not they are receiving benefits. I could agree with every word Pro has said here and it still would not prove Pro's position. Reject this argument because it is inapplicable to the resolution at hand. 2. Regardless of how much strife illegal immigrants may have to go through, the state is first and foremost obligated to serve the best interests of its own citizens, and I have shown with my C2 that giving benefits to illegal immigrants puts a significant strain on the government budget and, by extension, the citizens. Moreover, the majority of academic studies on immigration conclude that the presence of illegal immigrants is harmful to the well-being of America's poorest citizens by competing with them for the same jobs. Therefore, the government shouldn't do anything that makes it easier for illegal immigrants -- including the provision of federal benefits -- and instead take action to reduce their numbers. https://www.hamiltonproject.org... 3. I have no idea what point Pro was trying to make with his tirade about European colonization and Columbus Day. He's going to have to explain how that connects to the resolution for it to even be considered an argument. R2) Work 1. The part where Pro actually connects \"immigration is beneficial\" to the resolution is extremely ill-warranted. He provides absolutely no evidence that illegal immigrants \"need\" benefits more than native citizens do. Considering Pro's claims that immigrants benefit the economy by filling in high-demand jobs, we would expect that they would be making ample money to be financially self-sufficient. 2. I have provided actual academic studies demonstrating that illegal immigrants hurt the job security and wages of America's poorest. Pro has just noted a decrease in unemployment rate without making any attempt at linking it to immigration. Unemployment rate is affected by thousands of variables, so to just arbitrarily attribute it to increased illegal immigration is absurd. Prefer my evidence, obviously. == CON CASE == C1) Incoherent Pro's only response is that illegal immigrants can become citizens, and thus the government doesn't have to deport them. But that is NOT within the parameters of the resolution. If that is what Pro wanted to debate, he should have made the resolution something like \"The USFG should grant all illegal immigrants amnesty\". The resolution we are debating specifically states that *illegal* immigrants should be given benefits, implying that they would still be \"illegal\" when they are receiving benefits. Thus, my criticism stands -- Pro's plan cannot be implemented because of its paradoxical nature. Also, cross-apply (in advance) this counter to all other mentions Pro makes of making illegal immigrants citizens; the resolution is not about ammesty. C2) Cost 1. Pro essentially says that our debt is already so high that even 500 billion extra dollars makes little difference. That's nonsensical. We have to start paying off our debt eventually, and Pro's plan just makes it harder to do that any time soon. Pro's response is akin to a smoker who refuses to stop smoking because his lungs already seem to be beyond repair. It simply isn't tenable in the long run. 2. Pro is blatantly false in his claim that most Americans are illegal immigrants. Even the first settlers could not have been considered \"illegal immigrants\" because there was no state to \"immigrate\" into; Native Americans did not have the bureaucratic governments, citizens, or official immigration processes necessary for such classifications to exist. Pro's rebuttal fails. 3. Pro dismisses the notion of giving benefits attracting more illegal immigrants as being \"laughable\". However, I provided academic analyses demonstrating that it *does* happen. If anything, Pro's flippant dismissal of empirical evidence is \"laughable\". Pro says that if that were the case, having a welfare state would attract more legal immigrants... and he's right. It does. So, again, he has just hurt his own case. It is rather intuitive, really -- people respond to incentives. Providing benefits *does* attract illegal immigrants en masse. C3) Unjust Again, cross--apply the point that this debate is not about amnesty -- it's about providing federal benefits to immigrants who are currently classified as being here illegally. It is unfortunate that Pro has spent so much space on amnesty, because it is completely non-topical. == CONCLUSION == I don't feel like writing one. It's 3am again. Resolution negated.",

            "premise": "Allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses is a security issue for America. Illegal immigrants are a threat to the US because they have not gone through the necessary background checks that all immigrants are supposed to go through before being allowed into the US to ensure that they are not going to harm American citizens. Giving illegal immigrants documents that- as proposition argument three says- could grant them access to state services and to a wider range of private services is dangerous[1]. There is no way for frontline state and business staff to determine whether drivers licence holders are migrants who have undergone appropriate police screening, or criminals with a history of dishonest or exploitative behaviour. The resolution may, therefore, allow disreputable individuals to falsely claim to be normalised American citizens. Alternatively, and more likely, the resolution will undermine the value and utility of state drivers licences \u2013 for Latin-American US citizens at the very least. As it becomes known that immigrants from the south bearing licences might be more likely to be dishonest, banks, stores and hospitals will become less willing to accept drivers licences as conclusive proof of a Latin-American individual\u2019s identity. If the degree to which service providers will trust a driving licence is reduced, the improvements to illegal immigrants\u2019 quality of life that the resolution brings about will be short lived. Moreover, legally resident Latin-Americans will find that their lives become much more difficult. Service providers will adopt a stance of suspicion toward Latin-American individuals, assuming that a Latino-American\u2019s driving licence offers no useful indication as to his immigration status and background.\u00a0Therefore, this policy constitutes a large security threat to America and its citizens, and a significant danger to the integration and lifestyles of thousands of Latino-American individuals.

The Brooking's Institution's Michael Greenstone, said that, and I quote, \"on average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and income of Americans.\" Immigrants (whether they are illegal immigrants or not) increase the job opportunity's for Americans, because they start businesses and hire more workers. Our goal shouldn't be to send back the immigrants, but to welcome them. It's our responsibility to give them more chances to become lawful American citizens. It can take years for close relatives of U.S citizens to obtain Immigrant Visas. This difficult immigration process only encourages people to immigrate illegally. You also state that \"also the illegals don't have to pay taxes.\" That's my point exactly! If illegal immigrants are allowed citizenship, then they will pay taxes! Many illegal or undocumented immigrants actually pay income and sales taxes anyhow. On average an immigrant, regardless of status, will pay 80,000 U.S dollars more in taxes than they use in government services over the course of their lifetime.",

Are you suggesting that we allow any and all to just walk across the border and call themselves a citizen? that would have been great for America during the cold war when soviet spies and sabatours could just walk right in and out to never be found again. This goes for terrorists today as well. Is it worth risking American's lives? Illegal immagrants are breaking the law...PERIOD. besides that fact, should not an American wanting a job take precedence over that of an illegal? Is it fair that illegals should be allowed to live in this country and reap all the benefits without paying taxes like everyone else? Also, an increase in illegal immigration is directly proportional to an increase in crime. Besides the negative effects of that fact alone, this leads to a strain on government resources - police, jails, etc. which are paid for by taxes, which are bad enough, but lead to a strain on funding for other needed things.

            "conclusion": "Birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants",
            "premise": "Many thanks to my opponent for accepting this debate and responding. I would like to quickly move onto my refutations and new arguments. Refutations 1. I am slightly confused as to what my opponent is truly arguing. Instead of wondering about what my family roots are, or citing a movie, I would appreciate if you could make the argument more clear. However, correct me if I am wrong, I believe you are arguing that America is a land of freedom, free of prosecution, and free of religious intolerance. If so, I argue that these people are not American citizens and they realize it. They do not deserve to live in our extremely tolerant land when they themselves are not true citizens, but illegal immigrants. And their children certainly do not either. If you claim that America is so free, then why does the Constitution, the very document that defines America, contain the three-fifths slave law and the prohibition of outlawing the Atlantic slave trade [1]? I do not understand how my opponent refuted my argument and thus, it still stands. 2. So what's so problematic with legal children citizens of illegal immigrants becoming illegal citizens? All they need to do is become legal citizens, which is what true immigrants to the United States and other countries do. It's not that big of a deal. \"According to the Pew Research Center, 8% of all newborns, 5.4% of the total workforce, and 4% of the total US population are attributed to illegal immigrants.\" This debate has little to do with actual illegal immigrants, but more about the children they produce and their citizenship. I feel that most of my opponent's arguments are focused on illegal immigration in it's entirety. I personally believe that illegal immigrants are bad and have a negative effect, but that is useless in this specific debate. 3. No, it is not just about Hispanic immigration, but the Hispanics make up the largest percentage (more than half) of illegal immigrations to the US [2]. My opponent asks what the problem with a disproportionate amount of births is. Here is my response. Because illegal immigrants have the power to procreate in the United States and to bring new citizens into the union, they exacerbate the concerns of immigrants that feel they are being put at a disadvantage. \"Why not simply get rid of the entitlement programs, but keep the people who have just come here to provide their family the best opportunity possible? Immigrants to the US in the past had to be self-reliant, learned to be self-reliant, and were some of the most enterprising individuals on the face of the earth.\" We are not \"getting rid\" of or deporting the people who have birthright citizenship, but simply forcing them to obtain true citizenship instead of automatic citizenship of no charge. Plus, these are the children of illegal immigrants who have disrespected US' laws and immigrated here illegally, only to have a legal child who can put in a word for them when they are persecuted due to illegality. In the second sentence, the key word my opponent mentioned is \"immigrant.\" He never mentioned illegal immigrants and I would like him to cite any illegal aliens that became \"the most enterprising individuals on the face of the earth.\" \"The welfare state, with the promise of instant subsistence, is the real enemy, not immigration itself.\" I do not see why the welfare state should be eliminated. Sure, illegal immigrants will no longer exploit or take advantage of the public benefits, but the benefits are taken away from the legal citizens and public who need programs in public health and public housing and unemployment compensation. Illegal immigrant parents, not the United States government, are to blame for immigrating illegally and deciding to give birth to a child in the United States. The consequences to their children are a result of their folly, not of the government for deciding to end birthright citizenship. \"Secondly, the United States is very selective with whom they'll turn a bind (blind) eye too, versus who they will allow to come in.\" Well, this probably means we simply need to be more fair and less selective. But, this argument is, like the previous one, focusing on illegal immigration which is irrelevant to the topic, birthright citizenship. Arguments 1. The writers of the 14th amendment, if they had known of our situation, would not want birthright citizenship for illegals. If those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment had imagined laws restricting immigration -- and had anticipated huge waves of illegal immigration -- is it reasonable to presume they would have wanted to provide the reward of citizenship to the children of the violators of those laws? Surely not. 2. Birthright citizenship is outdated and came from a period of less immigration. The guarantee of birthright citizenship in the 14th Amendment came in a time when our borders were wide open and international travel was more difficult. When a family came here they usually intended to settle and stay, not have a child to lay a foothold down and put in a word for them. 3. Once again, birthright citizenship is unfair to true legal citizens. What about those who waited in lines and worked hard and studied hard to learn U.S. history and pass the test to become a real citizen? Birthright citizenship is simply a slap in the face to them. The concept of a pair of illegals having a child in the US and having him or her automatically be born as a citizen is absurd and unfair. 4. The illegal behavior of parents should not be awarded. While it is true that denying the child of an illegal immigrant birthright citizenship is harmful to the child, it is also true that giving them birthright citizenship rewards a mother for having willfully broken US law. Such a reward is unjust and unfair, and undermines the US rule of law. So, this is not about punishing children, it is about not rewarding illegal behavior. 5. Birthright citizenship encourages illegal families to have children in the United States. I have already expanded on this in the previous round. 6. A majority of Americans oppose birthright citizenship. Rasmussen took a poll in June of 2010, asking people if they thought children of illegal immigrants should have citizenship. Fifty-eight percent said no and only 33 percent said yes [3]. My opponent has frequently spoken about illegal immigration and not the main subject of birthright citizenship. I would like him to focus more on the matter at hand and the topic I posted, instead of illegal immigration. If you would like to debate illegal immigration, PARADIGM_L0ST, I would be very happy to do so in the future, but not now. I look forward to the next round.

            "premise": "The benefits of illegal immigration do not outweigh the negatives. First of all, illegal immigrant labor will depress American wages and keep the unemployed or underemployed out of the job market (Dann). Even with wage laws negotiated by unions, granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship will simply make it more difficult for American citizens to find work and support their families. Proponents of amnesty argue that illegals take care of the dirty manual labor that \"Americans wouldn't do,\" but this absurd assumption is false. There is no job that would not be filled by American citizens if all the illegals in this country disappeared (Hawkins). Even if the \"jobs Americans wouldn't do\" statement were true, unskilled workers eventually become a burden on society. When they become too old to perform the hard menial labor for which they were hired, the cost of taking care of them will greatly exceed what we pay in taxes (Hawkins). Greedy business owners want to maximize their profits and minimize spending. Therefore, they hire illegal immigrants over American citizens because they do not have to pay them what the job is worth.

            "premise": "The benefits of illegal immigration do not outweigh the negatives. First of all, illegal immigrant labor will depress American wages and keep the unemployed or underemployed out of the job market (Dann). Even with wage laws negotiated by unions, granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship will simply make it more difficult for American citizens to find work and support their families. Proponents of amnesty argue that illegals take care of the dirty manual labor that \"Americans wouldn't do,\" but this absurd assumption is false. There is no job that would not be filled by American citizens if all the illegals in this country disappeared (Hawkins). Even if the \"jobs Americans wouldn't do\" statement were true, unskilled workers eventually become a burden on society. When they become too old to perform the hard menial labor for which they were hired, the cost of taking care of them will greatly exceed what we pay in taxes (Hawkins). Greedy business owners want to maximize their profits and minimize spending. Therefore, they hire illegal immigrants over American citizens because they do not have to pay them what the job is worth. These employers exploit the tide of illegal immigration selfishly, and increase the hardships of already struggling Americans.

            "premise": "Hi! I am Lola and I would like to debate that immigration reform should not include a path to citizenship. On to my first contention, illegal immigrants have already broken U.S. Immigration law by crossing the border illegally. Title 8 U.S. Code section 1325 defines crossing illegally as: Any alien who (1) enters or attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers, or (2) eludes examination or inspection by immigration officers, or (3) attempts to enter or obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact. Why should we extend the right of citizenship in our country to a criminal who has willingly broken the law? On to my second contention, the people who crossed the border illegally should not get the benefits of citizenship. Those who entered legally should get the benefits, or at least the status quote. Those who crossed the border illegally should not be rewarded, or at most, get the status quote. They shouldn't\"t get the benefit of citizenship in the US. While rights and dignity for these individuals should not be restricted, the path to citizenship is unfair to those who are legally entering and rewards the illegal behavior that enabled them to be living in the U.S. in the first place. On to my third contention, providing pathways to citizenship, especially new pathways, encourages people to migrate illegally to the United States and makes it easier for more people who earn citizenship through the new path to sponsor those who do not yet have it. More people in the US also means that there will be higher demands on social services and welfare. These increased demands on public services will fall particularly hard on state governments. Costs associated with criminal activity also strain government budgets (pay access). And since most undocumented immigrants already file tax returns there is not likely to be any significant increase in tax revenue. Any potential gains in economic activity are offset by a number of factors. First, as more workers become available wages tend to decline because there are more potential workers to hire, allowing companies to pay any interested worker less. Illegal immigrants reduce the wages of an American citizen by 1.6%, which was $90 billion in 2005. This is particularly true in the agriculture sector. Second, increased immigration arguably contributes to deflation because consumers cutback spending in fear that they will lose their jobs to immigrants. And if the lower wages argument is true, there will be even more deflation due to less money available to spend. Third, a central premise of the economy arguments is that we need to increase immigration because the US has a shortage of skilled workers, but this shortage is not significant . A new study claims that this is a myth that needs to be demolished. And, if necessary, workers could work in international waters \" or simply be allowed to work in the US without becoming citizens! Conclusion: As a conclusion, immigration reform should NOT include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States because they have already broken the law and shouldn't\"t get the benefit of citizenship for it, there is no justice for those who crossed the border legally, and providing pathways to citizenship encourages people to migrate illegally to the United States. So, please give a con ballot. Thank you. :)",

You may say that Georgia has tons of illegals, but I've been there and have seen that you're illegal immigrant problem is on a small scale as opposed to being from Texas and especially West Texas where illegal immigrants are seen everyday, everywhere. I completely agree that everyone should have an opportunity to work and to provide for their family. I also would say that it's a privilege to be an American citizen and not a God-given right. You're idea of legalizing illegal immigrants is immature and very selfish. What do you say to those that have followed our laws and our statutes to try to become a U.S. citizen? In some cases it takes years to become a U.S. citizen and for someone to enter our nation illegally and reap the benefits of our nation is wrong. I'm proud for those that work their hardest to become a U.S. citizen. They have to learn our culture, customs, and traditions and because of that they know that the American life is a life of integrity, honor, and value. Illegal immigrants enter into our nation to benefit themselves. I believe that to be a \"true\" American you must contribute something to this nation. That's not what they have on their minds. Illegals do not pay taxes. They freeload off of hardworking Americans. When you turn 16 you might understand this. I'm ready to hear your argument about how they do work that Americans won't do.

Immigragte to escape awful conditions at home can be done legally. The U.S. offers asylum and refugee status and will offer immigration visas to \"people who are unable or unwilling to return to their home countries because of persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\" There is no need for illegal immigration to escape persecution. An immigrant does not even wait and they can recieve asylum if they are already in America. These immigrants are fine and SHOULD be allowed into the country. It is the illegal aliens that must be targeted. On the topic of crime rates and the economy, illegal immigrants run a high cost. B. Lindsay Lowell, PhD, director of Policy Studies at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University stated that \"There is a shadow side to the population that needs to be considered. It's real. U.S. immigration policy... has, with a wink and a nod, encouraged the growth of a low-rate sector that is supplied to a large degree by unauthorized workers. And in that regard, perhaps employers and consumers benefit, but as citizens we're abetting the growth of an underprivileged class, and as taxpayers, we are subsidizing employers... 17 percent, according to best estimate, of those in federal prisons are illegal aliens and they run up a substantial cost. This isn't news at all to the states that seek reimbursement. A roughly similar cost is found in federal courts. And payment for the treatment of the uninsured may run as high as $2.2 billion.\" 17% of prison populations may not seem that substantial but compared to only 3% of the American population being comprised of illegal immigrants, that number seems to grow. This shows that many illegal immigrants become exposed to crime. At the same time, the point made that about taxes is also skewed. In fact, illegal household create large net costs to the government. Steven A. Camarota, Ma, PhD, Director of Research at the Center for Immigration Studies has supplied data stating that \"Illegals Create Large Net Costs....When defense spending is not considered, illegal households are estimated to impose costs on the federal treasury of $6,949 a year or 58 percent of what other households received. When defense spending is included, their costs are only 46 percent those of other households. However, they pay only 28 percent as much in taxes as non-illegal households. As a result, the estimated net cost per illegal household was $2,736. Whether one sees this fiscal deficit as resulting from low tax payments or heavy use of services is a matter of perspective. As already discussed, illegal households comprise 3.6 percent of the total population, but...they account for an estimated 0.9 percent of taxes paid and 1.4 percent of costs.\" Clearly, illegal immigration has become a huge problem for the nation. The need to limit immigration is NOT based on racism and prejudice but on hard facts that illegal immigration is hurting our nation. http://immigration.procon.org... http://www.mdcathcon.org...",

            "premise": "Before I begin, your argument was fine. And thank you for posting, I thought you disappeared, ha ha. [1] The counter-argument Con is making that the plan established is incoherent was expected, and is relatively rinsed and repeated by the Right-Wingers. Thus, a generous rebuttal will be supplied to refute the points made:1a) Illegal immigrants coming into the country do not have to remain illegal immigrants. They can always gain citizenship. Barack Obama has become, as previously stated, more of a Social Democratic president and many of his foreign policies let free-flowing immigration occur, which has increased the amount of illegal immigrants significantly. However, the federal benefits in question that would be hypothetically given to \"illegals\" are already being given to \"legal\" immigrants and citizens. Yes, adding a couple thousand or even million more people into the country with these benefits would logically make the government spend more to be able to supply the higher demand for them. But this is a strawmen argument that is found easily debunkable by most: The benefits being given to people more since Obama's election into office are not even scratching the surface of the debt bucket the U.S now owns. In fact it doesn't even hit the top six causes of the U.S's debt. Bush Tax Cuts in 2003 and 2001 were the main source at around that time of deficit, adding an approximation of $1.6 trillion to the already built-up debt. And the other five reasons the economy is so trashy and in the negatives are; health care, medicare, war, economic stimulus [Obama's fault], Great Recession. All of these problems are nowhere near giving people who cross the U.S border \"illegally\" benefits. And the debt ceiling was rising even without that. While yes, it would wildly increase the amount of debt raining in to terrify the administration, it's not the only thing that would, and it has a minimal effect. And the numbers Con has supplied to state so are wildly over the top. [http://theweek.com...] Yes, what Con is saying about it adding to the debt ceiling is logical, but it would have the least impact. Taxes would have to be raised to keep up with the debt that would become added to the already horrible deficit staining the success of the American economy, but it would not add anymore than the current wars being faught in Iraq and Afghanistan are already costing the U.S. Well after reading quite a few articles, it has been retrieved that these numbers were much higher than most expected. Well, the government does have to sell war bonds, raise taxes and still pay for supplies such as food, armaments, water, rations, armour and vehicles that would be given to soldiers fighting on the front, so it is only logical to assume that the amount of money these wars since 9/11 have costed the U.S a lot of money. https://www.nationalpriorities.org... http://costsofwar.org... http://www.globalresearch.ca... 1b) It was described that the State is responsible for rounding up and deporting illegal immigrants back to their home land. Well, this logical does seem sensible. People coming across the borders to come into a country in order to save their lives from the tyrant rule and horrible, unbearable crime rates down south? Undermining the legality of those waiting to get their paperwork done? Hmm..Seems like a problem. Well that is, until it is examined closer. To go back to a point previously used, every American in the U.S with the exception of an extremely small minority (actually just 2%), is an illegal immigrant in one respect or another. European colonists (as mentioned in the first round) did come to the land and pillage it, killing people, raping them and exploiting natural resources and the weak technologies the Natives had to try and fend off the newly self-proclaimed enemy with. So if the U.S really wanted to eliminate the problem of illegal immigration, everyone would be kicked out and the Natives would be left to remake their civilization but now with these better technologies. Yes, this argument is almost viewed as irrelevant now, but all sides of the story must be considered when the word 'immigration' comes up. And again, a driving motive for many illegal immigrants to come to the U.S is to find conditions of better living. At one point, immigration should, yes, be trafficked better so over-population does not become an issue, but it's not the U.S needs to be surrounded by electric fences. And the U.S is nowhere near its maximum population. And on top of that, if illegals going to the U.S eventually found there was no space, there would be one more country they could turn to. A country that gets swept under the rug and labeled irrelevant to most new world events...Canada. Canada has a massive amount of land and an extremely limited national population. So, for what it's worth, immigrants coming to the country could literally be passing through to go to Canada because there is space. Work is more affordable there and in most provinces the weather is reasonable. In fact, just going to Nova Scotia, one could easily find available commercial jobs. The U.S is not the only country to be considered with Western immigrants travelling upwards, be it legal or illegal means of travel. [2] The point that providing illegal immigrants benefits would attract more in more significant numbers is actually quite laughable. Because the exact same thing could be said with normal citizens. Implemented Social systems like Welfare and S.S.I could easily draw more citizens to the programs. So the argument is applicable to even legal citizens, not just illegal immigrants. 2a) Illegal immigrants could become legal if they are given the time. Not everyone can afford to waste time waiting in line for a couple of papers to be stamped and approved of by the federal government and U.S border patrol, so sometimes urgency kicks in, and the people will do whatever they have to do to get across the border. Some empathy is needed here. Illegal immigrants should be given a considerable amount of time to get on their feet, then should be provided paperwork, fill it out, and be able to attain citizenship. And another thing, it was never stated that all illegal immigrants should be given these benefits. It would have to be monitored in the same respect that giving these social benefits to legal citizens works. It would just be different in the aspect of legality, because the citizens would not have citizenship for a certain period of time, because again, it is expensive to move between countries, and desperate times call for desperate measures. It would only be ethical to allow illegal immigrants some space at the table. And economically speaking, it's not the worst thing the U.S has gone through to just simply give some of them benefits, granted they are willing to go through the process. 2b) Illegal immigrants can work just as legals can and that was something considered in round one, but it was not necessarily touched upon to a very hard extent. All that was said was that the unemployment rate dropped below 6% for the first time since recession, and that should be able to speak for itself, because it happened upon immigration being made more a free-flowing thing by President Obama, but there's more to the work ethic these illegals provide that is beneficial to the U.S: Military service. Not only are the immigrants in so much of a hurry that they need to pass through the border unseen and without paperwork, but they are literally willing to die for the U.S, a country that would once turn them away. So going back to the point Con made about it being the federal obligation of the U.S government to deport these immigrants, that is false. Obama and the administration of the Pentagon are both allowing illegal immigrants to enlist in the military. Wars often raise taxes but also make countries richer because of that. Not to say that the U.S should constantly go to war until it's out of debt, but this certainly does help the economy push towards the positives. And the military soldiers would also be leaving the country overseas to fight in the Middle East, and it would not be until they had made it out alive that they would receive benefits such as checking into VA hospitals and checks for their service to the country (which those kinds of benefits have been cut anyways lately, which is unfortunate). http://www.politifact.com... https://news.vice.com... http://www.usatoday.com... [3] All immigrants to the U.S, even illegals, are more than capable of making a contribution to the success of the country. Contributions that legal citizens are no more capable of doing than their illegal counter-parts. Being completely honest, immigrants should not have to prove their worthiness to the 'holier-than-thou' U.S anyways, or any country for that matter. Humans should naturally have the right to free exploration, in which they may travel between countries without having to pay ridiculously expensive amounts of money, or proving their legality or anything of the sort, because it's marginalizing and demonizing. It's about as insulting as being referred to as a number tagged onto your chest in a prison.",

It would still solve the problem at hand: illegal immigrants inability to properly pay taxes. \"your way will do nothing about the ones already here\" What? Mine is the one that specifically deals with those who are currently here, turning them into citizens. While yours just throws them out. \"Yes they have established life but they have done so illegally\" Changing the subject...again. I gave a valid logical argument and you basically said \"Yes,...but they still broke in illegally\" and then started talking about them immigrating illegaly. Politicians do it all the time. I can see through that. It doesn't matter if it was illegal, the point I was making was that Everybody, even the illegal immigrants wins, with my solution. My solution is compromise. Your's is punishment. I will repeat, most homeless people in America are in poverty fro a reasoncompletely unrelated to illegal immigration. You think all of those poor drunkard bums (no, offense, poor drunkard bums) on the street, are suddenly going to get hired because you deported 5% of the people in the US. Of course not. \"there foreign born children would be sent back with them. There american anchor babies should be orphaned and when turn 18 be given the choice of going back to there respective countrys or staying like any dual citizen\" Republicanview, that is horrible. 5%. 5% of the people in the US are the people to whom you would deport. Alot of them have children. That is at least 3 million children you are orphaning. \"the immigrants get to stay but they are being rewarded for there crime.\" Soon afterward: \"I don't want to deport them out of vengeance\" Right...You want to deport them because you're mad at them amd think they \"don't deserve\" it, yet you are not deporting them from vengeance. Right. Guess what, life isn't always fair. Sometimes we have to transcend what someone \"deserves\" and realize what is good for the common welfare. I think everyone \"deserves\" to have a good life. Government is for the good of the people. The people make up the society. The immigrants are deported and thus it hurts the society. Government is there to help society. Sure culture is important, but not in this context. America is supposed to be a MELTING POT, republicanview. We can't suddenly start making it an exclusive club, in which we deport someone because of their culture. That is sick. It is like saying: \"WE don't like the foods you eat or the clothes you wear, so...you're gonna have to leave and start life anew in a country surrounded by poverty\". \"Its the Mexicans culture that made them impoverished\" Don't flip-flop on me, republicanview. It's what you said. I missed that you were only specifying your own town. I don't know anything about your town. In austin, Texas, I know lots of hispanics, I don't know any of them to be illegal immigrants. The only person I have known to be an illegal immigrant was from vietnam. You don't need to convince me that illegal immigration is bad. You continuosly complain about it. You should have maybe made the debate header: \"illegal immigration is harmful\". You didn't though, and we are debating whether we should deport all illegal immigrants.",

I think that all immigrants need to apply for citizen ship for the safety of us all. I am not saying that all illegal immigrants are criminals, or that they are more prone to commit crimes, but we need to do background checks to make sure that no immigrants are criminals who would endanger our society. That is why we have a process of citizenship that people need to complete to become a citizen. Now, I think that all illegal immigrants who have been discovered should be forced to apply for citizen ship. If they have nothing to hide, they will accept, and if they are able they will become a citizen. A large percentage of illegal immigrants in the United States have been living here for an extended period of time and that means that they should have adjusted to our society and would easily pass the test and receive their citizenship.

            "premise": "Citizens are more likely than illegal immigrants to commit crimes, but aliens still contribute to the imperative issue of criminality in America. One is more likely to die from a car accident than from drowning, but does that mean swimming safety should be taken any less seriously? In 2011, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,000 people from this country, the highest number ever, and fifty-five percent of them were convicted criminals (\"Republicans...crimes\"). Therefore, illegal immigrants cannot be granted the rights of citizens because it would only encourage unrestrained immigration and an increase in the crime rate. The threat that amnesty poses to national security should also be considered. The majority of terrorist acts committed in the United States have been perpetrated by people from countries abroad. Granting illegal immigrants amnesty would \"open the flood gates,\" relaxing our immigration policies even further and increasing the risk of terrorism (\"Top Ten Pros and Cons\"). The highly reputable Center for Immigration Studies predicts that, as the requirements for citizenship become easier to obtain, immigrants will create false documents just to obtain green cards or amnesty, heightening the risk of terrorists slipping through the cracks (\"Is it...Illegal Immigrants?\"). The risk that illegal immigrants pose to the safety of American citizens cannot be undermined, and granting them amnesty would only put the country's safety in jeopardy.

We, as a nation, require certain standards to be met before you can become a U.S. citizen. I know that they have it rough in Mexico but they should not come in the United States illegally and reap the benefits of a law-abiding country. What kind of signal are we sending to the world, or to our citizens, when we legalize millions of illegal immigrants? We say, \"Go ahead and break our laws because there are no consequences if you do.\" Let's just tell everyone to do what they want, legal or illegal, because in the end we all need to \"modernize\" and times will change to allow this type of behavior. That's not very logical to me. I say that we begin to deport all of those that have entered into the U.S. illegally. I don't think that we will be able to get rid of them all but we can try. This will send a signal to everyone that wants to become a U.S. citizen that they must follow our laws and must submit to the process that we have in place. I also believe that we need a fence. I don't know any of the logistics, but I would say that it needs to go from the southern tip of Texas all the way to west coast of California. Hiring more Border Patrol agents is also a necessity. I ask you this question, why should we have a Border Patrol if all we are going to do is allow anyone that wants into the U.S. to go ahead and come? Why do we have laws against illegal immigration? Should we allow anyone that wants in to the U.S. to freely enter? I'm not insulting you, I just believe that you do not understand the magnitude of the entire illegal immigration situation. You're solution is to legalize illegal immigrants. That completely goes against what our justice system is all about. Let's just legalize crystal meth because their are people that \"need\" to sell it to provide for their family. Let's legalize murder because some people can't control their actions and we shouldn't punish them because of their lack of self-control. This is a policy of appeasement. It never works.",

Jobs are lost by American-born citizens to the illegal immigrants, since they do not have to be payed minimum wage (because they are not legal in the first place). ac2. The cost to the citizens, taxpayers, and the government to keep them is extravagant and not worth it. No economic benefits are gained from keeping illegal immigrants. (Reasoning right below) #1 57 percent of all households that are led by an immigrant (legal or illegal) are enrolled in at least one welfare program. Taking money (if illegal then without paying taxes) from the government and the taxpayers, for an extended period of time, which could eventually cost more than deportation. #2 According to one study, the cost to U.S. taxpayers of legalizing current illegal immigrants would be approximately 6.3 trillion dollars over the next 50 years. (even more money stolen from taxpayers.) #3 The Obama administration has distributed flyers that tell illegal immigrants that their immigration status will not be checked when they apply for food stamps. #4 The Department of Homeland Security says that it has lost track of a million people that have entered this country but that appear never to have left. #5 One out of every five children living in Los Angeles County has a parent that is in the country illegally. #6 In one recent year, taxpayers in Los Angeles County spent 600 million dollars on welfare for children of illegal immigrants. #7 Thanks to illegal immigration, California\"s overstretched health care system is on the verge of collapse. Dozens of California hospitals and emergency rooms have shut down over the past decade because they could not afford to stay open after being endlessly swamped by illegal immigrants who were simply not able to pay for the services that they were receiving. As a result, the remainder of the health care system in the state of California is now beyond overloaded. This had led to brutally long waits, diverted ambulances and even unnecessary patient deaths. At this point, the state of California now ranks dead last out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people. #8 It has been estimated that U.S. taxpayers spend $12,000,000,000 a year on primary and secondary school education for the children of illegal immigrants. (even more money than deportation) #9 It is estimated that illegal aliens make up approximately 30 percent of the population in federal, state and local prisons and that the total cost of incarcerating them is more than $1.6 billion annually. #10 The federal government actually has a website that teaches immigrants how to sign up for welfare programs once they arrive in the United States. #11 The Obama administration recently introduced the very first \"unmanned\" border station along the Texas-Mexico border. #12 The Obama administration has sued individual states such as Arizona that have tried to crack down on illegal immigration. #13 According to the FBI, there are approximately 1.4 million gang members living in our cities. Illegal immigration has been one of the primary factors that has fueled the growth of these gangs. #14 As I have written about previously, there are only about 200 police officers assigned to Chicago\"s Gang Enforcement Unit to handle the estimated 100,000 gang members living in the city. #15 Mexican drug cartels make approximately 6.6 billion dollars a year\"exporting\" illegal drugs to the United States. #16 It is an open secret that Mexican drug cartels are openly conducting military operations inside the United States. The handful of border patrol agents that we have guarding the border are massively outgunned and outmanned. #17 According to the Justice Department\"s National Drug Intelligence Center, Mexican drug cartels were actively operating in 50 different U.S. cities in 2006. By 2010, that number had skyrocketed to 1,286. #18 Overall, more than 55,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico since 2006. That same level of violence will eventually show up in major U.S. cities unless something dramatic is done about illegal immigration. #19 It is being projected that the Senate immigration bill will bring 33 million more people to the United States over the next decade. http://www.infowars.com... c1. My opponent is obviously speaking only of legal immigrants. Illegal immigrants rarely pay taxes. Should we broadcast a message to the rest of the world that anyone that can find a way to enter this country and somehow get to a \"sanctuary city\" can sign up for a plethora of welfare benefits and live a life of leisure at the expense of hard working American citizens? Yes, those questions sound absurd, but what I have just described will essentially be official U.S. government policy if the immigration bill going through Congress becomes law. And unfortunately, Democrats now say that they have the Republican votes that they need to get \"immigration reform\" through the House of Representatives. If this amnesty bill becomes law, it will encourage even more illegal immigration and it will be one more step toward making the U.S. border essentially meaningless. c2. BoP is still on pro.",

A group or number of immigrants. Rebuttal 1 Immigrant's don't save us or make us more money. We loose money. I have one of 2 reasons. [2] Illegal immigrants generally don\u2019t pay taxes. The vast majority of illegal aliens would never even dream of paying income taxes, but Mexicans living in America send billions upon billions of dollars out of the United States and back to Mexico every single year. [3]Although illegal aliens pay next to nothing in taxes, they have no problem receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of free education benefits, free health care benefits, free housing assistance and free food stamp benefits. Many communities in the United States now openly advertise that they will help illegal aliens with these things. All of the illegal immigrant's don't have to pay for schooling or any type of insurance, including medical insurance. So who pays for this stuff? The state right? How is this any far to people whom were born in the U.S and work very hard and yet still have to pay for all of these basic necessities? Rebuttal 2 It has been proven on many multiple occasions that immigrants steal jobs from hard working U.S citizens. U.S citizens work and train very hard for their jobs, and then they get let go because immigrants are cheaper to pay. [4] Illegal immigrants take jobs away from American citizens. According to a review of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau data, legal and illegal immigrants gained over a million additional jobs between 2008 and 2010 even as millions of American citizens were losing their jobs during that same time period. As you can see, its not just a fib but it's been proven. How is this fair to American families who have been working their butts off their whole entire life and then to get fired over some else because they are cheaper labor? Why Illegal Immigration is bad Impact on the Economy [5] \"If a wealthy person is to hire unskilled laborers, he is more likely to go for illegal immigrants as he can pay them less as compared to what he will have to pay a legal immigrant or a local unskilled laborer. (The latter has to be paid in accordance to the stipulated pay scale.) This, in turn, will not just affect migrants who have entered the nation legally, but also those poor Americans for whom such labor work is the only means of livelihood - and further widen the rich-poor divide. Similarly, skilled professionals also form a significant portion of illegal immigrant population - most of who enter the country legally, but eventually violate visa terms by overstaying and continuing to work here. While many people suggest that even the illegal immigrants pay taxes, they fail to understand that the taxes these aliens pay are not sufficient to offset the cost of services that they avail while staying here illegally. Unabated influx of illegal immigrants also put tremendous pressure of public sector services, such as health care, education, etc.\" This is just like what I have stated in my rebuttal, many Americans loose their job because they get replaced by immigrant's who aren't trained and aren't knowledgble in the field. They are cheap laborer's to the employers. Not only dose illegal immigration cause economic problems, but it also causes danger and harm. [6] The relationship between illegal immigration and crime rate has been making a lot of noise in the United States, with those against the practice often citing that illegal immigrants are responsible for the rising number of crimes in the society. The Secure Communities project initiated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency identified 240,000 illegal immigrants who were convicted for criminal activities. The trend is most obvious in border states of the country, especially the US-Mexico border, wherein smuggling and related violent crimes are rampant. Other crimes which are often associated with illegal immigration include gang wars, identity thefts, rape, financial frauds, etc. Some sources also argue that this practice also gives rise to illegal activities such as prostitution and exploitation of workers as there is no monitoring authority to keep a check on what these illegal immigrants do.Read more at Buzzle: http://www.buzzle.com...; Much violence takes place by borders due to drug smuggling and human trafficking and many more crimes. By allowing more immigration its like we are making it okay for these crimes to be committed, its okay for drug smuggling to take place. Then when there is stuff taking place at the borders, many officers get harmed and hurt trying to protect the border. Then just letting them in makes it all ok? No. Conclusion So not is illegal immigration bad for just the economy by loosing and wasting money , but for the safety of our states and the people. Sources [1] http://dictionary.reference.com...

According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion every year, which amounts to an extra $1,117 per household (\"Illegal Immigration\"American Taxpayer\"). Illegal immigrants do pay taxes, but this only yields $13 billion per year, leaving a net cost of $100 billion that must be made up by law-abiding citizens. (\"Illegal Immigration\"American Taxpayer\"). Illegal immigration is clearly unhealthy for America. In fact, the money spent on education and welfare programs for illegal aliens exceeded the budget deficits of 18 states in 2009 (\"Illegal Immigration\"American Taxpayer\"). If a \"path to citizenship\" were granted, tax revenues from current illegal aliens would certainly increase. However, this yield would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the full welfare benefits to which they would automatically become entitled (\"Illegal Immigration\"American Taxpayer\"). Therefore, illegal immigration should be discouraged so that the U.S. can dig itself out of its fiscal grave and first provide law-abiding citizens with the care they need.

            "premise": "The solution to illegal immigration is not to grant aliens the same rights as United States citizens or immigrants who are here legally. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion every year, which amounts to an extra $1,117 per household (\"Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer\"). Illegal immigrants do pay taxes, but this only yields $13 billion per year, leaving a net cost of $100 billion that must be made up by law-abiding citizens. (\"Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer\"). Illegal immigration is clearly unhealthy for America. In fact, the money spent on education and welfare programs for illegal aliens exceeded the budget deficits of 18 states in 2009 (\"Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer\"). If a \"path to citizenship\" were granted, tax revenues from current illegal aliens would certainly increase. However, this yield would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the full welfare benefits to which they would automatically become entitled (\"Illegal Immigration...American Taxpayer\"). Therefore, illegal immigration should be discouraged so that the U.S. can dig itself out of its fiscal grave and first provide law-abiding citizens with the care they need.

            "premise": "Your first argument points out that most Americans are descendants of immigrants. This is very true. However, it is important to note that even then, many people were turned away. All incoming immigrants, especially the poor and lower classes, were subject to rigorous examinations before they were allowed to become part of American Society. Ellis Island in New York was the gateway for thousands of immigrants and during its peak, could handle 15,000 people a day. Even then, not everyone was admitted into the country. All immigrants were subjected to screening. This screening helped to ensure that those who carried diseases and those who would cause trouble would stay out of the country. Why can this not be done today? Those who enter illegally have not been screened and can be dangerous. THESE ARE NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS, they do not have the same rights. Since it would be impossible to screen all illegals, then they should not be allowed in the country because of the risk they pose to real American citizens. Those who truly want to become Americans for the right reason should seek legal immigration that way all immigrants can be deemed suitable for American society and can mesh well into society without threat. It makes no sense to allow illegal citizens access to America when there is a legal process to do so. If our ancestors could go through the much stricter entrance exams of old, then so can those who want to immigrate today.",

            "premise": "\"I am aware, the studies behind that article refer to both legal and illegal migrants. Also can you show a serous reason to separate the two?\" Illegal immigrants have not immigrated legally, usually don't acquire citizenship, and live in the shadows. If an illegal immigrant gets in a car crash, they will be driving away and you have to pay for it. \"To claim that illegal immigrants don't pay tax is entirely false, most forms of tax are unavoidable.\" Illegal immigrants of some kinds are not used to paying taxes. If they didn't pay taxes in Mexico, will they pay them here? Illegals, as I said, live in the shadows, and pay much less, if any taxes. \"(Gangs and drug cartels) are irrelevant to the immigrants.\" False, if we have open borders (Which we pretty much do right now), they can come across with no consequences and continue their crimes in America. \"the US has a moral obligation to take in citizens from poorer nations.\" Sure, we do have that obligation. And yes, we should accept legal immigrants. However, ILLEGAL immigrants entering the country is unacceptable. They need to go through the process and become legal. Otherwise, you're basically asking for criminals to be in our country. Continuing Arguments: Illegal immigrants generally don't learn English. This means that we have millions of new people who speak Spanish and not English, meaning they cannot communicate with a lot of the population. Illegals (and some legals, but that's beside the point) don't bother learning English. This could lead to American culture being damaged as a whole, since they choose not to assimilate into our culture. Most of my info comes from: Adios, America! by Ann Coulter",

            "conclusion": "Should we deport illegal immigrants? (Not just from Mexico)",
            "premise": "Yes. I believe that we should deport illegal immigrants from the United States. For starters, many of the people that move illegal to the United States are unskilled and illiterate. Some illegal immigrants can also be dangerous criminals escaping from their country of origin to the United States. Though the process for gaining citizenship is rigorous, it should be enforced, as it improves the nation as a whole. Due to their lack of skill, many illegal immigrants are poor and cannot take up jobs to support themselves. In response to this, many are forced to go to food kitchens or use food stamps. The increase of food stamps and the food in food kitchens has resulted in the government raising the taxes of legal immigrants (aka. citizens), and families that have been living in and supporting the country for generations. I am not against immigrants moving to the United States, but they must be able to contribute to society. If we allow people to go around breaking the laws that has held this country together for generations, whats stopping people from breaking other laws. We take a firm stance against murder and other crimes, and we must do the same with our laws on immigration. Many of the immigrants are also children and are unable to contribute to America as a whole. These children must be sent back to the country that they came from. You may say that some immigrants are smart, and just don't have any money. Well, in that case they can apply for citizen ship. My own mother moved here (America) when she was 21, with no money. It took her 16 years to get her citizen ship, but it payed off. We cannot allow those who just come here illegally to stay and bring down our society.",

            "conclusion": "Allowing Illegal Immigrations To Still Get Benefits",
            "premise": "I thank you, con, for accepting my debate challenge and I am glad that we could have this debate just in general. I will now present my argument. [1] Causes of Illegal Immigration: Often time immigrants emigrate to other countries in search of cheap jobs, housing and better living conditions. A prime example would be the reasoning behind increase in immigration from Central to North American between the Cold War and now. Many immigrants the Central American area immigration to the U.S in search of better living conditions away from high-crime, economic inflation and sometimes more oppressive governments. In fact the Cold War was played a major rule in influencing American immigration policies. As imagineable, this was caused by issues preceding the Second World War in which refugees immigrated to the United States to find shelter and conditions more suitable for surivival. The majority of this European immigrants were Jews. To reiterate, illegal immigration is often caused by the need to find more afforable housinng, work and generally better living conditions.So in order to understand why immigrations come to foreign lands whether legally or illegaly, one must first step into the shoes of said immigrant. While stories may vary, it is generally the same concept. As much of the world today is under political pressure. Ukraine and Russia are having their problems, Palestine and Israel, Central America has an incredibly high crime rate in general, in Africa genocides and Civil Wars are still occuring. And here is evidence that such a thing can exist. A young student from a high school in Chelsea, MA in the United States moved from South Sudan in Africa to the U.S to find a better life, and to get a second chance at an education.http://www.wcvb.com...The young man is willing to work hard if he must to get by, and will not fail himself and become homeless.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another part of the argument that comes into play dates back to the time of European countries colonizing other nations. Be it the British, French, Flemish, Portugese and Germans teaming up on the continent of Africa, or the Spanish conquering most of Central and South America, there is no denying that Europe pillaged a lot of land that belonged to foreign ethnicities and civilizations. It is pretty well-known throughout the world today that Europeans did not simple kid the natives of these foreign and newly-explored territories into giving resources and into enslavement, the colonists forcefully invaded their land, raping citizens and enslaving the stronger men. As well as forcing religion, language and general components of European culture down the throats of the native citizens. But the Puritans that emigrated to the unfamiliar U.S territory committed mass genocide against American Indian / Native Americans and were responsible for a massive reduction in the general populace of them.http://historynewsnetwork.org...Another point to touch upon is the American \"holiday\" of Columbus Day. In which American citizens have days off to sit around and do absolutely nothing productive. So who is this Christopher Columbus whose name is tossed around the country quite often? He is a sex slaver, a murderer, a sociopathic imperialist, in accordance to the article found on boingboing.net, which describes it perfectly. But several other articles also support the concept, and the majority of American educatioonal facilities have taught their students at some point or another about the true atrocities Columbus had committed against natives of foreign lands.http://boingboing.net...http://www.danielnpaul.com...Several other sources can be found by reading up on books at the local library or a quick search on Google. Ever since the independence of these once-colonized countries from all around the world, chaos ensued. And that is not because those countries were meant to stay under the control and influence of their owners, but because the governments of the dominant nations never taught the vassalized people how to run an economy, government or how to, at all, be self-sufficient. In fact that was the main issue with European powers releasing African countries in the 1960s, the only successful citizens were the elite collaborators who willingly let the Europeans run their lives and eventually got brought to Europe itself. In the Second World War, many Africans were forcefully drafted into the military under segragated regiments in which they would go to European soil and fight. The Africans were absolutely shocked to see the Europeans being destroyed, as they were always portrayed as perfect and rich to them. [2] Immigrants Work Hard: Many people who advocate against giving benefits to illegal immigrants and who generally fight against letting immigrants flow past the United States' borders will claim that immigrants steal the jobs of citizens already within the U.S border. However, this is untrue. And according to the U.S Bureau of Labour Statistics, American unemployment has gone down to 5.5%, reducing slowly since Barack Obama's attainment of presidency in the elections of 2008. http://www.tradingeconomics.com...Barack Obama is a president who is a major player with foreign policy and a person who can truly understand what most people who immigrant illegally go through in daily life. And ever since Obama's presidency, it is undeniable that the rate of illegal immigrants has increased immensely. But with that there is an unexpected fact; the unemployment rate continues to shrink because the immigrations take the cheap labour jobs, expanding the businesses that employ them, and causes more and more corporations to pop up throughout the country, which are more expansive and are wealthy enough to afford a larger number of employees than the local corner store. But Obama also works with reducing the power and influence of the private sector and tries to help out poorer businesses with getting more of a floodgate for employment.http://www.businessinsider.com...http://www.dpcc.senate.gov...And though President Obama's plans to increase job growth have succeeded, one negative drawback happened as a result of the plans to accomodate the availability of jobs in the country: wages became smaller. With more and more jobs needing to be established and the industry expanding at the rapid rate to satisfy population growth, wages decreased by 23%. http://www.wsj.com...http://www.reuters.com...However, since recession, the unemployment rate in the United States is below 6% for the first time. If immigrants come to the other lands to work and pay taxes, regardless of whether or not their immigration was with or without the legal process, they should be granted the permission to receive benefits.U.S citizens who often complain about employment tend to suck up Social Security and Welfare checks to pay for their food, bills and to support their families (or selves) by other means through the Social Democratic, federally funded programs Obama released to the public in the nature of being a liberal. But in the nature of needing a helping hand because they actually need it, immigrants (both legally and illegally) collectively use more Welfare and social programs than do native citizens. But that is more logical than not. http://cis.org...http://www.itep.org...http://usgovinfo.about.com...http://www.immigrationpolicy.org...Article after article, statistic after statistic, it only becomes more and more evident that immigrants make a very clear contribution to the success of the community of the U.S, and the same principle can most certainly be applied to a majority of other countries in the world. The U.S just happens to be the most common and simple real world example to use because it makes the most sense to use it. American politics often involve foreign policy, unemployment rate and social programs, but this packages all in one.",

            "conclusion": "The United States government should substantially strengthen regulation of immigration to the United",
            "premise": "P1. The debate is whether The United States government should substantially strengthen regulation of immigration to the United States. The issue is immigration in relation to United States citizenship. We participated in a debate for 3 rounds defending our premises on whether the substantial strengthening or not strengthening would explicitly explain a sound argument for pro and con. We are not debating the regulation immigrants or as in individual persons not belonging to the U.S, but rather the system in which declares the individual a citizen and allows them into the country. P2: As stated in premise 1 during the first round, Notario Fraud is one aspect of the immigration system that requires attention and revision. In my argument, the issue is not whether I argue for immigrants to enter or not enter the country. The issue is the substantial regulation, in which I argue, will uphold U.S laws, will minimize waste, and will increase education for those interpreting the law as well as increasing the confidence of immigrants who will have their first time experience with an unfamiliar government and unfamiliar laws. I argue to maintain, regulate and revise this legal process to provide a platform for immigrants who are faced with an adversary government, sometimes in an unfamiliar language. Those who study immigration law should gain legal certification and uphold U.S law as well serving those who wish to become legal citizens; they should be well informed, well educated, and make a conscious effort to provide legal aid for families. Fallacies committed: ad hominem debater (con) questions position instead of responding to the given premises and asks a meaningless question. The debater attempts to argue against (pro) based on an assumed ignorance of the topic for debate. P3: Strengthening the regulation of immigration to the United States does not imply a violent, nagging, persistence. It simply suggests research, a revision in legal language, in which U.S individuals who are properly accredited through federally recognized organization can communicate the proper legal information for individuals who seek citizenship. \"The reason most come to the U.S is because the immigration system is as is.\" This statement is unclear, what aspect of the immigration system assumes more control? Your argument assumes that all immigrants come to the United States for the same reason which weakens this argument. To make such a broad statement as argued by you in Round 1 \"Immigration creates jobs, because a lot of immigrants create their own businesses which allows for some employment opportunities .If the regulation of immigration is increased, this may cause for fewer immigrants to be let in, and for more immigrants to be deported.\" such as \"immigrants\" alludes to begging the question in your premise 3 for round 2. We cannot assume all immigrants create jobs and start businesses. Your argument \"Strengthening the regulation of immigrants TO the U.S. would not allow the \"same platforms for immigrants that we have for American citizens\", because there would be more control over them (who can come in, the conditions they are allowed in under, etc.) does not relate and assumes the same for all immigrants who enter the country. A stronger regulation means a stronger system which prevents fraud and legal consequences for immigrants as well as criminal persecution for actors interpreting the immigrations laws. This argument contains a slippery slope, in which the arguer assumes as a change in procedure, law, or action, will result in adverse consequences such as the control of immigrants. Such regulation does not assume absolute control of the bodies of immigrants. It I don\"t understand how the first sentence of your premise 3 for round 2 relates to the idea that a stronger regulation would deter them. The last sentence again, appeals to consequence in which regulation will ultimately control immigrants and also assumes all immigrants seek citizenship for the same reasons. If we are not regulating and remaining current with the legal language in which we use to interpret the law to citizens the immigration system will become burdened with fraud and create corrupt theories which authorized citizens interpret and communicate with immigrants or potential U.S citizens. By creating a fair platform for immigrants, we decrease the risks of deportation, of criminalization, and can maintain the integrity of the legal system and those who come in contact with it.

            "discussionTitle": "The United States should adopt a more relaxed immigration policy with Mexico.",
            "conclusion": "The United States should adopt a more relaxed immigration policy with Mexico.",
            "premise": "First I will refute my Opponents arguments, and then I will post my own. Relaxed: freed from or lacking in precision or stringency (merriam-webster)A.My Opponent states that Illegal Immigration is good for the economy. While this certainly is debatable, I feel that this point is irrelevant in this debate because the resolution states \"The United States should adopt a more relaxed immigration policy with Mexico.\" meaning that the U.S. should reduce its' restrictions on allowing people to legally immigrate, thus creating more legal immigrants. Therefore this point actually supports the Con side, because if the U.S. was to allow these illegal immigrants to become citizens they would:1) have to be paid at least minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour, significantly more than the $5.00 per hour my opponent cites in his case. 2) if they meet the qualifications, they could qualify for medicaid benefits which cost, on average, $6,860 yearly per beneficiary.[1] 3) if these new immigrants have children and meet the qualifications they will recieve for welfare.4) if these new immigrants lose their jobs they could qualify for unemployment benefits. Therefore, this point actually supports my side because the status quo (keeping these people as illegal immigrants) is less costly than relaxing our policy and making citizens out of these people.B. \"When politicians pass laws that punish employers who hire illegal immigrants not only do they harm the consumer by increasing the cost of production but they harm the economy as a whole by lowering demand for goods.\" - Non-topical. You are saying that illegal immigrants help the economy, as I've already stated, relaxing our immigration policy will make more of these illegals citzens and thus this situation you point out ceases to exist. Instead, since they are all citizens, the cost of production still increases thus this point also supports my side. \"Now, the even funnier thing is that when illegals get here, they will find a way to make money (wether it is working or stealing/drug dealing/etc.).\" The same could be said about a Legal Immigrant as well, or a natrual born citizen. Relaxing our policy does not solve this.\"Anti-immigration labor policies hurt consumers and contribute to higher crime rates, but they don't curtail illegal immigration.\" -Irrelavent, a relaxed immigration policy would create more legal citizens so the implications behind these laws would largely dissappear. C.\"The labor that Mexican immigrants could provide the United States could be invaluable\" -No justification for this claim. Arguably illegal immigration has a positive impact on the United States, but relaxing the immigration policy will make these benefits go away as I've previously stated.\"Border security is even more expensive and does nothing to help the economy -it only consumes resources that could be used to fund more important things like education or our efforts to spread the blessings of liberty and democracy abroad\" - Yes border security is expensive, however the status quo does very much to help the economy as I've already explained. =Case=C1. Relaxing the policy only for Mexico is discriminatory.There is not much to be said here other than to single out Mexicans alone to have greater opprutunities for Citizenship is wrong to the Immigrants from other countries. I wonder what my Opponent would say if I was to claim that immigrants from European countries should be given priority, and have a more relaxed policy than the rest of the world. Singling out Mexico for this is no different. The Heritage Foundation sums it up quite nicely in their article \"Reforming Immigration\"[2] \"How, for instance, could we justify amnesty for illegal Mexican immigrants who have lived here for a number of years, no matter how decent and hardworking most of them undoubtedly are, when millions are on waiting lists for years or decades to join their families from other parts of the world?\" My Opponent must show why Mexico alone deserves to have the policy relaxed in its favor.C2. Legal Immigration hurts the natrual-born lower class more than Illegal Immigration does.My Opponent has already acknowledged in his case that Mexican immigrants, illegal or otherwise, are generally willing to work for less than Natrual-born citizens. He has also acknowledged that they generally have less skills than the average citizen as well. (refer to his point A) This hurts the lower class because they lose their unskilled labor jobs to the immigrants, illegal or otherwise. However Illegal Immigrants get deported at the rate of 350,000 per year[3]. This, combined with the incentives for businesses to hire citizens helps to free up some of these jobs to be filled by our lower class. American jobs ought to go to American workers. Legal Immigrants cannot be deported, and there are no disincentives to hiring them, and as such our natrual-born lower class suffers even more poverty than it is already in.Thank you.

            "premise": "As an born bred American Citizen I believe that allowing illegal immigrants into our country then giving them citizenship just like that is beyond wrong especially for those who are currently do the process right so that they may become a legal citizen of the United States. Now I don't want to hate on the Illegal Immigrants due to the fact that being human we strive to live better lives and most of us knowing that the U.S.A even in it's current condition is still very high on the scale for new opportunities, it's just that people have to want it bad enough, I digress but to my point if illegal immigrants were to enter the country it should be only on one term and that is to work. Now people are like oh those illegal are taking our jobs away but in reality if they were to pay attention in life rather than listen down the grape vine they would know that most illegal immigrants take jobs that most Americans wouldn't such as helping farmers pick food, they also pick up trash, and so on. These jobs are looked upon very unfavorably by the tens of millions of Americans. So to end my opinion, I shall state this, Illegal Immigrants under no circumstances should be allowed sanctuary in a country they do not belong to , only and mean only if they have a working visa and are monitored very closely to where they could not just fit into the populous and just disappear. There shall be tight restrictions to what they may do. As for the illegal immigrants that are currently in the country i feel they need to be found and deported to their home countries and be encouraged to become a U.S. citizen but there shall not be any automatic citizenship. You cannot just be forgiven and be granted something that you haven't earned. Only those that follow the rules shall get access and sometimes they don't even fit the standards.",

It has been documented accoriding to http://immigration.procon.org...; that many illegal immigrants in the US have taken many jobs from US citizens, for example according to the following sources nearly 10% of the US jobs have been taking by the illegal immigrants in the US. This has caused many citizens to lose jobs to cheaper labor forces of the illegal migrants not only in low paying but also some high skilled jobs. Now even if they are jobs no US citizen wants like gardening or cleaning, they still should be available first to the US citizen or legal migrant before they are given to Illegal Immigrants. Illegal immigrants also usually work under the table witch means that the employer doesn't need to provide insurance or retirment plan for the workers which might not be illegal however according to http://employment-law.freeadvice.com...; employers should provide these in order to have legal workers and not illegal ones.",

            "premise": "My partner conceded her point by not responding within the alloted time, although I will continue the debate for her sake and for the sake of possibly reaching someone on this issue. Last round I hit the character limit, here are some final arguements and citations. I have continued arguements, but the limit wold not allow me to add them. \"so really my words aren't going to matter, just like yours isn't.... whats going to happen is going to happen, and there is nothing we can do about it, But I do think people should lay off the hispancs and stop being so jealous...\" We are not jealous, we are enraged. Our money pays for the care of illegal immigrants while they continue to work untaxed. We need to fix the problem of illegal immigrants before it brings the decline of our nation into sight. Yet again, Hispanics are not always illegal immigrants. \"yes they drive new cars, yes their grocery buggies are more full than yours, yes they smile a lot, and they are happy....but it is only because they works their asses off... so if you have a problem with jealous, change your ways if you envy them..... work harder.... BUT FOR GODS SAKE LEAVE THEM ALONE......\" You suggest that people work harder; although the problem is that most citizens cannot afford to live on the wages paid to illegal immigrants (They do not drive new cars or have \"more full grocery buggies\"). Illegal immigrants are hired because their extremely low hourly rage, and undying effort; although they take away American money, causing us problems in the long run. In conclusion, I'd like to state that illegal immigration is a growing problem for America. If America is expected to sustain itself as a leading power in the world illegal immigration must be stopped. Citation (If you provide evidence, could you cite it?): (1)http://www.heritage.org...

(5)James Gilligan, Violence: Reflections on Our Deadliest Epidemic, 2000, p. 195-196, (6)http://www.globalissues.org... Now to my new arguments In hosting America's largest population of illegal immigrants, California bears a huge cost to provide basic human services for this fast growing, low-income segment of its population. A new study from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) examines the costs of education, health care and incarceration of illegal aliens, and concludes that the costs to Californians is $10.5 billion per year. (1) Among the key finding of the report are that the state's already struggling K-12 education system spends approximately $7.7 billion a year to school the children of illegal aliens who now constitute 15 percent of the student body. Another $1.4 billion of the taxpayers' money goes toward providing health care to illegal aliens and their families, the same amount that is spent incarcerating illegal aliens criminals. (1) Few Americans comprehend the various impacts and financial costs of illegal migration into the United States. Like a cancer, it enters the body while proliferating until, at some point, it compromises, then destroys the integrity of surrounding tissue. Illegal \"migration\" encroaches on legal American taxpayers who work honestly within their system. (2) With more than 20 million illegal aliens working and living in the United States today, that malignancy spreads out of control in every state where a sizable population of aliens congregates. (2) According to the well-respected U.S. Center for Immigration Studies (www.cis.org), incarcerated convicted illegal aliens make up 29 percent of federal, state and local prisons at a cost of more than $1.6 billion annually. This number doubles when the costs for apprehension, the justice system, public defenders, interpreters, prosecutors and the courts add to the total.(2) Why we cannot have open borders: Business interests however are short-term. Easy immediate access to labour will always be preferred to the costs of training and capital investment for the longer term. In the nature of economic cycles, yesterday's essential labour can often become, as the defunct factories and mills of Europe have shown, today's unemployed. Employers who demanded immigrant labour are not held to account for this or required to contribute to subsequent costs of their unemployed former workers. Few things are more permanent that temporary worker from a poor country. If business were made responsible for the lifetime costs of their migrant labour in the same way as they must now deal with the lifetime environmental costs of their products, perhaps enthusiasm for labour migration might be moderated and make way for longer-term investment in capital-intensive restructuring. (3) In the end, the measure to start construction on a 700-mile stretch of fence was passed 80-19 (with only Sen. Edward Kennedy abstaining). (4) This is a good first step. This is a problem at home that has gotten out of hand. This free flow of people illegally entering the country is a threat to our security and our resources. (4) Trust me, I've heard all the arguments in the book. \"They do the work Americans won't do\" is my favorite. Have you asked Americans? Do you know they won't do it? Have you given them the chance to do it? (4) Seventy-five percent of the drugs in the United States come from Mexico, while $80 billion is spent annually on the failed war on drugs. Illegal immigrants make up 30 percent of our prisoners, costing us $1.6 billion annually.(4) Households headed by illegal aliens imposed more than $26.3 billion in costs on the federal government in 2002 and paid only $16 billion in taxes, creating a net fiscal deficit of almost $10.4 billion, or $2,700 per illegal household. (5) With nearly two-thirds of illegal aliens lacking a high school degree, the primary reason they create a fiscal deficit is their low education levels and resulting low incomes and tax payments, not their legal status or heavy use of most social services. (5) Many of the costs associated with illegals are due to their American-born children, who are awarded U.S. citizenship at birth. Thus, greater efforts at barring illegals from federal programs will not reduce costs because their citizen children can continue to access them. (5) If illegal aliens were given amnesty and began to pay taxes and use services like households headed by legal immigrants with the same education levels, the estimated annual net fiscal deficit would increase from $2,700 per household to nearly $7,700, for a total net cost of $29 billion.(5) Costs increase dramatically because unskilled immigrants with legal status -- what most illegal aliens would become -- can access government programs, but still tend to make very modest tax payments. (5) Although legalization would increase average tax payments by 77 percent, average costs would rise by 118 percent. (5) I believe that my significant amount of evidence proves that it is moral to deport illegal immigrants, they are a cancer to our society; causing debt where they come, and paying little for their troubles to our economy.

            "conclusion": "There needs to be a tough stance to prevent illegal immigration.",
            "premise": "The only way to stop the problem of illegal immigration is to take a hard-line stance and adopt policies of repatriation. This means that illegal immigrants, after it has been proven through a fair hearing that they have no legitimate reason to stay, will be granted a period of voluntary repatriation, where they receive counselling and help to return to their country. If this does not work, and the illegal immigrant wants to stay, he or she will forced to repatriate. Repatriation is needed because illegal immigrants are residing in a country which is different from their country of origin, without fulfilling the legal requirements to do so. They also do not make the same contributions to the state as other people do, such as paying taxes. This means that illegal immigrants are actively harming the legal system, the citizens of the country and legal immigrants. At the same time, the number of illegal immigrants is rising every year, with an estimated 11.5-12 million illegal immigrants living in the US alone1. These kind of numbers show that the rules on immigration need to come with tough sanctions to ensure that they are not exploited or broken in the future. Repatriation is necessary because it targets successful illegal immigrants and ensures a comprehensive immigration policy that aims to reduce illegal immigration. What this policy of repatriation will do, is that it firstly will reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the country, which will lead to a decline of harms caused by them. Secondly, it will act as a strong deterrence for future immigrants. Repatriation sends a message to potential illegal migrants that their presence in the country will not be tolerated and that any attempt to stay in the country illegally will be unsuccessful. 1\u00a0BBC News, \"BBC guide on illegal immigration in the US\", 2005, accessed 31 August 2011",

            "premise": "My opponent has not offered any rebuttals to my arguements, and nothing but a borderline rascist opening statement to argue off, i'll continue attacking the problems of illegal immigrantion within the United States on my terms. Illegal immigration now makes it extremely diffiuclt for legal immigrants to enter the USA! (1) For centuries not just decades, the Canada/US Border was a friendly place. Canadians wishing to drive over to visit friends, do some shopping, or even spend a few months could do so with relative ease. In fact, as long as you declared your reasons for visiting you could walk across the border! Especially the St.Stephen New Brunswick/Calais,Maine border. (1) Now, to fly from Canada to the USA you need a passport. By September, 2008 you will need a passport to drive over the border; along with your drivers license. Permanent residents of Canada have it even harder. Just two years ago, a permanent resident of Canada could just drive over the US border by showing a drivers license, now they need to show a PR card too. (1) The main reason why illegal immigration is unfair is because illegal aliens are a burden to taxpayers for several reasons. For instance, illegal immigrants are typically entitled to free social services. For example, hospitals and emergency rooms are obligated to treat all patients even if they can not or do not pay for it. Illegal aliens can receive welfare checks and food stamps. Sometimes, governments assist illegal immigrants with job searches and transportation to jobs. The children of illegal immigrants, who are often also illegal immigrants, are entitled to education thus overcrowding schools and decreasing the quality of the education. Furthermore, it is perceived that illegal immigrants do not pay any or as much in taxes compared with legal residents, thus they should not receive free social services. In truth, illegal aliens do pay at least some of the taxes that regular citizens and legal immigrants do pay. The actual statistics and numbers of what is not paid are impossible to calculate. (2) Furthermore, illegal immigrants are attributed with job losses for legal residents especially for lower income jobs. In addition, higher crime rates are also sometimes associated with illegal aliens. Illegal immigration is even unfair to the illegal aliens, since they are politically and economically restricted. And finally if and when illegal immigrants are caught, these illegal aliens could be sent to jail and/or deported from the country, again at a cost to the taxpayers. (2) Here are Ten Reasons Why (3): 1. Illegals working in many industries - not just those who do cleaning jobs - will work for far less than legal citizens, causing unfair competition for businesses that DO obey the law and employ only legal citizens. 2. Illegal immigrants are often paid under the table. This is tax fraud and it costs the U.S. Taxpayer billions each year - billions that are made up for in higher taxes for everyone, including corporate taxes. 3. Illegal immigrants are often not fully trained in U.S. safety standards, and frequently do not understand enough English to read printed safety regulations, causing a hazardous work environment. 4. Legal immigrants and the working poor are often most hurt by illegal immigrants who drive down wages in traditional low-wage jobs, which may cause a spike in increased need for welfare and unemployment benefits. 5. A vast majority of illegal immigrants do not pay any state or Federal income taxes. This has put a strain on local, state and Federal governments and has caused business taxes to rise to help maintain infrastructure such as hospitals, roads and schools. 6. Illegal immigrants are unlikely to report theft, corruption, harassment and abuse by other employees, because they fear being turned into immigration authorities, causing unsafe or illegal practices in your workplace to go unreported. Being unaware of these abuses can significantly increase your legal liability. 7. Illegal immigrants may be deported or otherwise return home at any time. That could cost business owners like you all the time and investment you put into training those workers. 8. A Federal raid on your business by immigration authorities that subsequently discovers illegal employees, and the resulting negative publicity that would cause to you and your business, isn't worth it. 9. Hiring illegal immigrants sends a signal to your employees and customers that you condone cheating and support the exploitation of other human beings. Do you? 10. Obeying Federal laws regarding hiring only legal citizens is the ethical thing to do. Behind many of the nation's millions of undocumented workers are someone else's documents. To get a job, illegal immigrants need a Social Security number, and they often borrow one. As victim Melody Millet is fond of saying, U.S. citizens are being forced to share their identities with undocumented immigrants to give corporate America a steady supply of cheap labor. (4) Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans are right now sharing their identities with immigrants and don't know it. It is the dirty little secret of the immigration issue: By not dealing directly with the undocumented worker situation, the U.S government is actually encouraging identity theft. In fact, one can argue that the origins of the identity theft epidemic can be traced to the immigration issue. (4) The scope of this problem is vast. Every year, nearly 9 million people pay their taxes using the wrong Social Security number. The name used on W-2 tax forms used by employers doesn't match the name on file with the Social Security Administration. There can be many reasons why -- a data entry typo by a human resources department, a woman changes her name after marriage and forgets to report it, or a man uses someone else's SSN to get a job. (4) When it comes to the impact of illegal immigration, terrorism must be at the top of the list due to its potential to directly harm the greatest number of Americans. It is worth noting that three of the four terrorist pilots in the 9/11 attack were in the country illegally. 9/11 was a precursor. The next big incident could be far greater and kill many more Americans. (5) A recent Homeland Security report, A Line in the Sand: Confronting the Threat at the Southwest Border, reports that in 2005 at least 850 people from countries of \"special interest\" were apprehended crossing the southern border. How many more successfully crossed is unknown. How many actual terrorists have crossed is unknown. We do know, however, that they are there - see Al-Qaida Operative Nabbed Near Mexican Border. (5) By the way, \"countries of special interest\" is government-speak for terrorism conducting and sponsoring countries. (5) As can be seen from the aforementioned studies and references, many illegal aliens are not your casual immigration violating, ID theft committing, law breaker. Many are recidivists \u2013 a.k.a. career criminals, like Juan Leonardo Quintero, who was deported after being convicted of indecency with a child, but who later came back and then just recently killed a Houston cop in cold blood, leaving a widow and five now fatherless children. (6) In conclusion, i'd like to state that my many sources (and her lack of) shows that illegal immigration is currently a problem within the United States. Vote for Negative.

            "premise": "OK to open this debate, I would like to start with a quote: \"We've been inundated with criminal activity. It's just - it's been outrageous.\" - Arizona Governor Jan Brewer The said let's start with illegal immigration and criminal activity. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 2011 report, American prisons hold 351,000 illegal immigrants because of crimes that have occurred and criminal aliens actually have an average of seven arrests. This costs the US taxpayers $1.1 billion (http://www.gao.gov...). The United States of America should not take lawbreakers in as citizens and that is exactly what they are doing by being illegal immigrants. Currently, an average of three border patrol guards are attacked everyday along America's southern border with Mexico. The Justice Department has reported that assaults on US border patrol guards has increased 46% (http://cnsnews.com...). Not to mention that Al Qaeda has maybe infiltrating our southern borders already (http://www.washingtontimes.com...). Now not all immigrants are criminals, still we must enforce our laws. We cannot hold all the immigrants of the world. One immigrant, Carlos Montano, an illegal immigrant, was driving drunk in Virginia and killed a 66-year-old nun, Sister Denise Moiser, and wounded two others (http://www.cbsnews.com...). Now let's turn to illegal immigrants in school. First off, illegal immigrant obviously take up space in school for students who should really be there and thus make classrooms bigger. Also, US taxpayers pay $52 billion annually to educate illegals and that was reported by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) (http://www.fairus.org...). Illegal immigrants cause huge financial strains on the government. 70% of Texas' illegal immigrant families are on welfare? That is already to high compared to the too high 39% of native-born American who receive welfare (http://blog.chron.com...). The total cost of for Los Angeles to handle illegal immigrants is $1.6 billion which is not including the $600 million they pay for illegals' education (http://www.foxnews.com...). Also, due to illegal immigration, the nation's average wages have lowered 7.4% for America's 10 million native-born people who do not have a high school diploma (http://www.fairus.org...). So my opponent, if he/she pays taxes as well as the people will be voting should remember that they pay some of that $5.2 billion in education + $1.1 billion crime + the taxes you pay for 70% of illegal immigrants on welfare if you live in Texas + 1.6 billion it pays to handle illegal immigrants if you live in LA County if you live there.",

This clearly shows that not only do ILLEGAL migrants cause a problem. Now even though that many of ILLEGAL immigrants want a better life in the US they should learn more English and be accustomed to the US culture instead of their own in order to truly fit in a become \"American\". However, deporting children may be considered unethical if they end up causing trouble in the end I believe that the 11 million have reason to be deported.",

            "conclusion": "America should support blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants.",
            "premise": "America should not necessarily grant Illegal Immigrants citizenship, however they should be granted the right to all educational and health benefits, and legal rights that American citizens receive. According to the CAIRCO's section on Immigration Issues, since the 1986 amnesty, Congress has passed a total of 7 amnesties for illegal aliens allowing over 6 million total illegal immigrants to be granted blanket amnesty for a variety of reasons (\"Immigration Issues\"). Many illegal immigrants have already been granted a path to citizenship and amnesty, and more opportunities should be made available. For example, President Barack Obama reasons a plan to possibly grant the 12 million illegal immigrants that reside in America Amnesty. President Obama explains, \"'We are not going to ship back 12 million people, we're not going to do it as a practical matter. We would have to take all our law enforcement that we have available and we would have to use it and put people on buses, and rip families apart, and that's not who we are, that's not what America is about. So what I've proposed... is you say we're going to bring these folks out of the shadows. We're going to make them pay a fine, they are going to have to learn English, they are going to have to go to the back of the line...but they will have a pathway to citizenship over the course of 10 years'\" (\"PROPOSED IMMIGRATION REFORM\"). Simply removing illegal immigrants from the country would be much too costly and a waste of time. Individuals would be ripped away from their families and communities and there would also be negative economic consequences from removing millions of hard-working residents from the domestic labor pool. Instead, a proposed path to citizenship is a better solution. Illegal Immigrants offer benefits to the United states in a variety of different ways. For example, Undocumented immigrants contribute to our economy as workers, taxpayers, and consumers, they account for 5 percent of the total U.S. labor force, and at least a quarter of the workers in industries like construction, agriculture, grounds keeping, meat processing, and textile production. All undocumented immigrants pay sales and property taxes, and most pay federal and state income taxes as well, even though they're not eligible for Social Security, Medicare, or the many other programs their tax dollars help fund. Undocumented immigrants also spend billions of dollars each year, which supports our economy and helps create new jobs. The New York Times explains that 'a 2006 study by the Texas State Comptroller estimated that the 1.4 million undocumented immigrants in Texas alone added almost $18 billion to the state's economic output, and more than paid for the $1.2 billion in state services they used by generating $1.6 billion in new state revenues' (Ewing). The contributions of undocumented immigrants would be even greater if they were able to earn legal status. Workers who are not part of an underground economy and don't live in fear of deportation are better able to acquire new job skills and move up the career ladder. That turns into higher wages, more money paid in taxes, and more money to spend to support other businesses. Also, most illegal immigrants are for the most part law-abiding. As I previously explained, there is a greater percentage of citizens who commit crimes than there are illegal immigrants. Immigration is a natural right that is attained at birth. The idea that immigration needs to be authorized by the government goes against that freedom. Immigrants who come to America seeking the opportunity to work and pursue happiness, or those brought here at too young an age to have any say in the matter, ought to be able to stay to pursue those opportunities, thus proving that illegal immigrants should be granted blanket amnesty.

            "premise": "First off, I stated that \"First Round is acceptance.\" That means to just type \"I accept\" and maybe a short sentence on why you accept. That is ok though! I appreciate the enthusiasm and will enjoy debating this topic with you. Just informing you for next time you see a debate that says first round is acceptance. Now. What you said about illegal immigration is what most people think right away when defending illegal immigration. I will give you a list of reasons why making \"refugees\" as you call them, amnesty is completely wrong if you just think about it. First off, I would LOVE to say to all the poor and oppressed in the world \"Come to America and live a better life!\" The sad truth is that we cannot. The more illegal inmigrants that come to the Unites States and obtain a residency by the government keeps the cycle going. If foreign nations see that they can cross our border without getting caught and become a residence ten years later, then this creates a magnet effect. More will come. More will see the opportunity. The United States is a great place to live and that is why so many people are trying to come here. Secondly. This magnet effect will keep millions of immigrants crossing the borders which means millions more to care for, feed, and help. We will need to do all of these things because illegal immigrants who come here are most likely not millionaires. They are poor or oppressed victims. Like I said, I would LOVE TO help all the poor and vulnerable in the world! But if all of the world saw that we just let anyone across our borders, then what stops them from doing the same? We have to stop the cycle. Thirdly. We have legal immigration for a reason! So we can keep new hardworking Americans coming from different countries from all race, ethnicity, and religions. The more different the better! According to http://www.dhs.gov... we had about 500,000 new immigrants come to the United States legally in 2013. This is great. We can keep America diverse and new by letting legal immigrants come. You said \"I honestly see nothing wrong with immigration. They arnt't doing it illegally because there are specific instructions Congress has set up for refugees fleeing their homes. \" This is incorrect. This is what the laws of the United States say about people fleeing their countries to come to the United States: \"Immigrants can be classified as illegal for one of three reasons: entering without authorization or inspection, staying beyond the authorized period after legal entry, or violating the terms of legal entry.[57] Section 1325 in Title 8 of the United States Code, \"Improper entry of alien\", provides for a fine, imprisonment, or both for any noncitizen who:[58]\" This is from wikipedia that cites lines from the United States Constitution and laws. Go to the wiki page to see that they used sources to find this all out. http://en.m.wikipedia.org... It is in the \"Legal Issues\" section. To sum everything up I must say you made a good first attempt, but I need more than just emotional feelings for the poor and oppressed. We all wish we could help the world, but there must be a limit. We cannot care for everyone, that is a simple fact. Legal immigration still continues so there is no need to block down our borders from everyone. After all, we are all immigrants to the United States in the first place.",

            "conclusion": "Birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants",
            "premise": "Thank you for the response. This is the last round so I shall be making my refutations and restating my arguments and telling why I believe that the Opposition has won this debate. Refutations \"He claims that their children do not belong here, but gives no basis for why the 14th Amendment should be repealed.\" This is because my opponent's counter-argument had no relation to the children of illegal immigrants. The argument he presented was simply about illegal immigrants in general, but not the children. I have presented arguments for why the 14th amendment should be repealed and I'm sure my opponent knows that. \"I ask CON how he proposes infants, babies, toddlers, and children apply for citizenship...?\" They don't need citizenship at that age. Illegal immigrants like to have children in the United States because they automatically become legal citizens that can help their parents become citizens quickly. That's a benefit that attracts illegal here to have children. If the law is repealed, then illegal immigrants will not have children here. And if those children want to become American citizens, then they can when the become young adults or even older. \"CON alleges that based on the disproportionate number of births places \"exacerbate the concerns of immigrants that feel they are being put at a disadvantage.\" Here CON does not give any description of the \"concerns\" immigrants would have, and then completely neglects a criticial point in this debate.\" I have constantly stated a point that my opponent seems to ignore and not bother with. Wouldn't an immigrant, who worked hard to wait in the lines and learn about American history, who feels honored to even have the opportunity to become a legal citizen, wouldn't he feel angered that a child of an illegal immigrant, a bad person, could automatically be born as a citizen? These illegal immigrants should not be rewarded with citizenship for their child. That makes little to no sense in any circumstance. As I mentioned in the 2nd round, a Rasmussen poll found that more of the United States is against birthright citizenship for the children of illegals than those who support. Clearly, the true, legal citizens of the US have their own concerns. \"How exactly can newborn infants apply for citizenship? If you don't want to deport them, but also not give them a legal status which they are entitled to under the Constitution of the United States, and they are too young to comprehend what citizneship (citizenship) evens means, what else would you have them do?\" By repealing the birthright citizenship for children of illegal aliens amendment, it deters illegal immigrants from having children here in the first place. That's one of the main reasons why illegals have children here. For the free citizenship. Now, about the child become a legal citizen. A child could not live by himself/herself, meaning there must be an illegal parent in the picture. The parent should then, as an illegal, get citizenship for herself and the child, or pack up and leave or suffer consequences, seeing as they are on our United States soil illegally. \"CON states that had the Framers dealt with our current situation, they would not want citizenship for the offsrping of illegal immigrants. Historically, he is wrong. The Alien and Seditions Act of 1798 [1] made similar arguments until Thomas Jefferson strenusously fought against the unconstitutionality of it, citing the abridging of the 10th Amendment.\" The Alien and Seditions Act had nothing to do with the children of illegal immigrants. The act was about the power and right of the President to be able to deport any resident alien that could be potentially dangerous to the US, the duration of residence required for aliens to become citizens, and that it is a crime to publish false writing against the government and its officials [1]. What similar argument is there? Jefferson argued stating that it violated the 10th Amendment, where power is reserved to the people [2], legal citizens, not illegals. How does this have any relevance in any way? My opponent refutes my argument that birthright citizenship is outdated because back then there was a time of less immigration. He continues to support his refutation with two percentages. One stating that in 1990, the foreign-born population of the US was 8.5%. From 1860 to 1940, it was above 13 percent. Now, percentages can always be deceiving. Just because in 1990 the foreign population was 8.5% doesn't mean that there was fewer immigrants. Population of the United States has risen in the past years. This percent could be and most likely is a larger number of people than the 13% my opponent claimed. I also find it peculiar why my opponent mentioned a 90 year and 70 year spread and compared it to 1 year, 20 years ago. In 2005, just the Hispanic race made up 14.4% of the US population or about 43 million people [3]. Back then, I'm not even sure there WERE that many people in the US. \"Here, CON posits that birthright citizenship is unfair to immigrants who come here legally. I say it is decidely more unfair, not to mention impractical, for infants who did not choose to born in the United States or anywhere else.\" How is it unfair to child, who gets free citizenship? His parents were the ones who illegally and secretly smuggled into the US and had a child! Again, it's unfair to the people who actually worked for their citizenship because they waited, learned, and passed a test. \"I seek clarification for where these children would go, especially since they have a Constitutional right to be citizens who are treated with the same dignity and respect as he enjoys.\" They would return to their family and get true citizenship at an older age when they can care for themselves. \"CON states that a poll indicates that the majority of Americans oppose birthright citizenship. This is an immaterial non-sequitur, and an Argumentum ad Populum [4]. \" I've never known those words and thank you for adding that to my vocabulary. Anyway, isn't this a democratic republic? The people have spoken and they want these birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants ended. What happened to the 10th amendment that Jefferson defended? Don't the people have power? \"But this is simply not true, because everyone who is in the United States, either legally or illegally, is subject to the laws and ordinances of the United States.\" If everyone is subject to the laws of the United States, as you say, then why do we have illegal immigrants, drug smugglers, robbers, troublemakers, and scams? \"Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled, both in 1898 and in 1982, that the 14th amendment should be read inclusively to confer birthright citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.\" Well, that's what we're currently arguing and the topic has been brought up again, so I don't see the argument here. Arguments My opponent has constantly repeated that I have no actual reason to repeal the 14th amendment. I will try to make these points as clear as possible. 1. Birthright citizenship is unfair to the current legal citizens who worked hard for their citizenship. 2. We should not be rewarding the illegals with citizenship for their child. 3. Citizenship is something that should be earned. 4. It encourages illegal parents to have a child in the US. 5. Birthright citizenship is outdated and came from a time of less illegal immigration. For these arguments, CON should win this debate. I congratulate my opponent on good arguments and excellent vocabulary and near perfect spelling. Thank you for a wonderful debate.

You repeatedly state that illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from American citizens, and yet if we were to give illegal immigrants citizenship, then they would be citizens. There are currently an estimated 11,100,000 illegal immigrants residing in America, according to a recent survey taken by The Department of Homeland Security. America doesn't really have any choice but to give these immigrants citizenship; it'd be impossible to send back that many people to their homelands. In order to find and deport every illegal immigrant, the U.S government would need to undergo a massive bureaucratic expansion, in order to hire more workers to find the immigrants. You stated that \"illegal immigrants take up jobs that are for us.\" Employers should be allowed to hire whoever they chose to, and not be forced to hire based upon legal status. Businesses will increase in size the more people that they hire, which will help support America's economy. In conclusion to my argument, America needs to face facts; millions of illegal immigrants currently reside in America, and the vast majority of them are hardworking, taxpaying and law abiding. We should give them complete amnesty and work together to help make America a greater nation.",

Therefore, they help remedy the crippling labor shortages in certain sectors of the economy. Moreover, illegal immigrants provide cheap labor. If we were to deport them, consumer prices would rise and counteract any possible individual benefits coming from a slight drop in unemployment. In short, even though migrants may create many social problems, they are good for our economy and should not be deported unless they commit a serious crime.",

            "premise": "\"1. Your right, the border patrol is specially trained to contain the border. Well one question for you. WHY ISN'T IS WORKING? You seem to be all for the border patrol when really you have no idea that we are at the worst immigration level EVER.\" -The border patrol is not working for two reasons. The first reason is that there are not enough border patrol agents to complete close off the border. The second reason is that it is impossible to stop illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants streaming into this country are not only responding to economic demands, we need them to fill jobs, but are also looking for more political and economic freedom. These people risk their lives crossing the border to have the opportunities American's have and they cannot and will not be deterred by any amount of guarding of the border. \"2. Now what you say about the National Guard and Active Army makes no sense. Okay first the National Guard was made to protect WHAT? I can tell you the answer. AMERICA. If they are made to protect America then that is what they need to do. Also you say the the National Guard and Army cannot take on such a task but your saying that guys who are letting in 3 to 4 million illegals every year will do a better job. I dont understand your arguement. Apparently the so called technology that you say they have is not working.\" -Of course the national guard is trained to protect America, but they are trained to protect it in a very specific way: waging war. The national guard cannot deal with every threat to America. If America is threatened by protectionist trade practices in the EU should the national guard suddenly be involved in international trade relations? Guarding the border is beyond the scope of the national guard's training and ability and so they should not guard it. \"3. Okay here is what gets me. \"Illegal Immigration is good\" What? These people are coming over here and what they do is make a threat of foreign terrorism and yes 1 out of 3 or 4 million can possibly be a terrorist or a criminal. Actually in California there are millions of murders, rapes, burglaries, and robbings that occur by illegal immigrants. If the argument you are going to make is that American do crimes also. Well at least we have records of them and to not be able to find these criminals would be so harmful for our country.\" -Illegal immigrants (specifically those who have crossed the southern border, what this debate is about), at least historically, have not lead to a single act of terrorism. The acts of terrorism that have been carried out on US soil were either committed by US citizens or by immigrants who came here through legal channels. Mostatebears17 is right that the undocumented nature of illegal immigrants is the problem. The solution: give them documents, make them legal. It is terribly impractical if not impossible to stop all illegal immigration into this country and to kick out the 12 million already here illegally. It would be much easier to legalize them all and give them proper documentation. This means they would have track-able arrest records, they would pay the taxes people accuse them of dodging, and would in every way become full, productive, and contributing members of American society. Furthermore, illegal immigrants have arrest records, and they can be \"found\" (whatever that means). When illegal immigrants commit crimes, we arrest them and send them to jail just like American citizens. Mostatebears17 gives no reason why it is uniquely worse for illegal immigrants to commit crimes than citizens or legal immigrants, nor does he prove, or even argue, that illegal immigrants commit more crimes than citizens or legal immigrants. \"5. Now my last arguement just extends all my past points. Illegals are dangerous and they can do harm. I realize that every Illegal Immigrant isnt murderers and robbers but it doesnt matter even if the smallest amount were criminals we have to stop them.\" -He cannot extend his arguments when I refute them and he ignores my second, fifth, and sixth argument. Moreover, it is terribly bad logic to prevent 11.9999 million people in this country because .0001 million are bad eggs. The benefits of illegal immigration vastly outweigh the costs. \"The NATIONAL GUARD AND THE ACTIVE ARMY CAN take care this problem if giving the chance.\" -This is simply not true and mostatebears17 ignores my arguments that disprove this. The army and the national guard are not only not trained to guard the border, they are ignorant of the national and international laws that govern immigrant rights and border crossings. As a result, the army and national guard would not only be terribly ineffective organizations to guard the border but would most likely needlessly shoot, kill, or assault many immigrants trying to cross the border. \"Finally we need to stop this problem or eventually we will be paying all of our Social Security money to pay for the over drought of people while they dont pay income tax.\" -If mostatebears17 thinks that illegal immigrants receive social security benefits or that income taxes fund social security then he has no idea how the organization works. Illegal immigrants have no impact on social security. Furthermore, mostatebears17 advocates stopping all illegal immigration by putting the national guard and army on the border. His primary problems with illegal immigration stem from their undocumented status and its effect on their status on the justice system or tax system. My counter-advocacy is that we should legalize, grant amnesty, to all current illegal immigrants. This would solve his problems becaue they are now documented which means that they pay taxes and can be \"found.\" My counter-advocacy is also a much easier to implement solution to the exact same problems and can fix them better. Finally, mostatebears17 ignores my second, fifth, and sixth arguments. When he concedes that the army is incapable of protecting the border because of its commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, that the national guard is poorly equipped and trained to guard the border, and that illegal immigration is good because it provides immigrants with an opportunity to be free and be economically mobile, he should lose because those three arguments are sufficient to disprove the resolution.",

It's an interesting topic; although I must warn you to be wary of your statements that could be percieved as racist. \"Everyone is always stating, How Illegals are a problem, The only problem is the Mouths it is coming from, if everyone would just mind their own business, and leave Hispancs alone... this would be a better place to live\" That is quite untrue, illegal immigrants increase taxes for Americans contributing to the ever growing American deficit and to American homelessness. Each year, families and individuals pay taxes to the government and receive back a wide variety of services and benefits. A fiscal deficit occurs when the benefits and services received by one group exceed the taxes paid. When such a deficit occurs, other groups must pay for the services and benefits of the group in deficit. Each year, govern-ment is involved in a large-scale transfer of resources between different social groups. (1) Here are statistics on the views of illegal immigrants on different groups (2): Almost all Americans (90 percent) say illegal immigration is a \"very\" serious (60 percent) or \"somewhat\" serious (30 percent) problem for the country today \u2014 essentially unchanged from a year ago this time. Republicans (65 percent) are somewhat more likely than Democrats (58 percent) to say illegal immigration is a \"very\" serious problem, and Americans over age 65 are significantly more likely than those under age 30 to think so (71 percent and 46 percent respectively). How do Americans want to deal with illegal immigrants? Large majorities favor increasing the number of border patrol agents (80 percent) and imposing fines and criminal charges against employers who hire illegals (73 percent). By eight-to-one, Americans think it is unfair to grant rights to illegal immigrants while thousands of people wait each year to come to the United States legally. Fully 86 percent of Republicans think it is unfair, as do 77 percent of Democrats. Immigration reforms (3): There are two camps in immigration reform; the enforcement camp, which worries that illegal immigration threatens the peace of the nation and its laws, and the guest-worker camp, who worry that without these immigrants our prosperity will be at risk. But in reality, the goals of the two camps are complementary, not contradictory: With a legal path to work comes secure borders, and with secure borders comes economic prosperity. To protect America from terrorism, drug trafficking and lawlessness, those in favor of an enforcement-only approach propose massive increases in funding for border control to stop the flow of illegal aliens across the U.S.-Mexico border. It is imperative, they argue, to regain control of the border, and with good reason. In 2005, Customs and Border Patrol stopped 1,189,114 people from illegally crossing the border, including more tha n 200 from Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. There are also an astounding amount of other problems caused by illegal immigrants, here are some statistics (4): Illegal immigrants in America: 21,511,415 OTM (Other than Mexico) illegal immigrants in America: 535,484 Money wired to Mexico since January 2006: $29,657,318,494 Money wired to Latin America since 2001: $262,185,629,117 Cost of Social Services for Illegal Immigrants since 1996: $397,456,108,652 Children of illegal immigrants in public schools: 4,345,861 Cost of children of illegal immigrants in K-12 since 1996: $14,188,462,809 Illegal immigrants incarcerated: 364,263 Cost of incarcerations since 2001: $1,412,188,851 Illegal Immigrant fugitives: 677,987 Anchor Babies (definition below) since 2002: 1,979,211 Skilled jobs taken by illegal immigrants: 10,488,633 An Anchor baby is a baby born of illegal immigrant parents; this is significant because babies born on United States soil are citizens (whether or not they are of illegal descent). If an automatic \"path to citizenship\" (i.e., Amnesty) is offered, government leaders will quickly realize there are significantly more than 10-11 million in the country--in fact, there are more than 20 million. This would also be an offense to the millions of honest immigrants who have become citizens through the established legal process. The opportunity to live and work in America must remain an invited and controlled privilege, not to be gained by backdoor tactics. (4) \"but what is going to end up happening, the illegals are going to be forced to go back, and everyone will wish they were here again.\" I'd like to argue that because of the growing national deficit that it is imperative that we deport illegal immigrants; they are taking jobs and money from the United States economy, leading to an economic decline. This economic decline leads to structural violence (Due to the United States' inability to pay for our basic needs because of a budget deficit caused by illegal immigrants and the Social Security of the Baby Boomers). 18 million deaths a year are caused by structural violence compared with about 100,000 deaths per year from armed conflict. A hypothetical nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R (232 million) cannot begin to compare with structural violence, which continues year after year. In other word, every fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide, perpetrated on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. (5) The threat of illegal immigrants grows bigger the longer it is left untouched (As you suggested), if we were to follow through with your plan we would end up facing poverty and war. \"THEY ARE HARD WORKERS, GREAT PROVIDERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES! MOST WHITE AND BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T SAY THE SAME THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES HISPANICS TAKE THE SLACK FOR WHAT AMERICANS DON'T WANT. 50% OF AMERICANS START SOMETHING THAT 100% OF HIPANICS FINISH\" Although I do agree that Hispanics are hard workers, I would like to inform you that the argument is on illegal immigrants. Although, I must remind you that illegal immigrants have taken nearly 10.5 million skilled jobs from American citizens; are you suggesting that these are unwanted jobs? Your argument on the United States' land previously being part of Mexico is irrelevant. You restate that the United States should discontinue (or never have started) their pursuit of deportation of illegal immigrants in which I must remind you of the massive amounts of debt they cause American citizens which could bring the United States' decline invariably. \"I can't believe that this is happening, but I should because it is only the BIBLE fullfilling, everyone is growing weary, and becoming evil....\" On the above statement, I would like to introduce the amount of foreign aid America gives (much larger than most other countries) (6): The US being the wealthiest, strongest and most influential nation, it is worth seeing how their actions or inaction affect other nations. One notable area is US foreign aid. Being a major part of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and even helping to formulate the United Nations over 50 years ago, their actions can be felt around the world. The following statement is written on other country's foreign aid programs (6): Even though these targets and agendas have been set, year after year almost all rich nations have constantly failed to reach their agreed obligations of the 0.7% target $100 billion. Whoops, i've run out of room! I'll cite in the commentary.",

I wouldn't call the tunnels laughable; though the boarder patrol comes up on them often, many tunnels have been in existence for a long time or were before they were stopped. Increasing boarder patrol is much more important than putting up a fence. 1c. I agree that the boarder is the easiest way to enter, but I also think that a fence is the least effective way of stopping terrorists from entering. It's just a wall that will become exactly like the Berlin wall, doing much more harm than good. 2: I am not debating over Mexico's government, but the relationship between the two nations. It is important as Mexico is directly below us to at least maintain a decent relationship, and a fence WOULD NOT help. 3a. I don't agree with you on what illegal immigrants want. In St. Louis, we have a lot of illegal immigrants and I have met many of them when I worked for a local clinic as a translator and also a Mexican grill; these immigrants struggled to fit in and embraced the English language, however the English language is one of the most difficult to learn and so they were very slow going at it. The belief that illigal immigrants have no interest in melting into the States is exactly what I meant about a boarder increasing negative connotations; while some immigrants may be resistant, the majority are not and try to work with Americans to melt in-- its the Americans that resist them by being prejudice against the Hispanics. 3b. Yes, but I feel the issue is a lacking number of guards who are professionally trained. There are too many vigilantes taking action when it should be the boarder control. 3c. Immigrants sending money home should not be a huge derailment to our society if they are still spending money on themselves in America. 4: I believe the fence would only make a lot of people angry and increase violence at the border. The negativity towards illegal immigrants is entirely in the heads of those who don't understand the reasons people try to come into America and eventually are forced to enter illegally. Immigrants come as a refuge from their countries, to escape poverty, or to be with their families. While I am not advocated illigal immigration, I still hold that the government should revamp its laws about immigration and the people should encourage illegal immigrants to become citizens, rather than refer to them as violent criminals or \"bad\" Hispanics.",

Job creation of course could be helped by making immigration legal. Furthermore this is a deficit we are speaking of here, thus it is a lack of money, and has absolutely nothing to do with my opponent. Or for that matter illegal immigration. Next my opponent states that illegal immigrants steal our welfare. I would like him to prove how illegal immigrants, people who are not citizens of the United States, can possibly apply for welfare. Despite popular belief (?) one does not walk up and simply state, \"I need welfare.\" You actually do have to prove you are a United States citizen which is typically done using a drivers license and social security card or birth certificate. Three items that illegal immigrants generally do not have.... And even if illegal immigrants could be on welfare my opponent is still going to have to respond to my equal opportunity argument. Something which he has not yet done. Finally my opponent states that the crime rate brought by these people must be considered. Unfortunately this has nothing to do with the resolution, if it was true that illegal immigrants had a direct link to criminals then yes it would however this is not true. The fact that a person is an illegal immigrant does not make them a criminal. An illegal immigrant is just as likely to be a criminal as anyone else, therefor we should not persecute illegal immigrants because of this. Instead we need to persecute criminals. Having said all this I can only see how my counter plan still stands in this round and actually helps the economy of the United States.",

However, as long as immigrants are coming into the country illegally, they are not protected by the rights offered by the US Constitution. It benefits them more than anyone. The Fence is simply to enforce a national law, and it does a decent job. Border security is necessary. And to those who day that \"America is a country built by Immigrants\" please remember one thing; all of them were documented. Have you ever heard of Ellis Island? Over 90% of the Immigrants of the 1900's passed through and were documented and medically evaluated. Which brings me to my next point; Disease! Undocumented workers rise bringing disease to the country. It could be something as simple as an influenza outbreak in the community that they move to, or it could become a national epidemic of some unkown and new disease! An immigration fence with tighter border security can reduce these risks by reducing illegal immigration. If Mexico is such a terrible place, then how come the people who want to move here are not willing to take a test and become citizens? (or even documented workers from abroad)?",

The first half of this response will focus on pointing out the flaws in Con's assertion. 1) \"Illegal immigrants are blood sucking from America\". Grammatical mistakes aside, this statement is a metaphor (I hope) and its meaning is null without rigorous explanation. 2) \"They are on welfare\". If the illegal immigrants you are concerned with are primarily Hispanic, then this statement is null and void of argument. According to statisticbrain.com, only 15.7% of all Americans on welfare are Hispanic or Latin@ in origin. Even if every single one of these people was an illegal immigrant (which I'm sure is a gross overestimation), then the ratio of Illegals on Welfare to Citizens on Welfare would be 3 : 17, or nearly six times more Legal American citizens than illegal americans. 3) \"They steal jobs\". Or, they go out and get jobs while the white American citizen feels too entitled to work such terrible jobs. Jobs like construction and janitorial services and waste management are, in fact, terrible jobs! But immigrants are willing to work those terrible jobs, which is why they receive them. 4) \"They kill our white race\". According to statistics released by the FBI, 83% of homicides of white victims, were committed by white offenders. In fact, the percentage of white victims killed by Hispanic or other criminals is less that 3%! This statement is flat out wrong. Now I will argue why I feel illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the US. 1) The US was founded by illegal immigrants. No one ever asked the Native American people for permission to live in North America, and in fact European settlers were responsible for a mass genocide of Native Americans. According to David Stannard, American historian and Professor of American Studies at the University of Hawaii, the European Settlers were responsible for the deaths of over 100 million Native Americans. We are all illegal immigrants. 2) \"Liberty and Justice for All\" does not mean \"Liberty and Justice for native-born American citizens\". 3) American culture will be positively influenced by the mixing of immigrant culture and what we have now. 4) Like I said before, immigrants are willing to work in jobs that entitled American citizens will not. 5) Let me list for you the names of some American immigrants: Wyclef Jean, Albert Einstein, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Aldous Huxley, Bruce Willis, and Bob Marley, to name a few.",

            "premise": "The Wall's Efficiency: 40-60% of illegal immigrants enter the United States through the Mexican border. 400, 000 illegal immigrants are apprehended at the Mexican border annualy, 260, 000 have already been apprehended this year alone (https://www. Cbp. Gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration). Even if most illegal immigrants don't come throught the Mexican border, That's not an argument against building the wall. A wall would still stop the 40-60% from coming in. Analogy: if you have cancer and a broken leg, Do you ignore the broken leg? No, You treat the broken leg first. Just because we have bigger problems doesn't mean we shouldn't solve smaller problems. You can't go through and over a wall. A border wall would have security guards and barbed wire, Which stop such things from happening. The only way to cross the wall would be under it, Through a tunnel. But that's not an argument either! We have walls around prisons, Should we remove walls from prisons because some inmates can build a tunnel under them? No! Most illegal immigrants won't enter through tunnels. Such tunnels would have to start very far from the wall and end very far from the wall, They would be very expensive, Take months at best to build, And would be discovered by the US or Mexican government. Nobody is saying that the wall would stop ALL illegal immigration, But it will stop most. Illegal immigrants commit more crimes than legal immigrants, But slower than US citizens? So what! If legal immigrants commit less crime that illegal immigrants, Shouldn't all illegal immigrants enter as legal immigrants to decrease crime? Shouldn't we build a wall so illegal immigration will drop, And crime as well? It doesn't matter if illegal immigrants commit less crime than US citizens, THEY STILL COMMIT CRIME. Same analogy as before: if you have cancer and a broken leg, Do you ignore the broken leg? A wall will decrease the amount of drugs, Period. You're right: the price of drugs will increase. And that would mean that poor people would do less drugs! Increasing the price up so much would stop people from using a product. In the US, For example, Cigarettes are taxed to make them very expensive, Which stops most people from smoking. Increasing the price of a product decreases the demand. Simple supply/demand economics. Wall Funding: Even Trump's biggest critics estimate the wall at no more than $25 billion. That is a miniscule amount. The annual US budget is 4 trillion. The US army's budget is a whopping 600 million. ICE gets almost 6 billion a year. Heck, Even NASA gets 21 billion! Compared to other government projects and organizations, A wall is almost free. Plus, Building a wall would mean the ICE budget could be significantly reduced! The funding from the wall is a more difficult issue. President Trump has proposed that we use money from the $180 billion trade deficit of Mexico. But like I said before, It doesn't matter where we get the money, The price of the wall is tiny compared to the annual budget. So even if the money came from American taxpayers, Price isn't really a problem. Illegal Immigration: Nobody should be allowed to enter the United States without the government's permission. The US isn't morally obliged to let anyone enter: not illegal immigrants, Not refugees, Not legal immigrants, Only US citizens. Illegal immigrants commit crime and increase the US crime rate. They also steal jobs from US citizens. Illegal immigrants are very poor, So employees can pay them almost nothing and fire US citizens which demand more. Eventually, Most low-level jobs will be taken over by illegal immigrants. US citizens that hold these jobs now will lose them. That doesn't happen because illegal immigrants are better workers or because they do jobs that US citizens won't do: it happens simply because illegal immigrans want less money. The facts don't agree with you. 40-60% of illegal immigration will be stopped by a border wall. Places on the Mexican border with fences have lower illegal immigration. Walls have worked everywhere: in prisons, In foreign countries, Even in your house. Building a wall wouldn't automatically solve the border crisis, But it would decrease it by a lot. A wall is also very cheap to construct. Trump's wall should be built as soon as possible, In order to decrease illegal immigration and solve the current border crisis.",

Immigration to escape awful conditions at home can be done legally. The U.S. offers asylum and refugee status and will offer immigration visas to \"people who are unable or unwilling to return to their home countries because of persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\" There is no need for illegal immigration to escape persecution. An immigrant does not even wait and they can receive asylum if they are already in America. These immigrants are fine and SHOULD be allowed into the country. It is the illegal aliens that must be targeted. On the topic of crime rates and the economy, illegal immigrants run a high cost. B. Lindsay Lowell, PhD, director of Policy Studies at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University stated that \"There is a shadow side to the population that needs to be considered. It's real. U.S. immigration policy... has, with a wink and a nod, encouraged the growth of a low-rate sector that is supplied to a large degree by unauthorized workers. And in that regard, perhaps employers and consumers benefit, but as citizens we're abetting the growth of an underprivileged class, and as taxpayers, we are subsidizing employers... 17 percent, according to best estimate, of those in federal prisons are illegal aliens and they run up a substantial cost. This isn't news at all to the states that seek reimbursement. A roughly similar cost is found in federal courts. And payment for the treatment of the uninsured may run as high as $2.2 billion.\" 17% of prison populations may not seem that substantial but compared to only 3% of the American population being comprised of illegal immigrants, that number seems to grow. This shows that many illegal immigrants become exposed to crime. At the same time, the point made that about taxes is also skewed. In fact, illegal household create large net costs to the government. Steven A. Camarota, Ma, PhD, Director of Research at the Center for Immigration Studies has supplied data stating that \"Illegals Create Large Net Costs....When defense spending is not considered, illegal households are estimated to impose costs on the federal treasury of $6,949 a year or 58 percent of what other households received. When defense spending is included, their costs are only 46 percent those of other households. However, they pay only 28 percent as much in taxes as non-illegal households. As a result, the estimated net cost per illegal household was $2,736. Whether one sees this fiscal deficit as resulting from low tax payments or heavy use of services is a matter of perspective. As already discussed, illegal households comprise 3.6 percent of the total population, but...they account for an estimated 0.9 percent of taxes paid and 1.4 percent of costs.\" Clearly, illegal immigration has become a huge problem for the nation. The need to limit immigration is NOT based on racism and prejudice but on hard facts that illegal immigration is hurting our nation. http://immigration.procon.org...... http://www.mdcathcon.org......",

            "premise": "Question: Should undocumented immigrants already in the United States, be allowed to become U.S. citizens? The answer is no, when illegal aliens come over they can only get small salary jobs at the risk of the U.S. government finding out about their presence. By taking these jobs away from a country whose unemployment rates are already over 7%(Bureau of Labor Statistics), they are stealing what could be a \"bread on the table\" job from hardworking American citizens. Aside from the fact that our jobs are being taken away, the thought of providing them with jobs, welfare, housing assistance, food assistance, and student loans is legally ridiculous. Why would we reward them for coming over illegally and stealing jobs and other resources from legal citizens? Common since dictates that if a person within your authority breaks the law, you don\"t reward them for their actions. This year half a million fewer students nationwide enrolled in colleges, but the number of Latinos enrolled spiked by 447,000, 17% of those students were illegal immigrants from the southern border of the U.S. In 2012 the number of Latinos enrolled was at 3.4 million, an all time high, (NPR.org). By allowing illegals into the country, who are not only stealing government support or low class jobs, they are stealing education from students and taking even higher class jobs from people who are legal American citizens. Our country is funded by taxes. When illegal immigrants come into the picture our country as a whole loses money. Whether it is income tax, or health care our country is losing money for every transaction they make. While it may seem to be a useful way for businesses to save money by hiring unlawful immigrants, in the long run it\"s a practice that is harming our country more than not, as 11% of all lower and middle class workers are illegal aliens (NPR.org), and giving them citizenship would only invite others to take more jobs. When it\"s all said and done rewarding illegals for breaking our laws is counterproductive to our country as jobs are being stolen, colleges are being filled, and taxes are being dodged. To give these people citizenship would only harm the U.S. more then not. When illegals living in the U.S. get citizenship it only invites more people from other countries to come in illegally in hopes for free citizenship. Granting them amnesty may give the U.S a slight economy boom at first, but in the long run will lead to our demise.",

            "premise": "Immigrants should not be given the right to vote, remain within the country or receive the protection of a minimum wage if they are not at the very least naturalized[1] citizens of the country. Pro has argued that immigrants should be granted all three of these rights. An immigrant is \"a person who comes to a country to take up permanent residence.\" [2] Immigrants do not need to be naturalized citizens of the country in which they attempt to take up permanent residence.[3] To the extent that they are not naturalized, immigrants, as non-citizens, are not subject to the same social responsibilities of citizens, including taxation. This results in higher costs to the citizens of the nation being immigrated to. [3] Therefore, illegal immigrants (illegals) act as parasites of sorts, weakening the host society (the host) they invade and harming its citizens (the members) thereby. In addition to the detrimental aspects of illegal immigration, illegals, being non-citizens, have no duty to defend the host nor to support its social institutions. The social contract creating the rights Pro would have extend to the illegals is not only between the individual members of the host, but also between the members and the host itself. The rights and privileges of the host extend to its members because its members accept the responsibility of supporting the host. The illegals have no such covenant with the host, and are therefore rightly excluded from the scope of its protection. As with any contract, without consideration, there is no agreement. [5] Illegals have given nothing up for which the host would owe them an obligation of protection. Therefore, because illegals are engaged in parasitic, rather than symbiotic, balance with the host, the host may rationally exclude them from receiving its protection and desire their removal. Furthermore, illegals, having provided no consideration by which the rights due under the social contract would inure to them, have no claim against the host to provide such consideration under the social contract. Illegals being a subset of the set 'immigrants', my opponent's contention that \"anyone in a country ... should be given a minimum wage, the right to vote and the right to stay in that country\" is proven invalid. The resolution is negated. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://www.merriam-webster.com... [3] http://en.wikipedia.org... [4] http://www.bizjournals.com... [5]http://en.wikipedia.org...",

Not only are they not allowed to unionize, but they are not allowed to get paid. Workplace rights do not need to be strengthened for legal migrants, and they should not be for illegal migrants. Similarly it is impossible for the conditions for illegal migrants to be improved; if they are found they will be deported and so there is no need to improve their conditions, although of course they should be well treated while in the process of deportation. Moreover improving minimum conditions would be counterproductive as they would attract more migrants to immigrate illegally knowing that they will get minimum living conditions that may well be considerably better than those that they had in their home country.\u00a0",

            "premise": "Morally, illegal immigration is wrong and without reason. Immigrants generally bring good values to the country, and it is unfair to arrest millions of immigrants due to an opposition that stems from racism. Most illegal immigrants are law-abiding workers who just wish to live their lives, but there is still a racist belief that they cause crime. Estimations for the percentages of prison populations that are illegally in the country range wildly, yet even if the immigrants did appear to be more likely to commit a crime, an entire group of people cannot be targeted for the actions of a few. This is an invalid reason not to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. Research across the country indicates that there is very little connection between immigrant labor and unemployment rates of American citizens. Undocumented workers provide a cheap source of labor and take American jobs that many native-born Americans would not even want. The cheap labor of immigrants allows products to be sold cheaper, helping the economy. By entering the country, immigrants join the low-cost labor pool that increases American money in circulation and government tax revenue. The immigrants may not be the reason for the strong economy, but they should not be targeted as the scapegoats for any and all problems in the country\"s economy. There is no reason to disallow immigration in this country besides from ideas of Caucasian superiority. Does the United States really have the right to deny them the right to enter the country because they are deemed unworthy of the American label? Immigration is the foundation of America and should be made completely legal for all individuals.",

            "premise": "So far the prop has framed this debate as being one with a massive problem of immigration, and catching and deporting all of the illegal immigrants as a solution, with racial profiling as the method of doing that. Not only is this not going to be effective, but it is not even necessarily desirable to get rid of all the current illegal immigrants in the US. We agree that stopping future illegal immigration is crucial, but this can be achieved through tighter border control and creating a better situation back in Mexico. A better way of dealing with current illegal immigrants is the 'path to citizenship' proposed by Barack Obama [[http://www.economist.com/node/12321563?story_id=12321563]]. The essential idea is that the immigrants would turn themselves in in return for an amnesty and the opportunity to become citizens by paying a fine, learning English and gaining or continuing employment. As so many of the immigrants are already employed, this third issue isn't a problem. It would also create better circumstances for them, allow them to go to the police for protection (reducing their reliance on crime and gangs as an alternative) and also allow them to integrate more with American society. The route to citizenship is also cheaper than having more police and expensive prisons to detain the immigrants. It doesn't matter whether will provide a greater incentive to people wanting to try to immigrate illegally, when the threat of deportation and being shot at the border currently makes no difference. The prop's motion and the route to citizenship are directly conflicting. Racial profiling paints a picture of these people as evil, illegal aliens when really many of them are working hard to sustain themselves, it puts people off turning themselves in, and it is aimed towards detaining these people and eventually removing them from the country. This aim contradicts the aim of allowing them to stay within the country and try to become good American citizens.",

While that money will be used to pay retirees and health-care beneficiaries, it most likely will never be claimed by the illegal immigrants who contributed it, seeing that they do not have Social Security and Medicare benefits (Lantigua, 1). Many people would think that illegal immigrants don't pay any taxes, yet they take money out the the American Government system, but that is not the case. They use the benefits given to them just as everyone else in the country does while paying taxes.

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and hope to enjoy good argumentation. :) Let\u2019s define some key terms relevant in today\u2019s debate and clear up what the resolution ultimately implies. Expansion: the act of becoming larger or more extensive. In the context of the debate, this entails a sense of extending the immigration system to contain more immigrants and further complex facets. Compensate: to provide the means to counteract variation; to neutralize the effect of Increased immigration policies would make up for the growing society. Growing: increase; expand The society is increasing, expanding, changing, evolving, and a solution is needed to neutralize the potential harms from such a change. In essence, the resolution promotes more immigration and policies expanding that immigration within the United States. With that cleared up, let\u2019s move to the heart of the debate. Before delving into arguments too quickly, let us simply explain a) what immigration laws we have b) what purpose these laws serve and c) why immigration even exists.A. What Immigration Laws Do We Have? According to the Immigration Policy Center in 2015, \u201cU.S. immigration law is very complex, and there is much confusion as to how it works. The Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), the body of law governing current immigration policy, provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members. Congress and the President determine a separate number for refugee admissions. Immigration to the United States is based upon the following principles: the reunification of families, admitting immigrants with skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, protecting refugees, and promoting diversity.\u201d [1] Basically, our immigration laws vary due to different circumstances, but as a core ideal, the central law is an annual limit of roughly 675,000 immigrants each year. Take note that the immigrants are all considered legal (the statistics and laws exclude illegal aliens from passage).B. What Purpose Do US Immigration Laws Serve? Immigration laws are in place for many reasons, but primarily to avoid an excessive population without sufficient necessities (including housing, work, medical services, etc.). The Legal Information Institute of Cornell University Law School expands on the purpose by saying, \u201cFederal immigration law determines whether a person is an alien, the rights, duties, and obligations associated with being an alien in the United States, and how aliens gain residence or citizenship within the United States. It also provides the means by which certain aliens can become legally naturalized citizens with full rights of citizenship. Immigration law serves as a gatekeeper for the nation's border, determining who may enter, how long they may stay, and when they must leave.\u201d [2] Accordingly, these laws normatively prevent problems within the country itself.C. Why Does Immigration Even Exist? There are a variety of reasons as to why people immigrate. The Watson Institute for International Studies of Brown University published an article titled \u201cUS Immigration Policy: What Should We Do?\u201d that described a little about this subject: \u201cThe idealism surrounding immigration explains in large part the deep feelings it evokes in the public policy arena. These sentiments have jostled with concerns about the economy, ethnic relations, social services, the environment, and other issues. In recent years, the debate over immigration has expanded to incorporate a broad range of foreign policy issues.\u201d [3] Besides this, there are four age-old reasons explicitly detailing the cause of intentional immigration, particularly to the US. Those are: \u201c1. to be reunited with family 2. to seek a better financial situation 3. to seek freedom and safety and 4. to follow their faith.\u201d [4] With those questions effectively cleared up, I will provide the following contentions to detail why I negate the resolution. C1: Excessive immigration becomes a burden to society. Immigration can be beneficial on a minute scale, but those benefits quickly turn to detriments when expanded. Inefficiency of extensive immigration has been proven over time, expanding the policy include more people, coming illegally, would only result in problematic and perhaps even dangerous circumstances. If illegal immigration stopped now, the numbers would be permissible; however, the problems we see exist because illegal immigration is not stopping, or even slowing down; rather, it is accelerating. According to Peter Ketel of the University of Idaho, \u201cMore than 10 million illegal immigrants live in the United States, and 1,400 more arrive every day.\u201d [5] Refer back to the IPC [1] where they specified that immigration laws restrict access of legal immigrants at 675,000 annually. 1,400 every day calculates to a conservative estimate of 510,000 annually, all illegal. On average, that\u2019s the US increasing in population by 1,185,000 every year. Such an increase is positive to have detrimental effects. Considering the dilemma from a moral standpoint, we still shouldn\u2019t allow illegal immigrants. Manuel Velasquez, professor of business ethics at Santa Clara University explains, \u201cBecause immigrants from less-developed nations are usually willing to work for less than citizens, employers hire the immigrants, pushing wages downward. At the same time, aliens take advantage of government services such as schools and health care. So nations have a moral right to exclude immigrants because they harm citizens by taking away jobs, reducing wages, and draining social services.\u201d [6] Furthermore, illegal immigrants also unintentionally receive benefits that legal residents aren\u2019t granted. Jack Martin and Eric A. Ruark of Federation for American Immigration Reform explain this phenomenon, \u201cMost illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. among those who do, much of the revenues collected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns. many are also claiming tax credits resulting in payments from the U.S. treasury.\u201d [7] Living illegally should not constitute benefits from which regular legal citizens are excluded. Furthermore, complications arise particularly for places already facing problems. Economist John W. Schoen explained for NBC News, \u201cThe recent surge in immigrants is overwhelming the social services of many border counties like yours, especially in states with relatively small budgets where resources are already stretched thin.\u201d Continuing to burden these governments, local or otherwise, with immigration will only result in further detrimental consequences the government and citizens alike. [10] C2: Immigration expansion would foster further illegal immigration. Increasing the amount of immigrants who are granted entrance to our country would only facilitate further illegal immigration, the very problem the increase attempt to fix. Making the system more complex, and adding unnecessary facets to the system would have the opposite of the intended effect. Take, for example, the Visa Waiver Program, a tangent of immigration policies that is intended to be expanded. In short, it is a Visa free pass to allow tourists to come to the United States for a specific allotment of time, and then leave. Abuse of this system occurs regularly, and would only worsen if expanded. U.S. Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, an area closely affected by immigration laws and policies, explains, \u201c[Expanding] the VWP (Visa Waiver Program) facilitates illegal immigration. An estimated 40 percent of illegal immigrants came to the U.S. under the VWP or with temporary visas and simply overstayed their period of lawful admission.\u201d [8] Allowing intended tourists to stay longer than predetermined times encourages illegal action. This shortcut provides a loophole for individuals wishing only to enter the United States illegally. The expansion of these systems in particular prove to once again be detrimental to society, due to the burden illegal immigrants have on society. There is a common saying that \u201cif you give someone an inch, they\u2019ll take a mile.\u201d Granting more immigrants to enter the states, legal or otherwise, is sure to continue by leaps and bounds if not prohibited. Further, this increase harms an already delicate job market. Economist Jan Ting explains this effectively. \u201cwhat is the impact of an executive order adding 5 million or so additional workers to the labor work force in America? How does that affect the job prospects of 9 million unemployed Americans, 2.9 million of whom are considered long-term unemployed, and another 7 million officially recognized as involuntary part-time workers because they want but can't find full-time work, and another 2.2 million who want and are available for work and have looked for work in the past year, including 800,000 designated as discouraged workers who have given up?\u201d [9] In answer to his legitimate question, harms. That is the only possible answer. Adding immigrants will only further the unemployment market. For these reasons, and many more, I ask for a negative ballot in today\u2019s debate.

The Con argues that \"The use of physical... the U.S. illegally.\" Certainly, border patrol stops *some*, but that statistic of 9000 does not include all the immigrants that the system *failed* to stop. As immigrants will always be able to find the chinks in the fence, we should focus inland on law enforcement. 2. Next, the Con states that \"Illegal immigration is estimated... in each state.\" I must agree; illegal immigrants are like citizens in that they utilize government programs. However, if we cease border regulation, that will free up monetary resources to cover immigrant social program costs. Even better, the border patrol personnel could be put to work in the Immigration Service. If they can stop \"9,000 people trying to enter,\" they can file 9000 more immigration applications. Now the immigrants are citizens paying taxes, a true solution compared to funneling them to holes in the fence.",

            "premise": "The number of illegal immigrants attending public schools in the United States has increased significantly. These children of illegal immigrants are able to attend school for free not at the cost of their parents, but at the cost of legal United States taxpayers. In 2008, the Pew Study found that 13.5 percent of k-12 students were children of illegal immigrants. Lance T. Izumi, author of \"Educating Illegal Immigrants Costly\", stated that \"The U.S. Census Bureau just released in 2008 figures showing the national average total per-pupil funding from all revenue sources was $12,028...Therefore, if one multiplies $12,028 by the roughly 3.7 million students with illegal immigrant parents, then one gets a national total funding cost of $44.5 billion\" (Izumi). It is very expensive to educate a pupil in the public school system. Taxpayers' money funds public schools for their children, so any person who is an illegal immigrant and is not paying taxes should not be able to take advantage of the public school system. It is unfair to the citizens of the United States to allow the children of illegal immigrants receive a free education while they are working hard to earn the money that is taken from them by the government to support the school systems. Not only is illegal immigration unfair and costly to taxpayers, it is unfair to those waiting to enter the United States lawfully. Jim DeMint, author of \"The Burden of Amnesty\", states that \"amnesty is unfair to those who came to this country lawfully. More than four million people are waiting to come to the United States legally, but our dysfunctional bureaucracy makes it easier to break the law than to follow it\" (DeMint). By providing amnesty to illegal immigrants, the United States government is not only being unfair to the legal citizens of the nation, but to the people who are waiting to lawfully enter the United States and live in the country legally. Amnesty should not be offered to anyone who is not paying taxes and is living in the United States illegally.",

This is false, because obtaining legal citizenship is a fundamental part of the current U.S. immigration policy. So arguments based on the financial negatives created when we create more impoverished citizens are valid.=Observation=My Opponent has not defined what exactly a relaxed immigration policy means, he has made vague refernces as to weakening our efforts to be rid of Illegal Immigrants, however he has never specifically explained WHAT a relaxed immigration policy means. I contended that it would create more legal immigrants, and my Opponent did not have a counter-definition, therefore in this round a \"relaxed immigration policy\" means that the Government would reduce the restrictions to qualify for citizenship, thus creating more legal immigrants. It is not about only Illegal Immigrants.=Rebuttal=A. \"The point of relaxing or immigration policy is to use the $113 billion dollars that illegal immigrants currently cost tax payers for better purposes.\" -my Opponent should've read my source before he made this claim. The costs illegal immigrants brought to the economy were not from our efforts to fight them, they were the costs of illegals using public institutions such as education, food stamps, criminal justice ect. \"At present, taxpayers are unnecessarily overburdened with the task of keeping out a viable labor source at the expense of the opportunity cost of the prospective economic growth a relaxed immigration policy would yield\" -my Opponent has not shown how much Immigrants help the economy. I have shown their costs. He has not given any evidence for their financial benefits, and even if he did, making illegals into citizens would reduce these benefits. I know my Opponent wanted a philisophical debate, not a source war, and I tried to give him one but there are some things (such as this) that you simply must provide evidence for in order for it to be a valid argument.\"We are not talking about citizenship, or guest workers\" -if we truly weren't, than you should've clarified more as to what a \"more relaxed immigration policy\" actually means. Regardless, I've still shown the negative effects from illegal immigrants.B. The Resolved states \"should\". As the negative, it is my job to show why the United States should NOT do the action called for in the resolution. Therefore my arguments about how this policy could be harmful ARE valid because they must be taken into consideration when deciding to relax the policy or not.C. \"Immigration has a positive impact on the US economy. My opponent has offered no substantive evidence to the contrary.\" -actually, in my rebuttal for your point A, and my C2, I provided evidence for how immigration can harm the economy. Furthermore, as the instigator it is your burden of proof to show how it helps which you have not done. \"Citizenship is not at issue because a relaxed immigration policy would only allow workers to enter the United States, not necessarily obtain citizenship.\" - if a relaxed immigration policy meant only allowing workers to enter the U.S. you should have specified that earlier in the debate. =Reconstruction=C1. \"I would ask my opponent to turn on the news and listen to any news caster or politician describe Mexican immigration. They all oppose it vehemently, championing the cause of border security\"-first of all, they are talking about illegal immigration in general, the only reason Mexico gets more attention is because the largest amount of Illegals come from Mexico. Furthermore, even if the news casters did discriminate, my Opponent has not shown how in the eyes of the law, and the current immigration policy, Meicans are discriminated against. Therefore this is invalid.\"We don't afford the same level of intensity to the canadian border, for sure\" -there is no need for such close scrutiny at the Candian border. The numbers speak for themselves, there are an estimated 65,000-75,000 illegal Candian immigrants in the U.S.[1], as Opposed to 6.5 million illegal Mexican Immigrants.[2]C2. \"Where the cost of production is too high to remain competitive in an open market, companies go elsewhere to cut costs -and then who looses? The entire town.\"-this is an excellent point, and I'm glad my Opponent brought it up. It doesn't apply for these reasons. 1. Legal citizens (which would increase with relaxed policy) are required minimum wage, so the price to produce here would still be higher. 2. When the immigrants take these jobs, the citizens who were already working these jobs suffer just as much as if the job were outsourced 3. the costs brought by illegal immigrants ($113 billion) offset these gains, presuming they exist and 4. many of the jobs taken from citizens by illegals cannot be outsourced. For example, farming jobs, or mining, or oil drilling. Thank you to my Opponent, and vote Con!",

They risk death when traveling the desert to reach the borders. When illegal immigrants cross the border from mexico and other countries, they can face miles and miles of walking through desert, mountains, or nowhere, this risks their lives, and border patrol lives, who have to go out looking for them. 5. Those that successfully cross the border inspire those left behind to do the same. If one illegal immigrant crosses, it is estimated that he invites 5 more: Also the US census think of it a a river dam breaking, once there's a crack-water gushes through and the crack gets bigger until the dam falls. 6. Continued growth of the demand for cheap labor and low wages. Cheap labor may pay off employers-but to the average american who's job was just stolen, this is the opposite of a benefit. 7. No government reimbursement to offset states illegal alien maintenance costs. Self Explanatory 8. Potential negative effects on working and middle-class citizens. Negative effects include: INcrease in crime Increase of drugs Increase of theft Increase of robbery Increase of burgulary Increase of stolen cars Increase in alchohol drinking Increase in tobacco sales 9.

Unauthorized practice is one aspect which I would like to introduce in terms of regulation. \"Notario Fraud\" is a serious issue to the regulation simply because it sets a precedent for the way in which immigrants will interpret the United States laws and in which they first come in contact with United states legal system. P2: Some immigrants that come to the U.S willingly come to the U.S and leave their families to start a better life, as stated. Notario fraud will prevent an individual who wishes to do so if they are misguided by actors and gate keepers of the law. If we accept that immigrant come to the U.S to start a better life, we most also enforce better practices of people who interpret the law, if the United States allows them to engage in such practice. P3: Some immigrants are granted the opportunity to create their own business as well as many American entrepreneurs. There are social programs, and community opportunities that also offer many job opportunities. The important aspect is that we allow the same platform for immigrants that we have for American citizens. If immigrants are misled, misinformed, and become intimidated by the legal system, this can have consequences and effects in which citizens and potential citizens relate to laws and the legal system. Regulation comes in many forms the most important is education; informing immigrants of all of their rights and accesses. we can possibly consider creating more confidential organizations for immigrants in which they can access information.

            "premise": "Before I enter into my argument, I'd like to attempt to clarify the definitions of some of the terms my opponent has used. I assume that the US refers to the federal government, specifically the Department of Homeland Security along with the court system. I also take the drain on the economy to refer to the unpaid use of services such as emergency medical care, which hospitals provide regardless of the patient's immigration status or ability to repay, and to the effects illegal immigration has on the availability of jobs. In regards to the monetary costs caused by illegal immigration, the total cost of unpaid health care in the states of California, Texas and Arizona was reported to be about $2.7 billion in the year 2004 (1). Similar, later studies in Colorado and Minnesota reported their unpaid health care costs to only number in the tens of millions (2), showing that the costs drop off as distance to the Mexican border increases. Assume for a moment that, as a worst case scenario, the total national unpaid health care costs to be about 5 times the figure quoted from those three states ($8.1 billion). Also, for argument's sake, let's say that the population of illegal immigrants in the United States has doubled since then, increasing the total cost to $16.2 billion. This number pales in comparison to the amount of money it would take to repatriate these immigrants instead. The Department of Homeland Security estimated the total illegal immigrant population to be about 10.7 million people in 2009 (3), and the taxpayer cost for one arrest of an illegal immigrant has been estimated to be $2000 (4). To simply arrest every illegal immigrant in the United States, not accounting for the rising costs of such a procedure as the search extends from only those caught crossing the border to all such individuals, would cost $21.4 billion. Instead of simply removing illegal immigrants from the country, to truly save money we should be looking for ways to decrease the cost of the health care they require. An article in USA Today (2) attributes the strain on emergency services to the fear of being arrested if an illegal were to see an ordinary doctor. They instead live with injuries and illnesses until they become critical, vastly increasing the difficulty (and cost) of treating them. A campaign to educate illegal immigrants on preventative health care along with an adjustment of immigration enforcement so as to not target individuals through the health care system would go a long way towards fixing this problem. Concerning the jobs that illegal immigrants occupy, it is entirely possible that many of the positions they fill wouldn't be considered by the American workforce. Douglass Massey, a Sociology professor Princeton University and coauthor of Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Era of Economic Integration contends that a immigrants tend to accept bottom-tier jobs that most Americans wouldn't apply for, since they are unable to apply for those requiring a great deal of education (5). This implies that Americans and illegals don't directly compete for jobs, and to a degree necessitates illegal immigration to keep society functional. Lastly, the contention that the illegal immigrants should be deported because they are illegal does little to support itself. It would be a hard fight to convict a good number of these people of any moral wrong; many of them only enter the United States illegally in order to provide for their families. Instead of rounding them up and sending them packing, we should devote our efforts (and funds) to finding a way to integrate these individuals into our society, as well as a legal solution that better serves us both.

            "premise": "Thank you, Pro. Fair warning: I wrote this at 3am, so expect some incoherency. C1) Incoherent Pro's plan does not make any sense. How is it possible for the *government* to directly hand out benefits to *illegal* immigrants while they're still classified as illegally residing in the US? The government, as the upholder of the law, would be obligated to round up and deport every single illegal immigrant that showed up to its administrative offices to collect benefits. Pro's plan is impossible to implement, and thus it doesn't even warrant consideration. C2) Cost One exhaustive study by the Heritage foundation finds that if all illegal immigrants were to be given amnesty, it would cost the state an additional $106 billion dollars per year [1] due to the discrepancy between how much the now-legal immigrants will pay in taxes and how much money in benefits they eat up. However, the key difference between Pro's plan and amnesty is that under Pro's plan, immigrants remain illegal and thus do not have to pay any taxes; this means that the true cost of providing illegal immigrants with benefits is even higher than $106 billion, perhaps closer to $200 billion. Now further consider the fact that the very act of providing benefits to illegal immigrants attracts even *more* illegal immigrants in even *greater* numbers. America has better work conditions, higher wages, and greater job availability than almost every country in the Western Hemisphere; that itself is already plenty of motivation to try surmounting the obstacles blocking entry into the US. By going even further and paying the illegal immigrants federal benefits, the US would basically become a guaranteed ticket to financial security for the average lower-class Mexican worker. We can look to academic analyses of the effects of amnesty to see that generous immigration policies such as Pro's plan do, indeed, lead to substantial increases in illegal immigration [2]. The point of all this is that providing illegal immigrants benefits, all things taken together, could easily cost close to half a trillion dollars. Considering that the current amount of money spent on such benefits is about $900 billion [1], this is an *enormous* increase in government expenditures, which will inevitably translate to a higher tax burden on the American populace, more federal debt, and funds being diverted from important areas like education to make ends meet. The monetary costs of providing benefits to illegal immigrants would be hugely detrimental. C3) Unjust By giving illegal immigrants governmental benefits, the state is basically rewarding them for breaking the law, and at the considerable expense of all the state's legal residents. In other words, the policy Pro is advocating is completely and utterly unjust -- a travesty against the American population, whose well-being is supposed to be the government's *priority*. For that reason alone, we should reject the policy proposed in the resolution I'll leave it at that for now. The resolution is negated. Back to Pro. [1] http://www.heritage.org...

Also opponent has stated i didnt quite answer his question \"\"if all these illegal immigrants came into the United States legally, would you turn any away, and would you be supportive of them? I answered \"Many of the illegal immigrants that are here in this country did so by legal means example per visa. But those documentations have so expired and are willingly staying in this country illegally and knowingly. So no I do not support them being in this country when there documentations have expired and there now here illegally. To your otger statement of if all of the illegal immigrants were to becone us citizens then they would be able to pay taxes and more revenue for the government. Buf here is the thing majority of the illegal immigrants are below the poverty line. So realistically they would not pay taxes since they don't make enough to pay taxes or if they do pay tax it would be so miniscule that it wouldnt be noticed. Now if you are under the poverty line you wouldn't pay taxes or if you did it would be very small but the government would actually pay you more for refund then you would pay, if you are paying taxes. Depending on how many kids you have, if you have 4 children i think its betwen 10k-12k. Now that they are citizen it is open doors for all newpy us citizen to apply and get all of the welfare programs available to us citizens. This will sky rocket the us debt in order to sustain this level of cost deficiency. As per your statement of being humane. You don't see people giving away all of there assets or money for humane purpose they do what they can but there family comes first. I really dont have to much sympathy for the ones that came here breaking a FEDERAL LAW and ezpevting something back in return. Who i do have sympathy for are the ones trying to do the right thing and come here legally, but now is harder to the that because of the amount of illegals in this coubtry. Same concept us is drowning in debt and society is further crumbling and us is not coming or showing it is trying to climb out of the defecit but bury itself further. Also criminal activities by illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants are roughly 5% of the US population but cause 25% of crimes in the US. That is a staggering data for such a small portion of the US population. So if all illegal immigrants were deported rape, murder, robbery, and general crimes would drop 25%. http://www.citizensforlaws.org... A issue of amnesty is this will put a golden plate in peoples mindset. Is that i have a chance because of amnesty i can become a US citizen. This news will spread around the world and everyone will have the same idea. Come to the US you will be granted citizenship if your here long enough and it may become not 7-20 million but 20-60 million within a decade. Yes we both agree the system is broken. But putting more control over the borders, more patrol in the coast, and a better way to track the legal immigrants in this with deporting all of the illegal immigrants will be taxing in the beginning but as time progresses it will balance itself out. The defecit with social welfare will fall the schooling cost will fall and put more money into school books upgrades and possible teachers salary. That is what in my opinion a logical step. In other countries this is not an issue illegals found are deported back immediately, of uou have a child in some countries and they are under 7 they are not recognized as that countries citizen and deported back to the parents country (most cases its within the first year or at when the mother gave birth at the hospital to verify citizenship, and they are not given any welfare or help from the government. Since 1. They broke a law coming into the country illegally and technically a fugitive. 2. Not a citizen and only citizens of the country will be given priority. Which is why US is first choice they can get all of those for free. Come to US you can get free food free housing a new life government help.",

            "premise": "P1: The topic is The US gov. should substantially strengthen the regulation of immigration to the US. The issue is WHETHER OR NOT the US gov should strengthen the regulation of immigration to the US. The topic I see above doesn't say regulation of immigration in relation to US citizenship. Immigration: \"an act or instance of immigrating\", \"a party of immigrants; broadly : the number of immigrants arriving during a given period\" (http://www.merriam-webster.com... ). Regulation of immigration: directly relates to the regulation of immigrants. So I believe we ARE supposed to be debating the regulation of immigrants as individuals not belonging to the US. P2: I said the debate was about the regulation of immigration to the US. Meaning laws or rules put in place to CONTROL and MANAGE it.Not a fraud that only applies to immigrants who are already here. Again, Premise is unclear. Sentences 3 and 4 have no sources. Sentence 5 is off topic. I am going to state my Premise 2 as such: immigration to the US has no direct negative effect on the wages of the US citizens because it causes no competeitiveness between them. Immigrants often have a different skill set (manual labor), so they seek jobs different from those of US citizens. ( http://www.americanprogress.org...) *Ad hominem: \"when an arguer rejects his or her opponent's conclusion on the basis of some characteristic of that person, typically his or her circumstances, social position, history, or personal associations.\" ( chapter 5 of the critical thinking textbook) I never rejected your conclusion, i rejected your premises, not based on your personality, but based on the fact they they did not support your conclusion. Perhaps you should re-read your textbook. P3: \"The reason most come to the U.S is because the immigration system is as is.\" I believe i said most not all. Since you want to go back to my round one premises, maybe you should also look at the sources I've provided which allowed me to make such a broad statement. Begging the question means that my conclusion isn't stated and has to be assumed from the premises. I don't believe that happened either. Again, I didn't say all. \" the arguer assumes as a change in procedure, law, or action, will result in adverse consequences such as the control of immigrants.\" That's my position as Con. This regulation will not assume \"absolute control\" of the immigrants bodies (never said that either), however a stronger regulation on immigration will lead to them not entering the US (as stated before). It's control, but it isn't absolute. As for the 1st sentence in premise 3 for my round 2 being a deterrent, If someone who is from another country knows that the US has stronger rules in regards to immigration and becoming a citizen (which you are arguing), they would be less likely to migrate here. \"If we are not regulating and remaining current with the legal language in which we use to interpret the law to citizens the immigration system will become burdened with fraud and create corrupt theories which authorized citizens interpret and communicate with immigrants or potential U.S citizens.\" (PRO), my argument is not to stop regulation, it's against INCREASING IT. (the rest of this argument doesn't pertain to topic). C: The US Government should not substantially strengthen regulation of immigration to the US.",

            "conclusion": "Birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants",
            "premise": "==== COUNTER-POINTS ==== P1. My opponent has clarified his position more clearly in this round. The crux of his argument is that he would like to focus specifically on the children of illegal immigrants versus illegal immigrants themselves. I will attempt to argue against that position, but it must be noted that CON places the cart before the horse, as we have a chicken/egg problem (which came first, the illegal alien or their offspring?) If my opponent says that the progeny of illegal aliens are also illegal aliens, then what exactly is the difference? \"I argue that these people are not American citizens and they realize it. They do not deserve to live in our extremely tolerant land when they themselves are not true citizens\" CON gives a self-refuting proposition when he asserts that illegal immigrants do not deserve to live in our tolerant land by citing just how intolerant he would like America to be. He claims that their children do not belong here, but gives no basis for why the 14th Amendment should be repealed. P2. \"So what's so problematic with legal children citizens of illegal immigrants becoming illegal citizens? All they need to do is become legal citizens, which is what true immigrants to the United States and other countries do.\" Remember what my opponent clarified at the beginning of Round 2. He has stated that his focus is with the children of illegal immigrants, rather than the all-encompassing debate over illegal immigration. In lieu of his clarification, in tandem with his recent question, I ask CON how he proposes infants, babies, toddlers, and children apply for citizenship...? The bottom line is that the 14th Amendment states that people born in the United States are therefore citizens of the United States. Since no actual basis for repealing has thus far been given, it is imperative that CON give a detailed analysis for WHY it should be repealed. Anything less, in my estimation, is grounds for forfeiture. P3. CON alleges that based on the disproportionate number of births places \"exacerbate the concerns of immigrants that feel they are being put at a disadvantage.\" Here CON does not give any description of the \"concerns\" immigrants would have, and then completely neglects a criticial point in this debate. Those born in the United States ARE citizens, and so he ironically (and quite possibly, hypocritically) places the concern of immigrants over citizens of the United States. He forgets that people born in the United States ARE citizens and does not address why it is supposedly such a bad thing. And so, as we can see, CON still neglects to give an actual reason for repealing the 14th Amendment. Secondly, who is disproportionate? I already cited a statistic that show 8% of all births in the US are attributed to illegal aliens. P4. \"We are not \"getting rid\" of or deporting the people who have birthright citizenship, but simply forcing them to obtain true citizenship instead of automatic citizenship of no charge.\" Again, CON brings up the clear distinction between illegal immigrants (adults who cross the borders illegally) with their children. How exactly can newborn infants apply for citizenship? If you don't want to deport them, but also not give them a legal status which they are entitled to under the Constitution of the United States, and they are too young to comprehend what citizneship evens means, what else would you have them do? ==== REFUTING ARGUMENTS ==== P1. CON states that had the Framers dealt with our current situation, they would not want citizenship for the offsrping of illegal immigrants. Historically, he is wrong. The Alien and Seditions Act of 1798 [1] made similar arguments until Thomas Jefferson strenusously fought against the unconstitutionality of it, citing the abridging of the 10th Amendment. [2] It wasn't until later, during the ratification of the 14th Amendment, that a more comprehensive and clear amendment be made. That immigration debates have been a long part of American history is irrefutable, which means that the basis for the 14th Amendment has been given considerable thought. P2. CON argues that \"birthright citizenship\" is outdated during a time of less immigration. This is simply not true. Per capita and percentage-wise, there was far more immigration in the past than there is currently. According to the Washington-based thinktank, the CATO Institute, the foreign-born population of the United States is 8.5 percent of the total population (as of 1990). The proportions in the United States during the period from before 1850 to 1940 were higher--always above 13 percent during the entire period from 1860 to 1930 -- and the proportions since the 1940s were lower. [3] P3. Here, CON posits that birthright citizenship is unfair to immigrants who come here legally. I say it is decidely more unfair, not to mention impractical, for infants who did not choose to born in the United States or anywhere else. Secondly, how exactly it is supposedly \"unfair\" has still not been addressed by my opponent. He continues to mention how it is unfair for infants to be citizens in the country they were born in, but has thus far not offered one iota for why it is so. P4. CON makes the admission that \" While it is true that denying the child of an illegal immigrant birthright citizenship is harmful to the child, it is also true that giving them birthright citizenship rewards a mother for having willfully broken US law.\" So here we see that, even though CON specifically wants to make the argument about birthright citizenship, his argument is geared towards the parents. Well, which is it? Would my opponent like to talk about illegal immigration, or how the 14th Amendment should be repealed? Secondly, on Point 4, CON admits that uprooting infants, who have no choice in where they are born, is harmful to them. Knowing this would be harmful, I seek clarification for where these children would go, especially since they have a Constitutional right to be citizens who are treated with the same dignity and respect as he enjoys. P6. CON states that a poll indicates that the majority of Americans oppose birthright citizenship. This is an immaterial non-sequitur, and an Argumentum ad Populum [4]. It's a logical fallacy geared towards an appeal to majority opinion, in hopes that we will all jump on the bandwagon via peer pressure. ==== ARGUMENTS ==== Some opponents to Birthright Citizenship argue that the Jurisdiction Clause invalidates the children of illegal aliens the legality of citizenship. But this is simply not true, because everyone who is in the United States, either legally or illegally, is subject to the laws and ordinances of the United States. So whether visiting the US, and giving birth while on vacation, or coming here with the intent to better the existence of their children, children born in the United States are in fact legal citizens without exception. Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled, both in 1898 and in 1982, that the 14th amendment should be read inclusively to confer birthright citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. In fact, over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court case of U.S. v. WONG KIM ARK, determined that a man of Chinese descent, but who was born in San Fransisco, was in fact an American -- this decision was rendered even at the height of the anti-Chinese immigration movement. [5] ==== CLOSING ==== My opponent has failed to substantiate or legitimize any reason to overturn in the 14th Amendment, and all of his points have soundly been refuted with logic. I await my opponents reply. ==== SOURCES ==== [1] http://avalon.law.yale.edu... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org... [3] http://www.cato.org... [4] http://philosophy.lander.edu...

These low skill migrants pay few taxes and take a lot of government benefits. For example in the United States each immigrant without a high school diploma costs the US taxpayers $89,000 over their lifetime. Since there are six million illegals without a high school diploma living in the US this adds up to half a trillion dollars. This increases further if they are given an amnesty so are able to claim citizenship and more money and the costs spiral yet further when the cost of educating their children is included with the possible cost rising to $2 trillion.[1]\u00a0Some migrants may be necessary as a country ages, but the state should pick the migrants it wants - if a state wants migrants with skills to work in care homes it should let in those who have those skills or are applying to colleges to learn the relevant\u00a0 skills rather than granting an amnesty to those who are already here regardless of their worth to the economy.

            "conclusion": "We Must Deport Illegal Immigrants From The U.S.A. For 10 Major Reasons",
            "premise": "(1) Over 50% of illegals view themselves as citizens of their country of origin and have no intention of learning English or of assimilating. Some of them have the notion that they are in the U.S.A. in order to take it over with a crude overpopulation scheme called \"reconquista\". Their countries of origin view them as their citizens (soldiers) abroad. Fine. Go back to where you came from because you don't belong in the United States. (2) Illegals broke U.S. laws which is WHY they are called illegal in the first place, yet, they continuously lie about their crime of illegal entry and state that they are \"law abiding\" citizens looking for \"honest\" work. Both of these statements are completely false. (3) Illegals hurt those who choose to immigrate the right way by cutting in line ahead of them. Illegals should be subjected to a class action lawsuit by the people they jump ahead of for U.S. immigration. America loves immigrants and is a nation of immigrants. We do not, however, love criminals. (4) Illegals deplete U.S. social resources intended for the American citizen stock population and they do not reimburse over 90% of the money used to deal with them (which impoverishes the U.S. tax payer). (5) Illegals think that the U.S. is responsible for them and this notion is completely incorrect and childish. America is for Americans first. Just because the illegal's country dropped the ball and is unwilling to provide them with any opportunities is not America's fault. Instead of trying to mooch off of Americans, they need to grow a backbone, return to their own country, and make wherever they came from a better place for themselves and for their children. (6) Illegals LOVE to blame any talk of removing them from the U.S. as an evil, racist scheme to break up immigrant families, but, they refuse to acknowledge the fact that the U.S. did not cause these heart breaking problems for illegals in the first place. Illegals themselves caused this tragic division of their families and the sooner they own up to it, the better. The fact that they refuse to take responsibility for their primary role in their disaster tells me that they are childish, irresponsible, criminal individuals who are quite willing to make innocent American citizens suffer forever for the horrific choices of these illegals. They should leave immediately. \"Then\" their families won't be broken apart, which is what they love to accuse U.S. deportation forces of doing. The longer they stay, the worse the situation becomes for them and especially for their children. If they truly love their children they will leave ASAP because there is no future for either of them here illegally. (7) Whether the U.S. stock population will take certain jobs or not is none of the illegal's business, quite frankly. If the majority of the American people (also known as THE LAW) did not invite you into this country to dig a ditch, stay out of this country. Those American businesses illegally utilizing your services to depress U.S. wages and break the law will be dealt with also. (8) The countries of illegals should pay for all of their expenses while illegals are squatting in the U.S.A. since illegals are NOT American citizens. U.S. taxpayers should not have to pay one cent for the expenses of illegals. This includes hospitals, schools, and any other social benefits. Since their countries of origin will not foot the bill for these expenses that have been passed on unfairly to the American taxpayer, illegals should be deported ASAP. (9) Making the decision to give illegals a pathway to citizenship/amnesty will only encourage more criminality... It will only encourage more illegals to flood into our country so, the answer to illegal immigration is not to reward it, but, to follow and to enforce the laws of the land by summarily deporting these law breakers. (10) Open, unenforced borders put the American people at a heightened security risk and make them prone to victimization by violent, criminal illegals. It's simply not worth it.",

So illegals are rebuilding New Orleans if you where not here someone would rebuild it and that someone would be Americans. If we let everyone come to America there may be a few more jobs but because most of the immigrants will be poor theses jobs will be very low paying. There will be an increase crime, cities will become over crowded and our infrastructure will become overwhelmed and fail. Illegal immigrants might not come hear to hurt people but the numbers do not lie and it seems like many do and just by being in America illegally you are hurting Americans. By being here illegally you are putting a strain on our infrastructure with out paying for it. This then causes taxes to rise in order to cover the cost of paying for your use of government services and just the use of our infastructor.

            "premise": "My opponent seems to have switched to another account.For educational purposes, I negate.C1: Birthright Citizenship encourages illegal immigrationGiving instant citizenship to kids of illegals provides several incentives to migrate illegally.A. DeportationHaving a child citizen means the illegal parents are less likely to be deported (1). In addition to being an incentive, this is a violation of justice. Immgrants become less likely to be punished for breaking the law, for something as arbitrary as having a kid. If someone comes here against US laws, they should be punished and deported back to where they came from. They shouldn't be able to use a baby as a cop-out.B. AnchoringThe term \"anchor baby\" was coined when immigrants would come here illegally, have kids, and when those kids grew up, the parents could be in the US at any time despite being illegal. That is possible due to birthright citizenship. By having a baby in the US and it gaining citizenship, illegals become legal despite breaking laws. Also, the parents will be allowed in the US even if the immigration quota (# of immigrants allowed annually) is full. So if a Mexican wants to come here, but she can't because we've already had 90,000 Mexicans come here this year, she uses birthright citizenship as an incentive to come illegally, to bypass the quota. C. WelfareIn Darces v. Woods, the Supreme Court ruled that illegal alien parents are entitled to US welfare if they have an American citizen child (2). So they can come illegally, but still get food stamps and Medicaid? I dont think so. You have to follow the law to benefit from the law. And remember, birthright citiznship enables this by placing immigrant children within the criteria for welfare qualification.D. Empirically provenIts not just theoretics. According to the Texas Review of Law and Politics, almost 10% of all births in the US are from illegal immigrant mothers (3). Additionally, \"Many of these mothers frankly admitted that the reason they entered illegally was to give birth to an American citizen.\"E. Illegal immigration badThe Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates that illegal immigration costs Americans 113 billion dollars a year (4). If even one percent of that can be alleviated by abolishihng the Birthright incentive, thats over a billion dollars you're saving through a Con ballot.C2: Misapplication of the lawThe fourteenth amendment is Birthright Citizenship. But it was passed in 1868. This was shortly after the Emancipation Proclomation by Abraham Lincoln, \"freeing\" the slaves. The amendment was passed to expand the freedom of African-Americans, so they would be treated fairly as citizens (4). It was NOT passed so that illegal aliens could use it to come to America against US law. Incentivizing crime is probably not what the framers had in mind when they wrote this amendment. So we see that the Bithright Citizenship clause is being severely misapplied. It is being exploited by foreigners who want to bypass the quota and get free baby food. So because the origin of this law has no backing in regards to the current state of affairs, it would be desirable to repeal it.1. http://illegalillegals.com...2. http://law.justia.com...3. http://www.trolp.org...4. http://www.foxnews.com...5. http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk...",

            "premise": "Illegel immigration is obviously a problem. There are millions of people living and working in the United States illleglly. It hurts American workers, people who want ot enter the country legally, and compromises the security of our country. However, a barrier on the border with Mexico would not fix the problem. I try and put myself in the shoes of the illegal immigrants who somehow made it across the border. Why did they come? They came beccause they can make about twice as much money doing the same jobs they would in Mexico. If they have kids in America they become American citizens (which opens up many doors for them in the future). Along with that, living conditions are better in teh United States. Despite not having insurance, I can go to a hospital and get medical treatment if I need it. Despite not being a citizen (or knowing English) I can also send my child to a much better American school. On top of that, my own government does encourage me to go there to help stimulate our economy. If I am a poor Mexican citizen, there is an enourmous pull factor to the United States and an enourmous push factor out of Mexico. If I were poor, I would try and immigrate as well. After all, my ancestors did it from Germany and Ireland - as did many other people's as well. If a wall was up, it would drastically reduce the number of people who come across. This is true. Operation Gatekeeper was quite successful. That is true. More Border Patrol troops would also help. However, there is a group of people that wants illegal Mexicans to stay - any stay here illegally. Anyone who has a business in which the majority of their workers are illegal immigrants knows that the 12 million immigrants living \"in the shadows\" work for half of the minimum wage. If you own a business and a najority of your workers are illegal immigrants one of two things could happen from immigration reform. A.) amnesty is passed. The illegal immigrants are given citizenship and they now are entitled to 7 dollars an hour. You labor costs just doubled! B.) Any illegal immigrants are sent back home. Your labor pool has just been deported and the only people who can fufill your needs are Americans. Your labor costs have just doubled! Along with that, there are already 12 million illeglal immigrants in the United States. What happens to them? Are they rounded up and shipped back like Operation Wetback? Are they granted amnesty? A wall doesn't fix that. A wall only stops future illegal immigration. Even if, starting tomorrow, no more illegal immigration took place, and a wall was in place, the legitimate problems that have led Americans to call for building a wall would still be present. Somoe sort of effective patrolling of the border is neccessary. It's dangerous for people to just come across the border. There are legitimate security concerns. Along with the untold number of drugs and Mexican gang members that come across the border on a daily basis, terrorists could also come into America through Mexico. But until there are teeth to immigration laws for for illegal immigrants AND business owners the profit motive for Mexican workers and American business owners (especially in the Southwest) will trump any concerns about secure borders, assimilation, drugs, terrorism, etc. and a wall will be a big waste of time and money.

Legal immigrants can benefit this country, but all illegal immigrants are criminals, because they did not legally come into this country, thus should not be rewarded with citizenship.

            "conclusion": "An amnesty would encourage rather than reduce immigration",
            "premise": "An amnesty would simply mean more immigration resulting in new illegal immigrants. First, it would quickly become known that a country is offering an amnesty resulting in a rush to gain entry in time. An increase would continue even after the amnesty because migrants would believe that country would be more likely to grant another amnesty in the future. Second, Once there is an amnesty those who have been granted amnesty and are able to work legally so have gained a measure of security will bring family to live with them. This is exactly what has occurred with previous amnesties. After the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act in the United States which 2.7 million immigrants took advantage of to become legal residents the number of illegal immigrants arriving in the USA rose to 800,000 before falling back down to a more normal level of 500,000 per year.[1]\u00a0Spain has granted numerous amnesties since 1985 as a response to increasing immigration, particularly from South America. There has as a result been an ever increasing number of applications for these amnesties from 43,815 in 1985 to 350,000 in 2001.[2]\u00a0A general amnesty in 2005 that had 700,000 applicants.[3]\u00a0If the result is simply increased immigration an amnesty will have achieved nothing except pushing up immigration; there will still be illegal immigrants, there will be more anger against them, and ultimately there will need to be more deportations or another amnesty.

            "premise": "Regarding the education of the children of illegal immigrants, unless the requirements of becoming a naturalization are rewritten (a topic outside the boundaries of our proposition of expatriating illegal immigrants as they are currently defined), any child born on American soil is guaranteed U.S. citizenship. The immediate expatriation of the parents of such children would have one of two effects: either the family would be split up, as there would be no legal grounds for forcing the child with citizenship to leave the country, and any economic costs their schooling would incur would be unchanged, or the child would return with their families to their country of origin, where in many cases the quality of education is much poorer. We would effectively be denying U.S. citizens access to the public education system on the basis of the actions of their parents. Were expatriation forced, the only way to eliminate these costs would be a gross miscarriage of justice, blaming children for circumstances they cannot control. In regards to community colleges, if we are discussing the U.S. born children of illegal immigrants, such individuals would ostensibly have to pay their taxes and the tuition associated with community colleges if they wished to attend. In the end, the drain they cause on the system is no different from any other citizen (never mind that educating such individuals allows them access to a wider variety of jobs, increasing their overall productive capabilities and having a positive effect on the economy as a whole). In the case of illegal immigrants themselves attending community colleges, the system here in the state of North Carolina has already found a way to take advantage of this. Illegal immigrants can be accepted to community colleges, but at the out of state tuition rate. This additional cost means that the colleges generate a $2000 profit for each illegal student (1). In the end, to immediately expatriate illegal immigrants would cause a loss of future taxes collectable from legitimate U.S. citizens as well as dry up a source of potential revenue for community colleges. In regards to the crimes attributed to illegal immigration, an immediate deportation of all the illegals that DHS could capture would do little to reduce their rates. Drug and arms dealers have demonstrated their ability to operate without being detected by the authorities. A new campaign to remove all illegals would tax already overstressed law enforcement resources that could instead be used to target these criminals specifically, removing a great number of immigrants whose only crime was entering the country at the cost of ignoring many of these hardened criminals. Instead of a mass deportation, we should instead focus on apprehending only these individuals, understanding the weaknesses in our border security they use to transport their goods, and endeavoring to close these gaps.
