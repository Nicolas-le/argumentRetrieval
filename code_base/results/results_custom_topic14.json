While the genitals determine biological sex and biological sex correlates with sexual orientation, biological sex is not the cause of sexual orientation. If sexual orientation was determined at birth, then all identical twins would have the same sexual orientation. However, it is not the case that when one twin is homosexual, the other twin is also homosexual. As has been established by several studies on this matter, not 100% of twins have the same sexual orientation as the other, in fact it varies from as little as 20% of twins sharing the same sexual orientation, to as much as 60% in some studies.[3, pg 271] Source:[1] https://www.logicallyfallacious.com...;[2] https://genepi.qimr.edu.au...;",

            "premise": "I'd like to start by thanking my opponent for accepting this debate. Now onto the argument. Gregory Herek, a UC Davis psychology professor, claimed that 95 percent of the self-identified gay men in a study he conducted, and 80 to 90 percent of the lesbians, believed they had little or no choice in their sexual orientation. [1] Gays and lesbians commonly have heterosexual partners at some point in life - often due to youthful uncertainty and social pressures - but, most people ultimately can define their own sexuality. Another report; delivered by Jerome Goldstein, M.D., a board-certified medical neurologist and Director of the San Francisco Clinical Research Center, states that Sexual orientation is neurobiological and is set at birth. [2] Goldstein later goes on to say that brains of people of different sexual orientations \" gay, straight, and bisexual \" work in different ways. most people do not seem to recall ever making such a choice. While this does not prove that it is not a choice, the fact that people seem unable to point to making such a choice does provide support for the claim that it is not a matter of choice. Do heterosexual men and women think about their orientation, or does it just come \"naturally\"? Personally, I have no awareness that I chose to be straight. I also have no awareness of selecting my preferences in regards to the type of women I am attracted to. For example, I have a general preference towards woman with blonde hair. However, that does not seem to be something I selected. I cannot think of consciously deciding that I would find dark hair somewhat more appealing than lighter hair, I just do. If orientation were a choice, then a straight person should be able to choose to be gay and vice versa. A person can, obviously, test this by trying to switch his/her orientation. If my opponent/viewers of this debate are heterosexual, I urge you to give it a try and see if you can change preference.. It does not come natural. Another argument would be that if sexual preference is a matter of choice, it does seem a little bit odd that people would not decide to be heterosexual when people were (and still to this day are) persecuted and even killed for being homosexuals. It would make no sense to endure such treatment when a person could simply decide to not be that way. Of course, this argument is not decisive... but it is a point to be noticed. In my opinion, sexual orientation is innate but latent emerging slowly as the person develops. This is my opening argument, I await and look forward to seeing what my opponent has to say.

What I tried to prove through queer animals is that the factors mentioned for sexual orientation in case of humans are absolutely absent in animal world. Therefore all animals should have similar sexual orientations as they grow up under similar condition unlike humans. Parents of animals do not have divorces, some of them dont live in cities and some in forests and yet there are a range of sexual orientations in animals. 2. The sexual fluidity as mentioned by opponent seems as if he has assumed that sexual fluidity is change in sexual orientation. No! http://www.scienceofrelationships.com... Sexual fluidity is not a change in sexual orientation. Sexual fluidity does not imply that a person is homosexual for a given period of time and then turns heterosexual for a certain period of time. It also does not equal to bisexuality. Kindly donot confuse fluidity with bisexuality. 3. The fact that conversion therapy does not work is itself a proof that environment is not a factor. If I were depressed due to something bad happening to me (a physical factor) I could be cured by therapy but sexual orientation is not.",

            "premise": "After reading popular opinion, I feel like I'm arguing the tough side here, but I WILL PREVAIL. Before I continue the debate I want to make sure everyone that might read this debate understands that I have nothing against homo-sexual people, I simply am participating in this debate out of opinion. On to the debate. I believe that sexual orientation is a choice, because of three key points: the way people are raised, what they experience in life, and what they choose to become. My first point is the ways we are raised. Every experience that we go through, affects the choices we make throughout life. From the moment we are born things start changing us. One of the ways I believe sexual orientation is chosen, is through the orientation of the parents. If you are raised by to gay parents, I am sure from the moment you are adopted they will teach you that being gay/lesbian is perfectly fine, If not even normal. Another example is if you have very lenient parents. I don't mean to say that strict parents wouldn't let their children be gay, but let's say you were raised with only one parent who had to work long hours. You would be very free to make a lot of your own choices, including sexual orientation. If you are raised and grow up with gay friends and/or family you are very likely to possibly wonder about what being gay/lesbian is like. Another example is life experiences. Many people that are \"born\" straight may feel confused if they grow up seeing mostly straight people, then go out on their own and see gay couples. They may \"experiment\" with the same gender and ultimately chose to switch orientation. As we see laws and rules regarding homo-sexuality change around the world, many people may feel like they would be more accepted if they changed sexual orientation. I understand my opponents point about trying to change my sexual orientation. I am straight , and when I thought about this I realized that I would not be able to. However, I make the point that had I been raised in a different situation I may have felt confused growing up and changed orientation. My last point for this round is the ultimate decision. What sexual orientation you chose is one of the largest choices in your life. It decides how you will act socially around other genders, and your own. If you get married, sexual orientation decides who you will possibly spend the rest of your life with. I believe that there is one moment in each of our lives when we decide what sexual orientation we are. This may occur during the anytime, but is usually during the first half of our lives. Our parents may have personal opinions, and try to raise us a certain way. This usually succeeds, because we are taught during a young very impressionable time in our lives. Our parents are the only ones around during these early years and their opinions matter the most to us during that time. I urge my opponent and others who may read this to look at their opinions and decide whether some of them may have come from your parents, because I know a lot of them have for me personally. In conclusion for this round I believe that sexual orientation is a choice. Whether this choice is made by our parents in the way they raise us, or by us after confusing life experiences depends on your personal life. Back to my opponent now.",

Normal is not a vague word unless you choose to over think the meaning. Funny you admit being a superhero is not normal thus making my point. I am sure if you were honest you could find many more examples of normal versus not. Does being born gay make you a bad person? I don't think so. In my first reply to you I only wrote one short paragraph. In that statement I think I addressed how I would treat someone with any handicap.

If any kind of behavious is created by environmental factors, or society, they should be able to be healed using therapy like the one that has been used for rape victims and criminals. If being gay has a social/environmental factor, then therapy of any kind must change them into heterosexuals or 'reduce the amount of homosexuality'. Why is there a need to \"reduce the amount of homosexuality\"? It is not a psycopathology. There is no need to cure it. The DSM-5 does not include homosexuality. When i talk about sexual orientation, i'm not only considering homosexuals and heterosexuals, i'm also considering bisexuals, asexuals, sexually fluid people and so on. REBUTTAL (Sexuality in animals): The fact that there are queer animals does not make any point. I said biology does affect sexual orientation, i didn't deny that. (Animals regardless of the kind of place they live will show the same amount of variation of sexuality): The link you showed me doesn't show any experimental or statistical information, so you cannot make such assumptions. Just gay penguins, again, i didn't say they aren't gay, in fact they are. 1) Sexuality alters through time (at least for sexually fluid people): http://www.hup.harvard.edu... And i quote from this very link: \"Lisa M. Diamond argues that for some women, love and desire are not rigidly heterosexual or homosexual but fluid, changing as women move through the stages of life, various social groups, and, most important, different love relationships.\" Also, epigenetics is influenced by the environment: http://cdp.sagepub.com... I agree with you, conversion therapy should not be done, and hurts homosexuals. I will finish with the abstract of an interesting link i found on pubmed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...",

My biggest problem is with the gay agenda. I don't believe it should be promoted as a normal life style. Because it clearly is not. Having said that does not mean anyone should be denied the right to love whom they want as long as it is \"mutual\". But there are consequences when we try to normalize something that is primarily based on an abnormal sexual preference. In the case of same sex interaction you cannot have offspring. When it comes to marriage the argument is why can't I legally marry the one I love. I submit that the reason that the state got involved with marriage in the first place was because of offspring. It's a contract between a man and a woman that puts children first and their love secondary. And it is my opinion (but not just mine) children need a mother and a father. If you are gay maybe you cannot see that. Yes gay couples are capable of loving children too. But the need for a mother and a father trump that argument. Also the sexual nature of that kind of union is not healthy for nurturing children. In their attempt to normalize Homosexuality the gay agenda has forced it's belief on The Boy Scouts of America. Something I feel was completely unnecessary. It's supposed to be a free country. The idea that their political motivation was more important than preserving the values that the scouts held is indicative of who they are. To be clear, I am talking about the those that belong to the gay organizations that promote these political ideals. To me this just strengthens my belief that homosexuality should not be treated as normal.",

            "premise": "I understand my opponent had some difficulties so I will end with my round 3 argument and then a closing statement. -Round 3- \"As we see laws and rules regarding homo-sexuality change around the world, many people may feel like they would be more accepted if they changed sexual orientation.\" Do you think that this could be because they were afraid of being persecuted before hand? In Iran the threat of hanging may lessen homosexual activity, but there are still plenty of gays. (Some are forced into a sex-change because, curiously, transsexualism is more acceptable to the State.) There is a tribe in the New Guinea highlands called the 'sambia', where the practice (until recently) was for younger boys to be isolated from all female company and to fellate older boys in order to ingest their virility. The early teens were spent performing fellatio and the later teens being fellated. If any cultural pressure was going to create homosexuality surely this would be it - only it didn't. Come adulthood, most Sambia males emerged as married heterosexuals - with only around 5% of \"backsliders\" continuing to seek boys to fellate them (Herdt, 1981). This is much the same as the proportion of gay males in Western society. \"Another example is life experiences. Many people that are \"born\" straight may feel confused if they grow up seeing mostly straight people, then go out on their own and see gay couples.\" One of the first clues that people are born rather than made gay is that sex role behaviour, interests, toy and play preferences that relate to adult sex orientation can be observed from the earliest years. Some girls are described as \"tomboys\" and boys identified as 'sissies' when very young, usually by the age of 3. This is technically known as childhood gender nonconformity and it is strongly predictive of homosexuality in adulthood (Lippa, 2008). About 75% of CGN children grow up to be gay or lesbian. This would seem to place the origins of sex orientation much earlier than any supposed incidents of seduction and contagion in the early teens. There are actually differences in the anatomy of the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men and women. Where there are characteristic differences between male and female brains, these are often reversed in gay men and women. For example, LeVay (1991) found that a hypothalamic nucleus concerned with sexual behaviour (INAH-3), was smaller in gay men than straight men (indeed, more like that of women). Part of the conduit linking the left and right sides of the brain (the corpus callosum) is larger in homosexual men and straight women (Witelson et al, 2008). The brains of straight men and lesbians are larger in the right hemisphere than the left, but in gay men and straight women the two sides are symmetrical.). The amygdala, a mid-brain area important for emotional learning seems to be wired for a greater fight-flight response in straight men and lesbians than gay men and straight women (Savic & Lindstrom, 2008). Ponsetti et al (2007) found less gray matter in the perirhinal cortex in lesbians compared with straight women but no comparable differences between gay and straight men. [1] In regards to my opponents point that our parents have an affect on sexual orientation, I'd just like to place this link here to be observed. http://www.huffingtonpost.com...... I personally have a slight doubt that this father never gave off the opinion that he accepted homosexuality. it is clear that sex orientation is embedded within a bio-psychological context that goes beyond the simple question of who or what turns us on. It is a fundamental part of our nature that is not easily tilted by social events during development. Being raised by homosexual parents does not alter a child 's sexuality and those who fear their son can be initiated into homosexuality by an encounter with a paedophile priest or scoutmaster may sleep easily.

I believe that sexual orientation IS NOT a choice. The evidence I have provided will hopefully sway some of you (the voters) in my direction. Thanks for reading/voting!",

Because of this I am going to ignore your first argument, and other arguments except for the second because that does not seem to go into the terms of being gay is NOT bad sort of thing. What is choice ? Choice - an act of selecting or making a decision when faced with two or more possibilities When I was young and navive, I want to be left-handed because I was convinced that left-handed people were smarter (which is obviously not true in all cases). But, I was born right-handed, however that doesn't mean I don't have a choice. So, even though I was right-handed doesn't mean I couldn't be left-handed. Because really wanted to be left-handed. But couldn't sadly speaking. I could always fake it untiI make it. Applying, my brief anecdote to my own sexual orientation, I could want to homosexual and I could fool myself into thinking, I am gay, but I wouldn't be gay. Because I simply wasn't born that way. However that doesn't mean I don't have a choice in the matter. Just like people that don't have a choice in their sex, but do have a choice in their gender identity. We all have a choice in what we could be and who we are. This is called freedom. Or If you are simply implying that choice is the freedom to choose what we want to be or be who we are, then that's for the next round. Please clarify and be as specific as you can. I do so love a good round of wits! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",

            "discussionTitle": "Sexual orientation is not a choice",
            "conclusion": "Sexual orientation is not a choice",
            "premise": "I'm new to debate.org, so forgive me if I make a mistake in this process. I've made multiple attempts to argue this point in person and have come unsuccessful. I have yet to hear an argument supporting that sexuality is a choice, despite my efforts. The closest I've heard has been \"sexual orientation may not be a choice, but homosexual actions certainly are\". I'm not trying to debate this, I'm talking about strictly sexual orientation. Considering this is a website specifically for debating, I'm assuming I will get some responses and I'm excited for it. Onto my arguments: 1. To fellow heterosexuals: When did we choose to be straight? I know, this is an extremely cliche argument and I'm sure you've all heard it. But I certainly don't remember making a decision about it. I don't think I could choose to be homosexual if I tried. When thinking of sleeping with another guy, I feel nothing but discomfort. I guess it's like trying to explain why I don't like deviled eggs. I just don't, and I can't choose to like deviled eggs. 2. There's no reason to choose homosexuality You could make the argument that it's a rebellion thing, and I'll get to that later. Let's look at all the downsides society has caused to homosexuality. Bullying, discrimination, and persecution are just a few example of what many homosexuals have to endure everyday (at least where I live, in the bible belt). Consider the case of Carlos Vigil, a 17 year old homosexual high-schooler. He took his own life after the bullying became unbearable, all because of his sexual orientation. If it's a choice, he could have just switched back, right? Before it got really bad, he could have bailed out of homosexuality while he had the chance, right? If so, why didn't he take that chance? I would think just about every homosexual in this scenario would become heterosexual, yet they don't. Why? Because they can't. They are who they are. In my school, there are two homosexual men, both very religious. Hell, on their Instagram bio they both claim \"God is everything\". It goes without saying that they know they are sinning, and in their own religious book, it claims that their god \"hates homosexuals\". These people believe they will spend an eternity suffering for the way they live, yet they don't change it. If sexuality were as easy to change as many claim, why don't they? For these reasons, I do not believe homosexuality is a way to rebel (at least not in 99.9% of cases). I don't think anybody would rebel to the point where they spend an eternity suffering, or rebel to the point where they commit suicide. 3. Homosexual stereotypes Yes, I know nowadays the default notion of stereotypes is they're hurtful and false, but I think most would agree that stereotypes come from somewhere. Many, if not the majority of open homosexuals (to my personal observations) abide to the stereotype, which involves being feminine, a higher pitched voice, a lisp (I'm not sure why this is true, but it seems to be), dramatic, extreme hand motions, etc. Obviously not all homosexuals fit this stereotype, and I'm expecting to take heat for these statements, but we all know that's the stereotype. Growing up, we all knew who the gays were, far before they came out. When they finally did, nobody was surprised. Why? Because they acted gay for years, yet they didn't want people to know. It makes sense that they act gay even when others don't know that they're gay, because that's just the way they are. I grew up with a kid who was always feminine. Our parents were friends, so I would play at his house a lot. Even before kindergarten, he played with Barbies instead of soldiers, and glittery horses instead of dragons. The games he wanted to play were foreign to me. I remember specifically \"Boy by the River\". He played as the girl and made my brother play as his boyfriend while I was the boy by the river. All he would do is break up with my brother and become my girlfriend (We hated this game). I always knew he was different, and he was obviously way too young to make a choice of his sexuality, but he was obviously homosexual. Fast forward 10 years, after going about that time without seeing him, he goes into my dads office and asks him to donate to his dance crew. Come to find out...he was gay. Homosexuals don't begin showing these stereotypes to make a point, that's just the way they are. 4. It happens Short point... Over 1500 species of animals have been witnessed engaging in homosexual behaviors. The society of these animals aren't advanced to the point where they need to show off to their friends or they want to rebel to their parents. It shows that it's perfectly natural to be gay, it's just uncommon. I'm sure I'm missing something, but it'll come to me at some point throughout the debate. Again, correct me if I made a mistake.

            "premise": "Hello. I would like to begin by thanking the instigator, GMFGMD, for challenging me to this debate. Although I may disagree with your opinion, I do respect your opinion as I hope you do mine. If you are born to be gay you are an \"accident of nature\". Research has proven that being gay is not a disease. Research: (1) http://www.helem.net... \"Homosexuality was considered as a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) until 1973\". This nullifies you argument calling it a deformity. Therefore, calling it a deformity is in an opinion. Of which gives you no sound proof of it being an accident of nature. Also, \"On January 1, 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) removed homosexuality from its list of diseases.\" (1) WHO has removed homosexuality from the list of diseases. Thus, not making homosexuality a handicap. Now for a second lets call homosexuality an \"illness\". Why do gay people get kill, bullied, hurt, emotionally, and physically abused? Aren't you suppose to treat people who are ill in a kind and loving manner? When my friend is sick I don't say \"Omg, you have strep throat. You should die. You don't deserve to breathe the same air as me.\" The way people treat homosexuality is not as a way of illness which proves people do not think of it as an illness. If people though of it as an illness they would give you soup and say \"Hope the gay goes away.\" Being gay is not an illness the way people treat homosexuality proves my point. Normal. Funny choice of words. Could you tell me what is normal? Normal is such a vague word. Normal can mean literally anything. Nothing is normal. Technology is not normal in comparison to human's roots. Superheros are not normal but we think they are awesome. Normal is not normal. \"Those that choose it are just sick.\" Again, as I mentioned previously , homosexuality is not an illness. For sake of argument, lets replace the word sick with \"bad\". Now what I do not understand is, why does my choice in who I love make any difference to another person? In conclusion, homosexuality cannot be classified as an illness. It is normal because normal is a vague word meaning anything. Who I love does not hurt anyone. Honestly, if anyone is hurting themselves it is you because of all this hate in your body. I am not the one causing your hate you are. Hate, as well, as anger is an individual emotion that can only be controlled by the person who has it. Therefore, if it is a choice, why does choosing who you love hurt anyone? Love is love.",

            "conclusion": "LGBT People Should Have Equal Rights",
            "premise": "CON: \"There is no way to give a \"born male\" LGBT the right to give vaginal birth to a baby because there is no such available process\". REBUTTAL: While it is true a born male cannot give vaginal birth that in no way implies that if they could they wouldn\"t have the right to. We as humans are forced to live in the physical world we inhabit, and with it comes certain impossibilities. I only argue that LGBT people should have the right to, not that all would be able to. Freedom of speech is a \"right\" of the people of America as written in the Constitution, however if a person is unable to speak, write, or \"voice\" their opinion in any way it does not mean that the right does not apply to them, it only means they are unable to accomplish it. CON: \"Do they have the right to break women's world records at the Olympics? If they do, why can I not participate?\" REBUTTAL: Equal rights does not imply equal acceptance into independent organization. A male who has an operation to become female, has every right to attempt to enter the Olympics to compete in a female sport. Just as every male who doesn\"t have an operation does. An organization is its own social establishment and such it operates based on the rights of the people within the group, as long as it follow the rules it originally described. If a male wants to join the female sport and the group doesn\"t want to accept them that is their own right to do so. The male can still run, or high jump, or do any other sport they wish to do, but the organization doesn\"t have to consider it as a part of their organization. If however the rules simply state gender by affiliation instead of by birth then anyone who affiliates themselves as female should be allowed to join. Note my argument is for SEXUAL orientation and not gender. CON: \"If a \"born male\" who claims to be a female trapped in a male body can go in a female restroom, why can't a straight man?\" REBUTTAL: I would like to note again the debate is about equal rights of people of differing SEXUAL orientation, not gender. If a right is given to a person to use a bathroom based on the rules of a facility then everyone has the right to use the bathroom as described by the facility. Whether or not a transgender person should be able to use a bathroom of their choosing depends on the rules of the facility. If the facility states the only requirement to use a bathroom is gender affiliation then they have the right to use the bathroom of whichever gender they affiliate with. It is up to the laws of a facility and organization to determine the rights of the people who use them. I do not believe however bathrooms should be restricted because a person is gay, or of a differing sexuality. MAIN REBUTTAL: It is true if you are not a police officer you can\"t legally arrest anyone, it is true if you are not in the military you cannot legally enter facilities meant for military personnel only. These are rules set up by the government, I am not arguing against laws. My argument is if a right is given to men and women to join the police, or the military, or whatever organization, be it based on gender or not, the person's sexual orientation should have no bearing on whether or not they qualify. If a person is transgender they should be allowed to follow the laws as originally described. If the law says gender of time at birth is what matters then they should follow that rule, if it simply says affiliated gender then both transgender, and non-transgender should be able to follow the rules of whichever gender they affiliate with. If a law is made or changed to be against a person based on sexual orientation however, that is unjust. What difference is there between an LGBT person and a straight person that should cause them to be discriminated against. Sexual Orientation Discrimination is not currently illegal based on our current laws, but it should be. The Equal Rights Amendments (http://www.equalrightsamendment.org...) covers issues pertaining to gender, although lacking in information on transgender. There however, needs to be an Equal Right Amendment for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people to have no fear of discrimination based on their sexual orientation. That is if a straight person of a specific gender has the right to do something a non-straight should have that same right.",

You can not choose to be left handed but they are treated as the so called \"normal\". Studies have proven that being a homosexual is normal. For instance, I don't like fish; however, I do like pasta. Does this make me \"abnormal\"? \"In the case of same sex interaction you cannot have offspring.\" Some heterosexuals can not have kids; therefore, this nullifies that statement because not being able to have kids as a heterosexual and not being able to have kids as a gay couple is the same. Also, there are many children that are put up for adoption that deserve a good home, so everyone does not need to have offspring.\"But the need for a mother and a father trump that argument.\"(1) http://www.sciencedaily.com...(2) http://www.bu.edu...My uncle died when my cousin was 2 years old. My aunt never got remarried since then or has even had a boyfriend since then. Therefore, my cousin has had no father for 20 years. Yet, he is still a man and doing just fine. Forget about same sex parenting for a second. It seems like you oppose single parenting as well since there is one gender in the household.\"Also the sexual nature of that kind of union is not healthy for nurturing children. In their attempt to normalize Homosexuality the gay agenda has forced it's belief on The Boy Scouts of America.\"(3) http://www.pbs.org... \"Same-sex couples raising adopted children are older, more educated and have more economic resources than other adoptive parents. An estimated 65,500 adopted American children are living with a lesbian or gay parent.\" -PBS This was taken off of PBS' website. Proving that same sex couples can proved both love and financial support making them good parents.\"In their attempt to normalize Homosexuality the gay agenda has forced it's belief on The Boy Scouts of America. Something I feel was completely unnecessary.\"(4) http://www.huffingtonpost.com...Not letting a human join a group for the sole reason it that they are a homosexual is absurd. Like I said in the first round, being a homosexual is normal (if you would like me to use that word). You have not provided any research to back you beliefs. However, I have provided you with proven research. The WHO has taken homosexuality off their list of diseases. Again, being a homosexual is as normal as being left handed.\"It's supposed to be a free country. The idea that their political motivation was more important than preserving the values that the scouts held is indicative of who they are.\"You honestly can not but \"free country\" but imply denying homosexuals to be a Boy Scout in the same sentence. Free country means I have and opportunity to be whatever I want. But, then saying you can't be a cub scout is quite hypocritical.\"To be clear, I am talking about the those that belong to the gay organizations that promote these political ideals. To me this just strengthens my belief that homosexuality should not be treated as normal.\"Yes, gay people do promote them to do this. However, they are not holding a gun to their head saying change this or we will kill you. Therefore, changing the rules was their decisions. Even if it was influenced by them, in the end it was still their decision.http://www.youtube.com...I hope the research I have provided you might expand your views on the homosexual community. But, without research and proven facts I assume that you have nothing proving what you state. For instance, you have given no proof that gay people are not normal. You have also not given any proof that you need two different genders in order to be a good family. However, I do respect your opinion.Thank you for taking the time to debate and have a nice day.",

Of course there are some biological factors that influence sexual orientation, such as: - Genetics - Epigenetics (prenatal androgen exposure) - Brain structures Biology has a great influence on sexual orientation. But not everything is as it seems. 1) A study from Denmark proves that the environment increases or decreases the proportion of heterosexual and homosexual weddings. What did this study find? - Demography: People in cities are more likely to marry a same-sex partner and less likely to marry heterosexually. - Family issues - Having no brothers http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... 2) Younger men from the Sambia tribe fellate other adult men as a rite of passage. 3) The greeks were equally comfortable with the same-sex and that helped the formation of more \"men on men\" action. And finally this one, which i think isn't that good but can raise an interesting topic: 4) Homophobia is for some a latent homosexuality. By now all i can say is that homophobia correlates with homosexual arousal. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... Are the people in 4 homosexual? Is homosexuality defined by conduct or is it enough if we consider physiological response? I believe sexual orientation is a social construct. So it doesn't really matter how you identify yourself, what matters is whether or not you are taking every aspect of yourself into account, or maybe just letting it be.",

You need to tell me why federally legalizing gay marriage isn't constitutional before you tell me why gay marriage is immoral. Since I'm still waiting for your reply on why it's unconstitutional, I'll go along with your argument. You still need to determine why being gay is wrong, let alone gay marriage. First of all, you are using a slippery slope argument. You can't compare pansexualism to people who commit rape. Rape is involuntary and violates one's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Pansexualism is completely voluntary. \"We don't make gays drink at seperate fountains, we don't spray protesting gays with firehoses! \" Not in the literal sense, but you are still preventing them from getting marriage licenses in 30+ states which give you tax benefits. Why? Not only that, but gays are suffering persecution from fundamentalists all across America. Now you bring up another point about whether or not homosexuality is natural or not. Can you prove this point without using the Bible and saying it's true because the \"Bible said so\"? If you are referring that homosexuality is a mental disorder, you need to provide evidence. I'll provide a quote from the American Psychological Association as to why it is not: \"No, lesbian, gay, and bisexual orientations are not disorders. Research has found no inherent association between any of these sexual orientations and psychopathology. Both heterosexual behavior and homosexual behavior are normal aspects of human sexuality. Both have been documented in many different cultures and historical eras. Despite the persistence of stereotypes that portray lesbian, gay, and bisexual people as disturbed, several decades of research and clinical experience have led all mainstream medical and mental health organizations in this country to conclude that these orientations represent normal forms of human experience. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual relationships are normal forms of human bonding. Therefore, these mainstream organizations long ago abandoned classifications of homosexuality as a mental disorder.\" - APA The same institution also says that gay men are not more likely to molest young children than straight men: \"Homosexual men are not more likely to sexually abuse children than heterosexual men are.\" - APA As far as being gay is a \"choice\" is concerned, the APA once again states that \"most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation,\" even though there isn't enough evidence to determine what exactly causes sexual orientation. Also, the short little clip below explains in a scientific fashion how it is very likely that gender affiliation and sexuality is determined within the mother's womb: http://www.youtube.com...",

            "premise": "Ask yourself this \"when did you choose to be straight\"? A person's sexual orientation is not a black or white matter, sexual orientation exists along a continuum, with exclusive attraction to the opposite sex on one end of the continuum and exclusive attraction to the same sex on the other. There is a great deal of research suggesting that sexual orientation is congenital. Common sense tells us that no one sits down one day and goes, \"Hmmmm\" should I be gay or straight?\" but rather some people find themselves attracted to people of the same gender. But there are people who consciously decide to experiment with their sexuality, to try gay sex and see if they like it. Some radical feminists embrace lesbianism for political rather than sexual reasons. As some men in prison with strong sexual desire use other men for sex. This can cause some people to believe that homosexual behavior is the same thing as homosexual attraction. What if behavior doesn't match well with attraction? What if people usually enjoy sex with one gender but only fall in love with the other? What if a person's past doesn't reflect his or her present feelings? Sexuality is much more complex than we know, but we are gaining understanding through science. So the real question should be what causes homosexuality? Research suggest that homosexuality is hereditary. https://www.eurekalert.org... http://www.journals.uchicago.edu... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... http://www.pnas.org... http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com... However in spite of all of the above scientific studies, according to the American Psychological Association's own website, \"there is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; however most people whether heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual, experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.\" From all of this I can draw only one conclusion. Homosexuality is not a choice.",

The claim assumes that sexual orientation is a way of life not a disorder. The claim goes further by stating Pedophilia is a sexual orientation like heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality. Sexual orientation is a person\"s sexual identity in relation to the gender to which they are attracted to; it is the state of being a heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual. This claim deviates from the issue. The problem with pedophilia is not that the person is sexually attracted to men or women, it\"s that the person is sexually attracted to boys and/or girls. Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation, meaning it is not the attraction to a male or female, it is a disorder of sexual preference. It is a disorder of sexual preference because pedophilic behavior causes harm, unlike sexual orientation. Pedophilia may put children at risk because they are not in the age of corresponding to the sexual attraction of pedophiliacs. It is why pedophiliac behavior should be prevented. Treatment can help prevent it.",

            "premise": "The report done by the Innovation Group? It was a poll of less than 1000 people. And the questions they used to determine their numbers? They asked less about a person's sexual standpoint than what they saw about current trends. One such question: \"Gender doesn't define a person as much as it used to\". Or how about: \"People are exploring their gender identity/sexuality more than in the past.\" A more reliable survey would be the National Survey of Family Growth conducted by the CDC in 2006, where they found that 95% of Americans identified themselves as exclusively heterosexual. Now although this number probably isn't proportional to teen statistics, it is clear proof that the numbers provided by the J Walter Thompson innovation group are incorrect. But why are we wasting time talking about sexual orientation? This debate is about gender identity.The problem with this concept of gender identity is that it promotes the idea that you are what you feel, and that you can be anything you think you are. But just because you think you are something doesn't mean you are that thing. Like a very popular meme says, can I sexually identify as an attack helicopter? The studies that say that your nurturing and upbringing determine what you think you are, ARE TRUE! If you are brought up thinking you are a dog, you will think you are a dog. But are you a dog? No! (Assuming you're a human reading this). Now, assuming gender is flexible, why can't racial identity be a thing? Can I change my ethnicity just because I think I'm of another ethnicity? No, race is not exclusive of nature. In the same way, gender is not exclusive of nature.Just to be clear, if your debating statement is equivalent to this statement, \"What you think is determined by nurture rather than nature,\" then there is no debate. You say gender identity is about \"a person's perception\", so is the statement I just gave the same as your statement? Otherwise I am making a case against gender being separated from one's sex.",

These deities did not tell them anything, man wrote the Bible, Koran, and etc. How can we trust mans word if it lies constantly, we cant, we just cant. Take everything people say with a grain of salt because the underlying fact in this is that man lies and can write anything in a fancy way and say \"god made me do it\" same thing in regards to if man kills someone. It cannot be an act of god if he says \"god made me do it\" god (or deities) harming his own children. The creator (god) does not have to be removed. Just the church's of these gods need to conform a little. I am know catholic but I sure as heck think the pope is heading in a right direction in his new papacy.

I will try to get the format for the debate as correct as I can, I will try to research any fallacies I may commit and correct them before I do, and I invite anyone on this site to take up the con on this issue. This is an issue I have been debating several people on for weeks now, and its time to put it to a vote...since this is a topic in front of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS).Accordingly, people of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) community has argued that States which do not allow same-sex marriage, as well as the Federal government, are discriminating against the LGBT couples rights because of their sexual orientation. FOR THIS DEBATE THE CON MUST ARGUE FOR THE STATES THAT DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Definitions of terms: Definition of HOMOSEXUAL 1 : of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex 2 : of, relating to, or involving sexual intercourse between persons of the same sexDefinition of HETEROSEXUAL 1 : of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward the opposite sex : of, relating to, or involving sexual intercourse between individuals of opposite sexDefinition of COUPLE 1 a : two persons married, engaged, or otherwise romantically paired b : two persons paired together Definition of STATEa : one of the constituent units of The United States of AmericaDefinition of SEXUAL ORIENTATION : the inclination of an individual with respect to heterosexual, homosexual, asexual, bisexual, and zoophilia behavior My contentions:C1: State or Federal government is not discriminating against homosexuals couples right to marry because of their sexual orientation.After reviewing several state requirements on marriage http://www.usmarriagelaws.com..., I do not and have not seen any state that asks the soon to be married couple their sexual orientation. Therefore since the state doesn't not ask for sexual orientation, the state cannot discriminated nor deny a couple a marriage license based off of sexual orientation.C2: All homosexuals currently have the right to marry just as all heterosexual have the right to marry.As stated in C1:, states cannot discriminated based off of sexual orientation...homosexuals can therefore be married. Homosexuals can marry people of the opposite sex, just like heterosexuals can.C3: Arguments that allow same-sex marriages can be argued for all types of marriages i.e. polygamy, incestuous, bestial.Same-sex marriages would have to redefine what marriage is based on, through the equality of sexual orientation. By making the state recognize the rights based on sexual orientation, the states interest would change and have to recognize all sexual orientaions as equals. Thus allowing poygamy, incestuous, and bestial marriages to take place. In conclustion, the right to marry is currently provided to everyone equally under the law, and does not discrminated against homosexuals.",

            "conclusion": "Homosexuality has Little to No Correlation to Pedophillia",
            "premise": "Welcome to the debate, and I remind you, the rules explicitly say that arguing homosexuality is bad/unnatural is 100% banned. Well, I found a report that says that 80% of pedophiles are gay/bisexual, but this has nothing to say that 80% of homosexuals or bisexuals are pedophiles. Anyway, my source debunks it and contains an excerpt from what I believe you got your source from. You argued that pedophilia is a sexual orientation in one of your debates. http://www.debate.org... So, can you have two sexual orientations? The logical answer is no. From my source (http://www.dailykos.com...) \"Fischer cites a study that says 86% of men who molest boys identify themselves as gay or bisexual with no breakdown of gay or bisexual perpetrators. The study Fischer references is strongly criticized by the consensus of experts in this field. The paper he's referencing is Erickson et al. (1988). Behavior patterns of child molesters. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 17, 77-86. The paper does claim in passing that 86% of molesters of boys identified as gay or bisexual, but the paper does not describe how this data was gathered, and how it ascertained the sexual orientation of these men.\" So, there is no way to determine HOW this data was obtained, and it is both phrased incorrectly, and there is no way to determine the validity of an argument that has no source backing it up. And, many pedophiles assault boys. Does that make them gay? No more than it makes a homosexual who has a heterosexual life heterosexual. Same source. \"Pedophiles are attracted, primarily, to children. The sex of those children matter less than that they are children. The sex of victim has more to do with access than sexual orientation.\" In the book Mental Disorders of the New Millennium (2006), author and psychology professor Thomas Plante writes: \"Although the majority of clergy abuse victims are males, homosexuality cannot be blamed. First, many of the pedophile priests report that they are not homosexual. This is also true of many non-clergy sex offenders who victimize boys. Many report that they target boys for a variety of reasons that include easier access to boys ... pregnancy fears with female victims ... homosexuals in general have not been found to be more likely to commit sexual crimes against minors compared to heterosexuals. Sexual orientation is not predictive of sex crimes \" And, then there's this Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category \" those with a more or less exclusive interest in children \" have been labeled fixated. Fixation means \"a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \"stuck\" at an early stage of psychological development. By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is \"a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children. Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" And they tried YET AGAIN. And they failed. \"In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children, some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages (child, pubescent, and mature adult). All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners. The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children (Freund et al., 1989).\" Same source. Therefore, all scientific evidence states that homosexuals have no predisposition to pedophilia, and your own debate says pedophilia is a sexual orientation. So, at the risk of violating my own rules, my opponent cites an incorrect statistic, rephrased from a paper from 1921, that has no credibility and no sources backing it up.

            "premise": "Thank you for your timely reply. \"I am NOT going to cite sources or back up material for a lot of information that I use for several different reasons; either it is common knowledge, common sense, or the information in my argument can easily be verified and looked up at any time on any search engine.\" No comment. The voters can judge this statement. \"...yet there are lots of heterosexual men born with lower levels of testosterone so if what you are saying is accurate then these men should be GAY.\" The word 'lots' is a generalized word to make an argument look stronger. However, with no statistics or sources, I can not prove this fact true. It is your job as a debater to cite and make claims backed up with sources. It is like saying \"there are a lot of people in the world. Search it up on a search engine.\" It is your job as a debater to provide these details. I have to analyze and view this comment as unproven. \" Also falling in love is scientifically proven to lower levels of testosterone in males and increase testosterone in females which means that testosterone levels have intermittent highs and lows throughout the lifetime of a human being.\" This is true. However, my study has proven this at birth, as these would not affect the outcome of the study I provided. \"First I will start by saying that there is no definitive proof that lower levels of testosterone effect sexual orientation. You never mentioned the female hormone estrogen which some females are born with lower levels of but are not Lesbians.\" Men and women both have testosterone, so the levels of estrogen is unnecessary into determining the sexual orientation of a person. Many sexually differentiated characteristics are organized by sex steroids, which I agree with you, but it also affects sexual orientation. Multiple sexually differentiated behavioral, and physiological traits are significantly different in homosexual and heterosexual people. Some of these traits are known to be organized by prenatal steroids, including testosterone. These differences suggest that homosexual subjects were exposed to endocrine conditions during development.[1] Testosterone is a steroid hormone responsible for sexual orientation. In addition, my opponent misread my argument, as I said when the male fetus receives too little testosterone, it causes the sexual orientation. The study I provided was only studied over males. I did not imply females get to choose. It was a stretched assumption made by my opponent. \"...why have none of these athletes who habitually have taken this supplement have displayed any homosexual-like behavior or characteristics in any way what-so-ever?? Odd don't you think? And you use this estranged person called Dr. Ward? I looked him up and couldn't find a Dr. Ward only someone named Dr. Ward F. Odenwald if that's who you're talking about who did his research on HOMOSEXUALITY in 1995!! I was 9 years old!!\" They have not displayed homosexual behaviors because it effects the early development of babies, and not adults. The study you did looked up was the one I did provide in my sources. It is important to remember that I provided over 5 studies, this being the most outdated one. All of them proved that sexual orientation was decided at birth. Being critical over one study, that is still reliable and even helps prove the more recent studies, is unnecessary. Providing one outdated study is better than displaying none, like my opponent. (Unless you count Wikipedia, none cited, so the information cannot be trusted nor verified.) \"I'm a female and I was attracted to other females for almost 6 years and now I'M NOT!! I'm attracted to guys and have been dating them ever since!\" Yes, as I stated before, people can change their viewpoints. As we argued earlier on, there is no test we can give a person after birth to determine if they are straight or homosexual. Just because of your personal experience, (needless to say only one experience), should not be the determining factor of the majority of studies. Sure, people can change their views. However, even by the confusion, (which could be from external factors), there is still the underlying factors that have been ingrained in the memory. \"And you consider people who live as pedophiles, scam artists, rapists and so forth to be \"ACTUAL CHOICES\" and \"POOR DECISIONS\" yet being a guy and WANTING to suck another guy's wiener is not? LMAO Get out of here! There are STRAIGHT men who even do this for the money and solely for the money so get the heck out of here but in your biased logic it can't be an ACTUAL CHOICE or male prostitution it's an \"epi-mark\" no wait it's too much \"Androstenedione\" at birth, no no it's \"lack of Testosterone\"!! Wait it's in the \"BRAIN\"!! HAHA Which one is it?? Pick one! LMAO!!\" As you can tell by my opponents choice of language, like \"lmao\", my opponent does not take this as a serious debate. Saying it is a poor choice for a guy being gay is judging. \"... yet being a guy and WANTING to suck another guy's wiener is not?\" Another person could judge for a girl wanting to do that to a guy. There is no difference, as this does not even matter into the deciding factor of if someone is born gay. My opponent only supplied her personal opinion, displayed a multitude of times throughout this debate, with rude language, a closed mind, and no sources. The answer is clear, as I supplied multiple studies (that non my opponent actually refuted with sources), and thorough explanations. My opponent simply acted as if the assumptions made on my opponents part were correct, as with no sources or statistics, cannot be proven. My sources are credible and reliable. My opponent used one personal experience. Vote pro. [1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...",

            "conclusion": "The Bible Says Homosexuals Live an Acceptable Lifestyle",
            "premise": "--- \"I believe that the Bible has a lot to say about the behavior of homosexuals, and I also blieve that none of what it has to say is said in a positive manner.\" + I'm simply saying that the Bible does not openly condemn homosexuality not that it casts it in a positive light. We cannot assume that today's societal ills are the Bible's as wells because of obscure scriptures. Obscure scriptures justified slavery, suffrage, the Holocaust and more. --- LEVITICUS 18:22--- \" 'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.'\" LEVITICUS 20:13--- \" 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.'\" + You've misinterpreted the scripture and are using it to advance the intolerant social agenda against gays. Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. This code includes many outdated sexual laws. It also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortune told, and even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!) So what's a holiness code? It's a list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time. In this case, the code was written for priests only, and its primary intent was to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures. \"The Old Testament is not credible?\" + Nobody said that the Old Testament was not credible. The Old Testament is very credible. However, this scripture is being used and twisted to promote the anti-homosexual agenda. Matthew 5:17--- \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\" If Jesus did not come to abolish the law, then it must still be credible, don't you think?\" + ...Yes... GENESIS 29:4-11--- \"4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom\u2014both young and old\u2014surrounded the house. 5 They called to Lot, \"Where are the men (These men are said to be angels in earlier verses) who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\" etc etc\" + This is an orgy before marriage! This is homosexual abuse! This is not homosexuality. This is a wild sex orgy without marriage, which the Bible does condemn. But not pure homosexuality. Sodom and Gamora was destroyed because of arrogance not because they were gay.Jesus and five Old Testament prophets all speak of the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom -- and not one of them mentions homosexuality. Even Billy Graham doesn't mention homosexuality when he preaches on Sodom. Listen to what Ezekiel 16:48-49 tell us: \"This is the sin of Sodom; she and her suburbs had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not help or encourage the poor and needy. They were arrogant and this was abominable in God's eyes.\" Think about this...if God destroyed Sodom and Gamora because they were homosexual, then what about the plenty of heterosexuals there??? --- My point--- It has been scientifically determined that homosexuality has several pre natal and post natal influences to contribute to it. Your sexuality can not be determined by yuo. You can control your actions and not participate in homosexual actions but you cannot determine your own sexuality. The American Psychological Association website reads: What Causes a Person To Have a Particular Sexual Orientation? There are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation; most scientists today agree that sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors. In most people, sexual orientation is shaped at an early age. There is also considerable recent evidence to suggest that biology, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality. In summary, it is important to recognize that there are probably many reasons for a person's sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people. Is Sexual Orientation a Choice? No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. --- Why would God condemn his own children in the way that he made them? I am a Bisexual American and I did nothing wrong but be born this way. I doubt that my God condemns the way he created me. Just as much as I doubt that he condemns any person for being Asian or tall. I eagerly await your reply! Thanks! Renzzy",

            "premise": "I am glad for the opportunity to continue this discussion and will respond to my opponent's latest comments with the following three thoughts: FIRST My opponent asks for a correlation between homosexuality and the potential conditions that he stated in his thesis, namely polygamy, incest, pedophilia and bestiality. I have given two very clear correlations which I will restate here: 1. They are all explicitly of a sexual nature 2. They are all regarded, by a large segment of American society, as aberrant (deviating from what is normal or desirable). To dispute these correlations is merely obstinate. SECOND My opponent states that it is his \"task is to examine why gay marriage is most commendable to be included over a marriage involving polygamy, incest, bestiality and pedophilia.\" This has nothing to do with this debate. The debate is about whether there are logical reasons to hold the \"slippery slope argument\" against gay marriage. An exploration of the merits of gay marriage vs. polygamy, incest, bestiality and pedophilia might be interesting but it is not the subject of this debate. THIRD My opponent again draws distinction between \"sexual behavior\" and \"sexual orientation.\" Observe the following quote: \"I believe the definition of marriage should not be changed to include anything that promotes a particular sexual behavior. I have already proven that homosexuality (such as heterosexuality and bisexuality) is not a sexual behavior, but a sexual orientation. Would my opponent be able to discover a sexual orientation other than heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality? If not, how could marriage ever change its definition again?\" My opponent seems to want to justify gay marriage on grounds that homosexuality is an orientation and not a behavior. But notice that he has interjected \"bisexuality\" into the mix as an orientation. He asks how the definition of marriage might change if there are no other orientations but hetero, homo and bi-sexuality. My opponent has just compounded his own difficulties. (!) Let's explore the implications of the \"orientation\" of bisexuality and the potential changing of marriage's definition. A woman with a bisexual orientation might desire to be married to both a man and a woman which would then change the definition of marriage to include POLYGAMY. Remember, if we are only dealing with \"orientation\" and not \"behavior\" then on what grounds could my opponent deny our hypothetical bi friend the right to have a fulfilling marriage to the heterosexual man and homosexual woman of her desires? We have, in my opponent's own terms, clear, logical justification for slippery slope. But let's go a step further. Who is to say that pedophilia and bestiality are merely \"behaviors\" and not also \"orientations?\" Is it not possible that one might never actually have sex with a child (animal) but yet still only experience sexual desire for children (animals)? Where might this lead? I rest, waiting for my opponent's closing thoughts.",

            "premise": "I accept your terms that we only debate about marriage in the United States and the age o consent be 17. My resolution says that anyone of age should be able to be married regardless of sexual orientation. So there is no reason why arguments 1 and 5 should be thrown out. My resolution states that sexual orientation should not come into the equation. However, this clearly happens so it is only natural that I should argue against it. I will begin with a definition of marriage. Marriage: a social contract between two individuals that unites their lives legally, economically and emotionally. http://marriage.about.com... I propose that the definition of marriage does not include specifications on the sex of the individuals partaking. Marriage is about two people that want to legally bind themselves together. It does not matter if there is one guy and one girl or two guys or two girls. Marriage is about love and commitment and not sexual orientation. Not allowing two people to marry on the basis of their sexual orientation is discrimination. I may use this argument because my resolution is that sexual orientation should not factor in the decision to allow two individuals to marry. It however is and I am arguing against it. No one will argue that discrimination is not wrong. laws have been passed that protect people form being discriminated against on the basis of race, gender, and sexual orientation. You cannot be prohibited from marrying because you are black or asian, so why is it okay to discriminate on the basis of sexual preference when it comes to marriage? Marriage binds two individuals together both economically and legally. So to be married is to provide a more stable environment for any children that two individuals may care for. If two people have a kid but are not married, there is no laws deciding that one parent may see the child if the couple breaks up. Marriage brings the law into the matter thus making the lives of the couple and their child more stable in the process. There is no reason why a couple should be prohibited from having this kind of security.",

As a sort of tongue and cheek demonstration that sexual orientation doesn't change at our whim I would ask our audience to force themselves to find this thing attractive(of course applying to people that don't find it attractive) [IMG]http://www.funnypica.com...[/IMG] http://www.funnypica.com... In a study it was found that 52% of cases in which an identical twin was homosexual, the other was also a homosexual. You may say, yes but that's because they're raised in the same environment, but the same study showed that only 22% of cases in which a fraternal twin was homosexual the other was homosexual. This is clear evidence that there is a genetic basis for homosexuality. http://www.nytimes.com...

            "conclusion": "Being gay is not a choice",
            "premise": "Let me clarify, bisexuals are not gay, pansexuals are not gay, asexuals are not gay. We are speaking solely about homosexuals-someone who is sexually attracted to the same sex. Not homoromantics which can be a choice in certain situations, homosexuals. Now let's begin. It makes no sense for a person to choose to be gay In Uganda, if you're gay you'll be put in something called \"The Rolling Stone\" and people will find you and kill you. Cops will literally hunt you down and give you the death penalty.[1] It would be completely insane to choose this life. It would make no sense for a person to want to feel like they might get severely beaten up and killed for stepping out of their house. This happens all over the world and especially after what happened with Matthew Shepard it would be a wonder if anyone even thought about being gay. Experimentation is not homosexuality In college many people experiment. Experiment meaning trying to have sex or a relationship with a person that differs from your sexual preferences. Such as a straight woman dating another woman or a gay man dating a woman. Experimenting likely ends up with you returning back to your original orientation, but just the fact that you had sex with a person of the opposite or same sex means it's a choice right? No. Bi-curiosity is when you're curious about relations with a sex you originally thought you weren't interested in. Some people turn out bisexual others revert back. Sexual relations with that person was a choice, but sexuality is not. Final points Because my opponent might hold this against me as many do I'm going to clarify this. Sexual intercourse does not equal sexual orientation. This might confuse you, but having sex with someone once or tice and never again does decide your sexuality. Sexual intercourse-intercourse (as anal or oral intercourse) that does not involve penetration of the vagina by the penis This is not a debate on whether lesbian sex is sex or not so let's include cunnilingus. Sexual orientation-a person's sexual identity in relation to the gender to which they are attracted. Another thing you said \"The burden of proof is on the Pro.\" I strongly hope that you'll provide arguments of your own or we can't have an argument. There is supposed to be proof on both sides that's kind of what a debate is. Good luck. Citation [1]",

            "premise": "Response A: This argument is a complete strawman evident that my opponent has absolutely no idea what I'm trying to argue for. I not only conceded that other groups can be disadvantaged as homosexuals are (even though I've provided evidence to say that homosexuals are more disadvatanged and my opponent's evidence points toward that same conclusion), but I argue that these other groups should have legislation done for them as well. The focus of this debate is the enumeration of bullying against sexual orientation into protocol for dealing with bullying in schools, and enumeration for bullying against obesity and people with deficiencies in speech or otherwise other impediments can be included as well. Should they be included? Absolutely. Are they the specific focus of this debate? Absolutely not. The essential question in this debate is whether or not sexual orientation should be included in this enumeration, and unfortunately, my opponent's rebuttals deviate from the true focus of this debate. Even if we were talking about a legislation that solely focuses on sexual orientation and nothing else, another piece of legislation can be made for other groups anyway if needed (and is needed). My opponent's arguments about discrimination are not a real issue.Reponse B: First, my opponent obviously did not read my evidence in detail because it included a statement that said that bullying against gays is more intense than other groups. Needless to say, this response is only an extension of Response A's strawman, and I've already addressed this. My opponent completely misunderstands my case.",

            "conclusion": "Being gay is a not a choice!",
            "premise": "Theories of causation for homosexuality have shifted dramatically in the past 100 years. Early psychologists believed that early childhood trauma caused homosexual feelings to develop. Specifically, Freud proposed that a weak father and an overbearing mother caused a person to \"stall\" in the phallic stage of childhood development. Subsequent studies have shown there is no association between any parenting style or early childhood experiences that leads to homosexuality. According to the American Psychiatric Association No specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent in children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual. Rather, all of the peer-reviewed literature is converging on the opinion that sexual orientation has a strongly genetic causation. This is not meant to imply that sexual orientation is completely determined by genes. It seems there is a complex interaction between biology and the environment to produce sexual orientation. In insects, same-gender sexual mating is induced from altering genes alone, thus indicating a 100% biological causatoin for sexual orientation in simple species. For lower mammals, like rats, same-sex mating behaviors will occur simply by putting a female \"smell\" on a male rat. \"Lesbian\" and \"gay\" rats, guinea pigs, sheep, zebra finches (just after hatching) and monkeys can be produced simply by altering prenatal androgen levels (natural hormones that bathe the fetus in utero) in the mother, in a process called behavioral defeminization and behavioral demasculinization. It is currently believed that In vertebrate model systems, a single [prenatal] factor-the steroid hormone testosterone-accounts for most, and perhaps all, of the known sex differences in neural structure and behavior. . . . Events triggered by testosterone masculinize the developing and adult nervous system, [to] promote male behaviors and suppress female behaviors. In the animal kingdom, same-sex mating, including life-time pairing, is not uncommon, presumably caused by mechanisms such as these. Hundreds of zoological studies have found evidence of such pairings in the wild, including, for example, the widely publicized \"gay\" penguins in both the New York and Berlin zoos. In humans, socialization makes the development of sexual orientation much more complex. However, the prenatal biological process is identical. While, in most instances, sexual development of the body and the brain occurs without discrepancy, in some instances prenatal androgen levels change in the middle of this process, causing a dichotomy in the affected individual. For example, in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the early process of physical sexualization takes place as expected in the female. However, later in development, the adrenal glands begin producing excess testosterone, causing the brain to become masculinized. Almost half of this population become homosexual or bisexual. It is believed that similar processes are the cause of homosexuality in the general population. While the pro-amendment testimony is correct, that \"there are no replicated studies proving that homosexuality is caused by biological factors,\" there is also no disagreement at this point in the medical, psychological and biological communities that biology is a crucial dimension to the process of human homosexuality, just as it is the sole cause of homosexuality in all lower species. There are no peer-reviewed studies that any longer explore purely, or even mostly, psychological causes for homosexuality in humans. The convergence of many decades of research, as well as theory, all point to, by far, biology as a primary factor in human sexual orientation. While we know that biological factors do not act as the sole cause of homosexuality, it is accepted as the primary cause. While many studies support this idea, there are no current studies that contradict this belief.",

I challenge you to show me with the Bible where it condemns this type of sexual orientation or behavior. Furthermore, I challenge you to explain to me how you reconcile the fact that God also made AIS hermaphrodites. These people are BORN physically both male AND female. In fact, and AIS hermaphrodite or \"intersex\" person has a vagina, female breasts, are hormonally more female that the average female. The do NOT have a uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. The DO have internal testicles and their DNA is male. If our sexual orientation is determined by God, and he reveals what our orientation should be by our gender, what is one to do that is born with a vagina AND testicles? This is where science and the Bible clearly contradict each other if I were to accept the conservative Christian view of sexual orientation. This is nature's little \"curve ball\" thrown at Christianity and the Bible, for the Bible makes no mention of such conditions. Who would this person choose as a mate without sinning if homosexuality is a sin?",

            "discussionTitle": "Gay Marriage",
            "conclusion": "Gay Marriage",
            "premise": "Thanks again to GCL. I will now present my arguments.FRAMEWORKThe topic reads \"Gay Marriage is immoral.\" This is not a debate about gay sex; rather, it is a debate about gay marriage.That being said, sexual acts are integral to marriage, and so some discussion of gay sex is appropriate. However, we must recall that this is about the institution of marriage itself, not about what occurs within the marriage.Definitions:Marriage - \"a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws.\" [1]Choice - \"the act of choosing: picking/deciding between possibilities.\" [2]Sexual Orientation - \"to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic and/or sexual attractions to men, women or both sexes. Sexual orientation also refers to a person\u2019s sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors and membership in a community of others who share those attractions. Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum.\" [3]Morality - \"conformity to ideals of right human conduct.\" [2] I assert that fairness is a good criterion for morality. Clarification: I know I'm listed as Pro; however, I will be arguing gay marriage is NOT immoral.ARGUMENTSContention One: Orientation is not a ChoiceA. Homosexuality is found in animalsNumerous animal species display homosexual orientations [4]. One famous example of this is the union of two female Swans. [5] Officials originally believed them to be a heterosexual couple, naming them Romeo and Juliet, only to--after investigation--discover that the couple was lesbian. This shows, at the very least, that homosexual orientations can be evidenced in nature. I would further posit, that since animals lack the rationality required to make higher-order decisions, that they did not choose to be lesbian, but were born that way. Christian existentialist Soren Kierkegaard once asserted that choice is about the ability to self-direct. Nonhumans lack choice. A cow, for instance, is a purely natural being; its behavior is always determined by worldly facts. The composition of a cow, the environment of a cow, and the natural laws governing Mother Earth determine what the cow does at all stages of its life. The cow, in essence, lacks the free will to act contrary to what any of the biological/natural factors dictate. For example, if a cow is hungry, it will eat; it cannot consciously choose not to eat even though it is hungry. It cannot fight against its natural urges.\"The Swans cannot choose to be straight or gay. Rather, they are simply submitting to their natural, homosexual urges.B. Behavioral AnalysisLearned behavior can be untaught. [6] Something that is innate cannot be untaught. For example, no psychologist could teach me to turn my blues eye brown. In this same way, homosexuality cannot be untaught. The APA, America's premier psychological association, has found that homosexuality cannot be \"cured\" and cannot be undone via therapy. [7] Other psychological experts concur. [8, 9] Even groups that have tried to unteach homosexuality have acknowledged their failures. [10] Therefore, people don't choose orientation.C. ConclusionSexual Orientation is not a choice. \"Sexual orientation is not simply a personal characteristic but defines a group of people in which one is likely to discover satisfying and romantically fulfilling relationships as essential components of personal identity.\" [9]Contention Two: NondiscriminationA. It is wrong to discriminate based on things people have no control overPeople are responsible for their choices--not for things they cannot influence or control. Insofar as people cannot control whether or not they are gay, they are not responsible for their orientation. To say that they should be treated differently because of some factor beyond their control is to unfairly discriminate.Just as African Americans should not be persecuted for their skins color, women should not be persecuted for their gender, and people should not be persecuted based on their place of birth, gay people should not be persecuted for being gay. B. Civil Unions are insufficient\"The institution of civil marriage confers a social status and important legal benefits, rights, and privileges. ... Same-sex couples are denied equal access to civil marriage. ... Same-sex couples who enter into a civil union are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to married couples ... The benefits, rights, and privileges associated with domestic partnerships are not universally available, are not equal to those associated with marriage, and are rarely portable.\" [11] We can also look to the Supreme Court's striking down of DOMA as unduly discriminatory and unequal to see that the highest Court in the U.S. conquers that there should be a more equal footing here. [11, 12] C. The Libertarian ParadigmIt is also important to point out here that gay marriage poses no active harm to any one else. Gay individuals getting married does not endanger you or your neighbors, nor does it serve any government benefit to deny gay couples marriage rights. It seems like an inappropriate use of government coercion, therefore, to prevent these loving couples from exercising their autonomy and getting married.D. ConclusionThe concept of Civil Unions is akin to the idea of Separate but Equal. Yet, Separate but Equal is inherently unequal. Gay couples are relegated to second-class unions for something they cannot control. This is inherently unfair.Contention Three: Preemption regarding Homosexual sexA. Set-up\"We can and often do evaluate sexual activity morally: we inquire whether a sexual act\u2014either a particular occurrence of a sexual act (the act we are doing or want to do right now) or a type of sexual act (say, all instances of homosexual fellatio)--is morally good or morally bad.\" [13] Some might claim, like the Catholic Church for instance, that having a homosexual orientation is not immoral, but having homosexual sex is. It is the contrast between the State of Homosexuality and Acts of Homosexuality. B. What makes Sex Wrong: The ContractWhat makes sex wrong--particularly sex within a marriage? Marriage is a contract that implies exclusivity between partners and caring for/honoring one's partner. These themes are echoed and enshrined in a variety of common marriage vows. [14] Therefore, within marriage, it is wrong to commit adultery (violates exclusivity) or to rape or abuse one's spouse (violates honoring/cherishing). Gay couples can be faithful and are fully able to consent. It seems then that the marriage contract itself would not prohibit gay sex.C: What makes Sex Wrong: The TelosSome claim that the purpose of something (its telos) matters when making right/wrong and good/bad judgments. For example, a calculator that solves math problems is a good calculator. Some claim that sex's purpose is to procreate; therefore, good sex is sex that results/could result in procreation. There are several logical problems with the teleological approach:1. Purpose is Nebulous 1A. Purpose cannot always be determined 1B. Objects often have multiple purposes so it is a fruitless task to attempt to synthesize an object's/institution's purpose into one thing as Con attempts to do 2. Purpose =/= should. For example, let's suppose that a gun's purpose is to murder. Simply because a gun's purpose is to murder does not mean that is how it should be used.3. Purpose is not exclusive. Simply because a gun's purpose is to murder does not mean it cannot morally be used for other things (hunting, deterrence, self-defense, sport, etc.)Therefore, the teleological approach is a logical fallacy; a non-sequitur if you will.SOURCES1 - http://en.wikipedia.org...2 - http://www.merriam-webster.com...3 - http://www.apa.org...4 - http://en.wikipedia.org...5 - http://www.mombian.com...6 - http://www.mentalhelp.net...7 - http://www.sgn.org...8 - http://www.mens-wellbeing.com...9 - http://communities.washingtontimes.com...10 - http://www.speroforum.com...11 - http://en.wikipedia.org... 12 - http://www.reuters.com... 13 -http://www.iep.utm.edu...14 - http://www.ehow.com...Thanks!

Though I have wished once or twice that I was asexual (meaning in this context that I find nothing attractive in a romantic way). Though I do have a question on your last comment that I would ask you answer in the comment section if you see it. You said, \"I would believe that over 50% of gay people would love to infact experience the love of a woman rather than a man.\" Why would this be? Or why do you feel it is true?",

            "discussionTitle": "Marriage should be legalized for anyone of age, regardless of sexal orientation",
            "conclusion": "Marriage should be legalized for anyone of age, regardless of sexal orientation",
            "premise": "\"this debate does not include sexual orientation\" If you would read the resolution it says, \"Marriage should be legalized for anyone of age, REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION\". That is to say that as long as someone meets the legal age requirement, they should be allowed to marry. The main point of my resolution is that sexual orientation should not be taken into account when a couple applies for marriage. This happens. My resolution is against these occurences so it is natural that I should argue against them. Just like if a debate was that god does not exist, my argument would clearly be against all arguments that say that he does exist. My argument is that if a person fulfills the age requirement, 17 as you stated they should be allowed to marry my major point is against sexual discrimination. It is in my resolution. \"This debate is specifically about age, not homosexuality. But, if it makes you feel better to vent your anger about sexual orientation, that's perfectly plausible, just not arguable.\" It is not specifically about age it is specifically about sexual discrimination. You put emphasis on the wrong part. I'm not venting out of anger, I am trying to have a debate against sexual discrimination. My resolution mentions age but only as the qualifier for marriage. The main point is that people who are of age should be allowed to marry without sexual orientation coming into the equation. I'm sorry if I provided more than one definition of marriage. Consider this my official definition. Marriage: a social contract between two individuals that unites their lives legally, economically and emotionally. \"Not allowing two people to marry on the basis of their sexual orientation is discrimination. I may use this argument because my resolution is that sexual orientation should not factor in the decision to allow two individuals to marry.\" As I have already shown my argument is against sexual discrimination. Age is not my main point. Therefore this statement is relevant. \"Marriage binds two individuals together both economically and legally. So to be married is to provide a more stable environment for any children that two individuals may care for. If two people have a kid but are not married, there is no laws deciding that one parent may see the child if the couple breaks up. Marriage brings the law into the matter thus making the lives of the couple and their child more stable in the process. There is no reason why a couple should be prohibited from having this kind of security.\" Your refutation to this argument is age related and my resolution focuses on sexual discrimination. Your two arguments all put an emphasis on age. And I am not arguing that anyone should be able to be married as I think you are arguing against. The main point of my argument is that people of age, 17, should be allowed to marry regardless of what their sexual orientation is. I am not trying to debate about age. It is unfortunate that we went the entire debate without actually debating about my resolution. We just debated about where to put the emphasis on my resolution. I apologize if my language may have been unclear or vague. If you would like to debate my actual resolution as I have recently explained I would be glad to. Please answer in the next round. Although this has pretty much been a pointless debate since I missed a round and we just argued about what the resolution meant, I wish you the best of luck in the voting period.",

We come into this world not knowing how to act or what to think, but we learn how to be a good human. To judge a human on what he or she chooses to love is in-human, to be classified as a homosexual is wrong. The creator (who that may be) made people and people have free will they choose whom they can love and if so be loved in return. In addition since the creator gave free will to people does that not in tell whom they may choose to love. Yes it does, they may love and choose whom they want to share their life with. Homosexuality is not wrong, due to the fact that they were born and made like all of other humans. We are created equal because we are all of one race, the human race. To be gay, that is not wrong I say others may say it is, but stick and stones. Islam and Christianity frown upon this and say it is \"sin\" or \"wrong\" but it is not, being closed minded is. The fact of the matter is that too few have wanted to challenge the religious on this topic due to their morals or their churches high ground in the world. either way gay is the new way for some. We as humans must learn to deal with it or be stuck in a time period where the idiocy still rules.",

[2] http://en.wikipedia.org... link 2) \"The sexual revolution (also known as a time of \"sexual liberation\") was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and interpersonal relationships throughout the Western world from the 1960s to the 1980s.[1] Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sex outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships (primarily marriage).[2] Contraception and the pill, public nudity, the normalization of premarital sex, homosexuality and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of abortion all followed\" So when did this occur? The 1960s to the 1980s. Don't forget that, it will be very important. link 1) \"From the late 1950s to early 1990s, several pedophile membership organizations advocated age of consent reform to lower or abolish age of consent laws,[121][122][123] and for the acceptance of pedophilia as a sexual orientation rather than a psychological disorder,[124] and the legalization of child pornography.[123] The efforts of pedophile advocacy groups did not gain any public support[121][123][125][126][127] and today those few groups that have not dissolved have only minimal membership and have ceased their activities other than through a few websites.[123][127][128][129]\" 1950s-1990s. Around the exact same time. What did I say earlier? If you allow them to break one rule, then where is the limit? Now most of my characters will be taken up because of the second half of this argument, so I am going to cut this short because I outlined it a lot earlier. To sum it up, we have men who are marrying video game characters, pillows, and dogs. As stated, we have people claiming homosexuality is okay, and trying to make pedophilia a sexual orientation and not a crime. Where do we draw the line? When we don't set moral standards, people will keep pushing as I stated earlier. My opponent could of easily refuted my argument by citing an opposite claim showing how these trends were existent back hundreds of years ago, not recent. However, that has not happened. I have shown from a logical perspective, as well as with evidence, the consequences of allowing such things to progress. I will now address the evidence and claims proposed by my opponent. [(links 1-5)Slippery Slope] First of all, I don't know why you posted 5 links about the same definition, I know what you meant after link #1. In addition, I thought I outlined the logical progression to my argument, I guess I did not. My argument was that if we allow homosexual marriage to occur and be deemed as normal, other things will inevitable be deemed as normal due to people pushing the boundaries. Like I stated previously with my analogy of the children. [links 6-10)Choose to be Gay] I will go at these one at a time. Link #6) I\"m going to just post some quotes from the articles and comment on them. \"And although the scientific community hasn't yet settled on a precise explanation for sexual orientation, many biologists agree that the fraternal birth order effect is likely the cause of homosexuality in 15 to 30 percent of all gay men.\" The quote says that they haven't specifically found a precise explanation, also it doesn't claim it's 100% guaranteed [15-30 percent of men] \"Ambrosino doesn't accept this. In his essay, he states that \"I could, in fact, change [my orientation] if I tried, if I wanted to. I chose this.\" A man who is a homosexual, is denying what the article is saying. If he has no choice, then why would he lie about this? He is a homosexual, he has nothing to gain from doing this. Link #7) \"Bailey said: \"Sexual orientation has nothing to do with choice. Our findings suggest there may be genes at play and we found evidence for two sets that affect whether a man is gay or straight.\" The keywords are \"suggest\" and \"may\" have evidence, not 100% proof, but \"may\". It is not a fact. \"While the findings revealed genetics accounted for around 30% to 40% of a man's sexuality, the rest was based on social and environmental factors.\" Notice the difference in numbers from the previous link. Also, it is not 100% guaranteed. \"However, there were no genes discovered to determine sexuality that were obvious among all the participants.\" Above is the key quote. It speaks for itself. They found no complete, exact chromosome that proves their hypothesis. Link #8) This link is in sections. Sections 1-3 contain no information on topic and just shows the PDF file. In addition, section 4 just has things such as homosexual conversion therapy and etc. Nothing to prove factually that homosexuality is natural. The PDF file) This is on Page #2 \"There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors\" Just like every other article has claimed, there is no 100% guaranteed fact to prove it. Nothing. No concrete evidence saying homosexuality is natural. I read the rest of the pages. They just have information of psychological effects on kids of homosexuals, places to find more information on homosexual effects, what age should homosexuals come out, etc. Link 9) \"Scientists from San Francisco to Stockholm are finding evidence of what gay people know in their hearts: that sexual orientation is innate. Recent research in Sweden has identified differences in brain structure that may determine whether a person is gay or straight.\" The article does not say that they have evidence, they are looking for it. The also say keywords such as \"may\". Link 10) This is the one she posted mid-paragraph. It has no factual evidence. In addition, her last argument and arguments mid paragraph are what they argued in this link. The difference between cars, air-conditioning, and etc. is that they accomplish their designed task. Air-conditioners do not create pizza, that would be unnatural for an air-conditioner to do. The same thing is with humans and homosexuality. It is not natural for humans to be homosexual, and nothing in the evidence that was posted proves that. Also, I stated earlier my position on sodomy. Condoms themselves are unnatural and so is masturbation. In conclusion, I have used logical statements as well as evidence to show how allowing things such as homosexual marriage can cause other problems in society. For example, to reiterate, the pedophiles who tried to make pedophilia as a sexual orientation instead of it being a psychological disorder. Why would they think it was even possible to accomplish this task? Well, when you know that homosexual was becoming more and more excepted, as well as the sexual revolution, of course they'd think they could accomplish it. It correlates with the logical progression I mentioned in round 2. Moreover, I disproved my opponents perspective that homosexuality is natural and therefore it should be okay to be married. In addition, my opponent brought up the argument about animals which I mentioned earlier in previous rounds. Animals eat each other, is cannibalism okay then too? Therefore, I would say to vote Con and agree that homosexual marriage is wrong.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: Homosexuals are 'born that way'",
            "premise": "Twin studies Twin studies can estimate what percent of a trait is genetic through concordance. If one twin has a trait, and the other twin shares this trait, they are considered concordant [1]. If one twin is gay, and the other twin is gay 50% of the time, the concordance rate is 50%, so the trait is estimated to be around 50% genetic. If a trait is 100% genetic, there is a 100% concordance rate. Twin studies for homosexuality find extremely small genetic influences. Using a massive Australian register with 33,000 participants\u2014or 16,500 twin pairs\u2014finds extremely low concordance rates of 11% for men and 14% for women. So genes likely contribute a low 11-14% portion of homosexuality [2]. 11-14% genetic rates in this field of research are considered weak. To say something is about 10% genetic is not significant at all. To put it into perspective, puberty has been shown to be 90% genetic [3]. To say something is 10% genetic is basically saying genes have almost no effect, and the trait is likely environmentally driven. Many twin studies have been undertaken in order to find what effect the environment has on homosexuality. They tend to find shared environment\u2014the environment both of the twins experience\u2014has 0 effect. But non-shared environment\u2014such as a different perception to an event, being harmed in other ways (many reasons)\u2014contributed to about 54-84% of homosexuality [4]. the *vast majority* of homosexual orientation is dictated by one\u2019s environment, not biological predisposition. There is reason to believe those studies overestimate the genetic effects and underestimate the environmental effects. Shared environmental factors\u2014such as having a gay parent\u2014are often considered \u2018nonshared\u2019 factors, and are often dubbed down by the authors. When this is accounted for the genetic contribution is about 10% [5]. Gay parents If being gay was biologically determined, children of gay parents would not have higher rates of homosexuality. However, children raised by gay parents tend to have much higher rates of homosexuality\u2014indicating environments play a large role in determining homosexual orientation. A massive review recently published amassed a gargantuan amount of literature in order to test whether or not children raised by homosexuals tend to be homosexual. The author concluded\u2014citing 150 studies written by authors who claim there is no difference\u2014finds that there is a difference. Children raised by gay parents tend to be more likely to have nonheterosexual orientations. The study even cites works by authors who have eviscerated the no difference hypothesis. The study argues \u201cchildren of nonheterosexual parents have been more likely to grow up to engage in same-sex sexual behaviors, or to identify as nonheterosexual, than children raised by heterosexual parents\u201d [6]. A study published in 1996 which uses a random sample gives us some pretty interesting results. The study found children of homosexuals were much less likely to report exclusive heterosexuality. 47% of children raised by homosexuals said they were not exclusive heterosexuals (in contrast, about 97% of the overall population is exclusively heterosexual), and were more likely to say their first sexual experience was homosexual [7].A similar study by the same authors\u2014this time using data from different books claiming there were \u2018no differences\u2019 between children raised by homosexuals when compared to heterosexuals\u2014obtained similar results. 27% of children raised by homosexuals identified as homosexual, and 20% of sons reported exclusive homosexuality. This is much higher rate than children raised by heterosexuals [8]. A separate scholar\u2014sociologist Walter Schumm\u2014set out to see whether or not these results could be replicated. Schumm added upon the data set: not only were more anecdotal (book) respondents added, but research from other studies and an anthropological dataset were also added. The results\u2014that children of gay parents were more likely to be gay\u2014\u201cwas confirmed\u201d [9]. Reorientation therapy Arguably the strongest argument against homosexuality being inborn is the fact homosexual orientation often changes. Traits which change are not genetic, but generally are environmentally determined. Although many homosexuals have actually changed without any therapy at all (it happens over time) [10], I will focus upon therapy. Research from as early as 1974 had found reorientation therapy was successful in 40% of cases in reducing unwanted homosexual attraction. A meta-analysis done in 2000 surveyed 30 studies in regards to how often people\u2019s sexual orientation would change if they underwent therapy. A total of 327 subjects were present in the study. Of the sample, 33% reported significant changes in sexuality. A second analysis in 2002 reviewed even more literature than the previous studies. They found 79% who underwent treatment were more heterosexual than those in the control groups who did nothing [11]. Arguably these other studies all suffered from many methodological flaws. In this field of research, a lot of the research is forced to rely upon small sample sizes as not many people wish to undergo therapy. But in 2001, a large study by Robert Spitzer\u2014a phycologist who was instrumental in getting homosexuality removed from the diagnostic list of mental disorders\u2014seemed to have revered his previous position that homosexuality was immutable. The study had one of the largest sample in this field of research with \u201c200 respondents of both genders (143 males, 57 females)\u201d, and found that many individuals \u201creported changes from homosexual to heterosexual orientation lasting 5 years or more\u201d [12]. What is interesting is that a large amount of those surveyed\u201441 percent\u2014had been openly gay prior to conversion therapy. Many charge that those who \u2018changed\u2019 didn\u2019t really change, just that they were repressing their feelings. But the fact 41% were comfortable with homosexuality\u2014at least to be open about it\u2014became bisexual or heterosexual really indicates that real change does occur, and that the therapy is often very effective. An exact number of those who became heterosexual is around 64% for men and 44% for women (obtained \u2018good heterosexual functioning\u2019). A similar study published one year later involved a survey of 822 individuals who had obtained reorientation therapy. A law review citing the article noted how the study \u201cBefore counseling, 68% of the participants in the survey perceived themselves as exclusively homosexual, and another 22% stated that they were more homosexual than heterosexual. After their treatment or therapy, only 13% perceived themselves as exclusively homosexual, while 34% described themselves as exclusively heterosexual.\u201d[13] So what environmental factors cause homosexuality? If my opponent can demonstrate a strong biological cause, this becomes refuted. However, I think it is important to clarify *what* type of factors have the potential to cause homosexuality. Some of the factors are discussed above. Social setting seems to be an important factor in the development of homosexuality. Being raised by a gay parent seems to be a risk, as well as being sexually assaulted in a homosexual manner [7][8]. Some societies seem to *promote* homosexuality which leads to increased homosexual orientation [6]. For men, some factors are \u201curban birthplace and an absent or unknown father\u201d, and for women it is \u201can urban birthplace, maternal death during adolescence, and mother-absence.\u201d A US study found \u201cdegree of urbanization \u2026 growing up in a more pro-homosexual region \u2026 a woman with a college degree was nine times more likely to identify herself as non-heterosexual \u2026 environments that sanction and/or promote homosexuality induce more individuals to engage in homosexual behavior.\u201d[14] Wait, college makes you gay?! Sounds odd, but it isn\u2019t what you think. The reason those who are homosexual are more educated is because many universities actually promote homosexuality. This theory has been supported by an abundance of evidence. Urbanization and a \u2018pro\u2019 gay society are strong factors in homosexuality development. Amongst western countries, the percentage of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals amongst a population varies greatly\u2014indicating social factors help promote homosexuality. Indeed, a genetic trait\u2014like height\u2014has very little variation amongst the western world. Homosexuality, however, varies significantly [15]. The following graphs demonstrate this (height vs male homosexuality): Evidence which supports the idea that society causes homosexuality is that overtime homosexual experimentation has increased. In the UK it has increased from 1% to 2.8% [16]. Animals? There is a difference between homosexual behavior and homosexual orientation. There are no known animals who have *long term* homosexual relationships. What occurs in animals is not directly applicable to what occurs in humans. Ram homosexuality supports the idea environmental factors cause homosexuality. Indeed, many argue the hormone differences between gay rams and straight rams prove homosexuality is innate amongst animals, however ram hormone levels change in response to environmental experiences. The environment (e.g. sex deprivation) seems to drive ram homosexuality [17]. 1. http://tinyurl.com...; 2. http://tinyurl.com... 3. Ibid. 4. http://tinyurl.com... 5. Ibid. 6.

My rebuttals: I do not agree with my opponent in his claim that homosexuality is a sexual behavior. I would like to clarify the difference between sexual behavior and sexual orientation/attraction. Sexual Behavior: The method and/or means in which a person chooses to express their sexual orientation. Sexual Orientation/Attraction: the direction of a persons emotional and physical desire, toward people of the opposite sex, same sex, or both sexes. If needed proof to distinguish the difference, how does one know they are heterosexual if they've never had any physical contact with a person of the opposite sex? Are they a clean slate? No, they are simply attracted to others of the opposite sex. Sexual Orientation determines sexual behavior, not vice versa. Polygamy, pedophilia, bestiality and incest are all examples of sexual behavior, and there are legitimate reasons why marriage among these behaviors should remain illegal: Polygamy: Takes advantage of marriage benefits most especially. Imagine an employer having to pay insurance to a worker with who knows how many wives! This is unfair to other couples and to the government providing them with this abundance of benefits. Bestiality: Are animals covered by our constitution? Homosexuals are human beings, whom ARE covered by our constitution. Pedophilia: Children do not have the mental capacity and/or ability to consent over and adult. Incest: If a man loves his sister, there are still many \"fish in the sea\" that man would be able to marry. If that man were a homosexual, he has no options, for he can not marry any other man. I am aware of the stigmas between many of these sexual behaviors mentioned and can understand why many would associate homosexuality into them. But when analyzing the difference between sexual behavior and sexual orientation, one can clearly see that homosexuality just does not share the same label with these behaviors.",

Because these two expressions are listed among the list of sexual orientations, there is a lot of confusion around the separation between gender and sexuality. Much of this confusion could be eliminated by removing the two words from the acronym and creating a separate acronym for gender non-conforming folks.

            "conclusion": "Children need to be protected from the gays and their homosexual agenda.",
            "premise": "The Actual Resolution: Gay couples should not be allowed to adopt children. Gay couples should be allowed to adopt children since this is a policy that would be in the best interests of children, families, and society as a whole. Further, arbitrarily denying certain couples the ability to adopt children because of their sexual orientation is simply unacceptably detrimental to the aims of a civil society, and it is a position that is perpetuated by nothing other than flagrant discrimination. Of course, people's ignorance plays a large role in this matter. Some people have come to believe \u2013 almost invariably on bad evidence \u2013 that there is something fundamentally wrong with the minds of gay people. It's likely that many factors play into this sort of thinking, however, the point remains; many of the views people have about gays are simply not based on science, reason or empirical data. While some scientists may disagree about particular aspects of certain theories regarding sexual orientation, one thing is now universally agreed upon by the psychological and medical experts who specialize on this subject: there is nothing psychologically, emotionally, socially, mentally or morally wrong with people that are gay, and one's sexual orientation is mainly not a conscious choice. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to suppose that gay couples should not be allowed to raise children. C1: Evidence indicates that homosexuality is a normal sexual orientation that is not consciously chosen. There is nothing about gay individuals that makes them inadequate parents, and thus there is no reason to suppose that they shouldn't be allowed to raise children. And despite what many deeply pious (i.e. ignorant) people may believe, there is no reason whatsoever to think that homosexual orientations are anything other than normal and healthy variations of human nature. In fact, compelling evidence and recent scientific studies from both neuroscience and psychology now confirm this notion to an astonishing degree. Indeed, many of the negative ideas that people have held over the years about homosexuality are simply unsupportable in light of the mounds of evidence that has come forth on this subject. Luckily, the evidence that is being called upon can be found everywhere. As a result, there are good reasons to suppose that the sexual preference gays hold will not negatively impact their life or character. As it turns out, there is now compelling evidence \u2013 especially the evidence coming from neuroscience research \u2013 which indicates that a person's sexual orientation is determined in large part by the structure of their mind. For example, recent functional neuro-imaging experiments done by Ivanka Savic, Hans Berglund, and Per Lindstr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm indicate two human pheromones - the progesterone derivative 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and an estrogen-like steroid estra-1,3-5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST) \u2013 arouse sexual orientation specific responses that are key to activating the neural circuits of the anterior hypothalamus of those with a heterosexual and homosexual orientation. [1] To give some background information, it is important to point out that the anterior hypothalamus has been shown to be essential in integrating sensory cues that are involved in sexual behavior and sexual preference. Further, the study in question demonstrated that the anterior hypothalamus of the gay men in the experiment responded much in the same way to the pheromone (AND) that the anterior hypothalamus of heterosexual women did. Consequently, it is now fairly certain that one's sexual preference is largely involuntarily acquired, because it is not reasonable to believe that any person can willfully control the way in which their brain responds to electrochemical stimuli. If it were true that a person's sexual orientation were entirely a choice, then there should be no such correlations in the neural patterns between gay men and heterosexual females with respect to their sexual preference. Therefore, the evidence aforementioned demonstrates with much certainty that a person's mind does play a large role in determining whether that person is gay or straight. Some may be ignorant of these facts, but the evidence is clear; sexual orientation is not determined in large part by a conscious choice. Additionally, organizations with the most educated insights on this subject such as, The American Medical Association, The American Psychiatric Association, The American Psychological Association, The American Psychoanalytic Association, The American Academy of Pediatrics, and The National Academy of Social Workers all agree on this topic: homosexuality is a normal orientation that should not be treated or viewed as a mental disorder, and sexual orientation is not a choice. [2] In particular, The National Institute of Mental Health did various scientific studies regarding homosexuality. [3] In the data that was accumulated by them, they determined that their \"subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality, rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation.\" In light of these findings, The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973 while maintaining that, \"homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.\" [3] Later on, after they reviewed the data from this research, The American Psychological Association followed suit and adopted the same view, with other science organizations following them shortly thereafter. [3] Thus, it should be obvious that homosexuality is not some sort of mental disorder that leads to adverse affects in gay individuals. Given these facts, there is no reason whatsoever for anyone to be anxious about gay couples adopting children; they are just as normal, virtuous, and well-adjusted as anyone else. ::Conclusion:: Not allowing two people to adopt a child based on their sexual preference is nothing more than an arbitrary form of discrimination. This is especially true since it is now clear that gay people's sexual preference is both normal and not subject to change. Simply put, there is no process of ratiocination, religious or otherwise, that can justifiably demonstrate why children should be denied access to the loving homes and families that gay couples can provide. Moreover, the \"homosexual agenda,\" if such a thing even exists, is in no way something that should be opposed or feared. For thousands of years gay couples have been the victims of gay bashing (both figuratively and literally). It is, therefore, imperative that society takes steps to protect this vulnerable minority group and also insure that they have equal protections under the law. And allowing them to adopt children that need loving families will bring the world one step closer to actualizing this goal. Sources: 1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... 2. YouTube - Gay Education.

Sodom & Gomorrah showed his lack of tolerance for other sexualities as do the rules that he wrote for the Jews to follow. The Christian religion is no different with some being condemned to Hell, explicitly for homosexuality mind. Islam is also similar, as is practically every religion, regarding homosexuality.

Marriage: the legal or religious ceremony that formalizes the decision of two people to live as a married couple, including the accompanying social festivities Sexual orientation: the clear, persistent desire of a person for affiliation with one sex rather than the other My argument will go as follows: -Not allowing two people to marry each other solely on the basis of their sexual orientation is discrimination and is inherently wrong, just as it it wrong to discriminate on the basis of race or gender. -Marriage is about two people making a commitment to each other and not about what their sexual preference is or whether or not they want to have kids. -Marriage provides a more stable environment for couples who do choose to raise children. -Marriage is a civil right for consenting adults that is taken for granted everyday by straight couples. -Prohibition of marriage based on sexual orientation is the same thing as the laws passed before that prohibited interracial marriage.",

Granting asylum to people on the basis of sexual orientation sends a clear message to the international community that it is not okay to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and that the West not only strongly disapproves of this behaviour, but that, more importantly, they will take active steps to counter-act your discriminatory policies. This has immense impact on pressuring governments to change their policies. What is important to note here is that there is a gradual normative consensus that is manufactured under this system. Through the use of soft power, the policies of nations are slowly but surely moderated and a global consensus is created. Not only can this policy influence current state behaviour, but that the influence and change that creates becomes part of a larger global move towards universal acceptance of the norm and the diffusion of that idea throughout all strata of society. This is important in two ways: Creating a discourse centred on a universal consensus against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Therefore making discourse be dominated by agreement with this principle and thus creating a dialogue that creates an accepting atmosphere through disseminating the norm of acceptance throughout the international community and global society. This is important is forging international legal protections for the rights of the LGBT community. International law arrives from a consensus of opinion around a particular issue and its need to be legislated on. Making sexual orientation grounds for asylum creates the framework that explicitly states that legislative international protection is necessary for these groups. This policy therefore begins that process in and of itself. However, more importantly, the reduction of opposition and trend of nations removing discriminatory laws against sexual orientation consolidates this statement of legislative need and furthers the cause for international protection. Making sexual orientation a category for asylum not only saves lives, but also sends a strong and influential message that helps craft policy in nations who use discrimination as a tool of oppression against the LGBT community. This begins the foundations of global consensus on equality for all sexual orientations and a lasting solution to the issue of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.",

Definitions: Sexual Reproduction: The production of new living organisms by combining genetic information from two individuals of different types (sexes). Asexual Reproduction: Reproduction without the use of gametes. Justice: Giving each their due. Contention #1: The self-sacrifice of asexual reproduction proves its superiority. It is very clear that processes such as budding and fission result in the death or shrinkage of the original cell. This is clearly an altruistic behavior, and altruism clearly supports the ultimate value of life. This self-sacrifice provides an external precedent that would cause more individuals to sacrifice themselves not just in the name of reproduction but also for the benefit of the entire community, which supports both life and the universal quality of life. Contention #2: Asexual reproduction is faster and more efficient, and thus supports life and altruism Sexual reproduction generally can take a length of time ranging from months to years. Asexual reproduction can occur in milliseconds. Although individuals must sacrifice the aesthetic value of giving birth in order to achieve this efficiency, relinquishing that aesthetic value would benefit the entire community with the faster reproduction, showing that asexual reproduction supports both life and altruism. Contention #3: Genetic coding is not altruistic and harms life. Genetic codes can help produce several inherited disabilities. These disabilities could be mitigated through asexual reproduction, where genetic coding would not be required for reproduction. Although individuals would have to sacrifice the aesthetic value of raising a disabled child, asexual reproduction would therefore benefit both offspring and the community and support life.",

In this debate, the overarching themes that I'm going to focus on are morality (with a strong focus on consequentialism) and societal welfare. With this ideal in place, I will move on toward my contentions.Contention 1: Anti-bullying legislation focusing on sexual orientation is practical.

The resulting effects from such legislation show us the practicality, and analyzingSub-point 1a: Bullying is common against members of differing sexual orientation, and this has severe negative effects.Sexual orientation is certainly one of the largest reasons for bullying in the United States: \"According to GLSEN\u2019s 2009 National School Climate Survey, which polled more than 7,000 self-identified gay and straight students between the ages of thirteen and twenty-one from all fifty states and the District of Columbia from 2008 to 2009, 61 percent of all students felt unsafe at school because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation whereas only 9.8 percent of all students felt unsafe because of their gender and 7.6 percent of all students felt unsafe because of their race or ethnicity (Kosciw et al. 2010).\" The methodology of this survey, by the way, is legitimate considering the largeness of the sample and how widespread it is throughout the United States, but the actual population size of the United States is still 10 times larger than the sample size. Other surveys conclude the idea that this is a problem: \"LGBT youth regularly face insidious verbal and physical abuse. A recent nationally representative survey of LGBT teens by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) found that 84.6% of those surveyed had been verbally harassed, 40.1% had been physically harassed (pushed or shoved), and 18.8% had been physically assaulted (punched, kicked, or injured with a weapon) because of his or her sexual orientation in the past year.\" The effects that come from such bullying are incredibly negative: \"The detrimental impact of this climate is apparent in the host of negative outcomes that attend gay youth: LGBT children and teenagers report dramatically higher levels of depression and anxiety, as well as decreased levels of self-esteem relative to their heterosexual peers. Of course, gay students are not inherently more likely to experience mental and physical harm; rather, it is \u201ca direct result of the hatred and prejudice that surround[s] them.\u201dSub-point 1b: Legislation is effective, and alternatives are few. The many legislations in the United States after the suicides of 2010 prove the effectiveness of legislation against LGBT bullying: \"Over the years, a small number of states have chosen to extend explicit protection to victims who are bullied based on enumerated personal characteristics. Although enumeration remains a minority position, the most recent spate of anti-bullying statutes offers a promising indication that this may be shifting. Illinois, New Hampshire, New York, and Washington\u2014over half of the states enacting statutes in 2010\u2014provide a list of prohibited bases for bullying behavior, including sexual orientation. These lists are uniformly nonexclusive,to highlight for teachers and school officials certain types of bullying as absolutely prohibited while still reaching bullying based on unlisted characteristics. New York\u2019s statute, for instance, encompasses but is not limited to \u201cconduct, verbal threats, intimidation or abuse based on a person\u2019s actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender or sex.\u201d Gay rights organizations strongly support enumeration, and research indicates that statutes that specifically identify sexual orientation as an impermissible target for bullying lead to a greater decrease in LGBT bullying than those statutes that do not. The Supreme Court, too, has stated that statutory \u201c[e]numeration is the essential device used to make the duty not to discriminate concrete and to provide guidance for those who must comply.\u201d Similar numbers of students report hearing homophobic remarks frequently in schools with non-enumerated anti-bullying laws (74.3% of students) as in those with no laws at all (75% of students). However, those enrolled in schools with enumerated policies experience less bullying, feel safer overall, and report that teachers are significantly more likely to intervene in instances of anti-gay bullying. These statistics underscore the tremendous potential for enumerated anti-gay bullying legislation to positively impact the lives of LGBT youth.\" Alternatives are few and ineffective: \"The impact of an unwelcoming school climate is aggravated for students who lack a protective buffer of social support. Studies showthat positive parental practices protect adolescents from involvement in both bullying perpetration and victimization, but sexual minority youth are less likely to receive this support at home. Approximately one third of gay and lesbian teens have suffered verbal abuse or physical violence from a family member as a consequence of coming out, and one half have experienced some form of parental rejection. Although some theorists argue that being an \u201canonymous and diffuse\u201d minority is beneficial to sexual minorities, it can also make it more difficult for LGBT youth to identify similar individuals, particularly within their own age group. Facing rejection at home and school because of their sexual orientation, LGBT youth may experience a \u201cnarrow view of the options available to deal with recurrent family discord, rejection, or failure [that] contributes to a decision to commit suicide.\u201d\" Connolly, Lisa C. \"Anti-Gay Bullying in Schools--Are Anti-Bullying Statutes the Solution?\" New York University Law Review 87 (2012): 248-83.

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and I must stand on the PRO side of this debate and affirm the resolution. In this debate, the overarching themes that I'm going to focus on are morality (with a strong focus on consequentialism) and societal welfare. With this ideal in place, I will move on toward my contentions.Contention 1: Anti-bullying legislation focusing on sexual orientation is practical. Because bullying leads to negative effects for the individual as well as society and bullying as a result of sexual orientation is so heavily common, a piece of legislation from government focusing on sexual orientation is heavily preferrable. The resulting effects from such legislation show us the practicality, and analyzingSub-point 1a: Bullying is common against members of differing sexual orientation, and this has severe negative effects.Sexual orientation is certainly one of the largest reasons for bullying in the United States: \"According to GLSEN\u2019s 2009 National School Climate Survey, which polled more than 7,000 self-identified gay and straight students between the ages of thirteen and twenty-one from all fifty states and the District of Columbia from 2008 to 2009, 61 percent of all students felt unsafe at school because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation whereas only 9.8 percent of all students felt unsafe because of their gender and 7.6 percent of all students felt unsafe because of their race or ethnicity (Kosciw et al. 2010).\" The methodology of this survey, by the way, is legitimate considering the largeness of the sample and how widespread it is throughout the United States, but the actual population size of the United States is still 10 times larger than the sample size. Other surveys conclude the idea that this is a problem: \"LGBT youth regularly face insidious verbal and physical abuse. A recent nationally representative survey of LGBT teens by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) found that 84.6% of those surveyed had been verbally harassed, 40.1% had been physically harassed (pushed or shoved), and 18.8% had been physically assaulted (punched, kicked, or injured with a weapon) because of his or her sexual orientation in the past year.\" The effects that come from such bullying are incredibly negative: \"The detrimental impact of this climate is apparent in the host of negative outcomes that attend gay youth: LGBT children and teenagers report dramatically higher levels of depression and anxiety, as well as decreased levels of self-esteem relative to their heterosexual peers. Of course, gay students are not inherently more likely to experience mental and physical harm; rather, it is \u201ca direct result of the hatred and prejudice that surround[s] them.\u201dSub-point 1b: Legislation is effective, and alternatives are few. The many legislations in the United States after the suicides of 2010 prove the effectiveness of legislation against LGBT bullying: \"Over the years, a small number of states have chosen to extend explicit protection to victims who are bullied based on enumerated personal characteristics. Although enumeration remains a minority position, the most recent spate of anti-bullying statutes offers a promising indication that this may be shifting. Illinois, New Hampshire, New York, and Washington\u2014over half of the states enacting statutes in 2010\u2014provide a list of prohibited bases for bullying behavior, including sexual orientation.

            "conclusion": "homosexuality is an unchangeable trait that you're born with",
            "premise": "Since Pro has not set the BoP, we can assume that the BoP is placed on Pro. All I need to do is provide a reasonable case homosexuality is something you are not born with.My Case:I would like to assert homosexuality is caused by nurture; not nature. In biology, we learn that we have traits. These can be determined by certain factors. These factors are physical, environment, and spiritual in nature. A physical factor would be a certain level of melanin causing pigmentation. An environmental factor could be growing up in a bad place in town; causing the person to be on constant alert. A spiritual factor could be someone keeping their virginity until marriage for their religion. While some traits are brought on by physical factors, our behavior is mostly shaped by our environmental and spiritual factors. A human's sexuality falls into this category of being shaped by environmental factors. Eight major studies in identical twins show that homosexuality is not genetic. As quoted by the article:\"Identical twins have the same genes or DNA. They are nurtured in equal prenatal conditions. If homosexuality is caused by genetics or prenatal conditions and one twin is gay, the co-twin should also be gay. \u201cBecause they have identical DNA, it ought to be 100%,\u201d Dr. Whitehead notes. But the studies reveal something else. \u201cIf an identical twin has same-sex attraction the chances the co-twin has it are only about 11% for men and 14% for women.\u201d Because identical twins are always genetically identical, homosexuality cannot be genetically dictated. \u201cNo-one is born gay,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe predominant things that create homosexuality in one identical twin and not in the other have to be post-birth factors.\u201d The predominant things that create homosexuality in one identical twin and not in the other have to be post-birth factors. Dr. Whitehead believes same-sex attraction (SSA) is caused by \u201cnon-shared factors,\u201d things happening to one twin but not the other, or a personal response to an event by one of the twins and not the other. For example, one twin might have exposure to pornography or sexual abuse, but not the other. One twin may interpret and respond to their family or classroom environment differently than the other. \u201cThese individual and idiosyncratic responses to random events and to common environmental factors predominate,\u201d he says.\" (1)\"Humans display a wide range of sexual feelings and behavior. Nowhere is this more prominent than in American culture which is saturated with images and references to sex and romantic love from television advertisements to billboard displays. Often, our identities as individuals are wrapped up with our romantic tendencies and how these play out in our relationships. Sometimes an individual\u2019s sexual behavior is used as a barometer for his or her moral or religious beliefs. Our collective sense of how human sexuality should be expressed is revealed through the rights and liberties that structure our lives as citizens. We are sexual beings, yet this does not mean that we are born homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Our sexual expression can change over time, towards different people, through different experiences. A lack of understanding about this type of human variability often leads to a perspective that our genes define who we are. Each of the above areas of research displays findings that hinge on the assumption that a given individual\u2019s sexual expression neatly fits into the categories \u201cstraight\u201d and \u201cgay.\u201d By not considering evidence of human sexual fluidity, debates regarding origins and biology are not substantial or complete. Current efforts fail to tell the whole story. And even if we were to accept that the assigned sexual orientation of the individuals participating in these studies accurately reflected their lifelong expression, conclusive proof of a link between this and their genes has yet to be found.\"(2)It is clear that I have made the point that homosexuality depends on factors that are determined outside the womb. Thus, I have fulfilled my BoP. However, if my opponent still wants evidence, I'll be happy to provide Pro which such material. How can you change a person's sexuality? You can change it under the right environmental conditions. Rebuttals:Addressing opponent's 1st and 2nd argument:\"But all of this evidence rests on the notion that sexual orientation is fixed and that individuals are either \u201cstraight\u201d or \u201cgay.\u201d Researchers in these studies did not indicate whether individuals in their sample provided an extensive account of their sexual histories and tastes. Rather, individuals in the samples were simply asked to define their sexual orientation. In doing this, researchers set up a false dichotomy whereby the individuals studied are forced into one of two categories neither of which may accurately account for the full range of their sexual expression. Additionally, it is difficult to conclude with certainty that because a trait shows up more often among biologically-related siblings, it is inherited. In fact, many such traits appear to be linked to distinctly non-biological factors. Diet, drug addiction, religious and political orientation, and career paths are just a few of the behaviors that cluster in families due to shared social influences. Indeed, a shared environment can often produce a clustering of all types of behavior patterns. It is doubtful that any study could be designed with sufficient sensitivity to exclude this possibility. The methods used in family linkage studies, which depend upon recruitment from gay and lesbian magazines, websites, and organizations, carry a clear risk of ascertainment bias. Gay brother pairs may be more interested in responding than gay men with straight brothers, given the potential for homophobia among siblings and the substantial number of homosexuals who are \u201cin the closet\u201d toward their families. Twins or siblings who are both gay might find the subject interesting or already suspect a genetic basis of their shared sexual orientation, thus making them more likely to participate . In order to exclude these potentially confounding factors, more recent studies have drawn participants from random samples. A study in 2000 of 4,500 twins from the Australian Twin Registry by Bailey and colleagues showed only a 30% rate of homosexuality shared between both male and female identical twins.\" (2)Also, sources. Provide them. However, this proves such sources to be unfit to use.Response to argument 3:I have addressed this in my earlier argument.Response to argument 4, 5, 6, and 7:Thus, you admit some do change. This contradicts your stance that homosexuality is set from inside the womb. Also, source. Provide them.There are stories of people changing their sexuality in time; whether it be to heterosexuality of homosexuality. (3) (4) Again, this contradicts your claim. To sum them up, these are stories where the therapy actually worked and when people decided to be gay. In fact, a woman in source number four is a homosexual; yet acknowledges said therapies work in some occasions. Response to argument 8 and 9:Refer to my earlier argument.As for the \"God\" argument, I used to be Catholic. They taught in the Church that humans were given the right to autonomy; which is the ability to make an unbiased decision. With certain decisions, environmental factors could arise causing homosexuality; fulfilling God's right for our autonomy.I'm out of characters. I appreciate your time.

            "premise": "Thank you, Pro. The debate seems to focus on 2 issues. Response A: Pro concedes that other groups may be disadvantage similarly to homosexuals and advocates legislation in their cases as well. The question becomes now \"where do we draw the line?\" Let's go back to the resolution which explicitly advocates anti-bullying legislation focusing on sexual orientation - and I ask, how does one focus on an issue if not by discriminating against others? It's apparent that Pro wants to create a caste system of discrimination where certain types of bullying are treated as worse than others. This brings us to our next point where I believe the crux of the debate lies. However, before I go there I'd like to hear Pro state one group which would not be covered by anti-bullying laws and how such a view is justified. In essence, Pro can \"open the floodgates\" for any disadvantage I name without a problem - but to specifically focus on sexual orientation inherently requires discriminating against other forms of bullying and outright stating that the sufferers of that abuse - however severe - do not warrant the same attention as those who face bullying due to sexual orientation. Response B: I'm still willing to grant the hypothetical world where GLBT is the only group that is disproportionately bullied. Would legislation in such a case then be justified? I'd say still no. Certainly since group A might be discriminated against at a higher percentage than B, C, D doesn't mean discrimination doesn't occur to B, C, D. Moreover, this says nothing of the severity of the discrimination/bullying. I would advocate legal evaluation on much more case-by-case basis rather than sweeping legislation that makes allowances for members of one group and not others regardless of severity. My point remains that non-GLBT bullying victims deserve the exact same treatment as GLBT victims depending on the severity and frequency. As soon as we begin targeting one group for special treatment we inherently ignore the plights of other groups.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for this debate. Since it is only a one round debate, I'll just give it all I got. I have done some researching and studying regardings this topic and here I will post my findings and prove that you are indeed born gay. Scientific researchers specializing in human sexuality have shown that homosexuality is genetic (and that people are born gay). I am unaware of any study that has ever suggested that sexual orientation is a choice. Scientific research from October 2004 that was replicated in June 2008 stated that scientists have found that women tend to have more children when they inherit the same genetic factors linked to homosexuality in men. This fertility boost more than compensates for the lack of offspring fathered by gay men, and keeps the \u201cgay\u201d genetic factors in circulation. A lead researcher said \"You have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say it's against nature because it doesn't lead to reproduction. We found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund\" and that their findings offered \"a solution to the Darwinian paradox and an explanation of why natural selection does not progressively eliminate homosexuals.\" A 2005 study reported genetic scans showing a clustering of the same genetic pattern among gay men on three chromosomes - chromosomes 7, 8, and 10. The regions on chromosome 7 and 8 were associated with male sexual orientation regardless of whether the man got them from his mother or father. The regions on chromosome 10 were only associated with male sexual orientation if they were inherited from the mother. A study published in Human Genetics in February 2006 examined X chromosome inactivation in mothers of gay sons and mothers whose sons were not gay. Researchers found extreme differences between women who had gay sons and women who did not. A study from 2006 said that researchers have known for years that a man's likelihood of being gay rises with the number of older biological brothers, but the new study found that the so-called \"fraternal birth order effect\" persists even if gay men were raised away from their biological families & that \"the research suggests that the development of sexual orientation is influenced before birth.\"Seeing the overwhelming evidence, I hope that the audience agrees with me!

            "discussionTitle": "Being Transgender is not a Sin",
            "conclusion": "Being Transgender is not a Sin",
            "premise": "Being Transgender is a Congenital ConditionTransgender women are women because of biological reality. Many studies show that transgender women's brain are physiologically female. In this sense, transgenders are in the same boat as intersex people. Both faces biological reality, so to speak.Male-to-female transsexuals have female neuron numbers in a limbic nucleus (Kruijver et al. , May 2000). In their study of six MTF GID sufferers, a femaleR08;sized BSTc was present in all subjects. Additionally, the size of the BSTc was not influenced by taking sex hormones in adulthood. This implies that these individuals had a powerful biological force compelling them to be female, rather than just a psychological conviction\" (Nicola Tugnet et al. 2007).For a number of sexually dimorphic brain structures or processes, signs of feminisation or masculinisation are observable in transsexual individuals, which, during hormonal treatment, partly seem to further adjust to characteristics of the desired sex (Smith ES, 2015). According to a 2009 study, being a male to female transsexualism has a genetic cause. Australian researchers have identified a significant link between a gene involved in testosterone action and male-to-female transsexualism.A significant association was identified between transsexualism and the AR allele, with transsexuals having longer AR repeat lengths than non-transsexual male control subjects (p=.04). (Hary L et al. 2009). Not all cisgender women (women born with XX chromosome) experience \"menstrual cramps, pregnancy and dozens of other things women experience.\" For instance, a cisgender woman with Mayer-Rockitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) does not have a uterus or a womb. Studies show that transgenders are born that way. The strongest evidence to suggest that abnormal prenatal brain differentiation may lead to gender identity disorder comes from a recent study examining hypothalamic brain nuclei in men with gender identity disorder ( Zhou et al. 1995) The fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. However, since sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place in the first two months of pregnancy and sexual differentiation of the brain starts in the second half of pregnancy, these two processes can be influenced independently, which may result in extreme cases in trans-sexuality. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation (Garcia-Falgueras A 2010). RebuttalsMost gender dysphoric children grow up to be gay or lesbian.Patients with non-persistent GD (whether children, adolescent or adult) is not a case of Irreversible Transgenderism because by very definition GD is persistent cross-gender identification.Only 2.5% to 20% of all cases of GID in childhood and adolescence are the initial manifestation of irreversible transsexualism (Alexander Corte et al. 2008).Most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty. Children with persistent GID are characterized by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. With regard to sexual orientation, the most likely outcome of childhood GID is homosexuality or bisexuality (Drescher J et al. 2014).Of children with even severe gender dysphoria and cross-sex identification, about 85% do not develop a persistent transsexual identity in adolescence. Reliable indicators are not so far available regarding which gender dysphoric children cease to be so in puberty and who develop transsexual identity. Medical interventions are therefore not warranted in pre-pubertal children In light of current knowledge, transsexual identity in adolescence is persistent and medical interventions may be appropriate (Riittakerttu Kaltiala-Heino et al. 2015). Con, note that sexual orientation is different from gender identity. Do not confuse the two. Deuteronomy 22:5Deuteronomy 22:5 prohibits cross-dressing. CAH and other forms of intersex conditions with GD diagnosis (e.g. XX male syndrome etc.) show us that genes and genitalia are not the determiners of gender but the brain itself. Thus, if the scope of Deut 22:5 were universal, then, intersex people with GD is wrongfully included in that proscription since modern science hasn't yet been available in the ancient world. Yet in our time Deut 22:5 is not applicable to intersex people with GD since all of today's Christian denomination encourage sex reassignment and gender transition to such people! Why not encourage sex reasignment to transsexuals with GD as well? Bottom line: GD diagnosis covers both intersex people and transgenders. Patients with GD (whether trans or intersex) equally deserve to receive medical treatment for GD. 1 Corinthians 6:9The only Biblical usage of malakoi [male prostitutes, NRSV] in the context of sinful behavior is found in 1 Corinthians 6:9. Since malakoi is side by side arsenokites [man lying in bed], it connotes same-sex sexual activity. In the context, it refers to heterosexual males commiting homoeroticism as a form of idolatry (cf. 1 Corinthians 6:17-18). Bottom line: Con's argument is wishful thinking.1 Corinthians 6:9 does not talk about people with GD because if it were, then, intersex people will be included in that proscription! Deuteronomy 23:1Deuteronomy 23:1 is clearly about eunuchs. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus himself welcomes eunuchs! Therefore, [Jesus] cogently argued that Deuteronomy 23:1 is now null.Psalm 139:13God is perfect (Psalm 18:30). Every one is created by God from birth even from the womb (Psalm 139:13). Blindness is not part of the original design (Genesis 1). Judaism believed that being blind from birth is a sin (cf. John 9:3). Being an eunuch is excluded in Judaism (Deut 23:1). The argument of Con holds no water because in the New Testament, both conditions were welcomed by Jesus Christ himself! There's a man blind from birth (John 9:1) and there's a man eunuch from birth (Matthew 19:12). Birth defects are not mistakes but God's way of displaying his glory(cf. John 9:1-3; Matthew 19:11-12). Neither Eve were created blind nor were Adam created an eunuch! The Biblical Ethics of Gender Reassignment You say, \"I am allowed to do anything\"--but not everything is good for you. You say, \"I am allowed to do anything\"-- beneficial. 1 Corinthians 10:23 (NLT) Dear friend, I hope all is well with you and that you are as healthy in body as you are strong in spirit. 3 John 1:2 (NLT) The Bible allows gender reassignment since those medical treatments are good and beneficial for the health of patients with Gender Dysphoria. has been demonstrated as the most effective treatment for patients affected by gender dysphoria (or gender identity disorder), in which patients do not recognize their gender (sexual identity) as matching their genetic and sexual characteristics (Selvaggi G, 2011). Although current transgender treatment is relatively invasive and does not address the problem completely, it is the most successful intervention available. Studies report very high transgender patient satisfaction with sexual reassignment. Thus far, the largest evaluation has been a survey of Dutch transgender patients. Among the 1,285 patients surveyed, 1,280 were satisfied (Joshua D. Safer et al. 2008).I can't understand why people suffering with GD is being tauted as sinning. People who twist God's word to say what it doesn't say is the one sinning! Bottom line: Being transgender is not a sin because any patient with GD diagnosis receiving medical treatment is not sinning.",

            "premise": "This should make for a good debate. Thanks for the acceptance of the challenge. --- \"JESUS SAYS NOTHING ABOUT SAME SEX BEHAVIOR AT ALL... THE JEWISH PROPHETS ARE SILENT ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY\" My opponent concurred that, \"That is true.\" However, he went on to explain that Jesus and Paul condemned sexual sin butwho is to say that homosexuality is sexual sin? It is a natural genetic and social occurance according to many leading studies and sources including the American Psychology Association. My opponent also mentioned that homosexuality as a taboo topic was not the doing of a religious group. I disagree with this but it is irrelevant to the topic of whether or not the Bible excludes homosexuality as acceptable, which it does not. --- \"IT IS NOT IMMORAL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF HAVING CHILDREN.\" My opponent and I agree on this aspect of this topic. Point dropped. --- \"THE CITIES OF SODOM AND GAMORA WERE NOT DESTROYED BECAUSE OF THEIR HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR BUT RATHER BECAUSE... OF THEIR ARROGANT WAYS.\" We both agree, seemingly, homosexuality was not the reason Sodom and Gamora was destroyed. Rather, it did, more than likely, have to do with sexual sin this, more than likely, did not include homosexuality. --- \"LEVITICUS IS A HOLINESS CODE WRITTEN 3,000 YEARS AGO.\" Opponent - \"The New Testament makes it clear that homosexuality is still considered an aberration\" You mentioned Moses, a character of the Old Testament, not the new. --- \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. -Romans 1:24-27\" This verse appears to be clear: Paul sees women having sex with women and men having sex with men, and he condemns that practice. But let's go back 2,000 years and try to understand why. Paul is writing this letter to Rome after his missionary tour of the Mediterranean. On his journey Paul had seen great temples built to honor Aphrodite, Diana, and other fertility gods and goddesses of sex and passion instead of the one true God the apostle honors. Apparently, these priests and priestesses engaged in some odd sexual behaviors -- including castrating themselves, carrying on drunken sexual orgies, and even having sex with young temple prostitutes (male and female) -- all to honor the gods of sex and pleasure. The Bible is clear that sexuality is a gift from God. Our Creator celebrates our passion. But the Bible is also clear that when passion gets control of our lives, we're in deep trouble. When we live for pleasure, when we forget that we are God's children and that God has great dreams for our lives, we may end up serving the false gods of sex and passion, just as they did in Paul's time. In our obsession with pleasure, we may even walk away from the God who created us -- and in the process we may cause God to abandon all the great dreams God has for our lives. Did these priests and priestesses get into these behaviors because they were lesbian or gay? I don't think so. Did God abandon them because they were practicing homosexuals? No. Read the text again. ([Homosexual] Reverend Mel White) --- PRO states, \"During the last three decades, for example, organizations representing 1.5 million U.S. health professionals (doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and educators) have stated definitively that homosexual orientation is as natural as heterosexual orientation\" \"...By your logic...the supposed aberration of homosexuality should never have been challenged to begin with...\" Homosexuality should never have been questioned! It is perfectly natural. If science is not good enough proof to you that homosexuality is natural, then there obviously is no source or process good enough to prove that. I can't be expected to give you any better source than science. And why would God condemn something that he created? --- \"that sexual orientation is determined by a combination of yet unknown pre- and post-natal influences\" I can only quote the scientists at the APA. I imagine they've done experiments to prove that you cannot determine your sexual orientation but have simply not determined those exact influences. I am a bisexual American. I do not have a mental disorder. I was never molested or taught to be this way. I doubt that my God or your God condemns and will eventually chastise the way he supposedly created me.",

            "premise": "Thanks for the response. Refutations \"My resolution says that anyone of age should be able to be married regardless of sexual orientation. So there is no reason why arguments 1 and 5 should be thrown out. My resolution states that sexual orientation should not come into the equation. However, this clearly happens so it is only natural that I should argue against it.\" Alright, it's fine if you argue against it, but once again, as this debate does not include sexual orientation, it's not a valid argument for this particular conversation. This debate is specifically about age, not homosexuality. But, if it makes you feel better to vent your anger about sexual orientation, that's perfectly plausible, just not arguable. \"I will begin with a definition of marriage. Marriage: a social contract between two individuals that unites their lives legally, economically and emotionally.\" Please use one of the definitions you presented. I'm confused which one you would like to be the standard. \"Not allowing two people to marry on the basis of their sexual orientation is discrimination. I may use this argument because my resolution is that sexual orientation should not factor in the decision to allow two individuals to marry.\" That's very good. I agree about homosexuality like you, but this is irrelevant. \"Marriage binds two individuals together both economically and legally. So to be married is to provide a more stable environment for any children that two individuals may care for. If two people have a kid but are not married, there is no laws deciding that one parent may see the child if the couple breaks up. Marriage brings the law into the matter thus making the lives of the couple and their child more stable in the process. There is no reason why a couple should be prohibited from having this kind of security.\" Here is a valid argument. However, by examining the resolution thoroughly, especially the \"age\" part, one can find the flaw. How can people under 17 ears of age be in good economic stability? No one can get sustainable jobs, and if they decide to have a child, it's even tougher. The economic portion has been refuted. Concerning the legal issues... What's wrong with the lacking of a specific law? There is no security involved. Marriage is collapsible, and that's not going to change by giving someone the right to marry under 17. And that leads into my arguments. Arguments I know it's relatively abnormal for the Opposition to bring in points, but I want my opponent to refute this. 1. Younger relationships are fickle and often fallible. Many kids go through several boy/girlfriends until they meet that \"special someone.\" When in adulthood, it's easier to find the person you want to be with your whole life. But through childhood, personalities of people often change, especially through adolescence, and you might just find yourself not liking your fiancee. The problem with this is that if younger kids begin to marry and discover their hatred for each other, they have to go through the legal system. They have to go through courts to get that divorce and be separated from their loved one. This clogs our court systems and wastes valuable time. 2. Marriage increases the chance of having a child. By feeling you are bonded to someone, the natural urge emerges. But people who are younger than 17, or even some number older, are not economically secure. They don't have a stable income. They don't make much money. And certainly, with a kid, both parents are going to have to work much harder. But one of the parents has to take care of the child. Therefore, you have one, young person with little job experience trying to raise a family. It's extremely difficult and would force many people into debt. It is not economically stable, and we should not encourage marriage. I await the response.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his time and effort. I will now rebut his arguments in round three: FIRST REBUTTAL: 1. \"They are all explicitly of a sexual nature\" -Polygamy, Incest, Pedophilia and Bestiality are all SPECIFIC instances of a sexual nature and are in no way relevant to gender preference, which by definition is: \"orientation\". 2. \"They are all, by a large segment of American society, as aberrant (deviation from what is normal or desirable).\" -A statement such as this only supports my claim that my opponent can only back up his correlations through social stigma. Would it just so happen that a large segment of American society has not analyzed what makes these correlations invalid, as I have consistently addressed? SECOND REBUTTAL: Let us review the statement I had made that my opponent feels has nothing to do with this debate: \"My task is to examine why gay marriage is most commendable to be included over a marriage involving polygamy, incest, bestiality and pedophilia.\" My opponent's comment: \"An exploration of the merits of gay marriage vs. polygamy, incest, bestiality and pedophilia might be interesting but it is not the subject of this debate.\" Merits: Qualities of being worthy or deserving. How does my opponent expect me to defend gay marriage against the \"slippery slope\" argument without exploring it's merits? Though merits might not be the subject of this debate, they are the key to support my position. I've already done this by stating that homosexuality is a sexual orientation and not a behavior such as polygamy, incest, bestiality and pedophilia. My opponent believes that I have compounded my own claims through the instance of a bisexual man/woman marrying one member of each sex (polygamy). This is completely false. Being bisexual does not suggest that that person would want to have relations with one person of each sex at the same time, that would be the definition of a polygamist. A bisexual simply has sexual attraction for both males and females. To say a bisexual will want to marry more than one person because he/she has a wider span of sexual preference, would be no different then saying a heterosexual man would want to marry more than one woman because he is attracted to more than one woman. (For more on polygamy, see round one). Now my opponents last argument: Who is to say that pedophilia and bestiality are merely \"behaviors\" and not also \"orientations?\" Is it not possible that one might never actually have sex with a child (animal) but yet still only experience sexual desire for children (animals)? Where might this lead? -These people may not be behaving like pedophiles or animal lovers, but neither are they experiencing sexual orientation, they are merely desiring a sexual behavior. Sexual orientation is strictly based on gender preference, any proceeding preferences would not fit the same definition. Look forward to my opponents final arguments in round four.",

            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for offering to debate this interesting topic as well as providing the clarifications on the concept of \u201cVirgin Birth\u201d.I was concerned this debate would go down the road of someone who has never had sex getting pregnant through artificial insemination, or that the debate would descend into obscure semantics. Thus when the baby was born this would be a Virgin Birth, but as my opponent has clarified this is an all natural process and so these ideas/arguments have all been put to rest. As simple as this topic may seem, I think its best to clarify the processes involved in conception and birthing to explicitly remove any doubt that a Virgin Birth is possible. A virgin is \u201ca person who has not had sexual intercourse\u201d. Birth is the \u201cthe time when a baby comes out from the body of its mother\u201d.(2) As such at this point we have determined that the baby must come out of the mother, so the question arises how does the baby get into the mother? We have ascertained so far that it is not through artificial insemination, and as this includes any \u201cmedical process in which semen is used to make a woman or female animal pregnant without sexual intercourse\u201d(3). So how are we to inseminate a women if it is not artificial, well it seems only logical that sexual intercourse has to take place can be inserted into the vagina thereby introducing semen into the vagina. This is achieved through copulation which means that the female and the male have to engage in sexual intercourse.(4) However, if sexual intercourse has to occur for pregnancy to occur then said parties involved in this process can no longer claim to be virgins. As such the concept of a \u201cVirgin Birth\u201d is absurd in the highest as how can a women get inseminated if there is not sexual intercourse thereby losing her virginity. Now, unless I am missing something as I have laid out above, it seems to me that my opponent has to prove that semen can be introduced into the vagina of a women thereby causing pregnancy. I do not believe this is possible or even probable, unless there is some obscure case reported somewhere in some medical journal that I have not heard about. With this short introduction over. I now hand the debate back over to my opponent and wish him luck in his arguments. And the video was included last moment for its sheer brilliance. http://www.youtube.com...

            "conclusion": "Pedophilia should be illegal",
            "premise": "Pedophilia Should be Illegal Introduction Thank you pro for creating this interesting debate. Some more semantics need to be dealt with before the debate proceeds. Pedophiles can be sub-divided into 2 main groups and be sub-divided even beyond that. I think to keep the debate fair, we should sub-divide pedophiles into exclusive and non-exclusive. Exclusive pedophiles is what I want to focus on. If we include non-exclusive it would include anyone who has ever had a fantasy about a child. Pedophilia is a sexual orientation This isn't something that can't be helped it's genetic. Some environmental factors may play a role, but it isn't likely to play a significant role. Pedophile is a sexual orientation, just like homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality etc.. You can't just wake up one day and decide not to be a pedophile. If you're a pedophile, you're a pedophile for life [1]. Many experts will tell you pedophilia is a sexual orientation [1]. Now, it's true the APA doesn't list pedophilia as a sexual orientation. It should be noted that they did list it as a sexual orientation until a bunch of right wing groups, complained that calling it a sexual orientation excuses child molestation [2]. The APA did what they usually do under strong social pressure and changed their manual. The same way they did in the 70s under pressure from gay rights groups. Time Bomb These exclusive-pedophiles are like ticking time bombs. They are only attracted to little kids. Society is forcing these guys to hide their sexual orientation, and they must remain celibate or hurt the very thing they want to love. Thinking that any straight or gay man can go their whole life and honor their vow of celibacy is crazy. I couldn't do it. I want to ask the voters if they could honor a vow of celibacy. They'd have to do without porn also since it exploits children. Most pedophiles will violate the law to satisfy their urges. It's not a matter of if, but when. If you don't believe me, just go a month without touching whoever you're attracted to in a sexual way, and avoid porn. What Making it Illegal Accomplishes Making pedophilia illegal, gets pedophiles the help they need. This isn't about locking somebody up for thought crimes. If we outlaw this psychological condition we can force pedophiles to get the help the need to prevent them from causing harm, and to deal with the psychological stresses of belonging to this sexual Orientation. There is even medication, extremely beneficial to helping them overcome their desires [3]. By making pedophilia illegal you can call treatment a punishment and require it among all discovered pedophiles. This illegality, would help create funding for pedophile treatment, so our children are safer. Pedophiles need help dealing with their desires. I'm sure most of them would support a law that makes getting the therapy they desperately need easier. In America people would not get behind a law that funds treatment for pedophiles, but if a bill were offered that made it a crime to be one, then it would be a lot easier to pass and therapy as well as a campaign to reach out to closet pedophiles, to seek help could be heavily funded. There are institutions right now that specialize in helping pedophiles[4]. With funding we could possibly prevent the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and pedophiles from being irreparably harmed. Adult's Engaging in Sexual Intercourse, With Children is Wrong I don't think, I need to go into too much detail with this point. I doubt my opponent would deny adults having sex with children is bad. Kids brains aren't fully developed, so it isn't really possible for them to fairly consent. They are also easily manipulated or coerced into doing things they don't want to. Plus it causes permanent psychological and sometimes physical damage to the child to engage in that sort of behavior. Conclusion Pedophilia needs to be made illegal, so that we can prevent sexual abuse of children and help pedophiles to be people that society can actually value, instead of demonize. Making it illegal helps children. It helps pedophiles. It's a true win-win scenario. Sources [1]http://latimesblogs.latimes.com... [2]http://m.huffpost.com... [3]http://www.slate.com...

            "premise": "I'm sorry I couldn't reply sooner. I really wanted to. I've been beyond busy. THis may be a little rushed.Rebuttal to His Response to Case 5:Ben Carson is a Neurosurgeon who has run for president. If anyone knows something about the American people, it'd be Ben Carson. He gets the anchor of the show to admit that people going into prison straight can come out gay. When Ben asks why, he can't respond. There are many factors as I said in my last argument. Environmental and spiritual factors that determine a trait can be changed. Given the right methods, sexual orientation can be changed. Well, people find it taboo. People like the taboo. I'll just let Jane Ward and more homosexuals including a college professor tell you they chose to be gay.\"But the fact that the \u201cborn this way\u201d hypothesis has resulted in greater political returns for gay and lesbian people doesn\u2019t have anything to do with whether it is true. Maybe, as gay people, we want to get together and pretendit is true because it is politically strategic\u2026.But still, it wouldn't\u2019t make the idea true. \u2026 People like to cite \u201cthe overwhelming scientific evidence\u201d that sexual orientation is biological in nature. But show me a study that claims to have proven this, and I will show you a flawed research design. \u2026 People like to use the failure of \u201cgay conversion\u201d therapies as evidence that homosexuality is innate. First of all, these conversions do not always fail\u2026.the point is that we can and do change. For instance, in high school and early in college, my sexual desires were deeply bound up with sexism. I wanted to be a hot girl, and I wanted powerful men to desire me. I was as authentically heterosexual as any woman I knew. But later, several years into my exploration of feminist politics, what I once found desirable (heterosexuality and sexism) became utterly unappealing. I became critical of homophobia and sexism in ways that allowed these forces far less power to determine the shape of my desires. If this had not happened, no doubt I\u2019d be married to a man\u2026.But instead, I was drawn to queerness for various political and emotional reasons, and from my vantage point today, I believe it to be one of the best desires I ever cultivated. [emphasis added]\" (1)As you can see, homosexuals themselves admit it is a choice. Some homosexuals may make it while they're young and grow up like that. That's why some teens rebel and take a stand. Others, like Jane, change over time. I'd like to fire a question back at you. If they knew their parents are against it, why did they openly say they were homosexual? Rebuttal to Response to Case 1:\"\"However,a number of researchers have pointed out significant methodological problems with the research that would cast doubt on the conclusiveness of the \u201cno difference\u201d findings. Even some researchers supportive of same-sex parenting have acknowledged the significant methodological limitations in the research to date\"It never refers to studies against \"no difference\" findings. They're saying that the way that advocates for \"no difference\" conducts their research is flawed. Rebuttal to Response to Case 2:Again, if children of homosexual parents get this messed up in just this short amount of time, how messed up will they be if raised for longer periods of time. If anything, it lays as proof that just a short time of homosexual parenting is harmful.Rebuttal to Response to Case 3:If you look at the bottom of the source, you'll see the citations are more than adequate. It gets its statistics from all of its citations.I believe homosexuaity and sexuality in general is determined by environemntal and spiritual factors.I did prove it. I used another source besides Ben Carson which you didn't even mention in your argument. I have shown through my sources that the increased suicide and depression rate is due to being homosexual. No matter how you spin it, homosexuality is a choice and it leads to an increased suicide and depression rate.No. Google it or just read the highlights that's laid out.Either way you spin it, homosexuals choose to come out and say they're homosexual. IF bullying is the cause, they could wait to say it. Homosexuality is a choice. However, my sources laid out the fact that homosexuality is the causation of those statistics. There are other statistics I've presented that show there's harm in being homosexual yet, you ignore it.Or we save the children and not let them adopt.I've acknowledged that. However, it seems to advocate that heterosexuality does indeed influence it by certain verbage.May I ask how dating violence is attributed to people not accepting them?Well, it would have been an experience that shaped their mentality so you never know. Statistics don't lie. Maybe that can be A (one of the) factor causes them to be homosexual or it's a result of their sexuality. Either way you spin it, it strenghtens my case.Rebuttal to Response of Case 4:Well played, man. I'll give you that one. You say the trend may not be present today; yet provide zero data to prove otherwise. I believe I addressed this in my argument.\"To examine heterosexuals' perceptions of bisexuals, 353 young adults read a description of a dating couple and rated each partner and the couple on several dimensions. The gender and sexual orientation (bisexual, heterosexual, homosexual) of each partner was varied among research participants. Compared to heterosexuals, bisexuals were seen as less likely to be monogamous, more likely to give a sexually transmitted disease (STD) to a partner, and more able to satisfy a partner sexually. Compared to gay men and lesbians, bisexuals were seen as more likely to give an STD to a partner and less able to satisfy a partner sexually. Despite their seeming behavioral compliance to heterosexual relationship norms, bisexuals in male\u2013female relationships were not viewed more positively than bisexuals in same-gender relationships. Participants perceived male and female bisexuals similarly. Explanations for these and other findings are considered.\"This shows that homosexuals (included bisexuals) are more likely to cheat. Note that the article didn't say that homosexuals cheat less than bisexuals while it said that heterosexuals cheat less. Thus, the article lets us know that bisexuals and homosexuals cheat more than heterosexuals. (2) Rebuttals to Pro-Adoption Case:As I showed earlier, homosexuals adopting will do more harm than good. Conclusion:I didn't have much time so this argument was fast. Pro has ignored evidence I've brought forth or simply denied it. I urge you to vote Con.Anime OP: 1. http://tinyurl.com...2. http://pwq.sagepub.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "There's no such thing as being born GAY!",
            "conclusion": "There's no such thing as being born GAY!",
            "premise": "First and for most before I start this argument I will state that I am NOT going to cite sources or back up material for a lot of information that I use for several different reasons; either it is common knowledge, common sense, or the information in my argument can easily be verified and looked up at any time on any search engine. It is not rocket science but any information I use can be searched and confirmed on your own time. First I will start by saying that there is no definitive proof that lower levels of testosterone effect sexual orientation. You never mentioned the female hormone estrogen which some females are born with lower levels of but are not Lesbians. You stated verbatim that \"The developing male fetus receives too little testosterone, which causes the sexual orientation,\" yet there are lots of heterosexual men born with lower levels of testosterone so if what you are saying is accurate then these men should be GAY. On the same note as stated in Wikipedia testosterone is a steroid hormone not a sexual orientation hormone and it plays a key role in males in the development of their reproductive organs as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle, bone mass, and the growth of body hair. Also falling in love is scientifically proven to lower levels of testosterone in males and increase testosterone in females which means that testosterone levels have intermittent highs and lows throughout the lifetime of a human being. It is our natural affinity to constantly go through hormonal changes all throughout life so why would something that is permanently innate in human development \"SUDDENLY\" have an affect on sexual orientation even if it happens prematurely during birth? Also on Wikipedia nowhere does it say TESTOSTERONE has \"ANYTHING\" to do with gender attraction nor in Human Biology which I took in college. The course covers over several chapters of detailed research and scientific information on different hormones, their effects on the body, and what they mean to our anatomy but there is not ONE reputable source that definitively confirms and proves without a doubt your claims about Testosterone having anything to do with sexual orientation; it is all speculation and not fact. Then you said, \"The developing MALE FETUS receives too little testosterone, which causes the sexual orientation.\" So I guess only males are born GAY??? And females get to choose... yes I see your logic! Second I love hypocrisy in debate it's great because I love how you said \"In addition, another study proves that sexual orientation is uncontrollable,\" then you said \"Just like the analogy that is used in my evidence, it is simply like being left handed.\" How is this statement any different from my pedophilia, scam artist, thief analogy? But I will get back to that later in the argument now is not the time lol! I want to address the fact that you said a study proves that sexual orientation is uncontrollable... how so? I would have loved to know which study this was and how they were able to prove something like that and what was the deciding factor that proved it, but as expected you couldn't offer anything more than just an enigmatic statement. You also stated verbatim that... \"A study was done by Dr. Ward, who found that androstendione in male pregnancies would prevent the hypothalamus to develop into a healthy male brain. The brain makes its gender commitment very early in development and, once committed to either male or female, it cannot change. These are all studies and examples that sexual orientation is, in fact, proved to be ingrained within a person before birth.\" \"Androstenedione\" as it is correctly spelled is the common precursor of male and female sex hormones as also stated in Wikipedia. It does lots of things in the human body but nowhere does it say that it has ANYTHING to do with sexual orientation or gender commitment however there is speculation that it may have estrogenic side-effects but that has yet to be proven because no one has ever had a high enough intake. Second Androstenedione was manufactured as a dietary supplement, often called andro for short. Andro was legal and able to be purchased over the counter, and, as a consequence, it was in common use in Major League Baseball throughout the 1990s by record-breaking sluggers like Mark McGwire. The International Olympic Committee in 1997 banned Androstenedione and placed it under the category of \"androgenic-anabolic steroids\" and for this reason it is banned by MLB, the NFL, USOC, NCA, and by the NBA. If Androstenedione has the ability to \"prevent the hypothalamus to develop into a healthy male brain,\" as you've stated then why have none of these athletes who habitually have taken this supplement have displayed any homosexual-like behavior or characteristics in any way what-so-ever?? Odd don't you think? And you use this estranged person called Dr. Ward? I looked him up and couldn't find a Dr. Ward only someone named Dr. Ward F. Odenwald if that's who you're talking about who did his research on HOMOSEXUALITY in 1995!! I was 9 years old!! Which was almost 20 years ago! So his research is null-and-void and means nothing because everything he \"THOUGHT\" he proved has yet to come to fruition! His so-called GAY discovery Androstenedione which was banned 2 years AFTER his research has not had the effect that he claimed it has on MALES and almost 20 years later and counting no athlete who took Androstenedione on a regular basis as a supplement has yet to experience changes in their sexual orientation. You also stated that sexual orientation was in-grained at birth yet you told me in the last argument that you cannot prove that someone who was GAY actually turned straight... that statement is a contradiction yet people do it all the time and YOU KNOW IT! In-grained my AZZ! I've had friends who were GAY and turned STRAIGHT and when asked about their decision to become heterosexual they said at one point they were attracted to the same gender and now they're JUST NOT!! I'm a female and I was attracted to other females for almost 6 years and now I'M NOT!! I'm attracted to guys and have been dating them ever since! People change their sexual preference all the time not to mention I CHOSE my sex partners thus choosing my orientation and was not in-grained with it. It is a personal choice just as simple as one day wanting Cheese cake and the next day Apple Pie! Lastly I'm going to skip arguing a lot of the stuff you said because it's pointless and I've already won so I will conclude this round by replying with a rebuttal to a statement that you made when you said... \"It is unreasonable to compare homosexuals being born the way they are to relate pedophiles and scam artists to the same cause. There is no way you can justify this. You are going into a different issue. Lets keep in mind that we are talking about sexual orientation, and not ACTUAL CHOICES and POOR DECISIONS people choose to make, like scamming or being a rapist.\" My response to that is no it is not unreasonable because the basis of my argument is that there is no such thing as people being born gay... it is a personal choice! I am not going into a different direction by naming people that live these other various lifestyles because this has everything to do with my argument because being GAY is ALSO a lifestyle and it is a lifestyle choice. And you consider people who live as pedophiles, scam artists, rapists and so forth to be \"ACTUAL CHOICES\" and \"POOR DECISIONS\" yet being a guy and WANTING to suck another guy's wiener is not? LMAO Get out of here! There are STRAIGHT men who even do this for the money and solely for the money so get the heck out of here but in your biased logic it can't be an ACTUAL CHOICE or male prostitution it's an \"epi-mark\" no wait it's too much \"Androstenedione\" at birth, no no it's \"lack of Testosterone\"!! Wait it's in the \"BRAIN\"!! HAHA Which one is it?? Pick one! LMAO!!",

            "premise": "\"You know, I'd actually like to see this universal gay activist my opponent keeps referencing - he sounds like quite a character.\" When I say \"The gay activist\" I am referring to the commonly held beliefs by the vast majority of \"gay activists\". I know at least 10 gay people and they are embarrassed to even be associated with the gay activist movement, as they do not represent all gay people \"gay activists\" represent themselves not all gay people. That is why I said \"gay activist\" and not just gay people in the title of the debate. It is a commonly held belief and fought for belief at all costs that homosexuality is genetic and that being gay can't be helped and there is no cure or rehabilitation for it. My opponents statement verifies my last statement: \"I have no reason to challenge this - the hypothetical \"gay activist\" agrees with it wholeheartedly. But not just in the sense of \"heterosexuality,\" - in the sense of \"sexual orientation.\" Sexual orientation is genetic, and heterosexuality is the more prevalent of the two (or three, if one includes bisexuality) possibilities\" Why does my opponent leave out pedophilia in this statement? Preference is preference, pedophiles prefer children, homosexuals prefer the same sex and heterosexuals prefer the opposite sex and of course lets not forget the bisexual who can't make up their mind unless given only one choice at that moment in time. \"Again, show me this gay activist who considers himself, a part of a 5-10% minority, to be \"normal\" http://home.messiah.edu... The introduction to the above link: INTRODUCTION - Society has two views of homosexuality. The traditional view holds that homosexuality is an aberration, the orientation is a disorder, and the behavior is pathological. The opposing view is that homosexuality is a normal variant in the human condition, that it is determined before birth, and homosexual behavior is natural for those so oriented. \"\"The gay community has been tremendously successful in gaining acceptance for the second view.\"\" This view, however, rests on a number of questionable premises, which if false, lead us back to the traditional view. In the following article we will continue to examine the premises put forth by those accepting homosexuality as \"normal\". \"Here's the thing: homosexuality is not a crime. Pedophilic actions are. One requires rehabilitation, another does not. A homosexual and a pedophile can both be \"rehabilitated\" to similar degrees.\" Again my opponent makes a direct comparison to the acts. I am comparing the logic that gay activists use to normalize their behavior. The next logical step is to never let pedophiles out of prison based on the same logic that they use. It is biological and genetic and can't be helped. Whether one is against the law or not is irrelevant to the logic argument. Very, very few people can suppress sexual gratification, they will cave sooner or later, especially a pedophile. \"It's kind of difficult not to play the bigotry card when my opponent presents an article about the ACLU supporting NAMBLA on freedom of speech grounds\" I put this link up to show that the ACLU is attempting to show it is normal to be a pedophile and that they have a right to talk about and lead pedophiles to children. It has nothing to do with bigotry it proves that the same logic is being used both by gay activists and pedophiles. Don't you just love how the ACLU protects us from the unjust suppression of pedophiles and their stalking of little children. My opponents second attempt at saying a bisexual doesn't make a choice is just samantics samantics samantics. \"Process of elimination\" Make a choice will ya!! \"it is a BIT better, and, therefore, not the same, not \"just as bad.\" My opponent affirms my statement that he minimises child porn as not as bad as molesting children yet children must be molested to constantly fill the needs of pedophiles appetites for new filth to watch. My opponents closing remarks are about treatment. This is not what gay activists want, they want their behavior to be considered normal. Treatment is not an option, but some how it is for pedophiles and it is done so at the expense of tens of thousands of children every year.",

            "premise": "Freeman, Thank you as well. Defense of my C-2. Is it a possibility, but not very likely at all. Was it silly, far fetched? Indeed, however, I have lost debates on this site based solely on semantics. Since it IS a very remote possibility, I decided to include it. Since it was not discredited, it stands. The argument over sources again off-sets per the information I will provide below. Further, if I did not touch your second point, how could have mentioned things that I alledgedly didn't argue? My opponent attempted to discredit my sources by stating that they were right wing biased results. What were his sources? Left wing biased results. Not enough? Let's examine the quote from one of my opponnet's sources Ivanka Savic : me: Ivanka Savic-Berglund, MD, PhD Title: Associate Professor and Senior Consultant Neurologist at Karolinska Institutet at the Centre of Gender Related Medicine in Stockholm, Sweden Position: None Found to the question \"Is sexual orientation determined at birth?\" Reasoning: \"I want to be extremely cautious - this [my] study (Brain Response to Putative Pheromones in Homosexual Men) does not tell us anything about whether sexual orientation is hardwired in the brain. It doesn't say anything about that.\" http://borngay.procon.org... Further, my opponent mentioned the American Pyschiatry Association as one of his many sources that \"concurred\": Biased Studies? Research studies, often conducted by individuals or organizations with a vested interest in the outcome, are contradictory. Studies linked to conservative political and religious groups almost never show anything positive about homosexuality and studies linked to liberal political and religious groups and/or gay support groups almost never show anything negative about homosexuality. So this means that we all have to take a step back and look at all these studies with a calm and a cool head. Though obviously being biased (since I know what the truth is from my own life experience) I still can not include any studies financed by the anti-gay religious right because for me the results are disingenuous, outrageous or even outright laughable. For example, Click Here to read about the ruse or junk science known as the Thomas Project or \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\u0153Ex-Gays?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd: A Longitudinal Study of Religiously Mediated Change In Sexual Orientation whose principal investigators, Stanton Jones and Mark Yarhouse both worked for universities with strong anti-gay biases (and therefore had a vested interest in the outcome of the study) Wheaton College and Pat Robertson University respectively. On the other hand I have tried to weed out the studies with the more favorable outcomes to my side that seem to have some basic problems with their methodology. For example, I have not included the results of the following studies because these results could not be independently replicated by other researchers: a) The so-called \"gay gene (Xq28) study\" done by Dean Hamer. b) Post-mortem (after death) studies of the hypothalamus of the brain of homosexual males done by D. F. Swaab, Laura S. Allen, and Simon LeVay. o However in spite of all of the above scientific studies, according to the American Psychological Association's own website, \"there is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Click Here on the American Psychological Association Website link, then scan down to the question \"What causes a person to have a particular sexual orientation?\" and you will find the direct quote as used above. My opponent stated that I glided over single parent children. While that is not directly the subject at hand, I will speak to it. Single parent children will also miss out on the contributions of the missing parent be it male or female. In the scenarios presented by my opponent, he implied that all gay/lesbian parents are model parents without fault. Is it better to have.......? That is assuming that all gay/lez parents are, which they are not. MANY probably are, as are MANY hetero; however we cannot make this an all inclusive/exclusive. It is situational and must be evaluated on a case by case basis. Children are deserving of loving parents, and as such, careful placement MUST be paramount in the decision process. This idea directly ties in to the suitablility and parental potential of adopting families. The various departments of children and family services do a variety of checks to ensure children are being placed in a suitable home. For example, in Tennessee potential adoptive parents complete MAPP classes (Modern Approach to Partnership in Parenting). A home study is completed on the parents individually, together, as well as anyone residing in the home. Background checks are completed. Then 2 announced and 1 unannounced home inspections occur. If favorable, then parents are considered for placements. In the case above, parents are given information regarding the child. Can you accept a child who has (fill in the blank(s)? Parents need to know this for compatability. I will say that adoptive parents should NOT always attempt to change something about the child they are receiving. Sexual orientation notwithstanding; for example. REBUTTAL: I will not go so far as to say that gay couples should not be allowed to adopt children. I will say that whenever possible, straight children should be adopted by straight parents; and children with homosexual tendencies adopted by homosexual parents. As I stated, and undisputed, in Round 1, children \"model\" the behaviors of their caregivers. This would alleviate many of the inevitable questions that are certain to accompany such a placement. It is inevitable a child would witness public displays of affection, such as kissing. It is possible if not probable that they would also have some exposure to private displays of affection (I won't go there). They would be naturally curious to at least question if not experiment. With that in mind, it is clearly most beneficial to place straight kids with straight parents, and gay kids with gay parents. CONCLUSION: Contention 1: Worst case, both off set, best case mine is stronger. Contention 2: Unlikely, but possible, thus defended. My opponent did not have a 2nd contention. I win this debate My opponent cited Biblical scripture from the comments section. As promised, I refrained. I was expected to make all of the concessions, and surrender my opinion. (Reminds me of my beloved Israel!) Unfortunately, the best compromise that I am capable of is listed in my rebuttal. I was attacked in print for stating my opinion, yet I did not attack. Of the 50 plus comments, only 2 had anything supportive of me. Some even encouraged poor sportsmanship. So I ask, Who was really acting the part of the bully here? I have provided credible evidence to back my case. I have provided credible evidence to dismantle my opponent's case. Given this, I request your support in a PRO ballot. Thanks to Freeman for a good contest!",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for carefully taking the time and thoughtfully arguing the Con side of this debate. I would also like to thank anyone that has patiently read through these rounds and taken the time to vote. I also hope and encourage everyone to vote based on the debate itself, and remain unbiased towards the subject. Do not vote on whether you are for or against the topic, but rather the presentation and delivery of the arguments. *I reject Cons argument from the Religious Aspect, for this debate is not about religious discrimination. Closing Argument While my opponent reminds us that this is a debate on whether, \"The United States does not discriminate against homosexual\u2019s right to marry.\" I would like to remind Con and our humble audience that in order for the United States to discriminate against homosexual\u2026homosexuals must be identified within the context of the law or acts by their sexual orientation. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation. This is why I have contended that if a state or Federal government is not identifying our sexual orientation in the law or acts, then that state or Federal government is not discriminating against any marriage rights specifically towards homosexuals. If we look back at the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 which, (to summarize here), separated race into two categories, white or colored/non-whites. From this act, our nation passed many anti-miscegenation laws that banned marriages between whites and colored/non-whites. These anti-miscegenation laws would specifically use the term white and colored/non-whites in the law. Our agreed definition of discrimination is to recognize a distinction which would encompass; age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, height, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, skin color, and weight. Sense no law is specifically identifying sexual orientation as being banned from marriage; it therefore cannot be a direct discrimination against homosexuals. Con may say it is an indirect discrimination, but the law applies to all. Con has addressed my contention and has refuted my claim and named the state of Alabama (really doesn't matter what state) as proof, that sexual orientation was being discriminated against. Also Con has agreed with me by saying, Alabama does not use the language that identifies our sexual orientation, but the law implies homosexuals cannot marry because the law identifies a marriage between a man and a woman. Now I have given examples and scenarios that satisfy a homosexual\u2019s right to marry can be met in an opposite marriage, and also given examples and scenarios that heterosexual cannot marry into a same-sex marriage. No matter how unlikely Con may think these scenarios may be, the unlikeliness of such scenarios doesn\u2019t make what I say untrue. Just because something is unlikely, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen; doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen; and doesn\u2019t mean as we speak, it isn\u2019t happening right now. The fact is: all sexual orientations are banned from having a same-sex marriage, not just homosexuals. Now, we are all aware that society may believe the term \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d means \u201cgay-marriage.\u201d, but it also just means \u201csame-gender marriage,\u201d as the highly unlikely scenario of two heterosexual men marrying for health benefits. But the law has a responsibility to use language that does not discriminate. If the law stated homosexual were banned from marriage, then my next example would be illegal. For those of you that didn\u2019t watch the clip, or any other clips of this, I will summarize for you. This is a segment from the Ricki Lake Show, in which a homosexual man is married to a woman. Now while the title of this show is disparaging from my argument as well the sexual acts of this couple, the principles back my contentions. If homosexuals were banned from marriage, then this man would not be allowed to marry this woman. The fact is this is a denial of choice to the marriage applicants\u2026.not a denial because you are homosexual. There are many laws and acts out there that deny us choice, and those laws and acts are for whatever reason the state or Federal Government may have the interest in doing so. Comparison for this would be the denail of choosing more than one spouce. Everyone is denied this choice for whatever the states or Federal governments interest are. Its certains isn't being denied becasue of someone's sexual orientation. If a choice is being denied to only one group, then it is discrimination. Marriage is available to every man and woman in the United States no matter if you identify yourself as homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, or asexual\u2026marriage is available to you as a right. You may not like the choices you have to exercise that right, but there are many rights out there you can\u2019t choose to exercise the way you would like. This is why, \u201cThe United States does not discriminate against homosexual\u2019s right to marry.\u201d Thank you!",
