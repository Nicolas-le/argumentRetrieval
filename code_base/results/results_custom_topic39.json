            "premise": "So because these people are not the ideal societal members, we should forget about them and leave them to their fates? We should leave the group who is forced into these jobs to suffer and make below the amount required to live? You also forget that the price to live has increased, and it will only continue to increase. And with the current minimum wage, these people will continue to seep deeper and deeper into poverty. (1) Quoting from the article: \"When the cost of living goes up, so should wages. It's common sense. While serving in the US Congress, we supported reasonable periodic increases in the federal minimum wage to enable workers to better support their families and keep up with the economy. And we rallied our Republican and Democratic colleagues to make it the law. But the last time Congress voted to raise the wage to its current rate of $7.25 an hour was seven years ago. Since then, the cost of life's essentials have shot up. Groceries cost 20% more, a gallon of gas costs 25%more, and average tuition at a community college increased 44%. But the minimum wage remains at $7.25. If it had kept up with inflation since 1968, it would be almost $10.70 today.\" These people deserve to have their wages increased as the price of living increases, for the time that was a proper minimum wage. Now? Prices have increased and to live costs more. Should they be forsaken to this fate as the prices continue to rise every year? Raise the minimum wage and leave it that way for ten years then go back and review the situation. Change the minimum wage to be parallel to the price of living. As it increases, raise the wage, as it decreases, lower the wage. Sources: (1) http://www.usatoday.com...",

            "premise": "The minimum wage has been raised in several areas already, and has shown some harmful side effects. Take Oakland, California as an example. The minimum wage there has rose to $12.25 hourly. A CNN report was shocked to find the usually affluent Bay Area had a high level of child poverty. Economists there thought a wage hike would help decrease the poverty, but it did the exact opposite. The 2003 wage increase was supposed to have an immediately positive effect on people there, but that was not what happened. According to the City and County of San Francisco\"s Office of Economic Analysis, The food service industry saw a -2.3% job loss and the former booming manufacturing industry saw a -8.5% job loss. Now, looking at the community demographics, about 14.1% of the families there live in poverty. This wage hike hit single mother families hard. Single mothers with a child/children under five had about a 42.3% poverty rate. The minimum wage law increased the number of children in poverty, it did not help families! This is a perfect example of a time where the minimum wage increase did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do. As you can see, it hit single mother families hardest, which are the ones who need the most help. The economy in Oakland took a sharp nose dive. As you can see, increasing the minimum wage did not help break the low income cycle. In fact, it made the whole situation worse. Many places in California have had similar experiences, too many to describe them all here. The state in general is pushing for increased minimum wage, which as you can see, has not benefited many of the cities it was implemented in. For these reasons, I believe it would be best for everyone AND the economy if the federal minimum wage did not increase. I fear it may have the same effects it did in Oakland nation-wide.

            "premise": "While people working for minimum wage would earn more, this would also mean the employer would have to pay them more. This means many people could get fired from work. Also as you mentioned, this would result in higher prices for their goods. In the long run, these higher prices could hurt everyone, not just those living on minimum wage. A CBO report from 2013 states that half a million jobs would be lost if the federal wage would be raised to $10.10 ( as many people want it to be ) The report also estimates that many job benefits would be lost, such as paid vacation and reimbursed parking. Another point I want to add is a higher minimum wage would hurt the development of people. Say you're in highschool and the new minimum wages looks pretty good to you. Many teens chose to drop out of highschool and not bother to attend college. These higher wages very well could entice teens and others to not go/go back to college because they are already making more money doing something so easy, like working at a fast food restaurant. In 2011, 3.8 million Americans were working for the federal minimum wage, more than half of them teens. About 70% of minimum wage employees work fewer than 35 hours a week. They work less, and their job is a lot easier than ones that require a college education. Why should we give more money to people doing less work? They work less and the job is easier, thus they earn proportionally less. In conclusion, we should not increase the federal minimum wage. By doing so, the quantity and quality of jobs decrease, and people very well may lose their strive to go to college and get a better education.

            "premise": "(1) Poverty is an issue that will always exist within a Capitalist society. Poverty is a healthy sign of a market at its work. Income inequality is inevitable. However, I should note that Robert Reich is not a respective Capitalist; instead, he shares more Socialistic values. Therefore, he does not account for the concept of economic competition; that is to say, between businesses and individuals competing, a marketplace will foster an environment where the benevolent race one another to assure the best conditions and services in exchange for maximum profits. An article by Pew Research describes that twenty-nine states [including D.C] have wages above the federal minimum. What does this mean? States where the minimum is higher will draw citizens across state lines, and there will be competition between the states. However, that is because the current wage is feasible. Imagine states trying to raise above the 15 minimum. I should mention also that the federal minimum wage does not account for differing state economies. While California may be able to afford a higher minimum, who's to say Ohio can? Or Pennsylvania? Or Michigan? Another problem this comes down to is a precedence with regard to state versus federal power. If the federal government controls the economics of each state, that may be a slippery-slope leading to other jurisdiction and rule over the states and their autonomy. If the worker of a company has two kids, and they are being paid inadequately, they simply quit and find an employer with better benefits and pay. Those companies exist in an economic market with minimal regulations; as opposed to markets with high regulation, wage hikes, and litigation against small businesses that put small, private sector entrepreneurs out of work. Now, take this article from the LA Times. A woman is describing the difficulty of living off of $7.25, which I agree is inadequate. However, her issue could be fixed if employers started paying above the minimum for her labor. The way she can attain that standard of employment is if she works to build a stronger resume, and aims for an above corporate minimum pay job. (2) This point is really moot/I am unable to refute it, considering the entire premise of my argument. (3) Sure, the minimum wage being raised by the federal government may increase consumer spending, but it will also cause businesses to spike prices. Effectively, what has changed? Your paycheck will look bigger, but you would end up draining your pockets trying to buy pockets were previously far cheaper. In order for smaller companies to pay the $15 minimum, they would have to compensate for it by racking in more profits. The way to do that? Make prices go up. Supply and demand. ------------------------ The larger image here can easily be covered if you only examine the consequences of wage hikes throughout the country on private sector growth. Several businesses on the West Coast have been put out of work due to sharp state government mandates in pay rates. Owners had to raise employees' hours and lay workers off before inevitably going out of business due to the non-affordable expense of a $15 minimum. And again, as I stated in a previous round, Walmart lobbied for this wage for that very reason. Even then, corporate America does not want to pay these wages. Ever wondered why Wendy's has begun to use machines instead of humans at their locations? In fact, several of them? It is because as wages have increased, the desire for human workers has generally decreased. Just as with affirmative action and the welfare state, high wage hikes hinder those they are purported to help. Sources Cited (1) http://www.pewresearch.org... http://www.latimes.com...

            "premise": "You seem to be forgetting that people are forced into living on minimum wage due to the shrinking amount of well paying, high education jobs available. Again, there must be checks. For a Fortune 500 company to cut employees because they are making more per hour shows that, once again, these companies are shady and will do anything to make the big bucks. These people living on minimum wage do not make enough to get by, they lack the ability to break out of this cycle due to the lack of funding that they receive. (1) Quoting from the article: \"Raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $8.50 an hour, would inject an amazing $9.5 billion extra spending power into the economy (this assumes all 3.8 million workers are making exactly $7.25, that each additional dollar earned is spent, and that none of the 3.8 million are earning wages below the federal minimum wage \" even though there are 9 states that are below this level or which have no minimum wage law). If the minimum wage were instead raised to where it should be, at least $10 per hour (which would still put it below the minimum wage in 1968), this would release at least $60 billion over two years into the economy.. On top of this, an increased minimum wage may also lead to an increase in the hourly pay of other low-wage workers that only make slightly more than the federal minimum wage. This increased purchasing power across the board helps stimulate the economy and benefits small businesses, many of which were hardest hit by the recession.\" As you can see, increasing the minimum wage will also increase the economy and allow for more spending of the individual workers. Currently, these workers do not making enough. Some states do not even have minimum wage, or they offer much lower than the federal wage. The increase would force companies in these states to give minimum wage, and this would in turn increase the purchasing that these workers receive and may even help them out of this deadly cycle of low income.

            "conclusion": "The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour",
            "premise": "- The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hourThe federal minimum wage has been $7.25 / hour since July 24, 2009. [1]\u201cIn the 2014 State of the Union address, President Obama called again on Congress to raise the national minimum wage, and soon after signed an Executive Order to raise the minimum wage for the individuals working on new federal service contracts.\u201d [2]There is much debate among policy makers about the merits of minimum wage and about the effects of different policies. The conservative narrative is that having a minimum wage increases unemployment among teens and other unskilled workers. The liberal position points to research done by David Card and Alan Krueger that concludes that there is no evidence that raising worker pay had killed jobs. [3]There is so much conformational bias among those writing on the subject that the experts look at the same data and come to opposite conclusions. Some researchers say that raising the minimum wage will cause increased unemployment. Card and Krueger found that an increase of 19% in the minimum wage ($4.25 to $5.05) did not reduce employment rates. [3]Some say that an increase in minimum wage will cause an unacceptable increase in prices. If the minimum wage were increased to $15 an hour, prices at fast food restaurants would rise by an estimated 4.3 percent, according to a new study. That would mean a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac, which currently goes for $3.99, would cost about 17 cents more, or $4.16. [4]Some claim that an increase in the minimum wage will reduce staff turnover. \u201cIn 2013, the turnover rate for franchises was 93 percent, and it can cost $4,700 per worker who leaves. A previous study found that for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, turnover drops by 2.2 percent, and a $15 wage would come with $5.2 billion in savings for the fast food industry.\u201d [4]All of this calls into question the published literature on the minimum wage. \u201cThe minimum-wage effects literature is contaminated by publication selection bias, which we estimate to be slightly larger than the average reported minimum-wage effect. Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains.\u201d[5]The misinformation around the minimum wage is so constant that the U.S. Department of Labor has set up a web page trying to debunk the common myths. [6]In light of this we need to do a controlled experiment on a national scale to see both the value and the harm done by raising the minimum wage raised by a significant amount.The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour.This should be introduced incrementally so we can measure the effects of the change to the federal minimum wage. (I suggest $2.58 / hour increase on Jan 1 each year for 3 years).This would give us good data to draw some conclusions about what effects the minimum wage has on around issues of poverty and economics.Here are some questions that need more data. Does increasing the minimum wage reduce jobs? - Current data says job growth is better with an increase in minimum wage. Does increasing the minimum wage help the poor? - Current research suggest it will mostly help middle class white women.Does increasing the minimum wage reduce poverty? - Current research suggests that most in poverty are not working at minimum wage jobs. The prime factors causing poverty are: Current Poor Economy; Drug Use; Lack of Education and Medical Expenses.[7]Do we even have a good definition of poverty? [8] Current definitions of poverty (for government policy considerations) have nothing to do with insufficient food or insufficient housing.The minimum wage debate is crippled by a lack of good information. Statements of position are presented like articles of faith which demand belief without question. We should raise the minimum wage substantially so we can see what effect, if any, all our minimum wage policies have. Then we can see if the minimum wage is a useful economic too or not.- The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour1. www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/minimumwage.htm2. www.whitehouse.gov/raise-the-wage3. www.davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf4. www.thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/08/03/3687171/15-minimum-wage-big-mac/5. www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x/abstract6. www.dol.gov/minwage/mythbuster.htm7. core197b.wikispaces.com/Major+Causes+of+Poverty+in+America8. www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/09/understanding-poverty-in-the-united-states-surprising-facts-about-americas-poor",

            "premise": "Thank you 16K for havinhis debate with me. MINIMUM WAGE AND WELFARE Minimum wage pays less than welfare in 35 different states. http://www.cato.org... currently the minmum wage is 7.25 an hour. http://www.dol.gov... Here is what welfare pays in a few different states: State Hourly Wage Equivalent Hawaii- $17.50 Alaska- $15.48 Massachusetts- $14.66 Connecticut- $14.23 Washington, D.C.- $13.99 New York- $13.13 New Jersey- $12.55 Rhode Island- $12.55 California- $11.59 Virginia- $11.11 http://www.statisticbrain.com... It's more beneficial for a lot of minimum wage families to quit working and collect welfare. The fact that minimum wage jobs pay less than welfare ecourages people not to work. The government mandating a minimum wage increase would incentivize working. the minimum wage increase should be enough to equal possible welfare benefits from not working. The government spends close to a trillion dollars a year on welfare spending. http://www.cato.org... This is money that businesses could be paying people if they were incentivized to work. These stats don't even include the people who are working and having to be partially subsidized by welfare. If there were a minimum wage increase, government could stop sunsidizing these corporations so they can pay less than a livable wage. REDUCES POVERTY LEVEL Raising the minimum wage reduces the poverty level. There is pretty much a consensus among economists about this fact. http://www.washingtonpost.com... A study by the University of Massachussets says; \"higher minimum wages moderately reduce the share of individuals with incomes below 50, 75 and 100 percent of the federal poverty line\" https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com... Here are a few of the benefits that the congressional budget office found would result from increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Once the increases and decreases in income for all workers are taken into account, overall real income would rise by $2 billion. Real income would increase, on net, by $5 billion for families whose income will be below the poverty threshold under current law, boosting their average family income by about 3 percent and moving about 900,000 people, on net, above the poverty threshold (out of the roughly 45 million people who are projected to be below that threshold under current law). Families whose income would have been between one and three times the poverty threshold would receive, on net, $12 billion in additional real income. About $2 billion, on net, would go to families whose income would have been between three and six times the poverty threshold. Real income would decrease, on net, by $17 billion for families whose income would otherwise have been six times the poverty threshold or more, lowering their average family income by 0.4 percent. https://www.cbo.gov... CONCLUSION Raising the minimum wage helps out poor people by bringing them above the poverty level and raising it enough can dramatically reduce the amount of federal spending on welfare as well as incentivizing people to work. I hand ove the debate to my opponent. Good luck.",

            "premise": "\"You have conceded that raising the minimum wage in \"very small increments will not destroy our economy\".What I have stated previously is yes, raising the minimum wage overtime is not bad. What people are proposing today is outrageous.\"The Federal Minimum wage in 1968 was $1.60, adjusted for inflation would amount to $10.90 per hour.\"Using the federal minimum wage from 1968 is out of the question. Me saying that we have to raise the minimum wage very slowly to keep up with inflation means that I do not want workers being paid $1.00 or $2.00 an hour with today's economy. I did not state anywhere that I wanted to base our economy off of the year 1968. Half of your argument has been based off of inflation. You did not once try to denounce the fact that higher minimum wages actually increase unemployment, increase product costs, and put more people into poverty. I stated earlier that states with higher minimum wages compared to states with lower minimum wages have one percent more unemployment. To put that into numbers look at the United States population. http://www.census.gov.... One percent of the over 319 million United States citizens is 3,190,000 people. If the states with lower minimum wages raised them to the states that already had higher minimum wages, this will be the hopeless result. To add to my argument, raising the minimum wage decreases jobs for teenagers. It greatly affects teenagers because of their job inexperience. http://www.forbes.com.... This states that \" In June 2006, before the 40% increase in the minimum wage, 42.1% of teens age 16 to 19 were employed. By June 2010, after the economic meltdown and the 40% minimum wage increase, only 28.6% of teens age 16 to 19 were employed. A very weak economy and a policy that substantially raised the cost of inexperienced labor decreased teen employment by about one third in just four years.\". Raising the minimum wage hurts the inexperienced workers.",

Con's theory is perfectly sound on paper: an increase in the minimum wage should translate into higher prices, contributing to inflation and nullifying the increase. In the real world, however, economic forces are much more complicated. However much theory says it shouldn't, study after study shows that base wage increases have a minimal impact on prices and that base wage increases are strongly correlated to economic improvement. Economists differ strongly on the relative value and importance of the minimum wage, but history shows that economic strength typically improves after minimum wage hikes and that jurisdictions with higher minimum wages enjoy stronger economies than jurisdictions with lower or no minimum wage law. I will try to briefly demonstrate that minimum wage increases have historically resulted in little inflationary effect, but are strongly correlated to economic growth.",

            "premise": "In round 4 I want to cover the following : 1. Arguments for a $15 federal minimum wage. 2. Summary of and Responses to CON\u2019s statements 3. Closing statement.1. The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour. The primary reason the Federal Government should mandate a $15 minimum wage is so it have hard data on all the effects of this public policy tool. The majority of current research suggests that increasing the minimum wage will do the following: a) \u201cProvide a much-needed boost to the earnings of low-wage workers.\u201d [1] b) Stimulate the economy as workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth. [1] c) Senator Edward Kennedy once called the minimum wage \u201cone of the best antipoverty programs we have.\u201d. [2] d) Reduce the number of single moms living in poverty. [1] e) It is good for public health [3] Not only are these benefits backed by the data, but the following are likely. [4] a) Job Hunt Motivation b) Single Parents benefit c) Job Creation d) Increased Morale e) Greater odds of high school completion [3] f) Reduced costs for state Medicaid [3] g) Less people choosing welfare over work. These are all excellent reasons to increase the minimum wage. The Federal Government should mandate a $15 minimum wage because that is a substantial increase, and we will see clear trends in the data to help us understand all the effects of a minimum wage that is above the poverty line. Another reason for proposing a $15 minimum wage, is because it will place our minimum wage earners above the poverty line. Our federal government uses two measures of poverty: \u201cpoverty guidelines\u201d and \u201cpoverty thresholds\u201d [5] Poverty thresholds were developed in 1963-1964, based largely on estimates of the minimal cost of food needs. Poverty guidelines are a dollar figure used by the census bureau to calculate the number of people in poverty. [6] As an example, the poverty guideline for a single person living in \u201c48 Contiguous States and D.C.\u201d is $11,770 for 2015. It would take 1624 hours at the 7.25 minimum wage to earn this amount. Many minimum wage workers get 30 hours a week or less, and can not rise above the poverty guideline. If the minimum wage were $10 this same worker could earn $15600 a year, which is almost enough to support a spouse or child at the poverty line($15,930). If the Federal minimum wage were $15, this same person would earn $23400. This is enough for three people to be above the poverty line, or for four people to almost rise out of poverty. [6 - poverty guideline table] The issue of public health is often forgotten in the Minimum wage debate: \u201cLast year, Minnesota legislators successfully enacted a raise in the minimum wage, taking Minnesota from one of the lowest-paying minimum wage states to one of the highest. State Health Commissioner Edward Ehlinger described the move as the greatest legislative victory of the year. - \u201cI\u2019d argue that it was the biggest public health achievement in that legislative session \u2014 and probably in the four years I\u2019ve been health commissioner\u201d [3] The Federal Government should mandate a $15 minimum wage because it will improve the health of low income earners. This means there will be less drain on medical resources and possibly even net savings as federal costs of Obama Care rise. A study \u201cin APHA\u2019s American Journal of Public Health, found that the wage increase would decrease the risk of premature death by 5 percent for adults ages 24 to 44 living in households with an income of about $20,000. In addition, the children of such workers would experience substantially increased odds of high school completion and a 22 percent decrease in the risk of early childbirth.\u201d [3] A \u201chigher minimum wages reduce enrollment in traditional Medicaid \u2014 the portion of the health insurance program in which states pay a substantial share.\u201d There are many other reasons why a $15 federal minimum wage would be good for minimum wage earners, and for the country. One helpful way to think of it is: You get more of what you pay for! I would rather see workers paid a living wage. I would rather not see increased spending on welfare and medicaid. 2. Summary of and Responses to CON\u2019s statementsCon has the following concerns / issues - Cost of Living - Will lead to job loss - Does very little to help the poor - EITCLet me respond to some of his errors. - Cost of Living \u201cDespite the high cost of living, it remains very popular.\u201d CON is taking a simplistic view that any increase in prices as absolutely bad. For the worker earning minimum wage, their purchasing power at $15/hour is far greater than it was at $7.25/ hour. For the rest of us, a Big Mac meal ($3.99) would cost about 17 cents more ($4.16) which is hardly going to hurt us.[7] One of the problems with the current Federal Minimum Wage is that it is not indexed to the consumer price index or the cost of living. [8] Adjusted for inflation/cost of living, the highest minimum wage was in 1968, when it was equivalent to $10.69/hour in purchasing power.[9] The effect on the cost of living will be small, but the effect on those earning the minimum wage will be huge. - Will lead to job loss CON seems to ignore all the scholarly papers that state that an increased minimum wage will have little effect on the unemployment rate. The literature concludes \u201cwe find no evidence that the rise in New Jersey's minimum wage reduced employment at fast-food restaurants in the state.\u201d [10] The Pew Research Center found that the strongest opposition to a minimum wage increase came from Republicans, and that the opposition in the debate are more partisan politics that based on fact.[11] - Does very little to help the poor CON is correct that not all people in poverty are the working poor. Many are on some form of welfare. I want to reward the working poor with a higher minimum wage so they will be not so poor. Raising the Federal minimum wage to $15/ hour will even allow some to be above the poverty line. It will increase the health of these working poor. It will encourage people who are on welfare to consider working. CON is absolutely incorrect in suggesting that an increase in the Federal Minimum Wage will not benefit the working poor. - EITC CON sings the Republican party line that tax breaks are the answer. This is absolutely false. The people who benefit the most from tax breaks are the wealthy who can afford to hire an accountant to protect their money from government. I have a good income. I pay almost no taxes because the wealthy have a high motivation to find tax breaks. There is one great advantage of the EITC. It often encourages people who are on welfare to participate in the workforce.[12] As such, I applaud it. It is a good tool to reduce welfare abuse. Combined with a decent ($15) minimum wage there should be even more benefits for the working poor, and for tax payers.Closing Statement.

            "premise": "Why the Federal minimum wage shouldn't be raised to $15.Since this debate is specifically about the Federal minimum wage, my arguments will focus on that. Since I missed a round, I will also provide my rebutalls to my opponents arguments.Cost of LivingThe cost of living varies across many states, and establishing a $15 federal minimum wage would either hurt a state, or overpay it's workers. We can use this tool provided by CNN to analyse this. Say we were to establish a $15 dollar federal minimum wage in place such as Des Moines, then the cost will be different in a state such as New York. For this example I will be using the $10.10 minimum wage, but all you have to do is extrapolate the data to see what will happen if we implement a 15 dollar minimum wage. For example, if Des Moines, Iowa, had a minimum wage of $10.10, that would only equal a $4.12 per hour rate when measured by the real costs of working and living in New York City. On the other hand, it would take $24.77 to equal the Des Moines rate.\" These changes can be seen if we continue to compare other states. A federal minimum wage is just ineffective, because it's hard to pinpoint the right wage on a federal standpoint. Something such as minimum wage is best left to the local counties or municipalities. Many states already have minimum wage laws that are set higher than the federal standard, and it's best if we let them take control of this, because they are accomodate their needs better.Will lead to job lossThink about the following senario. An employer has a worker, who generates him 20 dollars renvenue every hour. The owner pays him 15 dollars/hour, and makes $5 profit every hour. Now, the owner hires another worker, but he only generates 12 dollars revenue every hour. The owner pays him 7 dollars/hour, and generates $5 profit. Now, suppose a 15 dollar minimum wage is implemented, this would effect the owner very much. The worker was only generating 12 dollars, will know be paid 15 dollars for his work. What does that mean? It means the owner is losing money. No owner will want to keep losing potential profit, so he will likely fire the new employee. This is basic supply and demand law. And this According to several studies done by economists, they have come to the conclusion that minimium wage hikes will lead to job loss. This would also be significant since 64% of job creations come from small buisnesses.Here is some more evidence that proves minimum wage constitutes job loss. According to Federal Reserve bank of Chicago, \u201c10 percent increase in the minimum wage lowers low skill employment by 2 to 4 percent and total restaurant employment by 1 to 3 percent.\u201d According to the American Economist, 61% of economists were against the idea of a minimum wage raise. All this evidence indicates that the minimum wage hike is a job killer, and that it shouldn't be increased to $15 especially. Alan Kruger, a economist who once did a study on minimum wage effects in New Jersey, opposed a $15 dollar minimum wage stating a $15-an-hour national minimum wage would put us in uncharted waters, and risk undesirable and unintended consequences.\" Here is a graph showing the rise of teen unemployment after the minimum wage increase. Nearly after every minimum wage increase, unemployment rates have increased. Does very little to help the poorEmperical dates indicates that a minimum wage hike doesn't really effect the poor, because 60% of those in poverty are not even in the workforce. So, this would make it harder for them to get a job, because employers will try to hire those who are most experienced and more equiped for the job, even though the minimum wage job was meant for youngsters to get job experience. \"Research from economists at American University and Cornell University in 2008 showed the many state minimum-wage increases between 2003 and 2007 did nothing to reduce poverty rates. And economists at Ohio University found the federal minimum wage didn\u2019t decrease poverty, and may actually have increased poverty for certain subgroups.\"EITCThe earned income tax credit is a refundable tax credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and couples, particularly those with children. This method is far more feasible as means of reducing poverty than increasing the minimum wage. EITC does not have such detrimental employment effects such as unemployment and outsourcement of job but works the other way around for it really is a subsidy to employers to employ low value labor. Here is a graph showing the wages of employees without their EITC, and with their EITC. As you can see, the EITC boosts wages, and this will help reduce the wage gap between the rich and poor. The best part is, the unemployment disadvantages that minimum wage creates are not present. Other studies also prove that EITC decreases unemployment. Hoynes and Patel also find that the EITC has significantly boosted employment. A $1,000 increase in the credit translates into a 7.3 percentage-point increase in the employment of single mothers. This means that as a result of the boost in 1993, hundreds of thousands of women have entered the workforce. Notable people such as Warren Baffett have said expanding EITC is the right thing to do.ConclusionA $15 dollar minimum wage is not the way to go, because it's ignores the cost of livings by state, increases unemployment, does very little to reduce poverty, and other solutions such as EITC are much more effective.RebutallsFrom reading Pro's arguments, I feel like he is focusing more on the idea of a minimum wage, rather than $15 dollar figure. I'd like to mention the debate wasn't really about that, and Pro is most certainly aware of that, especially since he accepted the debate saying he would argue for a $15 dollar minimum wage.C1: David Card's studyFor Pro's first argument, he says that the Conservative narrtative about minimum wage killing jobs is false, because a study done by David Card and Alan Krueger demostrate that this isn't the case. First we need to look at what their actual study was about. It was comparing the minimum wages of two cities which compared the fast food prices of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It's important to note that this study was done by comparing two cities with similar costs of living. Also, the increase did not show any data that the minimum wage was a positive thing, rather there wasn't much of an impact with the unemployment. However, this debate is about a $15 federal minimum wage. So, this example is apples and oranges in many instances, because comparing minimum wage increases among cities is much different than minimum wage increase nationwide. Interesting enough, Alan Kruger himself said he was against the idea of increasing the minimum wage to $15.C2: Price Increases and everything elseI'll admit I'm a bit confused now, because Pro makes some arguments against the minimum wage, which are increased food costs. Not sure how I'll refute this.Pro's arguments about the bias in minimum wage articles, is rather defensive. Even if those arguments are biased, it doesn't give any reason why the $15 dollar minimum wage should be there. This is more of a rebutall than an argument.Regarding the link of the Department of Labor, many of those arguments are just cherrypicked examples of some studies which show a net positive in minimum wage. For example, the first rebutall by the DOL shows that hundreds of economists agreed with Obama, but these don't represent every ecnonmist. Most economists are against the idea of the minimum wage, so this is just a cherrypicked argument. Also, Obama's proposal is not a $15 increase, but a $10.10 increase. There is not gurantee all those economists would still support a $15 minimum wage.Finally, Pro's gives an argument states that gradually increasing it would give us good data to draw conclusions, but that isn't reallly an argument for an increase. That's like saying we should just ban all guns, so we can see how it effects the crime rate, but ignoring all the colleral damage caused by it! Minimum wage increases will increase unemployment as I have shown, and is ineffective in reducing poverty.My sourceshttp://www.degruyter.com...http://wheniwork.com...https://en.wikipedia.org...https://reason.com...http://www.republicanreader.com...http://www.huffingtonpost.com...http://www.vox.com...http://www.degruyter.com... https://www.epionline.org... http://www.krusekronicle.com...;",

            "premise": "I thank Wylted for accepting this debate, and it is perfectly alright that he has conceded due to time issues. Vote CON. But I will still write a rebuttal to round 1 claims, simply because I want to. I will do it in a more\u2026 summarized version than I usually would. ==Rebuttals== R1) Welfare and minimum wages This was an interesting argument which I was not expecting. To argue that welfare pays more than minimum wages really is not an argument against the minimum wage. If anything, it is an argument in order to reduce welfare spending. Both welfare and minimum wages have been shown to be ineffective ways to reduce poverty. Further, the CATO report on the issue is flawed. The CATO report tends to exaggerate the amount of money those in poverty were receiving from the government. The report assumes that many of these families receive TANF, SNAP, LIHEAP, WIC, and TEFAP. However, there is convincing evidence that generally most people do not receive more than one form of assistance very often. Therefore, it is misleading to claim welfare pays more than minimum wage jobs, as the assumptions they plug into their results are flawed in and of themselves. Government transfers are actually much lower than the CATO report claims, and labor income for the lowest quintile far exceeds that of those who only receive government benefits [1]. R2) Minimum wages and poverty Wylted draws his evidence from a few sources: First, a Dube study, and the next from the Washington Post. And the post summarizes multiple studies. First, the Dube study. The Dube study reaches its conclusions by assuming no-impact on employment. And how does he reach the no-impact conclusion? He uses the same methodology from his previous study, Allgretto, Dube, Reich in 2008. They claim that when they control for spatial heterogeneity, there is no adverse effect from increased minimum wage laws. Using those results, he claims to find a slight increase in poverty due to minimum wage increases. These methods have been criticized by other scholars, as it often prevents the researchers from looking into potentially valuable data which is thrown out with the type of controls used in that method. Controlling for polynomials I state trends rather than controlling for linear time trends leads to the opposite conclusion. Therefore, the method which Dube uses (which finds no effect on employment) is not valid [2]. Therefore, as the entire assumption which Dube uses to prove a positive effect on poverty is flawed, his conclusion cannot be trusted. The Washington post article argues that economists agree that minimum wages lead to a decrease in poverty. This could not be further from the truth. They cite a paper by Neumark and Wascher and claim they conclude minimum wages will reduce poverty. Well, this tells me that the reporter must have not read the paper. Neumark and Wascher claim to find that minimum wages enhance the effects of the EITC for single mothers, meaning they will be helped. However, they also find that EITC has no effect on low skilled workers and minority men, and that minimum wages adversely affect both groups. Therefore, minimum wages would harm low skilled workers, teenagers, and minorities, while helping single mothers. The study does NOT say that minimum wages reduce poverty. They find it decreases poverty in one group, and increases it in another, and then argue whether or not minimum wages help the poor depends on who you are trying to help. And the study ignores the vast majority of research which claims minimum wages have no effect on poverty, and may increase it. Sabia and Burkhauser 2007: using census data from 1979 to 2003, they estimate the effect of minimum wage increases on poverty rates. They found no evidence that minimum wages reduce either overall poverty rates or poverty rates amongst workers [3]. Sabia and Burkhauser 2010: Using same methodology and using more recent census data, they continued to find no evidence that minimum wages reduce poverty [4]. Sabia 2008: looking at groups targeted by policy makers, single mothers, he finds no evidence that minimum wages reduce poverty for those groups [5]. Neumark and Wascher 2002: looking as to how people entered and exited poverty using CPS data, they found that workers who kept their jobs were often lifted out of poverty. However, many workers who lost their jobs were barred from income and their hardships increased. Only for Junior High school drop outs are there poverty-alleviating affects. Overall, there was a slight increase in poverty [6]. Neumark, Wascher, and Schweitzer 1999: Minimum wage increases have no poverty alleviating effects [7]. Neumark and Adams 2000: Living wages do not reduce poverty [8]. Neumark and Wascher 2008: Meta-analysis. No evidence that minimum wages decrease poverty. Evidence minimum wage increases may increase poverty. Evidence shows that wages, on balance, decline as minimum wages are increased [9]. Neumark and Wascher 1997: Minimum wages lead to statistically insignificant increases in poverty [10]. Sabia and Nielson 2013: Higher minimum wages do not help people make ends meet, pay rent, pay utility bills, or avoid financial insecurity [11]. Addison and Blackburn 1999: Only junior high drop outs have poverty alleviating effects. Overall, no effect on poverty from minimum wage increases [12]. So the Washington Post was half right. Economists have reached a consensus! Except\u2026 It is that minimum wages do not decrease poverty, and that minimum wages harm society. Vote CON :D http://www.epi.org... http://www.nber.org...

DEFINITIONS MINIMUM WAGE: an amount of money that is the least amount of money per hour that workers must be paid according to the law ... www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/... INCREASE:to make greater, as in number, size, strength, or quality; augment; add to: toincrease taxes. verb (used without object), ... dictionary.reference.com/../increase ARGUMENTS . Increase Minimum Wage, Decrease Employment Getting the millions of currently-unemployed workers into productive employment should be a major focus of government. I had hoped that the president would address the labor market crisis, directing the energy of government in an effort to help the suffering unemployed. Unfortunately, there was precious little attention and no urgency regarding this crisis in the State of the Union address. Instead, the president called to increase the minimum wage. The economic effects of minimum wage increases have been studied dozens and dozens of times in the past few decades. Different studies come to different conclusions, of course. But economists David Neumark and William Wascher, after conducting an exhaustive literature review, conclude that \"among the papers we view as providing the most credible evidence, almost all point to negative employment e\"0\"2ects, both for the United States as well as for many other countries.\"They continue: \"The studies that focus on the least-skilled groups that are likely most directly a\"0\"2ected by minimum wage increases provide relatively overwhelming evidence of stronger disemployment effects for these groups.\" The weight of the evidence suggests that increasing the minimum wage decreases employment, especially for lower-skilled workers. Will a minimum wage increase help to alleviate poverty, as the president suggested in his speech? The evidence suggests that it will not. Economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser find that asmall minority of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase - around ten percent - live in poor households. The White House itself states that workerswho would benefit from a minimum wage increase bring home less than half of their household's total wage and salary income. In other words, the workers who will benefit from an increase are secondary and tertiary earners - think more of teenagers with summer jobs, of spouses earning some income on the side, or of elderly grandparents earning some retirement income, and less of primary breadwinners. In fact, Professors Sabia and Burkhauser find that around two-thirds of minimum wage workers live in households with incomes more than twice the poverty line.Speaking of teenagers: The unemployment rate for 16-to-19 year old African Americans is a massive 37.8 percent. For white teenagers, the rate is 20.8 percent. This crushing unemployment will ripple through the rest of their lives, affecting their labor market outcomes for years to come. Why does it make sense to increase the cost of hiring these unemployed teenagers by increasing the minimum wage? Raising the minimum wage is unlikely to affect the poverty rate. And raising the minimum wage certainly won'tincreasethe number of workers who are employed. Quite the opposite - the weight of the evidence suggests that it may decrease the number of employed workers. Our labor market crisis is a national emergency. Ideally our government would be implementing policies to help workers get jobs. But surely the government should not actively increase the cost of hiring workers. An increase in the minimum wage would do exactly that - by design. The president was wrong to call for a minimum wage increase, most especially in a labor market in crisis. Raising minimum wage is sure bet to create more jobless young Americans The unemploymentrate for 16 to 19 year olds was an astonishingly high 23.8 percent last month. The United States is facing a youth employment crisis. Young workers are finding it increasingly difficult to enter the labor market, get their first job and work their way up the career ladder. Yet, during this time of persistently high youth unemployment, there have been calls to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to as high as $10 per hour. America's youth are having a hard time reaching the first rung on their career ladders. Now is a bad time to increase minimum wages and make that important step more difficult. Higher minimum wages generate a tradeoff between higher wages for the employed and higher rates of unemployment. When minimum wages increase, many workers who earn less than the new higher minimum wage lose their jobs. Firms often decide that they can get by with fewer workers instead of paying higher wages. The increase in minimum wage, will even increase the unemployment issue in the state. www.aei.org/article/economics/fisca.. www.forbes.com/sites/williamdunkelb...",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The US Federal Government should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour",
            "premise": "Myth: Raising the minimum wage will only benefit teens. Not true: The typical minimum wage worker is not a high school student earning weekend pocket money. In fact, 89 percent of those who would benefit from a federal minimum wage increase to $12 per hour are age 20 or older, and 56 percent are women. Myth: Increasing the minimum wage will cause people to lose their jobs. Not true: In a letter to President Obama and congressional leaders urging a minimum wage increase, more than 600 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners wrote, \"In recent years there have been important developments in the academic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and providing some help on the jobs front.\" Myth: Small business owners can't afford to pay their workers more, and therefore don't support an increase in the minimum wage. Not true: A July 2015 survey found that 3 out of 5 small business owners with employees support a gradual increase in the minimum wage to $12. The survey reports that small business owners say an increase \"would immediately put more money in the pocket of low-wage workers who will then spend the money on things like housing, food, and gas. This boost in demand for goods and services will help stimulate the economy and help create opportunities.\" Myth: Raising the federal tipped minimum wage ($2.13 per hour since 1991) would hurt restaurants. Not true: In California, employers are required to pay servers the full minimum wage of $9 per hour \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd before tips. Even with a 2014 increase in the minimum wage, the National Restaurant Association projects California restaurant sales will outpace all but only a handful of states in 2015. Myth: Raising the federal tipped minimum wage ($2.13 per hour since 1991) would lead to restaurant job losses. Not true: As of May 2015, employers in San Francisco must pay tipped workers the full minimum wage of $12.25 per hour \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd before tips. Yet, the San Francisco leisure and hospitality industry, which includes full-service restaurants, has experienced positive job growth this year, including following the most recent minimum wage increase. Myth: Raising the federal minimum wage won't benefit workers in states where the hourly minimum rate is already higher than the federal minimum. Not true: While 29 states and the District of Columbia currently have a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum, increasing the federal minimum wage will boost the earnings for nearly 38 million low-wage workers nationwide. That includes workers in those states already earning above the current federal minimum. Raising the federal minimum wage is an important part of strengthening the economy. A raise for minimum wage earners will put more money in more families' pockets, which will be spent on goods and services, stimulating economic growth locally and nationally. Myth: Younger workers don't have to be paid the minimum wage. Not true: While there are some exceptions, employers are generally required to pay at least the federal minimum wage. Exceptions allowed include a minimum wage of $4.25 per hour for young workers under the age of 20, but only during their first 90 consecutive calendar days of employment with an employer, and as long as their work does not displace other workers. After 90 consecutive days of employment or the employee reaches 20 years of age, whichever comes first, the employee must receive the current federal minimum wage or the state minimum wage, whichever is higher. There are programs requiring federal certification that allow for payment of less than the full federal minimum wage, but those programs are not limited to the employment of young workers. Myth: Restaurant servers don't need to be paid the minimum wage since they receive tips. Not true: An employer can pay a tipped employee as little as $2.13 per hour in direct wages, but only if that amount plus tips equal at least the federal minimum wage and the worker retains all tips and customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. Often, an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage. When that occurs, the employer must make up the difference. Some states have minimum wage laws specific to tipped employees. When an employee is subject to both the federal and state wage laws, he or she is entitled to the provisions of each law which provides the greater benefits. Myth: Increasing the minimum wage is bad for businesses. Not true: Academic research has shown that higher wages sharply reduce employee turnover which can reduce employment and training costs. Myth: Increasing the minimum wage is bad for the economy. Not true: Since 1938, the federal minimum wage has been increased 22 times. For more than 75 years, real GDP per capita has steadily increased, even when the minimum wage has been raised. Myth: The federal minimum wage goes up automatically as prices increase. Not true: While some states have enacted rules in recent years triggering automatic increases in their minimum wages to help them keep up with inflation, the federal minimum wage does not operate in the same manner. An increase in the federal minimum wage requires approval by Congress and the president. However, in his call to gradually increase the current federal minimum, President Obama has also called for it to adjust automatically with inflation. Eliminating the requirement of formal congressional action would likely reduce the amount of time between increases, and better help low-income families keep up with rising prices. Myth: The federal minimum wage is higher today than it was when President Reagan took office. Not true: While the federal minimum wage was only $3.35 per hour in 1981 and is currently $7.25 per hour in real dollars, when adjusted for inflation, the current federal minimum wage would need to be more than $8 per hour to equal its buying power of the early 1980s and more nearly $11 per hour to equal its buying power of the late 1960s. That's why President Obama is urging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage and give low-wage workers a much-needed boost. Myth: Increasing the minimum wage lacks public support. Not true: Raising the federal minimum wage is an issue with broad popular support. Polls conducted since February 2013 when President Obama first called on Congress to increase the minimum wage have consistently shown that an overwhelming majority of Americans support an increase. Myth: Increasing the minimum wage will result in job losses for newly hired and unskilled workers in what some call a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlast-one-hired-equals-first-one-fired\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd scenario. Not true: Minimum wage increases have little to no negative effect on employment as shown in independent studies from economists across the country. Academic research also has shown that higher wages sharply reduce employee turnover which can reduce employment and training costs. Myth: The minimum wage stays the same if Congress doesn't change it. Not true: Congress sets the minimum wage, but it doesn't keep pace with inflation. Because the cost of living is always rising, the value of a new minimum wage begins to fall from the moment it is set.",

            "conclusion": "The Federal Minimum wage should NOT be raised",
            "premise": "The argument that raising the federal minimum wage would cost business owners more money, and thus force them to either lay off workers or not bring on additional workers, seems to assume that the only factor effecting unemployment is the finances of those employing the workforce. Instead, raising the federal minimum wage may work to incentivize people who have previously relied on welfare to seek employment. As the federal minimum wage stands, there are people who feel it is not worth their time to work for the minimum wage, and instead would be able to sustain a lifestyle they are comfortable with by continuing to stay on welfare for as long as they can. The argument that raising the minimum wage would increase \"overall costs\" seems to be reasonable in the short-term; in that, business owners would likely try to compensate for the increased wages of their employees. However, there are many other factors that have a direct impact upon the \"overall costs,\" and such a discussion seems to be beyond the scope of this debate. As far as your statement that raising the minimum wage would have a \"negative ripple through the economy,\" I will note that the very purpose of the enactment of a federal minimum wage is to increase consumer-spending power in order to stimulate the economy. That said, due to the inflation of our dollar over time, it would be reasonable for the federal government to raise the minimum wage in accordance with economic inflation, to preserve the intent of having a federal minimum wage in the first place. Without doing so, due to the already increase in \"overall costs\" of the standard of living in our country, minimum wage workers will continue to fall behind and the very purpose for a federal minimum wage would eventually become compromised. Lastly, I agree with you that if states want to raise their minimum wage that is their decision. However, if the federal government feels the need to step in and set a floor for what it believes the minimum wage should be, it has every right to do so. (Darby)",

            "discussionTitle": "should the government raise minimum wage",
            "conclusion": "should the government raise minimum wage",
            "premise": "what pro fails to mention is that though I don't mention evidence to support my argument but he don't either he doesn't rebut my claims either. Should the U.S. government increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $15? The issue is nuanced: Raising wages would boost employee paychecks, but it could also cause cost-conscious companies to reduce hiring. But with many states taking independent action to increase wages\"and with a $15 federal minimum wage \"over time\" added to the Democratic Party platform last week\"we asked three faculty experts to discuss the implications. Boost jobs through an earned income tax credit, better education, and reduced licensing requirements Erik Brynjolfsson We\"ve seen median wages stagnate for almost 20 years in the United States. How can we increase them while also boosting jobs? Here are three ideas: One: expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC; Two: reinvent education; and Three: reduce occupational licensing. Here\"s how the EITC works. Suppose that someone is earning $12 per hour, and we\"d like to them to earn $15. With an EITC, they\"d get an additional $3 per hour worked from the government. The money to pay for this would come from general tax revenue including income taxes, or ideally increased taxes on carbon dioxide\" emissions, congestion, and other things we\"d like to discourage. One of the benefits of the EITC is that it encourages employers to hire more workers, unlike increasing the minimum wage. That\"s important because I\"ve been convinced by sociologists like Bob Putnam that work has value beyond the dollars it provides. It\"s good for society to keep people engaged in the workforce, and we should be rewarding entrepreneurs and managers who come up with jobs. Another way to increase both wages and jobs is by increasing the educational levels of our workforce. The wage gap between the most and least educated workers has grown enormously since the 1980s, and better-educated workers also have much lower unemployment rates and higher rates of workforce participation. But it\"s not enough to simply do more of the same. We need to reinvent education for an age where machines are increasingly doing cognitive tasks\"the second machine age. That means a greater emphasis on skills like teamwork, project management, persuasion, leadership, coaching, and creativity. I believe these can be fostered in the right educational settings. Last but not least, we need to reduce unnecessary occupational licensing. Over 25 percent of workers now require a license to do their jobs, a five-fold increase since the 1950s. While some licenses are important for safety or other reasons, research has shown that excessive licensing requirements reduce employment and mobility. Requirements vary widely across states: Michigan requires three years of education and training to become a security guard, while most other states require 11 days or less. Having more people working and earning good wages is good not just for the people we help, but for all of us: People who work are more engaged in community, creating a virtuous cycle. If we do these three things, we\"ll be on track to becoming a richer, more engaged, and more dynamic nation. -- ErikBrynjolfsson, professor of information technology and director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy A higher minimum wage, by region Simon Johnson I\"m in favor of an increased minimum wage, but there is a valid question of \"by how much?\" Would you lose jobs as a consequence of increasing the minimum wage above some level? Labor economists have studied this carefully, and while there is no consensus, it\"s not difficult to support an increase to $12 per hour on the basis of the available evidence. In areas with higher living costs, a higher minimum wage can make sense\"and some states are already planning to phase in $15 per hour over several years. However, especially in less heavily urbanized areas with a lower cost of living, a higher national minimum wage could have unintended consequences, in the sense of reducing hiring and potentially increasing unemployment. -- Simon Johnson, professor of global economics and management A modest, stepwise increase over time Thomas Kochan It\"s clearly beyond time to increase the minimum wage. But it\"s a political stalemate: It has less to do with economics than politics. Congress has not acted positively on labor legislation for a long time. They block essentially all changes in labor policy, whether it\"s increases in wages, updating hourly wage legislation, or in other areas of labor relations law, all of which badly need to be updated. The stalemate has led states to take action on their own. Half the states have recognized the need for an increase. It\"s time to catch up. We\"re at $7.25, which is ridiculous. My view is that $15 is a reasonable target for the future, but we should raise it in steps at the federal level. An immediate jump to $15 would be too abrupt a change. It could have significant negative employment consequences. If we increased it step-by-step with a goal toward $15 over a period of years, it wouldn\"t have significant employment effects. We could start at $10, then go up to $15 over four years. President Obama has made raising the minimum wage a centerpiece of his campaign against \"income inequality.\" In his most recent State of the Union Address, he called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over the next 3 years. He also announced plans to unilaterally increase the minimum wage for federal contractors. Meanwhile, numerous governors are also pushing to increase their state minimum as well. No doubt such proposals are politically popular. But the overwhelming body of evidence suggests that increasing the minimum wage would do little to reduce poverty or inequality. On the other hand it would almost certainly reduce employment opportunities, especially for those low skilled, entry level workers for whom a job represents the first rungs on the ladder of opportunity. Over the last several years, Cato scholars have written on the pitfalls of raising the minimum wage.

While the President and his supporters claim that this increase would greatly benefit the economy and result in no loss of jobs, the opposition claims that this would be detrimental to minimum wage employees, resulting in 500,000 fewer jobs.

            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage should not increase to $15.",
            "premise": "R1: Increased Consumption.This claim has already been debunked in My P2: Annual Wages case. Increased Consumption means increased spending. The GDP is merely a measurement of the movement of currency in a nation, aka spending. In R2, I gave evidence that minimum wage increases have never been followed by GDP growth. A case dropped by Con showing that when minimum wage increased [1], GDP growth almost always decreased [2]. For Con's case to be true, we MUST see an increase in GDP growth. History opposes Con's case.Along with historically inconsistency, Con's case also falls short of academic consensus. In a popular study by famous economist J. Sabia, he shows that increases in minimum wage have only led to a negative impact on the GDP, specifically for low-skilled industries [3].Reasons for this being that hikes in minimum wage correlates strongly with unemployment rates among teenagers [4]. The increase in unemployment negates a major source of growth in the economy, and reduces productivity. Another inherent issue with Con's claim is that only a small portion of those postivitely effected by hikes in wages are major contributors to the economy. Over 62% of minimum wage workers work only as a summer job, and provide little to the economy [5]. It should be noted that Con's own source on the $17,500 claim states that this income is greatly outweighed by larger unemployment [6]. It must also be noted that Con's math is wrong. The CBO puts the net gain on income for $10.10 an hour at only $2 bn a year once increases and decreases in income are accounted for [12]. Even at $15 an hour, income would, at most, increase by $5 bn, but an exponentially increasing rate of disemployment would have a much larger decreasing effect, so net gain would be lower.A major contributor to lacking economic growth is that the increase in prices, following basic economic philosophy, reduces demand. This causes less consumption overall. We see this increase in prices across nations with minimum wages above $6.00 an hour. Using minimum wages gathered from OECD [7], and CPI information [8], we find that as minimum wage increases, there is an increase in CPI. Especially in the restaurant field, where a large ratio of employees are mw. The restaurant CPI follows minimum wage to a near perfect degree. We see this supported in academia by Aaronson, French, and MacDonald (2007)[9], where they found unambiguous increases in prices when wages increase. This claim was later supported by studies done in 2015 [10]. Empirically and historically speaking, raising minimum wage does not increase consumption, but instead leads to lower GDP growth. The Heritage Foundation found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would cost 300,000 jobs a year and reduce the economy by $40 bn annually [11].R2: Higher Productivity.Con's case is disproven by a study by A. Davies showing that productivity does not increase when minimum wage rose [12]. In fact, increases in unemployment negated any increase. CBO estimates as many as 200,000 workers could lose their job if minimum wage increased to $9.00, as could 1,000,000 workers at $10.10 [13]. By such an increase of 5x for only a dollar increase in wages, $15 an hour would lead to mass disemployment. At $10.10 alone, you lose nearly 2 billion hours of productivity. The economic stress would lead to lower productivity on the rest of the workers who must pick up the slack.Many studies support this, including one by Nuemark and Wascher [14] which stated that among low-skilled workers, there was a strong disemployment effect. A study by M. Hicks [15] found that minimum wage hikes in the 2000's led to 550,000 fewer jobs being created. Abowd claimed that french men ages 25 - 30 on minimum wage saw their probability of keeping their job decrease by 4.6 percent for every 1% increase in wages [16].Another hit to productivity was a study by Chaplin, Turner, and Pape [2003] that found that higher minimum wages lead to slight decreases in school enrollment [17]. The long term effect on skill levels will reduce both productivity and the efficiency of productivity over the long term. Backing Chaplin's study was two done by Nuemark and Wascher [18][19]. John Warren and C. Hamrock found the same results in 2008 [20].R3: Corporate Tax Cuts.Con's case lacks an understanding of minimum wage demographics. It assumes increasing minimum wage will lead to the wage increases necessary to decrease welfare funding. This isn't true. In fact, Minimum Wage increases barely touch poverty-stricken workers. I will discuss more in P5: Inefficiency and Alternatives, but will explain a bit here in the name of refutation.Contrary to popular belief, most minimum wage workers are not poor. In fact, a report done by R. Nielsen found that more than 57% of the nation's impoverished were so because they were unemployed [21]. As such, a minimum wage hike will not help them, but will keep them unemployed longer, costing the Government money in the long term. 87% of those who benefited from an increase in wages were not poor, and 56% lived in households earning 2x the poverty level. So the minimum wage increase does little to actually help poverty. Forbes claimed the average Household Income of minimum wage earners was $50,700+ a year [22]. This implies that the average welfare earner was largely unaffected. This is likely because most impoverished with jobs are poor because of family sizes, not individual wages.Many on minimum wage don't receive welfare because, statistically speaking, minimum wage isn't below the poverty line. Those who live on their own, working the annual average work hour (1780)[23], will bring in $12,900 a year. This is over $1,100 above the poverty level. If they were married with another minimum wage worker, they would earn almost $9,900 over [24]. If the second member were a child, the worker would be impoverished, until the EITC (worth $1,000)[25] and the CTC (worth $3,305 for one child)[26] were added, putting the worker almost $1,300 over the poverty line. This being so, poverty has little to do with their wages, and more with work hours and family sizes where the size is well above the wages of the working members.As such, Minimum Wage does little to decrease poverty, and therefore welfare. If anything, the effect on unemployment and cut hours would likely throw more people into poverty. Therefore there is no room for Corporate Tax Cuts. Even then, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 included tax cuts [27], and yet many of the studies I provided that found disemployment and negative GDP impacts included this wage increase, implying tax credits did little for corporations and workers.P1: Corporate Income v Employer Income.To reinforce this case, a study of prices in New Jersey claimed prices increased because of a hike in wages [28]. One restaurant rose prices 14% after a minimum wage hike [29]. Another found a price hike of at least 0.7% for every 10% hike in wages, or 1.6% for limited service establishments [30]. Such establishments would have to raise prices by 5% [31]. On that same note, Con never addressed decreasing fast food sales [32]. P2 and P3 need not be expanded upon.P4: Effect on Employees.To expand this case, a chart taken from the BLS shows a perfect correlation between teenager unemployment and the minimum wage [33]. A review of studies confirmed disemployment among younger workers [34]. Kosters [35], Henderson [36], and Sabia, Burkhauser, and Hansen [37] confirm this. Mark Wilson found that most minimum wage workers get promoted past minimum wage within a year, displaying a natural progression away from entry-level worker, and when forced, leads to disemployment among those workers [38].This is confirmed in a mass review of studies by Nuemark [39]. Brown, Gilroy, and Kohen found the same results, as did many others [40,41,42,43], and a massive compilation of studies by the JECR found a consensus in academia similar to Nuemark's [44]. P5: Inefficiency and Alternatives.As stated in R2: Corporate Tax Cuts, the demographics are not in minimum wage's favor. In fact, notable liberal billionaire Warren Buffett claimed he didn't believe the minimum wage was effective [45]. A 2010 study by Burkhauser and Sabia concludes that increasing the minimum wage does nothing to reduce poverty [46]. I've already hit plenty on the topic of inefficiency, so I will move on to the point. Alternatives. The study mentioned increasing The Earned Income Tax Credit, which is the most proposed option [47]. AIE discussed the proposal in depth [48], claiming that the policy is far more precise since the tax credit is based on household income (the defining income for poverty). Therefore, a family in poverty will recieve an increase in income, while a minimum wage worker in High School and with a household income of $50,000 doesn't. The policy is far better targeted and far more precise.Other reasons for the EITC's efficiency is that it does not cost the employer anything. As many scholars agree on, jobs are the best anti-poverty tool, therefore an increase to wages without decreasing employment is the best path. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found, increases in the EITC and CTC (Child Tax Credit) led to higher grades, healthier children, increased earnings for the children later on, and a number of other benefits [49]. The Tax Credit also encourages work, as the credit is based on a percentage of income. More work equals more revenue [50]. This increases work, productivity, and wages.Conclusion:Minimum Wage does not reduce poverty, welfare spending, or hardships among earners. It does, however, increase disemployment, prices, and even poverty if doubled. It does not increase consumption, but does decrease GDP growth. It should not be increased to $15 an hour. Increasing the EITC is the best option for reducing poverty and hardship among low-earning households and the impoverished.Sources: http://pasted.co...",

            "premise": "I'd like to thank Damian4447 for accepting the challenge and I wish him strength in argument (you're allowed to argue whatever you would like btw). I will lay out the majority of my argument in this round. Basic function of the minimum wage and its general impact on the economy The minimum wage is a price floor which, in some case, forces a superficially high wage rate. This occurs through the value of the labour being worth less than the minimum wage, causing a superficial inflation. Essentially, a business runs at a loss if it were to hire an employee whose actual labour value was worth less than the minimum wage. As you can see, at least in theory, the minimum wage is detrimental to business, yet it\u2019s also detrimental to employees. Remember, if you can\u2019t get a job, your income is zero\u2026 Minimum wage has, statistically, been shown not to reduce unemployment. A comprehensive study by Burkhauser et al.-, concluded that, \u201cMinimum wage increases have an insignificant effect on the employment of prime age workers (aged 25 to 61), but they have large and significant negative employment effects on teenagers, young high school dropouts, and young blacks. Hence, the very people minimum wage policies claim to help are most likely to be adversely affected.\u201d [6] Another study concluded that, \u201ca 10% increase in the minimum wage reduces teenage employment by 1% to 2%, and a decline of 1.5% to 2% among young adults.\u201d [7] Note that an American governmental body produced this. Yet another study: \u201cFinds that the negative effects of a minimum wage increase are greatest for nonwhite teenagers. Moreover, the disemployment effects on the size of the labor force are greater than the effects on the unemployment rate.\u201d [9] This particular, collaboration of studies by a not-for-profit organisation, concluded that, \u201cAfter analyzing poverty rates and increases in state & federal minimum wage laws from 2003 to 2007, they determined that raises in the minimum wage requirement have no effect on poverty.\u201d [10] As you can see, several studies suggest that there are multiple problems with a minimum wage in America, ranging from hurting black-American teens, teens and women, to reducing employment and not fixing the poverty issue. Supply and demand violation James Dorn, of the CATO institute, says that, \"\u2026 the law of demand states that when the price of anything (including labor) increases, the quantity demanded will decrease, assuming other things affecting demand remain unchanged. In the case of labor, this means as the price of labor (the wage rate) increases, the number of jobs will decrease, other things constant. Moreover, the decrease in employment will be greater in the long run than in the short run, as employers shift to labor-saving methods of production.\" [11] What Dorn is saying can be represented through this graph [12]: As shown by the graph, as the supply of available employees increases, the demand for them decreases (so long as all else is equal). The supply of available employees increases as some businesses hire less people, due to minimum wage, if the work costs less than minimum wage. This means that if the labour costs $4.50 per hour in real terms, a business will be hiring labour for twice the amount for if minimum wage is $9 per hour, in theory. Workers who want to work, but due to lower demand and greater supply, no longer can [12], (businesses will be hiring less people, as businesses will either raise prices or cut employees to cope). Impact on teenagers Businesses, when forced to pay minimum wage, and with all things equal, will be unable to hire as many workers; why would a business want to hire at a loss? This has been shown to negatively affect teenagers, such as the case in Louisiana [1]. A ~43% increase in the federal minimum wage had teenaged unemployment soar from 13.6% (2006), to 26.5% (2011). What this shows is that a minimum wage leaves businesses hiring less teenagers because that rise from $5.15 to $7.25 means that, all else being equal, there are 30% less jobs for teenagers (which equated to 6,600 jobs for them, in this scenario). As you can see, minimum wage has left teenagers, in general, with fewer opportunities to enter the workplace. Another study showed that, \u201ca 10% increase in the minimum wage will reduce teenage employment by 1%-3%\u201d [8]. Automation As the artificial costs of hiring people become greater, businesses, in hope of greater profits, will turn to the automated industry. After the initial cost of the machinery, and general maintenance, it could potentially be cheaper for a business to run a machine, than to hire a person (not to mention the social expenditure, like motivation and well-being, a human requires). Progressive Car Insurance is able to offer cheaper fees than it could in the past. Why? \u201cLess overheads, [meaning less hiring costs] means more savings. There\u2019s no phone queues, no unnecessary chatter and endless questions, and that means we have much lower overheads to pass on to our customers. [2]\u201d This company is able to offer savings due to its 100% online, automated service. Less power for the employee A minimum wage reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom. This creates an additional barrier to employment for the employee, a barrier that need not exist. If someone wants to work for a wage below the minimum wage, and is understanding of the work involved, would it not be good to let them work for that amount? Should people not have the right to self-determination, so long as their actions do not harm others? Tort law, used to counteract free, risky contracts, serves no good in regards to minimum wage, as there is no immediate danger involved in the contract [4]. In other words, tort law exists to prevent companies from selling dangerous products, not employees consenting to contract. Worker exploitation is an argument often made in favour of the minimum wage. In America, \u201cMinimum wage workers account for 4.7 percent of hourly paid workers in 2012\u201d [5]. This would indicates that workers, in theory, would mostly be paid an accepted, real value for their labour, rather than a contrived value. Furthermore, the 4.7 percent could be slightly lower, as some of the work may, in reality, be worth $7.15 an hour. So, worker exploitation/slave wages, all things being equal, would not be rampant without minimum wage. Sources and References [1] http://www.thepelicanpost.org...

            "premise": "But again, the cost of living is increasing. The only way to fix that problem, caused by inflation, is to stimulate the economy through an increase in the minimum wage. Increasing the wage would assist many people, mostly those who are in poverty. As discussed by CNN (1). Quoting from the article: \"Last week Oxfam released a new study that dispels many of the political myths surrounding the nation's minimum wage debate. It shows not only that increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour would give some 25 million workers across America a much-needed raise, but also that, on average, one in five workers in every single congressional district in America -- red or blue -- would benefit from such a raise. In fact, according to our data, a hike in the minimum wage would benefit more than 55,000 workers in the average congressional district.\" This increase has been proven to assist workers across America, helping those in every state. Quoting from the Study done by Oxfam: \"The districts with the highest percentages of workers who would benefit from a higher minimum wage are a diverse mix \" at least 29 percent of workers in districts like South Florida, rural South Texas, and Bakersfield, California.\" (2) This increase would benefit workers across the nation, but assisting those mainly in the states with the highest number of workers. This is what America needs, a chance to fix this poverty problem by attacking the source; low income. The price to live has risen over these seven years, and it is time that we fix that mistake.

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The Minimum Wage Should be Increased",
            "premise": "I thank Wylted for taking the challenge! I will rebut my opponent\u2019s arguments next round. As his arguments focused primarily on the poverty aspect of the debate (which I will respond to next round), my case will be primarily oriented towards the effect minimum wages have on employment. ==In Theory== Before discussing the empirical literature (which is what I always do, come on, it\u2019s me ;D) I will discuss what happens *in theory* when minimum wages are increased. I will present both the neoclassical and monopsony models, in order to clarify to the voters as to *why* the changes in employment occur the way they do. The empirical section will prove which theory is better supported in the actual world. First, the neoclassical model. The neoclassical model is the model which is presented in most economic textbooks and is widely accepted by mainstream economists. The model in its most basic form assumes that labor and product markets are competitive. Setting the minimum wage above the equilibrium raises the firms cost of production, which leads to two economic effects. First, the price of output increases, so the demand for it falls (output is defined as the quantity of goods or services produced over a given time period). Second, the higher wages lead the firms to substitute capital for labor. This leads to a decrease in the demand for labor. In the empirical literature, this is measured through labor elasticity: this is basically a measure as to how much unemployment is created due to the increase of the minimum wage [1]. The model also assumes that all workers are being paid in excess of the previous minimum wage. Though, in the US, this is not far from the truth (as 90% of workers are paid above the minimum wage), it is still a simplification made by the model. The second theory is the monopsony model. The neoclassical model assumes a competitive market, so one company cannot set the equilibrium wage: it is created through competition, and the minimum wage, as a mandated price floor, disrupts the process and leads to a net-loss of jobs. The monopsony model takes the opposite extreme. The model assumes that individual firms do have control over the wage equilibrium, and assumes much less competition than the previous model. In the standard form, the \u2018monopsonist\u2019 is what represents the employer\u2019s side. It is generally one firm. The collection of workers represent the homogenous workers, who are all paid the same wage. Due to the fact the monopsonist is the only employer, and is facing an ever increasing supply curve and increases wages in order to entice workers. If the minimum wage is not set too high, there can actually be an increased level of employment, as the firm (who is raising wages) sees more of a supply in labor, and therefore has lower employment costs [2]. Although this is a possibility, it is generally not accepted as it would not apply well towards a national minimum wage policy. The equilibrium wage varies across industries, skill sets, and regions\u2014the labor market simply is not homogeneous in the real world, and it is very seldom that a monopsonist actually exists. To settle the question as to which theory is correct, we must turn to the empirical literature. Both theories work on paper, but it is the result in the real world which accurately tells us which theory is valid. ==Empirical evidence on employment effects== The empirical evidence in the minimum wage debate is very one-sided. In almost every review (except a few critical studies, e.g, Myth and Measurement [3]), the literature has concluded that the burgeoning literature supports the theory that higher minimum wages reduce employment levels. The first systemic review of the literature was published in 1981. This study created the \u2018consensus\u2019 estimate regarding the elasticity of minimum wages. They found a 10% increase in the minimum wage led to elasticity measurements of -0.1 to -0.3. In other words, a 10% increase in the minimum wage led to a 1-3% decrease in employment for low skilled workers [4]. A second review by the Joint Economic Committee came to similar conclusions. They found that, not only do minimum wage laws reduce employment, but they reduce on the job training which lead to lower incomes in the long term (although they do get a temporary increased wage). They find that the vast preponderance of evidence demonstrates the negative effects of the minimum wage [5]. The following graph, which was produced by the same report, shows a close correlation between real minimum wage levels and teenage unemployment [6]: A newer review published in 2006 corroborated these earlier summaries, concluding \u201ca sizable majority of the studies... give a relatively consistent (although not always statistically significant) indication of negative employment effects of minimum wages\u201d [7]. The review was also slightly updated in 2008, with the same results. The study found that about two thirds of the published research supported the neoclassical model of the minimum wage, and supported the \u2018consensus view\u2019 created in 1981. When the research was limited to studies with strong methodology, 80% point to negative employment effects [8]. Most of these studies are known as difference-in-differences studies. The methodology, in the simplest terms I can think of, are comparing rates of unemployment before and after the minimum wage laws were changed. In many cases, this can be seen to underestimate the result. Research published last year noted that studies claiming \u2018no effect\u2019 rely upon this methodology. Although the vast amount of research still finds a negative effect when using this methodology, difference-in-differences often produces a misleading \u2018no effect\u2019 conclusion. In many cases, changes in the minimum wage should not be expected to change unemployment levels immediately. In fact, there is often a \u2018lag\u2019 after the law before minimum wages take effect [9]. There is also research indicating many firms refuse to lay off employees due to moral considerations. But they are not opposed to not hiring people if the cost of hiring becomes too high (as new workers would give the costs of a higher wages to the firm). Therefore, research looking into employment dynamics\u2014that is, the rate of new hiring\u2014shows that employers are less likely to hire workers after new minimum wage laws are passed [10]. Other studies claiming \u2018no effect\u2019 fail to recognize that the effect of transitioning to a new equilibrium are often slow or not smooth [11], meaning the noise in the data has to be accounted for before we can assume there is \u2018no effect\u2019. As noted, employment dynamics do a good job minimizing this problem, and the evidence there suggests decreased employment. I caution everyone who looks into the effects of minimum wage on the economy to be wary of case-studies. Case studies are not representative of the entire US. However, they can give some basic information as to how minimum wages interact with the workforce\u2014at least in the specific area of study. An increase of the local minimum wage in New York by only ~1 dollar led to a 20% reduction of youth employment. The evidence is robust when changing the control variable to different surrounding geographical areas. This gives some credence to the idea that minimum wages may have effects larger than the consensus view [12]. ==Minimum wages may cause long-term harm== This argument is one of the most compelling against increasing the minimum wage. Increased minimum wages are shown to increase the amount of children who drop out of school in order to get a job. They assume that the higher wages will give them a stable income, and they would not need to continue schooling. However, as noted, employment rates drop and most negatively affect low-skilled youths. Therefore, this increases the chances of them becoming idle. They neither get 1) skills from schooling, or 2) skills from work experience. Over the long-term, their future prospects for attaining a job significantly diminish and their future wages are lower than what they would have been had minimum wages not been increased [13]. Minimum wages are not only associated with decreased school enrolment, but also decreasing the amount of training people in low-paying jobs receive. Research published starting in the 1980s suggested that minimum wages would decrease the amount of training workers would receive. More modern evidence confirms these conclusions and attempts to correct many of the shortcomings of the previous papers. Both formal, informal, and total training decreased significantly and had large negative elasticities. Although evidence for training to obtain a job was more ambiguous, there was overall a statistically insignificant decrease for that specific portion of training [14]. Evidence suggests decreased school enrolment and on the job training as a result from minimum wage laws. This indicates that, over the long term, potential earnings may actually decrease due to increases in the minimum wage, meaning the minimum wage has a long-term negative impact on lesser-skilled workers. Conclusion: The evidence as to the negative employment effects due to increased minimum wages is significant and vast. Minimum wages will harm educational attainment and reduce on the job training, leading to a long-term adverse effects from minimum wage laws. References: 1. Neumark, David and William L.

            "conclusion": "March Beginners' Tournament: The USFG should significantly raise the federal minimum wage",
            "premise": "Argument 1: Raising the minimum wage would increase unemployment One of the greatest shortcomings of raising the minimum wages is that wage increases are often correlated with the decrease of such low-paying jobs hurting those who are supposed to be help with this wage increase. The extra money for these workers has to come from somewhere and such comes primarily from the businesses that employ them. In a 2014 study by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated that a half-million jobs would be lost if the minimum wage was increased to at least $10 an hour as this debate describes. [1] If you also look at the history of minimum wage, wage hikes do reduce employment. With the very first introduction of the minimum wage at $0.25, according to the US Department of Labor, the minimum wage led to 30,000 to 50,000 jobs lost which accounted for around 10-13% of workers who had jobs before the minimum wage. With the implementation in Puerto Rico, 120,000 jobs were lost within the year after the law was put into place. A review of the Minimum Wage Study Commission\u2019s report in 1981 shows that a recent 10% increase in the federal minimum wage resulted in the reduction of teen employment by 1-3%. [2] With the added labor costs, businesses would have to raise their prices, cut employee hours and benefits, cut workers, or in the 21st century replace them with computers, machines and robots. Take for example BAXTER, a robot that costs less than the average worker\u2019s salary at $25,000 capable of doing many unskilled jobs using pennies worth of electricity to operate [7]. Sure, it may not be as versatile as your average minimum wage worker, but if you look at computers, they developed from a programmer\u2019s play thing in the 60\u2019s to literally integrated into everything in society within a matter of decades. The Bank of England predicted that within the next 10 to 20 years, robots will take over 80 million jobs in the United States leaving those who are only capable of simple tasks out of the job market. By raising the federal minimum wage, you are only pushing employers to utilize more robots and computers in response to their raised labor costs. [3] Argument 2: Raising the minimum wage is ineffective at decreasing poverty. According to the Census Bureau, 34% of those living in poverty do not work. And if they don\u2019t work, such individuals would not benefit from a minimum wage increase. And pertaining to my previous argument, if the minimum wage was increased, there will be less jobs inflating the percentage of people who will not benefit from a wage hike. [5] Another issue with raising the federal minimum wage is the fact that cost of living varies by state. The states where the cost of living is lower would be negatively affected by unnecessarily raising costs of businesses in areas where poverty is minimal. This map below illustrates areas where costs of living are high and low. [4] In addition, most minimum wage earners don\u2019t even live in poverty. The average family income of a minimum wage earner is around $53,000. [6] Conclusion: I have proven that not only would increasing the federal minimum wage to $10 or above would be ineffective in reducing poverty, it would hurt businesses and ultimately the minimum wage workers through unemployment.

            "premise": "According to Heather Boushey, Executive Director and Chief Economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, raising the minimum wage is an important anti-poverty measure. A person earning the current minimum wage and working a 40-hour week makes $15,080 per year, which is barely above the poverty line for a single adult and is well below it for someone supporting children. The most recent proposal to increase the federal minimum wage would have raised it to $10.10 per hour, though it didn\"t pass. More than half of the states (including the District of Columbia) already have higher minimum wages than the federal minimum wage. The District of Columbia is currently the highest at $10.50/hour. There has been discussion lately about increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, which would bring a family relying on a single wage-earner above the poverty line. Minimum wage laws in the states as of January 1, 2016 so therefore, it should not be increased",

And the supreme court was never given the power to amend the constitution, and even if it was, they never even ruled that this was constitutional, thus the Federal Government does not have the power to establish a minimum wage. Secondly, I do believe I proved that Switzerland, as a result of not having any minimum wage, has increased the average wages of its workers through competition. This actually happened in the US during WW2, the reason is that there were more jobs than employees, thus employers competed over employees by offering benefits, higher wages, safer conditions etc. Furthermore, labor unions during the progressive movement were able to get better wages as of the 1890's, the Federal Government couldn't increase wages until 1941. This means that labor unions are much better at achieving a better wage than the federal government. Thirdly, I never said there are benefits to a 7.25$ a hour minimum wage, only that it isn't necessary because states have proven to be much better at increasing their minimum wage than the federal government. And the same is true about labor unions, thus, the federal government increasing the minimum wage wouldn't do much because it would be incapable of consistently updating it with inflation, which is severely miscalculated.",

            "premise": "Summary from Round 2Pro - 1. Economists are not agreed on the of the effects of a minimum wage.2. The literature is split. We need more data by way of a large scale experiment.3. Too small a change to the minimum wage is unlikely to give use clear data. The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 /hour.Con - Oops - no arguments Regarding CON\u2019s arguments in Round 3The cost of living There are 2 problems with Con\u2019s arguments about the cost of living.1. CON argues there should be no FEDERAL minimum wage, which is outside the scope of this debate. He also does not suggest a different value.2. Con says that a $15 minimum wage will hurt employers or overpay workers. Both these statements have no data to back them up. It seems that Con is suggesting that the FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE should be decided by each state or be different in each state. This is not the definition of a FEDERAL minimum wage. The idea of a FEDERAL MINIMUM is that it is decided nationally, and states can choose to have local or state legislation that mandates an increase above this. In CON\u2019s example the state of New York could mandate a $20 minimum if they thought the cost of living merited an increase to improve the lot of people in their state. CON recognizes that states can have higher minimums than the federal minimum. CON does not seem to recognize that setting a federal minimum wage is designed to get people at a better standard of living in all states. CON seems to be arguing that there should be NO federal minimum wage. This is outside the realm of this debate. Note that CON says \u201cSomething such as minimum wage is best left to the local counties or municipalities\u201d, which implies that the Federal Government should not set any minimum wage. Some who argue against paying workers a living wage say that the cost of living would go way up for all of us if we raised the federal minimum wage to $15. I am glad that Con did not try this argument as it is directly refuted by the evidence.Will lead to job lossCon makes up a fictional scenario with fictional numbers. Any employer with numbers like those given by con would already be out of business. Please give us real numbers for a real business in a real state in a real world.CON gave a completely fictional \u201cexample\u201d to try to sway the reader about an important question. \u201cWill an increased minimum wage lead to any significant job loss?\u201dOne source referenced by CON is \u201cDo Economists Agree on Anything? Yes!\u201d which concludes that \u201cThe efficacy of the minimum wage continues to divide economists.\u201d [1]The data presented say that 48.1% of economists want to decrease or eliminate the minimum wage, while 52.0% are in favour of it. (Note this does not specify local or federal minimum wage). Not only were 52% in favour of a minimum wage, but 37.7% of economists were in favour of a substantial increase. NOTE This is from Table 3 in first source that CON presented.The US Department of labor refutes CON\u2019s claim. Here is what they say \u201cIn a letter to President Obama and congressional leaders urging a minimum wage increase, more than 600 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners wrote, \"In recent years there have been important developments in the academic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and providing some help on the jobs front.\u201d [2]In the special case of tipped workers who get both the minimum wage plus tips (so they receive even more than the minimum) the department of labor states: \u201cAs of May 2015, employers in San Francisco must pay tipped workers the full minimum wage of $12.25 per hour \u2014 before tips. Yet, the San Francisco leisure and hospitality industry, which includes full-service restaurants, has experienced positive job growth this year, including following the most recent minimum wage increase.\u201d [2]There are many more studies that come to the same conclusion: There is no evidence that increasing the federal minimum wage will cause job loss or hurt job growth. The NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, which produces policy papers for government and industry, has an important 2008 paper on optimizing the value of the minimum wage.[3]It talks about supply, demand, competitive equilibrium and tax policy, and it takes the complexity of the issues seriously. Looking at all these factors we need a federal minimum wage of $15 so we can learn how to adjust taxes and welfare to give the most good to the most people.Does very little to help the poorCON seems to say that because the minimum wage does not fix every problem for the poor, we should abandon it as a tool for helping low wage earners. That is like saying that because everybody dies we should stop spending money on hospitals and doctors.CON suggest a low minimum wage BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. This is a fallacy. In response to CON and people with similar logic we need to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 (and indexed for cost of living)CON says that 60% of those in poverty are not in the workforce. This is true, many are the children and non working spouses of the working poor. Raising the wealth of poor communities will help many who are not employed.EITC CON says there should be a tax credit for those earning so little that a minimum wage increase would affect them. I agree that a comprehensive strategy to help the poor needs to include MORE than the minimum wage. Our debate, however, is about the fact that the federal minimum should be increased to $15.CON\u2019s (false) conclusions Con points to his false understanding about the cost of living and minimum wage. Con wrongly claims that a minimum wage increases unemployment Con rightly claims that a minimum wage increase is not the ONLY way to help the poor. Con suggests tax breaks (which are outside the scope of this debate). The facts prove CON wrong. The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hourRegarding CON\u2019s \u201crebuttals\u201d - The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hourDavid Card\u2019s study - CON says the study didn\u2019t show any proof that the minimum wage increase was a good thing. I\u2019m sure that those receiving the increase were happy to receive it. Con makes a nonsense comment that it compared 2 cities with similar cost of living. This is the way science works, you try to minimize changes in every variable but the one you are studying. I\u2019m glad CON pointed out that this is good science. His comment is a pont in favour of my understanding of the subject, not his.Con says that Alan Kruger was against raising the minimum wage to $15. Since he gives no reference, I\u2019ll assume he is referring to the 1992 study in my references. I agree that $15 / hour would be excessive in 1992 when the study was between $4.25 and $5.05 per hour.Price Increases If the minimum wage were increased to $15 an hour, prices at fast food restaurants would rise by an estimated 4.3 percent.[5] That would mean a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac, which currently goes for $3.99, would cost about 17 cents more, or $4.16. This is a trivial amount. If I buy a Big Mack meal every day of the week my total cost increase is $1.19 per week. The price increases would be trivial.CON states \u201cI'll admit I'm a bit confused now.\u201dCON seems to have missed my main premise that : The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour.This is because we need better information about the cause and effect relationship between minimum wage and other economic indicators. A federal minimum wage increase to this level would give good data for policy makers and a better understanding for economists. Most of CON\u2019s arguments prove my point that we need good data that we can only get from a large increase in the federal minimum wage. For example, one main source for CON is a blog page from a software developer and CEO of a software company.[6] He is possibly a great guy, but not an authority on government policy and economics.CON basically ignores the position of the US Dept. Of Labor.Please read here to see them refute his fallacies one by one.http://www.dol.gov...Vote PRO The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour.[1] http://ew-econ.typepad.fr...[2] http://www.dol.gov...[3] http://journalistsresource.org...[4] http://davidcard.berkeley.edu...[5] www.thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/08/03/3687171/15-minimum-wage-big-mac/[6] http://wheniwork.com...",

            "premise": "My task, as the CON position, is to show that raising the minimum wage can have a net positive effect on the economy. I will begin by addressing my opponent\u2019s arguments and follow by offering my own arguments. <<< REBUTTAL AGAINST PRO >>> 1. Rebuttal to :: Raising the Minimum Wage Will Increase Unemployment My opponent\u2019s primary argument is that raising the minimum wage is harmful to the economy because it will increase unemployment. In support of this argument, he states that increases to the minimum wage during 2007 and 2008 were followed by an increase in unemployment for teenage workers in subsequent years. My opponent, however, fails to demonstrate why this increase in unemployment should be attributable to the increase in minimum wage, particularly when the economic collapse occurred at the exact same time. In addition to the economic collapse, several other factors are known to have increased the unemployment of teenagers during this time \u2013 including competition with older men and women who have increased their attachment to the labor market, single mothers, and young adults unable to find employment.[1] Moreover, numerous economic studies over the last two decades have found that raising minimum wages does not result in job loss.[2][3][4][5][6] While simplistic models of supply and demand could lead one to predict that an increased minimum wage would lead to job loss, the empirical data from these studies demonstrates that moderate increases to the minimum wage do not result in increased unemployment. The reasons for why increased wages do not lead to increased unemployment may be attributable to the reduced expenses of the employer. When the wage is increased, employees are less likely to leave their employer, thus leading to reduced costs associated with recruitment, re-training, and re-staffing. [See study in CON ARGUMENT below] Additionally, employees that remain with their employer longer are likely to be more productive due to their greater experience. <<< CON ARGUMENT >>> I present the following arguments in support of my position that increasing the minimum wage can have a net benefit to the economy. 1. Raising the Minimum Wage Acts as an Economic Stimulus and Creates Job Growth Increasing the minimum wage provides a direct economic stimulus by placing money into the hands of low-wage workers \u2013 the class of people who are most likely to immediately spend that money in their communities. Increased spending power for low-wage workers will result in increased demand and stimulate economic growth. One dollar in increased minimum wage results in $2,800 in new consumer spending per person over the year, and would inject as much at $60 billion into the economy.[7][8] Studies demonstrate that an increased minimum wage will stimulate the economy. The decade following the federal minimum wage increase in 1996-1997 experienced one of the largest periods of job growths, and individual states that raised their minimum wages above the level of the federal minimum wage experienced job growth that was larger than those states that kept theirs at the lower federal level. [9] These beneficial economic effects hold true even during periods of high unemployment and recession. [10] 2. Raising the Minimum Wage Increases Productivity and Reduces Costly Employee Turnover Economic researchers have found that wage increases result in decreased employee turnover and increased productivity. Reduced employee turnover leads to savings by the employer because it spends less on recruitment, re-training, and re-staffing.[11] As a result of lower turnover, these employees will be more experienced, and consequently more productive. Improved worker wages, stability, and productivity, as well as decreased employer expenses all provide a benefit to the economy as a whole \u2013 and, to workers, employers, and consumers individually. 3. Conclusion Raising the minimum wage does not result in job loss, as shown by numerous studies. Instead, empirical evidence supports that raising the minimum wage will actually result in stimulation to the economy, job growth, increased worker productivity, and decreased employer expenses.

            "premise": "C1: Will raise teenage unemployment source: http://www.house.gov...I would like to note the lower minimum wage actually brought unemployment down, and the raise rose unemployment. \"Two years ago Mr. Neumark and William Wascher, a Federal Reserve economist, reviewed more than 100 academic studies on the impact of the minimum wage. They found \"overwhelming\" evidence that the least skilled and the young suffer a loss of employment when the minimum wage is increased.\" [2] And guess what? the least skilled are teenagers. The study shows 1 70 cent increase --------> 300,000 jobs lost. C2: Raises Overall unemployment\"Economists have studied the job-destroying features of a higher minimum wage. Estimates of the job losses of raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 have ranged from 625,000 to 1,000,000 lost jobs. It is important to recognize that the jobs lost are mainly entry-level jobs. By destroying entry-level jobs, a higher minimum wage harms the lifetime earnings prospects of low-skilled workers. \" [1] Out of the many studies proving the minimum wage raise hurts the economy, only 1 said it was good, another study tried to duplucate the results with no conclusion near the same. The study was debunked. [3] \"With all of this recessions significant labor market problems, and the expensive federal efforts to offset them, its too bad that the minimum-wage law added so many people to the list of those who today cannot find jobs.\" [4] This makes logical sense, let me prove this:Let's say pe hour I am worth about 7$. If you rose the minimum wage to 7.25 or 9$ then I am out of a job. Hiring me would be charity. Most employers are not able to afford this, so basically it disqualifies me from a job. C3: Mininium wages increase teenage dropoutsA raise in the minimum wage not only raises unemployment, but forces highschoolropouts. [5] This study actually proves any increasein the minimum wage increases highschool dropouts. [6] Now what is the reason? Money. The igher wages influence them to drop out of school, the their eyes have $ signs in them. Now, this doesn't gerentee they find jobs. Actually, most of them never find minimum wage jobs when they drop out. [1, 6] This means we have less education, and well frankly a worse country. C4: The minimum wage will raise prices\"The federal increase from $4.25 to $5.15 costs California families an average of $133 more per year for the goods they normally purchase. Since higher-income families spend more, they would pay more in absolute terms than lower-income families: up to $234 per year compared to $84 per year.\" [7] This makes sense. If you raise the cost of labor it costs more to actually make the product, the the employer must actually charge more to make the same profit. As the minimum wage increases, not only do companies fire employees, they also raise prices to help the budget. And in the end, this will make it harderfor people, especially poor people, to buynecessary things. That in turn reduces GDP growth because there is less buying, and know, this will plungeus into another recession. [8]Oh btw the reason I did not quote the last part of the paragraoh from 8 is because he plagarised me first. SO thats my former words from an old debate, so as ts mine origionally I did not quote it. Conclusion:My opponent will falsely use the \"general welfare clause\" Its funny as unemployment =/= general welfare, a 5$ wage is better than no wage. My opponent really then is saying more dropouts, higher prices, and higher unemployment is general welfare, so if he uses this argument it is basically False. Minimum wage hikes lead to more unemployment and higher prices which is bad for the economy. Also as kids drop out we have a less edcated country.

            "discussionTitle": "The Minimum Wage",
            "conclusion": "The Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "1. Contrary to Pro\u2019s claims, I never said that there is a fixed, hard and fast marginal productivity for each worker, or that other factors, such as efficiency or cost of materials, do not affect the output of workers. I merely claim that the labor of workers produces some amount of value for their employers. It can vary from job to job, depending on type of job, capital (machines and such, not capital as in money), and many other factors. It doesn\u2019t matter whether a worker\u2019s marginal productivity varies, all that matters is that the worker\u2019s labor brings some value to the employer. In addition, Pro misrepresents his own source regarding wages and productivity. He claims that Locke\u2019s research showed that higher wages increased productivity. What his source actually says is that when offered financial incentives for higher productivity, workers worked harder and were more productive. [1] So higher wages followed productivity, not the other way around\u2014which helps prove my point. 2. Pro fails to refute my argument about the profitability of industries employing low-wage workers. I do not ignore factors such as technology and efficiency. If an industry is more efficient and advanced than others, and that makes its average profits higher, then investors will invest in that industry too. That doesn\u2019t refute my point that if unskilled workers were paid significantly below their marginal productivity, industries employing those workers would be very profitable, and they would therefore attract investors, increasing the demand for unskilled workers, raising wages, and thus decreasing the profitability of those industries to the common level among a country. If they aren\u2019t more profitable than other industries, then an artificial wage increase decreasing their profits would have the reverse affect, driving investors away from those industries, and reducing the demand for unskilled workers. Pro\u2019s example of workers being paid $2 an hour to make $800 shoes in no way disproves my claim that workers are paid close to their marginal productivity. $800 shoes do not cost that much because there\u2019s 40x more physical labor put into them than $20 shoes, they\u2019re more expensive because of superior materials and design. Because it is those things that make the shoes worth that much more, it is those things that have the high marginal productivity in that situation. 3. Again, Pro misunderstood his source from part 1, so this point fails. In addition, even if it were the other way around, and wage increases did lead to productivity increases, that wouldn\u2019t prove the minimum wage works, unless you first assume that the minimum wage increases wages, which is what Pro is trying to prove. 4. And I find the idea that a minimum wage won\u2019t be set above marginal productivity unrealistic, as there are so many different workers with so many different marginal productivities. It will surely be set below the marginal productivity of many, who thus won\u2019t be affected by it, but it is certainly set above the marginal productivity of many others. Pro then asserts that he thinks any well-run business should be able to get enough productivity from their workers to justify paying them at least minimum wage. As I don\u2019t see how Pro could possibly know this, and he provides no support for this opinion, this point should be disregarded. 5.While it may be true that businesses could fire supervisory and managerial staff, rather than low-wage workers, there\u2019s no reason to think they will. Even if it were the case that those people are greatly overpaid, business owners obviously believe that they\u2019re worth the money. Even if they aren\u2019t (which I think is probably not true\u2014a business owner is much more likely to understand his business and his employees than someone who doesn\u2019t know anything about the business, like my opponent), the fact that business owners think they are means that they won\u2019t fire them first. Just as Pro claims we aren\u2019t working within the framework of my perfectly free-market ideal, we also aren\u2019t working in Pro\u2019s socialist utopia either\u2014we\u2019re talking about the world as it currently is. 6. Contrary to Pro\u2019s claim, 6 does logically follow from the premises. If the premises are correct, then they show that a minimum wage set below marginal productivity does nothing, and one set above it unemploys the workers it affects\u2014thus, the only affect a minimum wage can have is to cause unemployment. Empirical Evidence: Pro seems to misunderstand the state-by-state minimum wage map. While it is true that there is no state minimum wage law in the states he mentioned, they still have to obey the federal minimum wage law\u2014a proper comparison would be green states from the map (higher than the federal minimum wage) to all of the blue, red, and yellow states (because states with no minimum wage, one lower than the federal one, or one equal to the federal one will all have the same minimum wage law\u2014the federal one). If you compare the average from the states (plus DC) with a minimum wage higher than the federal one to those who only obey the federal one, you get an average unemployment rate of 9.34% for the 1st group and an average of 7.88% for the 2nd group (according to Pro\u2019s sources). [2] [3] Pro then cites the famous Card and Krueger study, which has been widely discredited by serious economists for its lack of statistical rigor. They used telephone surveys to measure unemployment, rather than actual payroll data\u2014and when others looked at the same data set, but with all of the data, rather than just telephone surveys, they found that Card and Krueger\u2019s findings were wrong, and the minimum wage increase did increase unemployment in the area they studied. [4] [5] There is a mountain of empirical evidence showing that the minimum wage increases unemployment [6] [7] [8], particularly among teenagers [9] [10] [11]. Pro has also failed to provide any actual evidence that a minimum wage increases wages. [1] http://www.nbrii.com... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org... [3] http://en.wikipedia.org...

            "premise": "Sorry about the delay in posting, the site went down for maintenance or something this morning. So here we go now. Whenever a minimum wage is set, it imposes no cost to the rest of us, the taxpayers. It is the businesses that absorb it, who will oppose it in the beginning, but then see that sales have gone up tremendously. That is because giving money to our people will in turn create a stronger economy. Americans will spend their increased income on housing, food, electricity etc., and companies of all kind will experience a surge in business. Of the 28 million Americans who would benefit from a federal wage raise, a portion of the group would include adults who are either married or with kids. Here is a run-through of the proportions: \"3.4 million under 18, 4.6 million married with kids, 2.8 million married with kids, 4.9 married without kids, 12.4 adults not married without kids.\" The value of the minimum wage is also greatly decreasing, another reason of why we should propose a raise. Not only has it dropped by a third since 1968, but we observe great increases in everything else. College fees have shot up, basic necessities for survival are being overpriced, and our landlords haven't decreased our rent or anything. Basically, it is physically impossible to survive on the minimum wage, and our growing prices haven't aided in the welfare of our Americans. Speaking of welfare, when working multiple minimum waged jobs becomes extremely persistent and agitating, many citizens might turn to government assistance programs, like food stamps, medicaid etc. As of now, 52% of fast-food workers have to rely on food stamps, therefore costing our government the taxpayer's money. If we simply increased the wage a tad bit, than these welfare receivers will stop riding of the system. And plus, the amount of money in food stamps going to fast-food workers tallies to $1.04 billion dollars. That money could've been spent on schools, community buildings, or just back to the people. The argument as to as if whether the federal wage increase will harm the job openings in America is a myth. These companies need their workers to service customers. And if customers on average spends $2,800 extra for every dollar of wage increase, those companies would receive more purchases. As I've said before, this increases will create money cycle, thus improving our economy. Minimum wage was not created for teenagers and college students, it was for everyone who happens to not be able to find a higher job position. Not everyone has the luxury of going to college, and even some who do complete college will find themselves at a restaurant working for minimum wage. There is something called being laid off, and when that happens to someone, they will take up a job at a local store for minimum wage just to support their family. When someone starts at minimum wages, they typically do not get raises at large corporations such as McDonalds. The Fair Labor Standards Act claims that the people working for minimum wage are not entitled to vacation, rest periods, premium pay for holiday work, pay raises, or a reason to terminate employees. The laws around the minimum wage are not beneficial to the employee after all, due to the fact that they have no lobbyists and negotiators. Another example of why the federal wage is not mainly for teenagers and college students is this rule in the FLSA; the youth minimum wage for anyone under 20 is $4.25 for the first 90 days. This allows the companies the opportunity to cut pay (a.k.a cheat) a youth literally out of three months of pay. Even fast-food managers are only paid slightly higher than their employees. A federal wage raise to $10.10 would even benefit them also, since their wage's would be raised to the federal minimum wage, plus higher to account for the slight increase between workers and managers. In short, everyone would receive a raise in some way. When workers struggle to make ends meet, productivity sags, absenteeism increases, morale suffers and turnover rises because workers are constantly hunting for better opportunities. When workers have less money to spend in the markets, companies also suffer because no one is buying their products. During the last 45 years, many middle class and lower class citizens are not as entitled because their wages have been lobbied away by the big companies who want profits to themselves. If we as a country raised our minimum wages to $10.10, we would witness significant growths at all fronts. From the lives of the workers themselves, to the increase in business for companies, it makes considerable sense we go for a federal minimum wage raise. It assists all people of this country. Whenever the minimum wage is raised, virtually all jobs will see an escalation in pay. When jobs that do not require collegiate education receive a raise, those that do also will witness the same increase. That undermines your argument of how Americans wouldn't be as motivated to attend university. Thank you for this debate, and this opportunity to express my views on the raising the federal minimum wage. Sources: https://www.whitehouse.gov... http://ourfuture.org... http://www.dol.gov...",

            "premise": "To clarify I will be making an argument that the minimum wage is racist I'm not forcing it's assumption - CON is very welcome to challenge my argument there. The minimum wage, like any price floor, leads to a surplus. A surplus in the form of labour means unemployment. This phenomenon is most obviously observed by studying teenage unemployment following the introduction of the minimum wage. Teenagers are an excellent surrogate for low skilled workers in general, since teenagers have minimal marketable skills (little job experience, no college education, poor work ethic etc.) Here is a study which examines the impact of a 43% increase in the federal minimum wage in Lousiana (this state has no state minimum wage law). Unemployment among Louisiana teenagers skyrocketed during this time period from 13.6% in 2006 to 34.4% in 2011. http://www.thepelicanpost.org... The minimum wage has no power to raise wage rates. All it can do is prohibit employment of individuals with a skill set which demands they be paid a wage lower than the minimum wage. In general these people tend to be the most destitute, the most in need of employment. This is a vicious predatory law which greatly harms those who are most desperately in need of help. Why then would anyone possibly support a minimum wage? There are do-gooders on one hand, who erroneously believe that this law helps the poor. Then there are the people who benefit from the minimum wage - namely skilled labourers. Let us assume you have a widget factory, and a skilled widget maker can make 15 widgets an hour and commands a wage of $20 / hr. An unskilled widget maker can make 5 widgets an hour, and commands a wage of $6.66 an hour. To the employer it really doesn't matter if he hires one skilled widget maker, or 3 unskiled widget makers. But what if there was a minimum wage of $10 an hour? Then the employer could not hire the unskilled widget makers, and the demand for the skilled worker would go up since the competition from the unskilled widget makers would be no longer present. And this is EXACTLY who advocates for minimum wage increases - unions representing skilled workers who make much more than the minimum wage. What's more advocates of the minimum wage implicitly acknowledge it's weakness. Why are there student minimum wages and minimum wages for waitresses which are lower than the general minimum wage? It is precisely because these groups are generally low skilled - a lower minimum wage for them lowers unemployment in those groups, just as a lower minimum wage for everyone would lower unemployment for everyone. Milton Friedman has referred to the minimum wage as one of the most racist laws on the books. Before the minimum wage was introduced, unemployment among blacks was roughly equal to unemployment among whites. Today unemployment for black teenagers stands at a staggering 30%! This law unfairly targets minorities. It kills their ability to get a job, to learn more marketable skills, to stay out of trouble and to gain capital. Here's another case study : http://idahofreedom.net... Between 2003 and 2011 teen unemployment in Idaho increased from 10.6% to 30.9%. Between 2007 and 2009 the federal minimum wage increased from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour. This policy is especially aggravating since it occurred during a recession, a time in which prices, including the price of labour, must fall. This is in contrast with Idaho's over all uneployment which stands at 7.8% as of May 11th 2012.",

            "premise": "Thanks to Romanii for accepting this debate.P1: Corporate Income v Employer's IncomeA) Large Corporations.A common misconception regarding the costs of Minimum Wage is that it's paid for by the corporations. McDonald's earns around $28 bn a year [1]. However, only $5.8 bn of this is profit. A lot at first, but McDonald's has 440,000 employees earning $9 an hour, a national average of 1,789 hours a year [2]. This would cost McDonald's upwards of $4.72 bn a year. Costing McDonald's over 80% of their profits.The problem starts with the employer. The Employer is not the McDonald's company, but instead the franchise owner. Over 80% of their restaurants of privately owned franchises [3]. Whereas the Company earns high profit margins, independent restaurants average 2.4% [4]. A local McDonald's averages $800,000 (based on total revenue / outlets) and an average profit of $20,000 a year. The remaining profit is strictly corporate side. Based on this, and assuming the outlet has 15 workers [5](my place of work in a rural location consists of 27,) it would cost the outlet over $150,000.This becomes a large issue. Independent franchises can not afford to pay doubled wages. and corporate can not afford to make up the difference for their franchises. This leads into P3: Stock Value.B) Small businesses.The next issue would be the cost to local businesses that run separate of a franchise. Profit Margins aren't much higher. The highest profit margins were for Limited Service establishments, at 6% [6]. To reuse the McDonald's estimate, $48,000. Still well under the $150,000 cost for just 15 employees [7]. Most establishments can not afford the increase in cost, and will surely go under, hire employees, or raise costs (leading to going under). New establishments have a 60% chance of going under in the first three years [8]. This number would skyrocket under increased costs and prices.This leads into a major issue. Ripple effect. While small increases may have small ripples that heal over time (regardless of if it leaves an economic scar), a sudden increase to $15 an hour, even over five years, an increase 15x larger than most any other increase prior, will leave a massive ripple that may not heal. A massive increase in failure rates in new restaurants would eliminate industry growth, and the elimination of rural and independent restaurants that can't afford to raise prices 35% to make up the cost while maintaining the same profit margins. For Franchises, with a profit margin 1/3rd of that, they would have to raise prices by 71%. The Dollar Menu would have to be removed to keep business alive. This is based on wages taking up 35% of restaurant costs [9].Restaurants make up 18% of all Minimum Wage workers, around 3,750,000 workers [10]. The industry as a whole employs 10% of the total US Workforce, and is set to create over 1.4 million new jobs within a decade [11]. Risking this industry would damage 14+ million jobs and wreck the Minimum Wage demographic. The industry makes up over 4% of the US GDP. This is just one of the many Minimum Wage industries that would get crippled. Supermarkets, like Walmart and K-Mart, manage profit margins between 1 - 2% [12]. They would have to raise prices incredible sums to keep afloat. Most in rural regions would go under, as they don't have the customer base to risk.Another major industry at risk is the Gas Station industry. Gas Stations run on minimum wage, and they only earn pennies per dollar. $50 in gas can equal $1.20 in profit [13]. Most profit is from the actual store [14], where prices are already too high. Profit margins for gas stations are 1.7% [15]... Any Gas Station that's open 24 hours a day will suffer the worse. Midnight hours would become profitless. This is a dangerous industry to hit hard.More will be discussed in P3.P2: Average Annual Wages.Con must assume that increasing Minimum Wage reduces poverty and increases wages. If it does increase the wages of the entirety of Minimum Wage workers, we'd see a notable increase in annual wages. Instead we see the opposite. As Minimum Wage goes down (based on 2013 USD standard)[16], the average Income of the US goes up [17]. This may not imply lower minimum wages lead to higher incomes, but it does imply that increasing the Minimum Wage does nothing for increasing the annual wages. If higher Minimum Wages led to a positive ripple effect, we should see this... be it from raising the pay of everyone increasing, or the increase in the economy. Another look into the issue of correlation leads us to measuring the actual increases in the wage along side GDP growth [18]. For Con's case to stand, we MUST see a positive effect on GDP growth. In my chart, red lines show the moment of increase in the Minimum Wage. Of the nine increases, only two see an economic growth follow. The first was after WWII, when millions of high earning US Soldiers returned home. And the second, around 1978, saw rocky growth at best. Economic Growth has, otherwise, never followed an increase in Minimum Wage. For Con's case to be true, there must be a positive ripple effect. If anything, the GDP decreases after practically all Minimum Wage increases. Again, while not implying the Minimun Wage was to blame, it does defy the logic Con must establish.P3: Stock Values.Companies stock would become a huge issue if profits disappear, prices go up without potential new return, or investors get scared. If McDonald's suddenly had it's franchises paying out $4.8 bn more a year in wage, it would cripple their stock. While most companies stock can survive a $0.25 increase, a $7.50 increase is well beyond the safe mark.Walmart has a market cap of $205.5 bn [19]. Having to double the paychecks of each of their employees would cost upwards of $15 bn. This would eliminate all of Walmart's profits. Since we know the individual profit margins of the individual shops are lower than the overall corporate profit margins, most Walmart shops would have plummeting profit margins, and the stock of the overall company would drop entirely. Bad, especially since their stock has dropped over 30% in the last year, and most companies are struggling to readjust in a post-recession era. But this isn't a Walmart issue...McDonald's has seen incredibly large sales declines in the past few years. In fact, McDonald's saw larger declines than they expected [20]. This, despite all the efforts put into promoting the franchise recently. This issue is hitting much of the Fast Food industry. Subway is seeing the largest decline [21]. Sales for the industry has dropped due to public awareness, but mostly the efficiency of better quality preserved foods that can be prepared in minutes without driving [22, 23].All this taken into account, the stocks of minimum wage employers is destined only to fail, along with the companies themselves.P4: Effect on Employees.Most Economists have a fairly good idea that increasing the Minimum Wage would lead to a reduction in employment, or at least lead to a slowdown in future employment. One popular study done by the NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH claimed that every 1 percent increase in average wages is associated with a 0.12% reduction in employment [24]. The increase is associated with as much as a 0.92% decrease in counties with lower average wages. By such measurements, a 100% increase in minimum wage would lead to a 12% reduction in employment. While obviously an extreme, even a 6% reduction would be crippling to the US economy. Counties facing lower average wages would face major recessions (as the highest possible reduction in employment is 92%. Obviously an extreme, but again, even a fourth the amount would be significant.)The increase in wages, if not outweighed by a reduction in hours, would be outweighed by unemployment and an economic downturn. Another study by David Neumark found that minimum wages correlated (with controls in place to remove outside variables) with teenage job elasticity of -0.3 [25]. Meaning the demand of teenagers in the job market was reduced as prices increased. In basic terms, demand went down as prices went up. It's a basic principle in economics that when you need less people to buy a product, you raise the prices. Everything is a product. This is why when applying for a job, even at an establishment like McDonald's (where pay starts around $9 an hour), you write down Minimum Wage for the desired wage.Conclusion:Most fast food companies are not in a position to pay doubled wages. They especially can't afford it when we take into account who is paying. Minimum Wage does not correlate with higher GDP growth or higher paychecks. Minimum Wage does, however, lead to higher amounts of job reduction and would cripple the stock values of major employers who are facing slowing business.Minimum Wage should not be doubled.Sources: http://pasted.co...",

That includes people in poverty who DO work, for minimum wage. \"More working-age adults picked up low-wage jobs in the slowly improving economy but still struggled to pay living expenses. \" (http://www.nydailynews.com... ) According to the cost of living calculator provided by the Economic Progress institute, a single person with no children would have to make $11.93 to cover the cost of living. Monthly costs including housing, food, transportation, medical, etc. total $1,662.00 ( http://www.economicprogressri.org...) and that's in states in the U.S. where the cost of living isn't as high as someplace like New York City. If you have a child, then you have to throw in child care expenses, you have to raise the amount you would spend on food and medical. In NYC minimum wage ranges from $7.25 (federal) and $8.00 (state). That's roughly $4 lower than the amount needed for a single person with no children. P2: Consumer spending makes up 70% of the economy. By increasing the minimum wage, you would have more workers making more money. The more money a person makes, the more they have to spend. If they have extra money to spend, more money gets pumped back into the economy. (http://www.cnn.com...) C: The government should increase the minimum wage.",

In the state I reside in the minimum wage is raising from $8.00 to $8.75 in only one year. Look at what Obama wants to do. http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com... \"Obama highlighted his own executive order, requiring federal contractors to pay employees at least $10.10 an hour.\" Is that a slow increment? Is raising it to over 10 dollars small?Also what you stated is obvious. We must raise the minimum wage to keep up with inflation. The truth is that this is not what the United States is doing.Why not raise the minimum wage? Simple. Destruction. We have to compete with nations like China. http://www.cbsnews.com... This source states that \"Shanghai will rise to $293 per month.\" Look at this wiki page. http://en.wikipedia.org.... China has $2.02 minimum wage. If we raise the minimum wage, we simply cannot maintain and continue to compete with foreign nations. I am not insisting on decreasing the minimum wage whatsoever. The simple truth is that the faster you raise the minimum wage, the easier it is for business owners to decide they do not want to manufacture in America.Imagine this. A garbage truck driver versus a garbage truck company manager. Almost everyone can drive, it is a skill not requiring much effort or training. That garbage truck driver makes $7.25 (minimum wage). Let's say that the manager makes $10.00 because he went to school, trained, and it is a job that requires experience. If the minimum wage increases to $10.10 like it is being proposed what will be the result? That garbage truck driver bumps up to $10.10 and the manager will have to bump up to around $15.00. Imagine this cycle going on with every single company there is. Since it costs more to pay the workers the expenses will rise. Let's say McDonalds has to raise their MIILLIONS of employees paychecks by the HOUR. That McDouble or Quarter Pounder meal is going to undeniably go up. The cycle will go on and on and on. The American dollar worth will plummet.Not only would the stores and other companies need to increase their products to a higher rate, but unemployment would be at a huge gain. http://dailycaller.com.... This proves that raising the minumum wage does just that. Raising it just $1 increases unemployment by 1.48 percent and 747,700 become unemployed and 83,300 jobs lost.Here is a chart from http://americanactionforum.org... shows that states with the minimum wage at $7.25 have a 6.4% average unemployment rate while states with the minimum wage above $7.25 have a 7.4% average unemployment rate. That is a 1% difference. In your following argument I would like you to state some facts on how the minimum wage increase actually produces jobs and growth. Of course it increases the average income, but inflation of product prices will make it completely useless.",

            "premise": "I know some people are forced to work minimum wage, but many dropouts have the opportunity to keep going in their education and chose not to because of the enticing pay and easier work. You mention people would be paid more, but you either get paid more or get paid nothing since many people end up getting laid off. I think it would be better if more people had jobs, but the jobs paid less then less people getting work but those who do get paid more. You mention we would get 9.5 billion dollars into the economy, but the quality of the economy itself would decrease, considering there would be less jobs and the jobs lack the quality they used to. This would make it harder for anyone to find jobs in the first place, hurting the economy further. It would be like pumping money into the economy, but getting nothing back in return. You seem to be focusing on just the benefits to the poor, while in doing so you are hurting everyone else. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only about 5% of US hourly paid workers for for or below the federal minimum wage. Out of these, most are young, unskilled, high school dropouts. Consider this situation- the wage increases, and since they have to pay more the corporation has to fire some employees. Who are they going to fire; unskilled, younger people with a lower education, or educated people with more experience and skills? The choice is obvious! This would hurt the poor more than help them, because instead of a lower paying jobs they would end up with nothing. I get they can't get out of the poor cycle and some are unable to attain good education, but now they are completely unable to obtain a job rather than get one, albeit with low pay. But some money is better than none. So, we've established that minimum wage jobs are usually taken by unskilled and generally uneducated people who are poor. Since they are poor, they can't get a good education, so basically they are forced into a lower paying job. But why should they get paid more? Sadly, they are unskilled so they should do a basic job. Is there a reason to give these people more money for bagging groceries and flipping burgers? What i'm trying to say is the amount of money they get is proportional to the amount of work they do and how hard the job is. We'd be giving them more money for doing a basic job that doesn't take much intelligence to complete. Once again, this higher wage would hurt small businesses more than help them. Since they aren't a large corporation, they aren't as affluent and usually have lower pay for workers. Now, they have to pay their workers more. This would make it a lot easier for small businesses to go bankrupt, and they wouldn't be able to give their workers usual job benefits. Again, the quantity and quality of jobs would go down. Your main point is that a higher minimum wage would help people get out of a low income cycle, when it would do just the opposite. Many people who made low income would end up with no income since they had to get laid off, and small business owners who make less as it is would struggle to get by. Smaller/family businesses would definitely suffer. Sources- fff.org, Huffington Post News website",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I will be arguing that the US Federal Government should raise the minimum wage. I would like more my opponent to note that I agree that the US Federal government should raise the minimum wage one dollar every year until we get to 10 dollars in order to make small businesses adjust to the wages. Now, I will begin my case. -------------------------------------- Democracy Advantage: Before, I begin to state the statistics on how many people in America support an increase in the minimum wage; I want to stress the importance of this argument. The Founding Fathers intended for our representatives to listen to what the American people want. These are one of the fundamental principles of America, and what defined our country in the 1700s as a democratic nation. My opponent is libertarian. If there is anything libertarians, liberals, and conservatives can agree with; it is that we should all be able to agree that when 76% of Americans agree on simple legislation that should be passed, than the government is obligated to listen and pass the legislation a majority of Americans want to be passed. If the government does not listen to the pleas of the American people, than our democracy is not functioning properly. 76% of Americans support raising the minimum wage. A great majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 dollars an hour. I offer this question to my opponent. I believe that if the government continues to deny the pleas to raise the minimum wage, than how can we still call ourselves a functional democracy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Benefits: My opponent is of the few in America that claim that raising the minimum wage will hurt jobs. I will debunk this popular myth in this contention. Note that 73 million people are paid hourly wages. 1. Improved living standards: The first benefit is that millions of Americans would see a pay raise that could go toward meeting their basic needs and living expenses. A 2013 report from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 16.5 million low-wage workers would benefit from a $10.10-per-hour wage, including 900,000 workers who would climb above the poverty threshold. A more recent analysis by CNN was even more aggressive, implying that 5 million Americans would be lifted out of poverty at $10.10 per hour. More workers being able to pay for their basic expenses is a good thing, as it may lead to less reliance on government- and state-sponsored financial-aid programs --------------------------------- 2. Increasing the federal minimum wage to $9.80 by July 1, 2014, would raise the wages of about 28 million workers who would receive nearly 40 billion dollars in additional wages over the phase in period. ------------------------------------ 3. GDP has been proven to increase roughly by 25 billion dollar resulting in the creation of approximately 100,000 net jobs. -------------------------------------- 4. Around 54% of affected worker work full time, over 70% are in families with incomes of less than 60,000 dollars, more than a quarter are parents, and over a third are married. ------------------------------------------------ 5. The average affected worker earns about half of his or her family's total income. ----------------------------------------------------------- 6. The immediate benefits of a minimum-wage increase are in the boosted earnings of the lowest-paid workers, but its positive effects would far exceed this extra income. Recent research reveals that, despite skeptics\" claims, raising the minimum wage does not cause job loss. In fact, throughout the nation, minimum-wage increases would create jobs. Like unemployment insurance benefits or tax breaks for low- and middle-income workers, raising the minimum wage puts more money in the pockets of working families when they need it most, thereby augmenting their spending power. Economists generally recognize that low-wage workers are more likely than any other income group to spend any extra earnings immediately on previously unaffordable basic needs or services: --------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe: Europe is also a good example of how the minimum wage actually benefits workers more than it harms workers. -Great Britain's minimum wage is $10.31 an hour. There GDP is 2.8 trillion dollars. There are 4.9 million small businesses that are fully capable of managing this wage without loosing jobs. -Germany's minimum wage is $11.50 an hour. Germany's GDP is 3.85 trillion dollars. -France's minimum wage is $10.70 an hour. France's GDP is 2.83 trillion dollars. -Australia's minimum wage is $10.50 an hour. Australia's GDO is 1.45 trillion dollars. - America's minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. America's GDP is 17.48 trillion dollars. I offer my opponent these questions. -Why is it that America was the wealthiest country in that list, yet had the lowest federal minimum wage? -Why is America able to access an abundant amount of benefits from raising the minimum wage, and the government is still not pass it into law? -Why is it that that the US Federal Government will not raise the minimum wage when 76% of Americans believe that it is the right thing to do? I look forward to these answers. It is up to my opponent whether to address these questions in his case or rebuttal.

            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage Laws In The USA Should Be Abolished",
            "premise": "Thanks for accepting my debate, ChristianLCompton! You're right, I'll be arguing for the abolishment of both federal & state minimum wage laws. Here is a summary of my arguments: 1. A law should be abolished if it either fails to accomplish its primary objectives, or works against its primary objectives. 2. The primary objectives of Minimum Wage laws are to reduce net poverty and net unemployment. 3. At best, Minimum Wage laws have no net effect on poverty or unemployment. At worst, they cause a net increase in poverty and unemployment. 4. Therefore, Minimum Wage laws should be abolished. To clarify, I need only prove that Minimum Wage laws do not cause a net reduction in poverty and employment to win. Let's begin! Minimum Wage Laws Don't Reduce Unemployment 10% raises in the Federal Minimum Wage generally correspond to a 4.5% increase in unemployment rates.3 The Congressional Joint Economic Committee published a paper based on 50 years of research on the Federal Minimum Wage. They summarised it this way: \u201cThe minimum wage reduces employment.\u201d1 In states that have a minimum wage higher than the federal one, unemployment is 2% higher than in those states with a minimum wage equal to the Federal Minimum Wage.5 When employers are forced to pay wages higher than they can afford, they cut costs by laying off entry-level workers. Their positions are then either automated (replaced by machinery), or outsourced to a country without minimum wage laws. Minimum Wage Laws Don't Reduce Poverty The Employment Policies Insitute, a non-profit organization, also published a paper on this subject. After analyzing poverty rates and increases in state & federal minimum wage laws from 2003 to 2007, they determined that raises in the minimum wage requirement have no effect on poverty.4 Even when the analysis was repeated using a 50% broader definition of \u201cpoverty\u201d, the results were the same. An explanation for this is the lack of ability these laws have in reaching their target population. Minimum wage laws disproportionately effect those who are already well-off. Of those who benefited from the increases in the Federal Minimum Wage between 2007 and 2009, 90% weren't in poverty!2 Your turn, Con.

The debate question had its genesis in news articles from New York and elsewhere as a response to people protesting for an increase. Raising the wage now is the wrong response , to the wrong problem and at the wrong time. With the current level of unemployment, and those who are not in the labor market, the minimum should not be raised until those issues are resolved. To raise it NOW only compounds the overall problem with the economy. When the federal government begins to act responsibly, this issue could be revisited. California may be raising their in-state minimum to $10 per hour. Let's wait and see what their experience shows. In the meantime, I still stand that \"The Federal Minimum wage should NOT be raised at this time.\"",

            "discussionTitle": "Minimum Wage",
            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "In this debate, pro will be defending the abolition of the minimum wage, and attacking arguments in defense of the minimum wage. Pro will be explicating the advantages of abolishing the minimum wage, disadvantages of the minimum wage, and how the impact of a minimum wage should be deemed null. C1-Minimum Wage Impact: The impact of the minimum wage should be deemed insignificant. According to Heratage.org, 2.9% of our population makes minimum wage. This piece of evidence obfuscates the minimum wage thesis entirely. The population that is impacted by the minimum wage are young people. Here are the statistics: 79% of the population work part time jobs. 62% of the population are enrolled in school. 68% of the population possess family incomes above 150%. The impact of raising the minimum wage will benefit the adholescent. A population which a majority of them would be deemed well off. Raising the minimum wage would only benefit 2.9% of our population. C2-Young people:The minimum wage already should be rendered null in regards to the incomes of families, but there is also more to be discussed about the negative implications of the minimum wage's impact on young people. Wages are of paramount importance not only to the employee, but to the employer. An employer usually will make a risky investment in a worker with no prior skill set. The government would deem it only acceptable for that employer to employ a most likely young boy with no prior skil set with 7 dollars or more an hour. The minimum wage lowers the prospects of young peoples' capability to acquire a job. C3-Small Business Impact:The minimum wage also has a significant impact the efficiency of small businesses. I offer the following examples: \"I am here every day, from 6:30 in the morning to 9:00 at night. I probably average 100 hours a week here at the course,\u201d Martha said, noting that hiring more staff is a luxury her small seasonal profit margins haven\u2019t afforded her. Recently, Martha had to let her restaurant\u2019s dishwasher and table busser go \u2014 hats she now wears along with her other employees. If voters approve a hike in Nebraska\u2019s minimum wage floor to $9 an hour by 2016, Martha fears she will have to shoulder an even greater load just to keep her business running. The increased wage and tax costs of the hike would mean fewer hours to schedule for her employees, particularly in the course\u2019s golf shop. Pat Haines, also a survey respondent, is another entrepreneur who is worried about the proposed increase. Haines runs North Bowl, a bowling alley in North Omaha. Haines knows the business well, in part because he spent his childhood years playing there. He likes giving young people in North Omaha a chance at their first jobs by bringing them on for part-time work at the bowling alley. Haines worries that he will not be able to make as many investments in young people with limited skills and experience if the minimum wage is raised to $9 an hour. He also thinks that the increased labor costs will seriously impact his bottom line, forcing him to raise prices in a community that is sensitive to jumps in the cost of entertainment. \u201cThe money has to come from somewhere. Either I have to raise prices, or do more with fewer employees, or cut the work hours of the ones I already have. But any of those decisions just makes it harder to grow the business, give more people work, and keep our customers coming back so everyone can be paid,\u201d Martha said Gary Tharnish, the president of Burton & Tyrell\u2019s Flowers in Lincoln, expresses similar anxiety about the proposal to increase the minimum wage. Like Haines, Tharnish likes to hire young people seeking their first jobs and then train them to be productive workers. \u201cI hire teenagers and then teach them,\u201d Tharnish explains. \u201cHopefully, at the end of three months they have learned enough to work at the shop. If they work out, they get a raise.\u201d Tharnish says that opportunity might disappear if the minimum wage is ratcheted up to $9 an hour. If that happens, he will have to stop investing so much time on inexperienced young workers and hire older workers who need less supervision. \u201cIf the minimum wage is increased I am simply going to look for adults who just want to work a few hours per week and forget about hiring teenagers.\u201d C4: Abolishing the minimum wage: The current federal minimum wage's impact on our population is null. 2.9% of the individuals on the minimum wage are young people from financially stable families. The minimum wage is only capable of harming people when inceased. A significant portion of economists have claimed that an increase of the minimum wage by 2 dollars would lead to a prollific depletion of 500,000 jobs. Proponents of the minimum wage claim that the minimum wage ceases any attempt my businesses to manipulate employee wages to their own advantage. Those proponents should be informed that the businesses compete for money as much as they compete for employees. If a business purposfully decreases wages that would be percieved to be unfair by the employee, than the employee has every right to find work at another company which assures him financial security. I request that my adversary answer the following questions?What positive impact does the minimum wage have on our population?Do you concede to the fact that an increase of the minimum wage implements a strain on small businesses? Can you explain why the minimum wage should not deemed to be null? Works Cited: http://www.heritage.org... http://www.platteinstitute.org... http://www.newsmax.com...",

            "premise": "P1) About 60% of the officially poor don't work, so the only thing raising the minimum wage does for them is to make it harder for them to get a job if they ever decide they want one. Workers must bring at least as much value to the firm as they are paid or the firm will fail and all jobs will be lost. These days people who are making minimum wage clearly do not care to put their all into a job. They are lazy yet content with being lazy so they should not be permitted to make more money for sheer laziness. P2) It is estimated that less than 15% of the total increase in wages resulting from an increase in the minimum will go to people below the poverty line and less than a third of those receiving the minimum wage are families below the poverty line. Most minimum wage workers are from above median income families. So, most of the people benefiting from the minimum wage are not the intended targets of the \"anti-poverty\" aspect of raising the minimum wage. It's a lose lose situation.

            "conclusion": "The minimum mage should be abolished",
            "premise": "Round 2 Rebuttal Regarding the Consumption, the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis, and Income inequality sections, my opponent makes the case that increasing wages for low-wage earners and reducing inequality would be beneficial to society. I do not dispute this point and am not making the case that inequality and poor wages for low-wage earners are desirable. ResponsiblyIrresponsible does not explain why or how the implementation of a legally enforced minimum wage is necessary or the best option in increasing the wages of low-wage earners and reducing inequality, and he or she does not consider or address other non-governmental possible ways of achieving these goals such as collective bartering or unionizing. Again, I am not suggesting that increasing wages for low-wage earners and reducing inequality are not desirable. I am arguing that the minimum wage should be abolished and considering the fact that there are other non-governmental options which can work towards the same goals the minimum wage was designed to reach more effectively. Points regarding Minimum Wage:1. Job Losses: Ever since the implementation of the Minimum wage, evidence of job losses was observed. The first 25-cent minimum wage introduced in 1938 resulted in significant job losses. Minimum wage increases in American Samoa resulted into adverse and detrimental effects. A 2006 review of more than 100 minimum wage studies by David Neumark and William Wascher found that about two-thirds found negative employment effects. In 2010, Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser estimated: \u201cnearly 1.3 million jobs will be lost if the federal minimum wage is increased to $9.50 per hour.\u201d 2. Effects on low-skilled workers: Evidence shows minimum wage increases substantially hurts the very people they were designed to help. The 2006 Neumark and Wascher review found the literature \u201cas largely solidifying the conventional view that minimum wages reduce employment among low-skilled workers. A 2012 analysis of the New York State minimum wage increase from $5.15 to $6.75 per hour found a \u201c20.2 to 21.8 percent reduction in the employment of younger less-educated individuals. A 2010 analysis by Michael J. Hicks found: \u201cthe latest round of minimum wage increases\u201d account \u201cfor roughly 550,000 fewer part-time jobs,\u201d including \u201croughly 310,000 fewer teenagers working part-time.\u201d 3. Reducing Poverty: The minimum wage doesn't reduce poverty. In the previous federal minimum wage increase from $5.15 to $7.25, only 15 percent of the workers who were expected to gain from it lived in poor households, according to a 2012 Wilson review. If the minimum were today raised to $9.50, only 11 percent of workers who would gain live in poor households. The 2012 Wilson review noted: \u201cSince 1995, eight studies have examined the income and poverty effects of minimum wage increases, and all but one have found that past minimum wage hikes had no effect on poverty.\u201d The 2012 Wilson review noted: \u201cOne recent academic study found that both state and federal minimum wage increases between 2003 and 2007 had no effect on state poverty rates.\u201d 4. Who Pays? Someone has to pay for increases in the minimum wage. The 2012 Wilson review noted: A 2004 \u201creview of more than 20 minimum wage studies looking at price effects found that a 10 percent increase in the U.S. minimum wage raises food prices by up to 4 percent.\u201d A 2007 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that restaurant prices increase in response to minimum wage increases. 5. Detrimental effects of the minimum wage oversees and other options. There are seven European Union countries in which no minimum wage is mandated (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, and Sweden). If we compare the levels of unemployment in these countries with E.U. countries that impose a minimum wage, the results are clear. A minimum wage leads to higher levels of unemployment. In the 21 countries with a minimum wage, the average country has an unemployment rate of 11.8%. Whereas, the average unemployment rate in the seven countries without mandated minimum wages is about one third lower \u2014 at 7.9%. Many of these countries however have organized labor which engage in collective bartering. 6. Income Inequality: Let's observe the gini coefficient of the nations in the European Union without a mandatory minimum wage and the European Union overall. (Austria - 0.26 Cyprus - 0.29 Denmark - 0.24 Finland - 0.269 Germany - 0.306 Italy - 0.36 Sweden - 0.25). The average gini coefficient of all members within the European Union is 0.305, so nations within the European Unon without a mandatory minimum wage are on average more equal than nations which have a government set minimum wage. A minimum wage is not necessary for a relatively economically egalitarian country. Of course many individuals in these nations are involved in organized labor and organized bartering, but there is no legally enforced minimum wage.

            "conclusion": "The minimum wage should be increased",
            "premise": "Con's arguments are largely unfounded. Note that there is no evidence backing up his (her? I apologize, but your profile doesn't give your gender!) assertions. Let's look at the two assertions in his round 1 arguments.1. Raising the minimum wage will cause inflation.2. It will tell students that, straight out of high school, they will be able to earn a living wage of $15. ( Note: This claim is inaccurate, because the resolution calls for a minimum wage increase, but not necessarily a living wage of $15 per hour. So this argument is unfounded.) First, the inflationary impacts of raising the minimum wage are negligible (1). A myriad of research has been done on this, and there is simply no evidence that raising the minimum wage would raise the gallon of gas to $4.50. For goodness' sake, do you truly think low wage workers have that type of power? Gas prices are determined not even by the Federal Reserve's QE, but by global demand. Gas prices tend to fluctuate with global events, and are high at this moment because of increased demand from China and India. There is no evidence whatsoever that a slight hike in the minimum wage would raise gas prices to the degree you're suggesting. Next, you act as though inflation -- even if it were possible for the minimum wage to cause inflation -- is a bad thing. It is not. In fact, we had mild inflation during the golden years of U.S. years -- the three decades following WWII -- and about 4 percent inflation during Ronald Reagan's second term. Inflation, in moderate levels, is a good thing because wages and prices adjust, and thus it doens't impact purchasing power, and it eats away at debts. If inflation were ever to reach an exorbitant level, the Federal Reserve would simply raise interest rates and downsize its balance sheet. The threat of inflation is an unheard of, unfounded apparaition. The current inflation rate is 1.6%, below the Fed's 2% target. Yes, there was a higher inflation target under Ronald Reagan's Fed Chair than there was under Bernanke (that remains today under Yellen).Next, the inability to inflate is a severe cause of the downturn in Europe. The ECB can only purchase government bonds on the secondary market, and is thus subject to the whims of investors. As a result, it must pay extremely high interest rates in even a feeble attempt to hold down rates and boost aggregate demand and investment. At the same time, the same kind of deflationary drive running rampant in the US -- amid a liquidity trap, mind you -- is increasing nominally denominated debt shares and forcing through austerity. It turns out, debt deflation leads to lower wages, leads to less demand, leads to higher unemployment, leads to less demand, etc. and the cycle continues. Now, moving onto my arguments:1. The minimum wage is good for the economy. If the minimum wage kept pace with productivity since 1960, it would be about $22 per hour (2). Right now, it's a measely $7.25 per hour. What happened to the rest of the money? Productivity has nearly doubled after all, yet wages have been flat -- or, if you factor in the Great Recession, median wages have fallen. The answer is quite simple: they've gone to the top. Even since the 2009 recovery, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1 percent. 2. Any job losses for raising the minimum wage are negligible vis-a-vis the net gain. The CBO recently released a report on the minimum wage in which they said raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour would cost anywhere from 0 to 1 million jobs, though the best estimate is about 500,000. Note the massive disparity. They simply can't put a number on it. At the same time, it would lift over a million people out of poverty, and they even acknowledged that it would spur a rather large demand stimulus. This stimulus would more than offset any loss of employment, and macropolicies alone could care for low-skilled workers who may lose their jobs as a result. The point is, the benefits would outweigh the cost.3. It is a myth that the majority of minimum wage workers are teenagers. My opponent has fallen into this trap with his second argument, which I will now address. First, the CBO also told us that only 12% of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase to $10.10 would be teenagers. That means that a whopping 88% are not teenagers. This is simply the truth. A majority of minimum wage workers are breadwinners. They depend on the minimum wage for their livelihoods. And, at the same time, because these people are literally living below the poverty line, they must spend 100% of what they earn in order to survive. Increasing their incomes by way of a minimum wage increase would significantly boost demand, and thus provide a stimulus to both businesses and the economy at large.Conclusion:My opponent's arguments are unfounded. He has not provided a single argument against the minimum wage. 1. http://truth-out.org...;2. http://www.huffingtonpost.com...;3. http://www.cbo.gov...;",

            "conclusion": "An increase of the Federal minimum wage would have adverse effects on employment",
            "premise": "Minimum wage increases in theoryThe neoclassical theory on the minimum wage is very sraightforward. The model assumes that the given labor market is competitive (i.e. firms take wages, interest rates, and prices as given), and that there is one type of labor. The labor entails that output is created by a mix of labor and capital, and that the workers in question are on the minimum wage. The firms which are competing for labor (so they must give a wage), prices (so customers will buy there), and interest rates they set an equilibrium wage setting to create an optimal balance to create profit. The minimum wage, if increased, often surpasses this equilibrium. This raises the hiring firms marginal costs and induces two economy harming effects. First, the price of the output (or workers) rises, and therefore the demand for new workers falls. This leads to a reduction in production and hiring, which then leads to decreased employment. At any given time more and more people enter the workforce, and this leads to underemployment and unemployment. Second, the higher wages cause firms to substitute capital for labor in the production process. Overall, the effect on employment tends to be negative [1]. As Murray Rothbard notes, \"All demand curves are falling, and the demand for hiring labor is no exception. Hence, laws that prohibit employment at any wage that is relevant to the market (a minimum wage of 10 cents an hour would have little or no impact) must result in outlawing employment and hence causing unemployment.\"[2] The minimum wage makes it illegal to pay under a certian wage. If you are worth 10 dollars an hour it is unlikely a firm will pay you 20 dollars an hour. If you are worth three, the firm will not hire you for 7 dollars an hour. If you are employed and the minimum wage is raised above your worth, expect to not last long in the labor market unless you accept illegal pay. Regardless, the minimum wage only outlaws jobs which the employer is willing to pay, it does not create any new jobs. Empirical evidence There is a strong consensus amongst the empirical literature as to what the effects of the minimum wage would be on the low-skilled workers. Although the \"consensus\" notes that a 10% increase in the minimum wage leads to a 1-3% decrease in employment, some studies reach results of much higher (10%, 15%, 40%, etc). Essentially if one looks at the peer-reviewed literature, the question is no longer if the minimum wage decreases employment, the question merely becomes how much [1]. For example, research in Canada (an area very similar to the United States economically) showed that increases in the minimum wage led to a 17 to 44% increase in teenage unemplpoyment, 14 - 43% increase in 20 - 24 year old unemployment, and a 17 - 44% decrease in 16 - 24 year old employment. Further research on low skill workers as a whole yeilded the result of a 33-54% decrease in employment. In the UK, when they instituted a national minimum wage, the amount of minimum wage employment fell .8 - 38%, and the amount of hours worked fell by 15%. Results from Mexico and Columbia yeild this result: Mexico: *time series* -18% in employment (insignificant), *panel study*Mexican skilled workers -.1 to -.5%, unskilled drop 3% (significant). Columbia: *time series* -34% (significant), *panel study* skilled -.3 to -24%, unskilled - 15 to -33% drop (significant) [1]. In the United States, the results are not different. A study done from data after the welfare expansion reveiled this result: \"Minimum wages have strongly negative effects on the employment of teenagers and minorities (African American, Hispanic, or both). The author finds that a 10% increase in the minimum wage will decrease minority employment by 3.9%, with the majority of the burden falling on minority teenagers (6.6%). Although the size of the disemployment effects for African Americans is quite large -2.8% (and even larger for African American teenagers, -8.4%), it is the statistically significant effect for Hispanics (-4.9%) that is driving these results. This supports earlier research which found that minimum wages have the largest negative effects on low-skilled employees, such as teens and minority teens.\"[3] The newest research has shown that the effect may be larger than a 4% decrease. In the US, some studies have found their medium elasticity to be a 7% drop in employment when the minimum wage is increased 10% in New York State [4]. Research done on Santa Fe's minimum wages have found that then the city rose the minimum wage to $7.50 an hour (at this moment is is around 8) they had a 3.2% decrease in overall employment. Those who received little schooling took most of the harm, while those who had a large amount of education took little beating. The effect on the overall unemployment rate was significant, but the effect on the uneducated, those minimum wages supposedly helped, were hurt the most [5]. CONCLUSION In the literature there exists a strong consensus in opposition to increasing the minimum wage. The studies show that minimum wages increase unemployment and that the neoclassical model is correct. Unless my opponent provides strong counter statistical evidence, or a more convincing theory, the answer to this question seems obvious. 1. Neumark, David. William L. Wascher. Minimum Wages.

            "discussionTitle": "Minimum Wage Should Not Be Raised",
            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage Should Not Be Raised",
            "premise": "Firstly, thank you for accepting this debate. Let me start off by stating that the minimum wage was ordained in 1938 at 25 cents per hour, which adjusted for inflation would equal to over $4 today. Minimum wage jobs are by no means meant as a career. A minimum wage job, for the most part, demands a low skilled worker, which usually equates to the younger population. The very first topic you brought up is the fact that people with families should not be subjected to low pay. These people know willingly that they are making little money, and that they have no skill or education to make more money. They still decide to have a family, and then demand higher wages to fit their inadequate decision making/ Firstly, raising the minimum wage on a federal level would result in the loss of over 500,000 jobs. In an economy that is getting more dependent on the skills of a worker, which almost always equates to their level of education, minimum wage jobs are in decline. We have technology that can very well replace minimum wage workers, and these machines have already sprung up in cities that have increased their wages tremendously. Raising minimum wage inadvertently forces small business to cut jobs as well as hours for those that remain. It also drives up prices tremendously, as employers have to pay more money to their workers, which cuts back on overall profit. The main argument that you can, and that you will make is that people who work these jobs cannot afford necessities. Most \"necessities\" are created by people who work minimum wage jobs. These products would increase in cost, as the employers have to match wage costs with increased profit. This not only hurts the company, as it creates unnecessary and unwarranted competition that is legislated by a supreme ruling body, but it also hurts the employees. Private businesses and industry is already raising wages. Many businesses pay more money then the required minimum, such as IKEA, which is a multi-billion dollar company that employs dozens of thousands of people. It\"s not clear that it\"s constitutional. The Supreme Court, in its opinion in the 1923 case Adkins v. Children\"s Hospital of District of Columbia, made a strong argument that a minimum wage was a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of contract embedded in the Fifth Amendment\"s language about due process and the deprivation of liberty and property: \"To the extent that the sum fixed exceeds the fair value of the services rendered, it amounts to a compulsory exaction from the employer for the support of a partially indigent person, for whose condition there rests upon him no peculiar responsibility, and therefore, in effect, arbitrarily shifts to his shoulders a burden which, if it belongs to anybody, belongs to society as a whole.\" You talk about people who live in poverty. First, many people who live in poverty do not work, and would thus be unaffected by an increase in the minimum wage. In addition, workers who earn the minimum wage are generally not the primary breadwinners in their households. They are secondary earners \" an elderly parent earning some retirement income or a spouse with a part-time job. Or they are young people living with their parents. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while workers under age 25 make up only about 20% of those who earn hourly wages, they constitute about half of all workers earning the minimum wage or less. Raising the minimum wage is therefore an ineffective anti-poverty proposal. You see, there is only one argument to make for minimum wage increases, and that is people living in poverty. By increasing wages, which then increases overall income, it would make eligibility for certain programs almost nonexistent. There is a program here in Chicago, called After School Matters, and it is a charity based program created to compensate poor youths for work that they do. The most you can make (household) to get accepted is 60,000. Granted that both parents are working, a minimum wage increase would take away all possibilities into these programs. Not only that, but it would bypass the federal income tax level. People would then make more money, which would force them into paying more in taxes. They would always have to pay more in products, as I mentioned previously. Social programs such as Medicare and Welfare would become useless, as many would pass the threshold and would not receive any more federal or local benefits.

Rebuttal 1: Teenagers The entire argument does not matter since I did not make this claim. What does matter, though, is the number attached to it showing the minimum wage that was measured. \u201c\u2026 In fact, 89 percent of those who would benefit from a federal minimum wage increase to $12 per hour are age 20 or older, and 56 percent are women.\u201d What we are debating is a fifteen-dollar minimum wage per hour, so this entire argument is not under the resolution, and is considered void given no context on why this matters. Rebuttal 2: 600 economists I will concede that this happened, in support of the minimum wage increasing to $10.10 an hour of course. However, we are debating the minimum wage being higher, which will lose jobs in the long run. Remember, we are not debating simply a minimum wage increase, but one to fifteen dollars an hour, and this should be factored into today\u2019s debate. http://www.epi.org... Rebuttal 3: Support from small businesses The opinions of small businesses do not matter since I already given you an unrefuted example of how a minimum wage increase harms consumers. Not only this, but these are simply opinions and are not factored in to this debate. Rebuttal 4: Tipped minimum wage This entire argument is non-sequitur as it is not discussed in this debate. Rebuttal 5: Job losses I have already explained that job losses do not occur if the state were in charge of raising the minimum wage and I have used a Brookings Institution article to show why states are the best actors. Myth 5 and 6 I have not discussed this in this debate up till now. Rebuttal 6: Employee turnover Alright, maybe under certain circumstances this may happen, but my opponent has not shown that the savings from employee turnover outweigh the price of paying more toward employees, which will increase the price of products. Rebuttal 7: Not bad for economy The article claims that since this has not happened before, the GDP will remain the same. Aright, but have we ever doubled the federal minimum wage within one year? If so, what was the effect of that? Rebuttal 8: Minimum wages do not mean job losses My opponent does not cite sources to prove this. Also, remember these are independent studies, not studies done on the national level. I have already shown you that a minimum wage hike will have different results in different states, so independent results are not important if done on the state level. Since this is not cited, I can only assume as much.",

            "discussionTitle": "Minimum Wage",
            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "C1-Minimum Wage Impact: The impact of the minimum wage should be deemed insignificant. According to Heratage.org, 2.9% of our population makes minimum wage. This piece of evidence obfuscates the minimum wage thesis entirely. The population that is impacted by the minimum wage are young people. Here are the statistics: 79% of the population work part time jobs. 62% of the population are enrolled in school. 68% of the population possess family incomes above 150%. The impact of raising the minimum wage will benefit the adholescent. A population which a majority of them would be deemed well off. Raising the minimum wage would only benefit 2.9% of our population. C2-Young people: The minimum wage already should be rendered null in regards to the incomes of families, but there is also more to be discussed about the negative implications of the minimum wage's impact on young people. Wages are of paramount importance not only to the employee, but to the employer. An employer usually will make a risky investment in a worker with no prior skill set. The government would deem it only acceptable for that employer to employ a most likely young boy with no prior skil set with 7 dollars or more an hour. The minimum wage lowers the prospects of young peoples' capability to acquire a job. C3-Small Business Impact: The minimum wage also has a significant impact the efficiency of small businesses. I offer the following examples: \"I am here every day, from 6:30 in the morning to 9:00 at night. I probably average 100 hours a week here at the course,\" Martha said, noting that hiring more staff is a luxury her small seasonal profit margins haven\u2019t afforded her. Recently, Martha had to let her restaurant\u2019s dishwasher and table busser go \u2014 hats she now wears along with her other employees. If voters approve a hike in Nebraska\u2019s minimum wage floor to $9 an hour by 2016, Martha fears she will have to shoulder an even greater load just to keep her business running. The increased wage and tax costs of the hike would mean fewer hours to schedule for her employees, particularly in the course\u2019s golf shop. Pat Haines, also a survey respondent, is another entrepreneur who is worried about the proposed increase. Haines runs North Bowl, a bowling alley in North Omaha. Haines knows the business well, in part because he spent his childhood years playing there. He likes giving young people in North Omaha a chance at their first jobs by bringing them on for part-time work at the bowling alley. Haines worries that he will not be able to make as many investments in young people with limited skills and experience if the minimum wage is raised to $9 an hour. He also thinks that the increased labor costs will seriously impact his bottom line, forcing him to raise prices in a community that is sensitive to jumps in the cost of entertainment. \"The money has to come from somewhere. Either I have to raise prices, or do more with fewer employees, or cut the work hours of the ones I already have. But any of those decisions just makes it harder to grow the business, give more people work, and keep our customers coming back so everyone can be paid,\" Martha said Gary Tharnish, the president of Burton & Tyrell\u2019s Flowers in Lincoln, expresses similar anxiety about the proposal to increase the minimum wage. Like Haines, Tharnish likes to hire young people seeking their first jobs and then train them to be productive workers. \"I hire teenagers and then teach them,\" Tharnish explains. \"Hopefully, at the end of three months they have learned enough to work at the shop. If they work out, they get a raise.\" Tharnish says that opportunity might disappear if the minimum wage is ratcheted up to $9 an hour. If that happens, he will have to stop investing so much time on inexperienced young workers and hire older workers who need less supervision. \"If the minimum wage is increased I am simply going to look for adults who just want to work a few hours per week and forget about hiring teenagers.\" C4: Abolishing the minimum wage: The current federal minimum wage's impact on our population is null. 2.9% of the individuals on the minimum wage are young people from financially stable families. The minimum wage is only capable of harming people when inceased. A significant portion of economists have claimed that an increase of the minimum wage by 2 dollars would lead to a prollific depletion of 500,000 jobs. Proponents of the minimum wage claim that the minimum wage ceases any attempt my businesses to manipulate employee wages to their own advantage. Those proponents should be informed that the businesses compete for money as much as they compete for employees. If a business purposfully decreases wages that would be percieved to be unfair by the employee, than the employee has every right to find work at another company which assures him financial security. I request that my adversary answer the following questions? What positive impact does the minimum wage have on our population? Do you concede to the fact that an increase of the minimum wage implements a strain on small businesses? Can you explain why the minimum wage should not deemed to be null?

            "premise": "Alright! Rebuttal time! I see you have some contentions which I will address in turn. First you claim minimum wages cannot be fairly proportioned to accommodate the city dwellers and the smaller townspeople. Actually that is not true. Fuel, groceries restaurants and rent, taxes all costs are often higher in small towns. This is because of the lack of competition it drives prices up. http://www.insidesources.com... so wages balance here. Therefore the city dwellers will make money with wage increase and the townspeople will also. Also because of the lack of stores the townspeople will flock too the city to do their shopping which will add moola to the city which will pay the minimum wage for many workers. Also again it will help stimulate the economy. http://www.investopedia.com... Next you claim Raising the minimum wage will negatively affect businesses. However studies say you are wrong. \"Raising wages reduces costly employee turnover and increases productivity. When the minimum wage goes up, employers can enjoy these benefits of paying higher wages without being placed at a competitive disadvantage, since all companies in their field are required to do the same. Raising wages also puts money in the hands of consumers, boosting demand for goods and services............For these reasons, nearly 1,000 business owners and executives, including Costco CEO Jim Singeal, U.S. Women\"s Chamber of Commerce CEO Margot Dorfman, Addus Health Care CEO Mark Heaney, Credo Mobile President Michael Kieschnick, ABC Home CEO Paulette Cole, and small business owners from all 50 states, signed a Business for a Fair Minimum Wage statement supporting the last increase in the federal minimum wage. As their statement explained, \"[h]igher wages benefit business by increasing consumer purchasing power, reducing costly employee turnover, raising productivity, and improving product quality, customer satisfaction and company reputation.\" http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com... The site also shows numerous studies that link higher wages to better business. Next you claim raising the minimum wage will kill many peoples jobs. However the United States Department of Labor has regard this as a myth. Due to extensive research they know it will benefit the economy when wages go up. They say, \"In a letter to President Obama and congressional leaders urging a minimum wage increase, more than 600 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners wrote, \"In recent years there have been important developments in the academic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and providing some help on the jobs front.\"\" You say businesses won't have the money to pay wages. The Department of Labor says, \"A July 2015 survey found that 3 out of 5 small business owners with employees support a gradual increase in the minimum wage to $12. The survey reports that small business owners say an increase \"would immediately put more money in the pocket of low-wage workers who will then spend the money on things like housing, food, and gas. This boost in demand for goods and services will help stimulate the economy and help create opportunities.\"\" You say increasing the minimum wage is bad for the economy. US department of labor says, \"Since 1938, the federal minimum wage has been increased 22 times. For more than 75 years, real GDP per capita has steadily increased, even when the minimum wage has been raised.\" You say Increasing the minimum wage lacks public support. Department of Labor says, \"Raising the federal minimum wage is an issue with broad popular support. Polls conducted since February 2013 when President Obama first called on Congress to increase the minimum wage have consistently shown that an overwhelming majority of Americans support an increase.\" You say Increasing the minimum wage will result in job losses for newly hired and unskilled workers in what some call a \"last-one-hired-equals-first-one-fired\" scenario. The department of labor says, \"Minimum wage increases have little to no negative effect on employment as shown in independent studies from economists across the country. Academic research also has shown that higher wages sharply reduce employee turnover which can reduce employment and training costs.\" http://www.dol.gov... I personally believe everything you have brought to the table has been addressed on the link above. From negative affects on the economy to higher crime rates because of unemployment. Another thing is Huffington Post you have been using is not a very accurate site to use. https://en.wikipedia.org... TO CAP THIS ALL OFF... I have explained how wage increase will benefit the economy, benefit workers, and ultimately benefit the world. I have shown how it is moral to raise wages because no one should work their butts off and still live in poverty, \"An employee working a 40-hour week at the federal minimum wage would earn $15,080 per year. This income would leave a two-person household -- say, a single parent with one child -- just below the federal poverty threshold of $15,130.\" http://www.salary.com... I have explained well how raising the minimum wage will add money to businesses and add money to groth for the economy. For this reason vote Pro. I look forward to my opponents response.",

            "premise": "The minimum wage should not be raised because: 1) Price-Demand chart shows that when the price of a good or service increases, consumers will demand less of it. In this case, laborers offering to sell their labor to an employer now must be worth at least the mandated minimum to the employer otherwise the employee is now unemployable and will not be able to work the job even if he would have done so for less than the mandated minimum. Raising the minimum wage increases unemployment for unskilled workers, just as raising height requirements decreases the amount of short passengers for a roller-coaster. 2) The current minimum wage is in fact \"livable\", as by the criteria of \"livable\", nobody working at the current minimum wage could do so if it were not. Since the minimum wage is in fact already \"livable\", then the minimum wage has already achieved what it is set out to achieve and thus, does not need to be raised any further. 3) Only roughly 4% of the labor force actually works at the mandated minimum wage. And out of that 4%, 50% are under the age of 25. [1] People who are this young tend to be dependent on other members of their families and so there is no reason to be raising the \"livable\" wage for those which are not dependent on the wage itself being \"livable\". 4) Since only 2% of workers could be said to be dependent on the minimum wage, and the minimum wage is federal policy which is contingent on the current political atmosphere and not sound economic policy, other methods besides the minimum wage should be pursued to better the lives of that 2%.

            "premise": "THE MINIMUM WAGE IS INEFECTIVE In order to know if we should keep the minimum wage or not, the first thing we need to ask is; Is it effective? In order to know what problem it's intended to solve. For that we can go back to what we found the original problem to be. The problem is poor people don't have enough money. The minimum wage if effective should decrease poverty levels. However this has been shown to have a negative effect on poverty levels. According to The Emloyment Policies Institute; \"This study by economists Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway shows convincingly that minimum wages, because of inefficient targeting of the poor and unintended adverse consequences on employment and earnings, are ineffective as an antipoverty device. The report relies on an impressive array of empirical evidence showing that, however one views the data, in the United States, state and federal minimum wages have not reduced poverty.\"[1] On top of not doing anything for poverty it actually increases the unemployment rate. The Congressional Budget Office a non partisan government organization released a study showing that an increase in a minimum wage would result in at least half a million less jobs. [2] We're not helping poor people. We're eliminating their jobs and creating more of them. On top of that, the policy is pretty racist it's self. Raising the minimum wage will affect blacks in a disproportionate way while having almost no effect on the white unemployment rate.[3] Do politicians know it's going to hurt black people? Well, yes they do. They just don't care. These guys are smart enough to realize the negative affects of their policies and yet still pass them, because it helps them get reelected. CONCLUSION I'd like to ask my opponent this question. Since having a minimum wage causes higher unemployment, and does nothing to combat poverty, why do you want one? Why would you want government to have a policy that hurts minorities? Shouldn't we have policies that actually help the poor get jobs instead of losing them? Shouldn't we have policies that help black people, instead of being racist and trying to hurt them? Shouldn't we have policies that decrease unemployment, instead of increasing it? sources [1] http://www.epionline.org... [2] http://cbo.gov... [3] http://www.prnation.org...",

If we don't have it, workers will be paid next to nothing. This is simply not true. Very few workers even work the minimum wage, this is because the more they work, the more value they gain and there wages will rise. People have a choice of were to work, if they want a very low paying job, its because they feel its the best choice. Also, if bussinesses start paying people barely anything, people won't work there. Bussinesses will try to offer the best wages possible to compete for workers. They will also raise the wages of current workers or those workers will find higher paying jobs. The minimum wage harms people in areas where their is high enemployment and the ecomy is bad because bussinisses cant pay minimum wage. In areas of high enemployment people are desprete for work and will work for far less then the minimum wage. The minumum wage keeps them out of the workforce. If you don't have a skill that is worth the minumum wage you are also shut out of the economy, no one will pay you the minimum wage if you are an unskilled labor who isn't producing enough. It stops bussinisses from expanding and hiring others because they must pay minimum wage. In general it is governments attempt to fix what the free market does fine.",

            "premise": "How do you think a mother feels when her child goes up to her and tells her that she does not want a birthday present because that child knows that her mother can not afford to buy her a birthday present? What if I tell you that if the minimum wage was raised that this mother and many like her can afford to buy a birthday present for their daughter's birthday? Many believe that the minimum wage should not be raised because small businesses can not afford to pay employees more that the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, or waiters/waitresses for example, who get tips earn $2.13 per hour. This translates into an average of $ 14,500 a year for a full time worker. Another reason that people say that the minimum wage can not be raised is that if the federal minimum wage is raised then the prices of goods and services also increase. Many also say that increasing the minimum wage will cause people to lose their jobs. People argue that small businesses can not afford to pay employees more and as a result will end up firing many employees. This is just not true. In July of 2015 a survey found out that 60% of small business owners support a gradual increase to the minimum wage of $12.00. This survey also reports that small business owners preferred this because an increase of income would put money into the pockets of low- wage workers who will then spend the money on goods and services. This boost in demand will stimulate the economy and help create job opportunities. In fact, the White House published an article called Raise the Wage and it states that raising the minimum wage nationwide will benefit local economies and support millions of workers. Many people also say that the federal minimum wage should stay the same because if the minimum wage goes up then other prices will increase as well, and as a result everything becomes more expensive. Some states have placed rules in recent years causing increases in their minimum wages to help keep up with the already rising inflation. The federal minimum wage does not operate that way. According to the Department of Labor in their article Minimum Wage Mythbusters, in order for the federal minimum wage to increase it has to gain approval from Congress and the President. The plan is to gradually increase the minimum wage so it has time to adjust automatically with inflation. This will help low income families keep up with prices of the cost of living. People also say that increasing the minimum wage will cause people to lose their jobs. What these people are thinking that the federal minimum wage is going to be raised immediately. In reality what President Obama wants to do is to raise the minimum wage in increments until it eventually reaches $15.00 per hour. He wants to do this because if he tells the whole country to pay their workers $15.00 per hour, employers will not have a chance to adjust to this sudden change. But if he asks to slowly raise the wage of employees, then employers will have the time to adjust. This way no jobs are lost. In fact 600 economists studied that increasing the minimum wage has no effect on employment of minimum-wage workers including at times of weakness in the labor market. Robert Reich (former Labor Secretary) in an article called Why we Should Raise the Minimum Wage published on CNBC\"s website on April 27, 2015,he states that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25 per hour would lift 900,000 people out of poverty.",

            "conclusion": "The federal minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour",
            "premise": "The Cost of Living The problem with Pro's accusation is that he assumes I was arguing for abolishing the minimum wage. This is wrong, because I said no such thing. All I said was that it was ineffective, and it was better handled at the state or local level. Pro also seems to think that it was outside the scope of this debate, but no where in my resolution did I mention such a thing. All that is being argued is me opposing the $15 FEDERAL minimum wage. I can present any argument that I want, that shows that the United States of America shouldn't implement it. Pro says that I provided no data that shows a $15 dollar minimum wage causes unemployment, but how could I do that, when there isn't a National minimum wage? Instead I have shown minimum wage increases have resulted in unemployment, but Pro is ignoring that.Again, Pro is mistaking my arguments, and saying that a Federal Minimum wage isn't not decided by the states. That wasn't the point of my argument. It was to show that increasing the federal minimum wage is inefficient, but it something such as minimum wage is better handled at a state level. Pro is stating that the minimum wage is is designed to get a people to have a better standard of living, but he forget this is done at the expense of employees, who will soon be forced to pay people more than they are worth. Pro completely concedes my analogy with Des Moines and New York, on how a $15 dollar minimum wage doesnt take the cost of living into factor.Will lead to job lossPro is insisting that I provide an example of an employers. who fired people. When Wal-Mart hiked the minimum wage, it was expected it would fire 1000 employees. In another study, it showed that 38% of employers would fire workers if they were to hike the minimum wage to $10.10. Now you just need to imagine what that number would be if it were $15.Pro is saying that 52% of economists in that study support increasing the minimum wage , which is a complete lie. In the study itself, it only says 38% support increase the minimum wage. Now, we need to relook at this. What exactly is Pro proposing? A Federal $15 dollar minimum wage. If we use that criteria, only 16.7% support increasing by more than $1 per hour. However we don't actually know how high that number is, just it's more than $1. So it's likely that number is less than 16.7%.Having already refuted this argument, Pro clings onto the fact that several ecnonomists have supported President Obama's propsal to increase the minimum wage. I already mentioned that Obama's plan was to increase to $10.10, not $15. Pro's point ultimately falls flat because he has no evidence that shows ecnonomists would support a $15 minimum wage. Throughout the whole debate, he has cherry-picked economists that only either say increasing the minimum wage wouldn't cause substancial loss or have said they support increasing it to a number much smaller than $15. Finally, Pro gives us some examples of employees who get paid a minimum wage somewhat closer to his proposed $15 minimum wage. I can relate to this much better than the examples he provided earlier, although this is technically an argument, and not a rebutall. So, what Pro provided us is a minimum wage increase on a local level. As I have said before, I'm not opposed to a minimum wage increase in local levels, because I already acknowledged that the cost of living is quite different in different states and cities. In a state such as San Francisco, it makes a lot of sense, because the cost of living there is quite high, compared to other cities. The problem is that if we were to implement it nation-wide, other states or cities with low cost of livings, will suffer from things such as unemployment and inflation, because their workers will be paid more money than they are generating money.Pro is now saying that there is no evidence for job loss from a $15 dollar minimum wage. That is true, but I have shown there is evidence for job loss during minimum wage hikes with several studies done by economists. I even showed that Alan Kreuger, an ecnonomist who did a minimum wage study in New Jersey, opposed the minimum wage to $15. Does very little to help the poorIn this argument Pro is stating that I support abandoning the minimum wage because it does very little to help the poor. But this isn't the point of that argument. I showed with evidence that a minimum wage hike actually does make it harder for the poor to enter the workplace, which Pro doesn't adresss. Somehow, me saying we shouldn't raise it to $15 translates to \"WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH\" On top of that, Pro says it's a fallacy, but he doesn't he take the time to tell what kind of fallacy I committed. So, Pro fails to refute the negative impacts of raising the minimium wage, and instead resorts to calling my argument a fallacy. Which in fact, is a fallacy itself.EITCWhile I'll agree that this isn't a minimum wage, it doesn't mean it is outside the scope of the debate. I didn't just say we should expand EITC, but I also said it works better than a minimum wage, because it doesn't bring along the negative impacts of the minimum wage. Con concedes that, and is saying we should expand both.David Card\u2019s studySo, earlier I said that the study didn't show proof that the minimum wage was a good thing. His reply is that those with the increase were happy with it. This isn't an acceptable rebutall, because who would be sad when they receive a pay raise? Why not just increase the minimum wage to $100, and those people will be even more happier. Does that mean it's a good thing? Not really. First of all I never said it was good science, and I'm not sure where Pro seems to get this from. And the point of my comment directly ties in with the comparision I made earlier with Des Moines and New York. The changes wouldn't be substancially different when compared to New Jersey and Pennslyania, but when we make it at Federal level, we see the problem it might cause. Pro has not refuted this.Pro says that I gave no reference to Alan Kreugers comment, but I clearly did. I gave a link to the comment, and I quoted his exact words. Also when Alan Kreguer made that comment, he was referring to Bernie Sander's proposal of $15. Bernie Sanders is running for president in 2016, so this comment is not outdated. Pro lies once again, and tries to present wrong information by saying he will assume this took place in 1992. Price IncreasesThis is precisely why I was confused in the beggining. I'm not sure why Pro is making arguments in my favor. But I'll go with it. Pro shows the prices of food items will go up, and this definetly doesn't indicate we should increase the minimum wage.Arguments Pro has concededA $15 Minimum wage create unemploymentThe minimum wage doesn't take the cost of living into factorEconomist such as Alan Kreuger are against it a $15 increase specificallyEITC will help people more than a $15 Minimum wageIncreasing the minimum wage will drive costs up in fast food restaurants60% of those in poverty aren't even workingThe majority of economists are against a raise, and support Abolishing itSources:http://ew-econ.typepad.fr...https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com...http://www.zerohedge.com...http://www.breitbart.com... I urge voters to vote Con, because I have shown the harmful impacts of raising the Federal minimum wage to $15, and I also provided a much better solution in the form of a tax break, which would work better than a minimum wage in reducing poverty.Please Vote Con Also, I thank Pro for this debate, and wish him goodluck in the voting period.",

            "premise": "Raising the minimum wage would increase economic activity and spur job growth. The Economic Policy Institute stated that a minimum wage increase from the current rate of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 would inject $22.1 billion net into the economy and create about 85,000 new jobs over a three-year phase-in period. Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago predicted that a $1.75 rise in the federal minimum wage would increase aggregate household spending by $48 billion the following year, thus boosting GDP and leading to job growth. A 1994 study by economists Alan Krueger, PhD, and David Card, PhD, compared employment in the fast food industry after New Jersey raised its minimum wage by 80 cents, while Pennsylvania did not. Krueger and Card observed that job growth in the fast food industry was similar in both states, and found \"no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\" Their findings were corroborated by economists Hristos Doucouliagos, PhD, and T.D. Stanley, PhD, in a review of 64 minimum wage studies. The authors found \"little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment.\" Increasing the minimum wage would reduce poverty. A person working full time at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour earns $15,080 in a year, which is 20% higher than the 2015 federal poverty level of $12,331 for a one-person household under 65 years of age but 8% below the 2015 federal poverty level of $16,337 for a single-parent family with a child under 18 years of age. According to a 2014 Congressional Budget Office report, increasing the minimum wage to $9 would lift 300,000 people out of poverty, and an increase to $10.10 would lift 900,000 people out of poverty. A 2013 study by University of Massachusetts at Amherst economist Arindrajit Dube, PhD, estimated that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 is \"projected to reduce the number of non-elderly living in poverty by around 4.6 million, or by 6.8 million when longer term effects are accounted for.\"",

Well, yes, it\u2019s true that there is some research that suggests minimum wage causes unemployment. There\u2019s also some research that suggests it makes no statistically significant difference, or actually makes a positive difference (ie reduces unemployment). Studies that support the minimum wage (in terms of unemployment) include: - David Card and Alan B. Krueger, \"Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,\" American Economic Review, Volume 84, no. 4 (September 1994), pp. 774\u2013775. This found that employment rose after an increase in minimum wage. - Thomas C. Leonard, \"The Very Idea of Applying Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and its Antecedents,\" History of Political Economy 32 (1), p. 139 (2000). This found that studies concluding that studies concluding unemployment rose after the implementation of a minimum wage had methological flaws had not be responded to by those who had written aforementioned studies. PDF: http://www.princeton.edu... - Hristos Doucouliagos and T.D. Stanley, \"Publication Bias in Minimum-Wage Research? A Meta-Regression Analysis,\" British Journal of Industrial Relations, 2008. Another study found that after publication bias was corrected for, there was no relationship between minimum wage and unemployment. While the minimum wage was believed to cause increases in unemployment in the 1990s, that view is no longer the consensus among economists[1]. Currently there isn\u2019t really much of one. Further peer-reviewed research is probably warranted. C2. It\u2019s true that Wal-Mart may be doing this to discourage competition (emphasis on may; I am not a member of the heads of Wal-Mart so I cannot say for sure\u2014it is possible that they are doing so for other reasons still not related to alturism). But in a similar light, some people can\u2019t afford to comply with OSHA regulations. Is competition an end in and of itself, or is it to serve a greater purpose? If it is to serve a greater purpose, then surely there could be specific instances in which competition could not be good. For instance, I would not desire competition between a company that manufactured peanut butter with rat feces in it and one that did not; someone (including myself) might be careless or ignorant and purchase the former rather than the latter. Now, that\u2019s an extreme example, to be sure. Which leaves it up to me to prove that having a minimum wage is, overall, a good thing, even if it decreases competition and (possibly) causes a slight increase in unemployment. There are many paths available for me to do this with; I\u2019ll use several of them. P1. Adoption of a living wage (which is basically a form of a minimum wage that automatically rises) is predicted to decrease premature death.[2] An increase in minimum wage would, of course, lead many to experience raises; currently a family of three with one minimum wage earner earns about 2/3 of the federal poverty level.[3] 1. \"A Blunt Instrument; The Minimum Wage,\" The Economist, October 28, 2006. 2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... 3. http://www.epi.org...",

            "conclusion": "Raising Minimum Wage Would Decrease USFG Spending",
            "premise": "Premise I: Burden of Prove.Pro blatantly misreads my case. I didn't say the resolution was \"x\"... I said that, to affirm the resolution, Pro must answer \"x\". My cases addresses the resolution, whereas I have shown that Pro did nothing to prove the resolution.To restate Pro's arguments...P1) The people are on Welfare.P2) Welfare costs X amount.C) Increasing MW would decrease Welfare costs.As I said, Pro most prove that increasing the minimum wage would impact those in P1.Argument I: Demographics of Minimum WagePro puts out a claim, but does nothing to quantify it. He claims that more people are on/near Minimum Wage, but doesn't say how many more. 3%? 5%? Pro doesn't answer this. As for the opening few sentences about state minimum wages, there is no relevance. This debate is about federal minimum wage, and only 2% of the working are at the US federal Minimum Wage.If Pro CAN'T prove that most Minimum Wage workers are in poverty, then he fails to prove his case, as his whole case is about how increasing wages decreases welfare costs. However, by conceding all of my arguments, he has conceded his own case. If most minimum wage workers aren't in poverty, then increasing minimum wage does little to impact welfare costs.More importantly, Pro concede the following cases:- The average household income for Minimum Wage workers is $50,700+ a year. - 87% of those effected by Minimum Wage increases were not poor. - 56% lived in households earning more than twice the poverty rate.- Raising Minimum Wage would only affect 0.0043% of those on welfareBy conceding these points, Pro can not prove that raising minimum wage would decrease welfare costs. If increasing minimum wage doesn't decrease poverty, it won't decrease welfare spending.Argument II: Effect of Minimum WageA) Prior CasePro's only argument is a blunt display of information with no detail, no context, and no variables being accounted for. My studies have accounted for all variables and context that may alter, and distort, the conclusion. Pro has not accounted for these. Nor does his employment increase account only for employment rates among minimum wage workers. As such, we must assume his analyzes is not valid. In fact, just accounting for the employment of the youth alone shows us a far different picture, where unemployment amoung teenagers correlates perfectly with the increasing/decreasing value of the minimum wage (1). This alone shows how important these variables are.My studies are based on reviewing minimum wage increases that have happened (one of my studies even dealing with the 1997 amendment), and found, after clearing all the variables that distort Pro's assessment, that the increase hurt employment. Pro's assessment also fails to account for disemployment. Pro may notice that I often talk about disemployment, not unemployment. Increasing minimum wage doesn't have a sudden, immediate effect. It can take a year or two to find the effects in place. Increasing minimum wage can decrease employment in the long-term by decreasing the rate of additional employment.... Called disemployment.A study by Brown, Gilroy, and Kohen found that, for every 1% increase in the Minimum Wage, there is a 0.12% increase in disemployment... Sometimes as high as 0.92% increase. To increase Minimum Wage to Obama's proposed $10.10, we'd risk seeing an increase in unemployment by as much as 9% (2). Another study, by Nuemark, backed up this claim (3). Later, Nuemark redid his evaluation, and found that with new variables accounted for, there was a similar disemployment rate (4).A review found that in 2011, McDonald's hired 64,000 Americans, but in Europe (with it's higher MWs), they replaced workers with 7,000 self-serve computers. They intend to do much the same in the US as well due to increasing minimum wage costs (5). Mark Wilson found that increased unemployment among the youth followed increases in minimum wage (6). This effect hurts the long-term success of these youth, making them costlier for the Government.I also want to note that, at only a 57% rate of success (11 out of 19 amendments), he has disproven his case about unemployment. He must prove that increasing the minimum wage WOULD decrease spending. Not that it MIGHT (57% could) decrease spending.[1] http://web.archive.org...[2] http://www.nber.org...[3] http://www.nber.org...[4] http://www.nber.org...[5] http://www.wsj.com...[6] http://object.cato.org...Argument III: Less USFG Income = More Debt.Pro claims that 66% of low-wage earners are working for Large Corporations. His source is wrong in how it assesses who they work for, however. If 100 employees are working for McDonald's, his source would claim that they are working for a \"big corporation.\" But this is wrong... They are employed by a small business franchising from McDonald's. That small business pays the employees wages, not McDonald's themselves. And that small business owner is bringing in tiny profit rates of around 6% or less (7) This, by itself, disproves Pro's whole study from NELP, as well. These studies were built on the false premise that the corporation, and not the actual franchisers, employs and pays the employees. Therefore, their results are corrupted.Pro's case is also flawed in that it reviews the productivity of the employees, and not the overall productivity rate. If the corporation decreases employment by 30% in order to fix losses, and the productivity of each employee increased by 10%, they would still see a 23% decrease in productivity. My Argument II case proves these potentionally massive unemployment/disemployment effects.Pro dropped the rest of this case, including lower profit margins.As for the $50 bn claim... This need not be sourced. Pro's attempt to discredit this is rather silly. I didn't say the debt WOULD increase by $50 bn here... I was showing how much debt and interest a $50 bn a year deficit would cause. Over a decade, that would amount to $500 billion in debt, which would produce at least another $500 billion in interest. Pro is acting as though I said increasing the minimum wage would lead to a $50 bn increase in the deficit.Based on US income tax revenues (8), it's likely that, with the CBO's unemployment estimate in mind, an increase to $10.10 could cost the USFG over $10 bn a year in income tax. $20 bn a year if we include unemployment costs from Rebuttal I. The cost could be $100 bn+ based on Brown, Kilroy, and Kohen's study.[7] http://smallbusiness.chron.com...Rebuttal I: Welfare CostsPro's copy/paste seems pointless... These number don't tell us anything about who is on welfare. My whole case proved that those people on welfare are not the same as the people on Minimum Wage. Perhaps if Pro hadn't been so quick to concede my case, his case would still work.Pro says that Walmart employees receive $6 billion in welfare, these statistics are recession related. To find an accurate measurement of how much welfare is spent on Minimum Wage, Pro needs to give us a number that accounts for the recession. However, even then, Pro fails to account for the largest issue...Pro has NOT proven that increasing Minimum Wage would counter these welfare costs. A study by Heritage Foundation found that, if increased to $10.10, the minimum wage increase would do nothing to reduce Welfare costs (8). Nor has Pro proven that, if it did decrease welfare costs, it would be larger then the negative impacts. The cost of the 1997 increase, as an example, and if accounting for population increases, would cost $8 bn - $10 bn alone just for unemployment increases if enacted today. Well over the $6 bn welfare costs for Walmart.I addressed these impacts in Argument II and Argument III.[8] http://www.heritage.org...Conclusion:I have shown that great disemployment effects would be seen from an increase in Minimum Wage. I have also shown the costs of these effects. Pro has not proven that minimum wage workers greatly impact welfare costs, while I have shown that the vast majority of them are too far from poverty to have an impact. Pro has also failed to prove that, among the few who are poor, increasing their wages would help them, while I have proven it wouldn't.Pro has not affirmed the resolution. And the argument he has conceded (especially from Argument I) prevent him from doing so.",

            "discussionTitle": "An increase of the Federal minimum wage would have adverse effects on employment",
            "conclusion": "An increase of the Federal minimum wage would have adverse effects on employment",
            "premise": "Neoclassical predictions do not entail a specific time frame. If the wages are above the market equilibrium, those in worth less than the equilibrium will not be hired. If the equilibrium changes, as most things do in the market, the minimum wage in 20 years may have no effect. However, this is merely a red herring. The debate entails an adverse effect on employment. An employment effect do be adverse need not be highly long term. Since the minimum wage cannot create new jobs itself, its most positive effect would be around zero (which itself does not make sense, based on economic theory). If employment does down 1%, then 5 years later flat lines because it is a short term effect the overall effect on society is zero. Further, if the minimum wage is raised ten percent, it temporarily stunts future growth anyway. My opponent essentially argues that more wages entail more spending and investment. Although this is true to a degree, the question is a matter of employment. However, since the minimum wage increases prices, this easily cancels out the wage benefits. And the employment downsides\u2014which are long term as I will explain later\u2014remain and the net effect is negative. To say that the effect of the minimum wage is small is impossible to comprehend. Studies have nearly always showed that the minimum wage makes it harder to employ the least skilled. 27 million people can\u2019t get a job because they are not worth enough to the employer, and a 40% increase in the minimum wage led to 550,000 people losing their jobs. A ten percent increase is roughly equal to 55000 losing their jobs, ignoring the long term schooling effects as well as the higher likelihood of those working above the minimum wage to slip into poverty in these situations [1]. Empirical Evidence My opponents source is blatantly wrong. The article relies on a new wave of studies who claim to have superior research designs then those who come before it. However, to claim that \u201call\u201d the recent research comes to their conclusion is false. For example, the studies I cited before (Neumark and Wascher 2008, for example) summarized much of the modern research. They find that very little literature actually supports minimum wage increases. To say that \u201call\u201d studies support the minimum wage is simply a lie. Further, this new research relies on worse designs. The new controls have actually been shown to be less robust then the research before it (which almost universally opposed minimum wages) and have problems of their own. The research my opponents article cites is not a victory. It merely relies on weak research with a host of new methodological problems. The study is less suited to argue its point then the ones I cited [2]. Nobel Laurate Gary Becker notes, \u201c. A very recent study by Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (January 2013] goes over a few recent studies challenging this conclusion. They conclude, as Neumark and Wascher did in their 2008 book, Minimum Wages, regarding earlier evidence, that the recent evidence does not overturn the conclusion that higher minimum wages do significantly reduce employment of vulnerable groups, like teenagers. [emphasis added]\u201d[3] These new studies themselves are weak and fail to control for the factors they wish to control for. The information cited here is totally misinformed about the academic rebuttal to the studies cited. Productivity If this is irrelevant to unemployment, my opponent should not have brought it up. This debate is about employment, not overall economic growth (though employment does affect economic growth\u2014to deny this is idiotic). But the reason GDP is growing is easy to explain. New technology, pro growth policies implemented by JFK, Reagan, Nixon, and everyone in that bunch except Bush II and Carter. Technological advancements throughout the era (dot com boom, space and other scientific knowledge). Basically, the fact we are seeing growth is not shocking. Since my opponent claims employment has no effect on growth, though, it is irrelevant in his own words. Numbers Ever heard of hypothetical\u2019s? They were devices to help you understand the basic theory\u2026 1. A living wage is merely a high minimum wage. It is merely a different name which sounds nice to garner it votes, but it\u2019s the same thing. For example, lets say I called a 1% tax cut a tax cut, but a 20% tax cut a money giveaway economy boosting drug. Mouth full ain\u2019t it? But it\u2019s the same thing. And again, it was a hypothetical. The same standard applies to $5 an hour and $7 an hour, if we insist that there is a difference. 2. If the rate employers hire decreases, unemployment rises, too. It also prevents people from entering the workforce. This is a subtle effect of a minimum wage. Small business lay people off all the time. Just recently (it\u2019s a personal story\u2014is that an example that counts?) we fired a front desk manager because she was not worth her wage. Not related to a minimum wage, but again the concept relates (she earned above minimum wage). But a company names Chicken of sea is laying off 2000 employees (12% of its total employment) because of the recent minimum wage hike [4]. Good enough example? Minorities I never said the minimum wage was racist, but that it had unintended consequences to those demographic groups. As a minority I hope this doesn\u2019t sound racist itself: on balance (not always\u2014I would say for my age of 15 I am *fairly* productive) minorities are worth \u201cless\u201d. Generally they are poorer and are schooled less. They then have fewer skills. If they can\u2019t get hired because they are not worth $7 an hour, sorry. If a wage increases above their worth (say their worth is $7, and in ABQ we raise it to 8/9 like recently) they will eventually get laid off unless their skill level improves. It is not racist, it is simply that they are disadvantaged and cannot get a job because of the mandated wage! If they had a $5 dollar/hour job for 1 year, they would be worth $9 the next. Essentially having a high minimum wage makes it impossible for them to catch up to their affluent cousins, which is not racist, its just life. 1. Neumark, David. William L. Wascher.

            "premise": "Alrighty then! I'll be out of the country starting Friday - but I expect to be able to respond. I apologize in advance, however, if I miss a rebuttal. Thanks! In this debate I will argue that the minimum wage of the United States, currently at $7.25 with the federal level, is detrimental to the United States. I am not advocating a reduction in the minimum wage, but a total abolishment. My opponent must advocate in turn the minimum wage as-is; that is, at 7.25 or higher (depending on the state) _____ When look at the situation from a purely economic perspective, the minimum wage makes very little sense. By abolishing the minimum wage the US would most likely see an increase in GDP and a decrease in unemployment. The reasons behind this are relatively simple. When a business is forced to pay someone a set amount of money, they most often take a heavy hit. To pay 7.25 an hour for an unskilled, uneducated job such as mopping floors requires businesses to redirect money from more important things and other employees' wages to said unskilled job. D.W. MacKenzie, professor of economics at State University of New York -- Plattsburgh explains in an article for the Mises Institute (1): Employers pay a wage no higher than the value of an additional hour's work. Raising minimum wages forces employers to dismiss low productivity workers. This policy has the largest affect on those with the least education, job experience, and maturity. Consequently, we should expect minimum wage laws to affect teenagers and those with less education. Let's say an employer has three employees paid directly according to their job abilities \u2013 Employee 1 is under minimum wage, Employee 2 is at minimum wage, and Employee 3 is above it. If we suddenly increase E1's wage to the same level as E2's, despite doing the exact same job as before, a problem occurs. The employer has to lower E3's wage to compensate, or decrease his profit and harm the business that pays the wages anyways. Now, on a small scale, that's not problem. It's only a couple of dollars. However, if you multiply that scenario by 100 \u2013 and get a 300 person company, what would the have to employer do? Rather than take away from the E3's (whose talent they need) they will fire some of the E1's. It is in this way that the minimum wages harm the least skilled \u2013 an unfortunate reality in the US is that it adversely affects teenagers and ethnic minorities the most. Jobs are only created when an employer thinks that the total revenue outweighs the cost. Minimum wage increases those costs. Hiring an unskilled teenager at 7.25 an hour would not normally appeal to an employer, and thus, he would continue on without the job post. In a philosophical sense, minimum wages are bad because they interfere with the right of contract. A 1905 SCOTUS case, Lochner v New York, affirmed the right of an employer and employee to freely determine the wages and hours, no matter how low or high they may be, of a job. This decision was reversed in 1937. The freedoms to negotiate wages, etc, are the cornerstone of a functioning economic system, and the minimum wage absolutely destroys that cornerstone - contracts have the ability to allocate risks and problems that may arise (2). Contracts have the ability to allocate risks and problems that may arise (1) http://mises.org... (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 2) (2) http://www.cato.org... (pg. 4, margin)",

            "conclusion": "The Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "The minimum wage is a law set by the both the federal government and the states to create a minimum rate at which workers can work. According to researcher at the Cato Institute Mark Wilson, this law was created during the Great Depression as part of Franklin Roosevelt\"s economic policies (Wilson). It has, however, grown since it was first instituted. Today, members of Congress are trying to pass a minimum wage law that would raise the minimum cost of labor to $10.10 from the current $7.25. This should not occur as many economic laws and theories suggest that it would impose a net negative effect on the American economy. The first economic laws that could be cited against the proposal are the Law of Supply and the Law of Demand. According to \"Principles of Microeconomics\" by Libby Rittenberg, the Law of Supply states that as the price of a good or service increases, the supply will also increase. This is because producers see that there is a profit that could be made, and the increase in price would make their time and effort worthwhile. This applies to labor as workers are producers of labor. When labor is worth more, more people will want to work. The Law of Demand works opposite the Law of Supply in that the Demand decreases as price increases. This is because consumers are less likely to consume goods that are more expensive. This also applies to labor as businesses are consumers of labor. As the price of labor increases, businesses are less likely to demand it (Rittenberg, 121-151). Rittenberg continues to state that these two laws work together to form an equilibrium point. The equilibrium point is the point where supply meets demand, and this is dependent upon price. The price at which supply and demand equal is called the equilibrium price. Labor has an equilibrium price too. However, labor\"s equilibrium price is dependent upon what is being performed. A fast food server is likely to have a low equilibrium price, but an engineer is likely to have a high one (Rittenberg, 152-167). Now, the minimum wage is what is referred to as a price floor (Rittenberg, 198). A price floor is the minimum price that can be placed on any good or service. If the price floor is set above the equilibrium price, the supply of a good or service will increase because the price being paid for a good increases. However, the demand for the good or service will decrease. The minimum wage would increase the supply for the good since more people would want to go to work, but it will also decrease demand. As a result, more people will want work, but fewer workers will be wanted. Thus, an employment shortage will occur. According to Hanson, this employment shortage could range from 500,000 to 1,500,000 American jobs (Hanson, 325). With an employment shortage, people will be clamoring for jobs, and employers will have a larger pool of people from which to choose to hire. This means that they can be more selective in who they hire. In other words, the minimum wage jobs of today will be taken by the more experienced and more educated individuals of society. The unskilled, uneducated, and the young will be hard-pressed to acquire the work experience they need to move up in the job market. The laws of supply and demand are a clear and common indicator of how price floors can harm the marketplace. It shows how the government trying to help can hurt. Still, there are more examples of theories that can prove that the minimum wage laws are not the best way to continue and resolve current economic issues. In fact, the Phillips Curve proves this. According to Kevin Hoover, the Short-Run Phillips Curve shows the correlation between inflation and unemployment over a short period of time. The Short-Run Phillips Curve is a smooth- \"L\" shaped curve that occurs when unemployment, x-axis, is graphed with inflation, y-axis. The \"L\" shape associated with the Short-Run Phillips Curve displays the negative correlation of these two variables: it shows that as the unemployment rate rises, the inflation rate falls (Hoover). The interesting feature about the Short-Run Phillips Curve, the one that applies in this situation, is that, according to Jordi Gali in \"The Return of the Wage Phillips Curve,\" wages can be substituted for inflation in the Short-Run Phillips Curve. This would indicate that as the unemployment rate rises, wages fall and vice-versa (Gali, 3). So, how would the minimum wage effect the Short-Run Phillips Curve as it relates to wages? By increasing the minimum wage, the L-shaped curve in the graph would shift to the right in the graph. By doing this, the same wages associated with a certain unemployment rate will correspond to a higher unemployment rate post shift. Therefore, it can be assumed that if wages are at the proposed $10.10, the unemployment rate must be higher than it is for the short term. The \"short term\" is not defined, so it can range from months to several years depending upon a variety of different variables. Of course it is referred to as \"Short-Run\" because it does not answer the questions of wages/inflation versus unemployment in the long-run. Therefore, economists utilize the Long-Run Phillips Curve for cases in which a long run analysis is more helpful. The Long-Run Phillips Curve is not a curve; it is a line. It is a vertical line that rises from the normal unemployment rate. According to Kevin D. Hoover, if the Short-Run Phillips Curve shifts to the right, the Long-Run Phillips Curve will also shift to the right by the same proportion (Hoover). Therefore, even in the long run, the unemployment rate will be larger in this the United States if the minimum wage is increased. The Phillips Curve works to describe immediate and long term effects on wages. However, what factors set wages in the first place? The simple answer to that question is productivity. Productivity is the amount a producer can produce in a given time. This is a short definition, but it is broad enough to cover a wide range of circumstances. For example, accountants produce documentation of financial transactions and tax records. They do this in specialized ways using a specific methodology that they had to learn at college. They produce the documents companies must have in order to continue to operate within the parameters of the law. Therefore, accountants are productive and worth much money. This is why they get paid better than a fast food worker. Any particular fast food worker could produce low-priced food in a short period of time. The value of the food they produce in an hour is just slightly more than the current minimum wage. For companies to remain profitable, they have to pay their employees less than the value of the goods that they produce. This is why the wages of fast food workers seem so low. If the minimum wage is raised, what would happen to productivity? The answer is nothing. This is because wages do not determine productivity like many on the other side of the issue will sometimes argue. It is, in fact, the other way around. Productivity determines the wages (Hovenga). If the price floor is raised, then employees will be producing less for the company than they are getting paid to produce. How can a company continue to make a profit off of their employees if this is the case? According to the article, \"The Detrimental Side-Effects of Minimum Wage Laws,\" employers have to branch out (Hovenga). In other words, they must look into hiring workers who can produce more than a $10.10 revenue in any given hour. According to The Journal of Collective Negotiations, this is not the young and inexperienced people hired by fast food restaurants or Mom-and-Pop stores (Moore). Again, the young and inexperienced will miss out on more job opportunities because of the federal minimum wage (Wilson). They will be replaced by machines wherever machines can be used, and they will be replaced by the people will plenty of on-the-job-training and even a college education (Hovenga). Furthermore, raising the minimum wage in this fashion is not fair to those who currently make more than the minimum. For example, those who have worked hard to make $10.15 today will still make that same amount after the minimum wage increases. They just made it over the minimum wage threshold. Therefore, they go from making almost three dollars more than the minimum wage per hour to making no more than a nickel more than the minimum wage. Also, those who are making $21.75 are making three times the minimum wage today; however, if it is raised to the specified amount, they will only be making just over double the minimum wage. Again, this is not fair. From the supply and demand argument to the productivity argument against the minimum wage, the youth miss out. The other side of the issue likes to argue that the current minimum wage is not sufficient, but the current minimum wage also includes the on-the-job-training and experience that the young are getting that they will not be getting upon passage of the minimum wage law if they cannot get a job. The minimum wage is not fair to those who have worked hard to get where they are, nor is it fair to those who are in the process of making it in the job market. According to Business & Society Review, the minimum wage laws harm the young and inexperienced workers disproportionate to those who are already experienced and situated in the economy. It is well-known that people need plenty of work experience in order to obtain higher paying jobs in this country. By raising the wages, the jobs will go to those who already have the experience and education. This will leave the nation\"s current youth, especially minority members, at a disadvantage for many years to come (Hovenga).",

The Swiss are earning more than we are, with no minimum wage, this is because the Swiss have something called a \"free market\" and \"labour unions,\" so they don't need a minimum wage, infact they do better without it and are more productive. Think about it, if you are guarenteed 10$ a hour for your labour, you would be inclined for personal profit, to put in labour worth less than 10$ a hour. Whereas if you are payed according to the quality of your work, you become more productive to earn more money. Also, the tenth ammendment saysa:\"The powers not delegated to the Federal Goveronment, nor prohibbited to the states, shall be granted to the states respectvely, or to the people.\"The constitution never grants the federal goveronment the power to establish a minimum wage, so this power should be given to the states through state minium wages, or to the people through labour unions. {1}. http://www.tradingeconomics.com...",

            "conclusion": "Raising the federal minimum wage would not be economically beneficial",
            "premise": "ForfeitUnfortunately Pro has forfeited every round of this debate. This merits a loss of conduct points, but I will leave that at the discretion of the voters. At this point, I will offer my own case which will go unrefuted. Resolved: Raising the Federal Minimum Wage would be economically beneficial The definitions, to my knowledge, are self-explanatory, so I don't feel a need to clarify any at this point. I'll jump right into my argument. Note: I had several images, but kept receiving error messages when I tried to submit. So I'm going to instead link to the images.I. Adjusting for Sticky WagesAs we all know, economic gains are not broadly shared; over the past thirty years, the bulk of economic gains have gone to the very affluent. In spite of the fact that productivity has doubled, median wages have flatlined for many and fallen for some. Who has been the most hurt by this? Minimum wage workers; the minimum has not been and is not indexed to inflation, meaning that nominal wages do not rise with inflation. Even though the nominal minimum wage has increased over time, real wages nevertheless decline, meaning falling purchasing power. Let's examine this in several graphs. The first graph comes from a piece Robert Reich wrote in the NYT (1). http://www.debate.org...Initially, this looks like a rather confusing graphic, so allow me to briefly elucidate it for you. From 1947 to 1979, productivity increased by 119%. As a result, hourly compensation increased by 100% and hour wages increased by 72%. This looked, overall, pretty fair: generally speaking, pay rose proportionally with productivity. This hasn't been the case recently, however. From 1979 to 2009, productivity increased by 80%, whilst average hourly compensation only increased by 8% and average hourly wages only increased by 8%. How have wages practically been flat, though, if productivity has increased? As the opponents of a minimum wage increase often argue, people are \"paid what they are worth.\" That, of course, is an utter crock. I'm going to provide a few more graphics proving this point soon, but there's more to see. Observe next the change in income distrubtion to households by income groups. This comes from the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality (2). Note the same occurence: rising shares of income for those at the very top, and flat or falling shares of income for those struggling to make it. http://www.debate.org...We should view this in context, though. What has happened to incomes of the top 1 percent over this time period? Let's review this following graph (3). http://www.debate.org...To make a long story short, the top 1 percent has done exceedingly well, with income gains surpassing productivity gains. To provide more context, consider this: in 1980, CEO's earned 42 times what the average worker made, but in 2012, they earned 380 times (4). Opponents of a minimum wage increase will argue that workers are merely paid \"what they are worth,\" which is rooted in their productivity. However, if the minimum wage kept pace with productivity, it will be about $21.72 (5). If it even kept pace with inflation, it would be $10.52 (5). We can observe this disparity with an analysis put together by Pew of nominal versus real values of the minimum wage (6). Notice that the real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968, and hasn't been higher since. http://www.debate.org...II. ProductivitySo we now know, judging from empirical data, that the notion that people are paid in accordance with their equilibrium wage or their marginal product of labor if a canard: it simply hasn't happened, which is largely because the entire concept is entirely theoretical and arbitrary. That is, if I'm an employer, I can artificially increase your productivity by making sure that you have access to the best machinery. I could also artificially lower your productivity (this is obviously hypothetical) by breaking your leg. Does this mean I should alter your pay? Of course not, nor would I. This isn't to say that productivity and compensation are entirely incompatible, as there is some merit to the argument that pay, generally speaking, does or should increase with productivity. It simply hasn't happened as recent, and thus having a minimum wage acts a counterweight against lack of bargaining leverage in the workplace. The point of this contention, though, is that raising the minimum wage can actually increase worker's productivity. Wayne Cascio from the Harvard Business Review explains: \"In return for its generous wages and benefits, Costco gets one of the most loyal and productive workforces in all of retailing, and, probably not coincidentally, the lowest shrinkage (employee theft) figures in the industry...Costco\u2019s stable, productive workforce more than offsets its higher costs.These figures challenge the common assumption that labor rates equal labor costs. Costco\u2019s approach shows that when it comes to wages and benefits, a cost-leadership strategy need not be a race to the bottom.\" (7) We also have a statement from over 1,000 business owners expressing their support for increasing the federal minimum wage: \"[H]igher wages benefit business by increasing consumer purchasing power, reducing costly employee turnover, raising productivity, and improving product quality, customer satisfaction and company reputation\" (8). These statements are consistent with empirical work conducted by U.C. Berkeley economists which revealed that an increase in the minimum wage up to $13 per hour has \"no measurable effect on employment\" (9). It also demonstrated how businesses react to the increase in labor costs. Lynn Thompson of the Seattle Times explains: \"Businesses absorbed the costs through lower turnover, small price increases at restaurants, which have a high concentration of low-wage workers, and higher worker productivity, the researchers found.\" (9) III. Outsourcing? Another canard we often hear about the minimum wage is that it will lead to \"outsourcing.\" Not only is this claim unsound logically, as it insinuates that labor costs are the be-all-end-all and the sole determinant of employment opportunities. If that were the case, why wouldn't businesses relocate to -- I know libertarians are going to cry \"strawman!\" but I promise you, if you look at the data, this is a relevant example -- Somalia? You could pay workers whatever you'd like if there aren't any regulations. Why don't businesses do this? There are a few reasons. First, minimum wage jobs are most often in the restaurant or service sector such as retail -- about 60%, in fact, as Paul Krugman notes (10). Obviously service sector jobs cannot be readily exported, so on this front, the claim falls flat. Literally relocating businesses to X country with lower labor costs would cost businesses even more money than increasing the minimum wage, and would exacerbate the next problem I'm about to point out. The second problem with the outsourcing canard is that one businesses's employees are another's businesses -- or, even that same business's -- customers. Low-wage workers have a higher marginal propensity to consumer than more affluent people, meaning they consume with about 100% of their income. Therefore, any increase in the minimum wage will merely result in those dollars going back into the economy. As people spend more money, the AD curve shifts to the left. Businesses would want to supply more, and now can because their profits have increased, meaning we would see a shift along the AS curve as well as an increase in the demand for labor. This is the reason that AD, not AS, is the key to the economy -- and I am not only saying that because John Maynard Keynes happens to be the economist after which I have modelled my username. Businesses are sitting on literally trillions of dollars in cash right now that they aren't investing. It's intellectually dishonst to insinuate that merely reducing their taxes, deregulating them further, abolishing the minimum wage, etc. would provide an economic boost. They aren't going to increase their supply, and thus hire more workers, if there isn't any demand for their products their selling. That, my conservative friends, is called a glut. Rising inventory costs are literally toxic to businesses, and should be avoided when they can. This acts as a check by ensuring that businesses have an active, vibrant customer base. IIII. Jobs I've already essentially proven this case, but with the few remaining characters I have, I'll address this as well. There have been several meta-studies conducted on this subject, and the conclusion far and wide has been that raising the minimum wage has \"no discernable effect\" on employment (11). Let's go to John Scmitt from the CEPR: \"[T]wo recent meta-studies analyzing the research conducted since the early 1990s concludes that the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. The most likely reason for this outcome is that the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms' overall costs and only modest relative to the wages paid to low-wage workers.\" (11)Even the CBO study that conservatives often cite -- falsely, might I add -- grants that a hike in the minimum wage provides an economic stimulus: \"The increased earnings for low-wage workers resulting from the higher minimum wage would total $31 billion, by CBO\u2019s estimate.\"ConclusionThere isn't much else to say.

            "conclusion": "An increase of the Federal minimum wage would have adverse effects on employment",
            "premise": "Time: For sake of argument, I will concede that time is actually important.It would be interesting to note that the minimum wage for some sub-groups actually makes it harder for them. Teenagers often enter the minimum wage workforce to gain experience. However, if they are not worth the current minimum wage, they will not get hired. That would lead to the employer losing money. Simply put, they never get experience and in their future enter the workforce with slightly higher skills (alive longer, mostly) but experience lower wages overall because they never gained the experience when they were young. Studies further show they become less likely to get hired at all. If the minimum wage lowers the chance of getting hired, training for a job (often included) if hired, as documented in the literature, the skill set and possible future wages substancially decreases the living standard for some and their ability to get hired [1]. To say that increasing the price of labor will not reduce the amount employment is absurd. Sources: My opponent claims my book is not a good source because he cannot read it. However, Neumark and Wascher have been publishing in the literature for years. Their book summarizes their research. The page I was refering to was page 65, section 3.4.3. Their studies found that the minimum wage reduced school enrollment. Teenagers falsely assumed they would recieve higher pay, and dropped out of school to get a job. When factoring this effect, they found \"a statistically significant employment elasticity of -0.22\", or negative 22% [2]. Empirical EvidenceIf my opponents source claims all research which they chose was supporting their opinion, by response is duh. If you cite ThinkProgress and expect them to cite Neumark and Wascher 2007 which found that 85% of the research supports my opinion, then lol. My opponent essentially admits that the research he cited is cherry-picked by ThinkProgress, not even including some literary dissent. My opponent cites a meta-analysis by Lester and Madland, whose whole conclusion relies on the studies Neumark et al. refuted as their \"evidence\" for recent research supporting minimum wage increases. It says that all of the recent research supports his view, not s strawman. Those five studies are complete bogus. Two rely on weak controls less suited to the tasks that studies that show minimum wages harm the economy have [3], one is the meta analysis cited screaming publication bias. Let me explain. Card and Krueger have had their research published in mainstream outlets, which proves no publication bias. Further, for there to be publication bias, there is generally a mechanism. This is an issue where labor unions probably have more influence. In Neumark and Wascher (2008) they document their work near the turn of the century which finds little publication bias to be found [2]. The last one is Dube et al. 2007. They claim that old research fails to control clustering properly, and minimum wage has no effect when this is done. Clustering makes the result less robust, and therefore their studies conclusions are not correct [4]. The studies are weak. Gary Becker does mention these new studies and uses the Neumark rebuttal. He is using academic literature and noting that the studies are flawed. He never makes extraordinary claims that all of the new studies are in near-universal agreement. And the state argument you didnt read the full studies. ALL of the other 5 studies focus on state effects because it is easier to control for those factors. They use data from all the states to get a national sample. The fact Neumark uses state data, like everyone else, is a widely supproted technique.One rebuttal was published 5 months earlier then cons sources [3], and the economist quote was published a month after the formal rebuttal was produced [5]. They fully ignored those studies. ProductivityThe workforce probably gains some productivity because less of the low skilled workers are employed. The decrease in production is due to the increased capital costs to the hiring firm, not the workers decrease. The minimum wage reduces production, not productivity to the worker (which is what I meant). Large changes in raw data are often explained with simple controls. When put in, many industries see a significant drop in productivity and production when the minimum wage is increased, when factors are controlled for [6]. The reason GDP grew is simple. Growing economy regardless of a minimum wage--other factors. Growing population, etc. Even if we assume his argument is relevant, he loses the point.I used the word \"production\" in order to explain the theory in full. My opponent thinks that it was a significant point to the debate, which it wasn't, and claim that is is highly relevant to the debate. NumbersA hypothetical used to explain a point, not be a data point, do not have to be correct. I used them to make my point simple. I really dont know why you want to see a hypothetical which used econometric equasions which are based off of monospy and neoclassical models. I mean I could do that. Or we can accept what I said as a hypothetical, an explanation device, and not an ACTUAL data point. We save character space that way. Large companies are unaffected by minimum wages, as most of their workers require greater skills and are paid hogh wages. So their record profits are often due to other factors. For those who manage to get a job on it they are promoted within one year because they gained the skills needed to get a pay raise [4]. So their wage actually increases if they have a low wage job. If we had no minimum wage, people worth $4 dollars an hour would get training, get experience, and eventually get higher paying jobs. The minimum wage only prevents people from gaining the invaluble life skills of work training because the minimum wage makes them a net-loss for the employer. This is why minimum wages have negative long term effects. Less skilled workers get laid off and hours reduced, lowering their pay [pg 138].Minorities\"The choice to fire those with greater ethnic diversity first, is entirely on them.\" -- R2You said that it is the emokoyers racism or discrimination to lay off those who are minorities first is at fault. Well, you say it in a discrete manner. You say that their decision is odd, and that the minimum wage is not the source of the discrimination, but rather it is the worker. Again, as I explained, this is totally false. African Americans and Latinos happen to be poorer, less skilled, and less educated due to their enviroments. If they fire you for being less skilled and you happen to be Latino, that's not discrimatory. It just so happens to be that minorities are more likely to be less skilled, and therefore more vunerable to minimum wage increases. A lower wage would make it more likely for them to be hired and then skills to be aquired worthy of a higher wage. Minorities are the most affected because of their relative skills and education, not racism of the employer. The minimum wage is not racist per se, but its unintended consequences are. The video talks more about this. ; Specific Examples All the studies are measuring specific examples and find negative effects. I provided an example where the 2009 hike caused a company to lay off 2,000 employees. The 1991 wage hikes and the late 2000s hikes show negative effectsn[7]. My case is full of examples. CONCLUSIONThe strength of the empirical data, the mere amount too, the theoretical predictions which have been proven by the peer reviewed data all support my case. I provided statistics then gave a reason. My opponent has provided minimal data and has not even provided one theoretical reason as to why it would have no effect (or a positive one). The BOP is even, and I have met it far better then my opponent. Vote PRO. http://tny.cz...;",

            "conclusion": "Raise The Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "Alright, so I am going to go through the reasons I believe increasing minimum wage would be beneficial to society.1. As productivity has climbed marginal compensation has rise very slowly with it. As we can see from this graph, in the past few decades we have increased our production capacity by a stunning amount yet hourly compensation has risen very slowly with it and has even stagnated and decreased. Meanwhile, CEO pay has greatly increased only dropping significantly during the 08 crash If productivity increased by this much you would think not only the ceo, but the average worker's pay would go up by similar margins but that is not evident. A rise in minimum wage would help this gap close. 2. Increased aggregate purchasing powerWith an increase in minimum wage those living on minimum wage would have the ability to purchase more. As we can see from this graph, the average purchasing power has gone down significantly and while that has happened we have been unable to fully compensate through an increase in wages. And it is very difficult, to live if at all on a minimum wage at 7.25 an hour.[1]3. It will not increase unemployment.Contrary to popular belief among Austrian economists, raising minimum wage does not increase unemployment. Why? mainly because there are only around 1.3 million people (in the United States) who work for minimum wage.[2] So a slight addition to the cost of labour to a certain group does not significantly shift the aggregate supply curve for the labour market. Here is some evidence for my claim. NELP (National Employment Law Project) conducted a study[3] and found that for the 22 times the federal minimum wage was raised from 1938 to 2010, the majority of the time employment went up and the times it went down can easily be attributed to the natural business cycle.This itself should prove that increasing minimum wage has little effect on unemployment and if anything, brings it down.Here is a piece of modern empirical evidence for my claim. Seattle not too long ago increased their minimum wage to $15 an hour and we can already see that unemployment has actually been low and today it hovers at a measly 4% [4]For these reasons, I believe minimum wage should be increased gradually.I shall await for you to present your reasons and why it should not be raised.sources: http://www.huffingtonpost.com...

            "discussionTitle": "We should raise the minmum wage",
            "conclusion": "We should raise the minmum wage",
            "premise": "Hello. I welcome Adam to this debate. I would like to start off by stating that I do not have to state a specific amount the minimum wage should be raised to, therefore, my evidence can conflict in that regard. I would also like to note that in this topic we are speaking on a federal level; that is, we are assuming this is something the government would pass. In my opponents conclusion, he talks of how it is better to earn five dollars than no dollars. That would be lowering MW (minimum wage), therefore, he is in conflict with himself there. My opponent must maintain that the MW should be kept at the same rate. First, Small businesses say MW has little to NO IMPACT on small businesses. Eight in 10 small-business owners say they hire their new employees at a wage level that exceeds the current minimum wage. Of the 14% of small businesses who do hire employees at the minimum wage, two in three say they do not expect to keep their new employees at that wage for more than a year. One in three of these new minimum wage employees are also hired on only a temporary basis. http://www.gallup.com... And later, Forty-six percent of small-business owners say they believe the minimum wage should be increased while only 34% believe it should remain where it is now. Only 2% believe the minimum wage should be reduced although 14% think it should be eliminated altogether. And more! Eighty-six percent of small-business owners say the minimum wage has no effect on their businesses. Now you may say, \"These are arguments for MW to stay\", but look at the 2nd stat! The majority of small business owners think it should be increased! It is completely logical then, to refute my opponents C2 and C4, as business owners are fine with it. These are gallup polls BTW. Next, the American people want a higher MW. More than two-thirds of Americans say lawmakers should raise the national minimum wage to $10 per hour from its current $7.25, a survey from the Public Religion Research Institute finds. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... So, since we are speaking of the federal government, and the government represents the people, then the government has an obligation to obey the peoples wishes and RAISE THE MW. Also, American people want more money, even if it risks their job. The three most-mentioned financial concerns in the Jan. 7-9, 2011, poll have been at the top of Americans' list for the past two years, with little change in the percentages who name each one. Note the first chart at http://www.gallup.com... (source) Next, an increase of MW was found to have no effect on job loss David Card and Alan B. Krueger, two leading economists, however, believe that small to moderate increases in the minimum wage will not increase unemployment. These two economists observed the impact of minimum wage on employment by researching 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after a minimum wage rise. In April of 1992, New Jersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05, Pennsylvania's minimum wage remaining constant. Under the traditional theory, the increase in New Jersey's minimum wage would predict higher unemployment. The study, on the other hand, suggested that raising the wage floor would in fact open new jobs. Card and Krueger also introduced the idea of wage levels influencing productivity. Higher productivity may offset the increased production costs. The minimum wage increase occurred during a recession in the New Jersey economy. Secondly, New Jersey's economy is greatly influenced by nearby states due to its small size. However, when minimum wage increased, full-time employment increased in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania full-time employment. And more! Economically conservative lawmakers traditionally argue that raising the minimum wage hurts small businesses because they cannot afford to pay higher wages, and therefore are forced to layoff workers, further augmenting poverty. In a study done by the Levy Institute, the vast majority of small business owners interviewed said a raise in minimum wage would not cause them to layoff workers, or decrease the number of new workers they could hire. The Levy Institute interviewed 560 businesses with under 500 workers each, asking them questions about their hiring practices, particularly with regard to a possible increase in the minimum wage. Of those businesses, only 6.2% said a raise in the minimum wage would negatively affect their hiring practices. When the minimum wage was increased in 1997, economists and lawmakers feared there would be significant job losses, but instead it was the best job market in 30 years. This shows the demand for labor is wage inelastic; meaning changes in wages does not affect the amount of labor demanded. From http://wiki.dickinson.edu... And next, the rising inflation calls a need for a higher MW. From the same source as above The Problem with the current Minimum wage is that it has failed to keep up with inflation and rising cost of living. This means that over time the purchasing power of the minimum wage has decrease. The current minimum wage is not longer enough to keep working families from meeting their most basic needs such as cost of housing and food, health care, education and child care. According to Economist Jared Bernstein from the Economic Policy Institute the cost of basic necessities has increase by almost 50% between 1991 and 2007. As a result low income families are stock in poverty and the income gap between the low and high class is continuously increasing. The federal poverty guideline released in 2007 shows that the minimum wage is insufficient. A minimum wage worker that works full time: 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year will only earn about $12,000 annually. This means that at the current minimum wage, a full time worker earns 40% below the poverty guideline. The established federal poverty guideline for a family of three is approximately $17,000 So it can be obviously seen here that we should raise the MW, and there are numerous things about it. Next, to rebut my opponents contentions: C1: Well what have we here? His source also admits that an alternate explanation could simply be the bad economy. And also, this makes no sense, considering the many polls I have provided. The biggest explanation is of course the bad economy. But it's precisely when the economy is down and businesses are slashing costs that raising the minimum wage is so destructive to job creation. Congress began raising the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour in July 2007, and there are now 691,000 fewer teens working. (from his source #2) C2: source was from 1996. Thats before adam was born. The current recession had not hit yet, and so this source is hopelessly outdated. C3: His argument makes no logical sense. All of the high schoolers I know know that if you spend the extra 2 years and finish, that instantly opens up a motley amount of options for you. It simply makes no logical sense C4: Wait\u2026 So high income families spent $86 a YEAR? Are they all starving themselves or something? There is now way that stat makes ANY real sense. To talk on teenagers for a bit: The thing here is that teenagers technically don't need a job, and whenever they finish high school, they are automatically more eligible for jobs. Oh yes, and notice the subtle not bringing up of the General welfare?",

You cite a paper that offers an opinion on the purpose of the Federal Minimum Wage when it was first enacted: \u201cThe purpose of the minimum wage was to stabilize the post-depression economy and protect the workers in the labor force.\u201d There are 2 problems with this. First, the Great Depression was long ago, so this is no longer relevant; your source says that was the purpose, implying that it is not the purpose today. Second, your paper effectively admits that this may not actually have been the true purpose, since it goes on to say that: \u201cOthers have argued that the primary purpose was [something else]\u201d Since you have not offered an alternative explanation for what the primary goals of minimum wage laws are, only what they were, we are left with the same 2 objectives that I listed in the previous round: decreasing unemployment and poverty. You say that minimum wage laws aren't directed at reducing poverty. This is incorrect. In his 2013 State of the Union Address, Obama supported raising the Federal Minimum Wage by arguing that full-time workers shouldn't have to be poor: \u201c[L]et\u2019s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.\u201d The Employment Policies Institute also calls the minimum wage \u201ca program intended to reduce poverty.\u201d (my 4th source from Round 2) You say minimum wage laws don't entitle the unemployed to reaping benefits, but that's kind of a strawman because I never argued that they do. You also say that minimum wage laws \u201cspecifically target\u201d workers to make sure they have the wages required \u201cto live and be in satisfactory health.\u201d First, let me point out that this is basically saying that reducing poverty is a primary goal of minimum wage laws, which contradicts one of your earlier statements. Second, I've already demonstrated that minimum wage laws do an awful job at targeting. If you look back to the previous round, I referenced a study which showed that increases the Federal Minimum Wage from 2007-2009 targeted those who were already well above the poverty threshold! If a primary goal of minimum wages is to protect workers from wages that are below what is \u201crequired to live and be in satisfactory health\u201d, than it is immensly wasteful. This is just another reason to support abolishment. My opponent cited the minimum wage and unemployment rate of San Fracisco, California. Since he didn't base any argument on these statistics, I'm still wondering why he posted them... \u201cHistorically, minimum wage has been increased in the United States on multiple occasions. Each time, people argued that raising it would be catastrophic - however, decades later, the United States still has the largest GDP in the world.\u201d This appears to be another strawman. I never argued that minimum wage laws are \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d nor that they must be to warrant their abolishment. Neither did I argue that increasing the minimum wage requirement would drop the USA down a spot on the GDP leaderboard. What I said was a law should be abolished if merely fails to meet it's primary objectives. You agreed with me: \u201cIt is, indeed, quite true that a law should be abolished if it doesn't accomplish, or works against its primary objective.\u201d Effects On Prices You spent a lot of your time arguing that increasing the minimum wage wouldn't dramatically affect prices. I'm just going to leave those bits alone for now, since my burden of proof doesn't depend on it. Further Rebuttals You said that \u201craising minimum wage would[...] bring many already-employed workers out of poverty.\u201d The study from my 4th source in Round 2 addresses this: \u201cWhile an increase in the minimum wage will lift the families of some low-skilled workers who remain employed out of poverty, other low-skilled workers will lose their jobs or have their hours significantly cut, dropping their families into poverty.\u201d In other words, there is no net reduction in poverty nor unemployment; in fact, their may be a net increase. \u201cA low minimum wage effectively discourages workers to work, so even if many corporate jobs were to open by the abolition of such laws, many people would refuse to take them out of feelings of entitlement to a living wage.\u201d Those are incorrect assumptions. Increasing the minimum wage raises the cost of labor at about the same rate. This means that any unemployment due to unsatisfaction with the minimum wage will remain the same regardless of how many times you increase the minimum wage. Back to you, Con.",

            "premise": "It appears that my opponent offered new arguments in the last round. I suppose I will rebut those as well, since I was expecting him to give only a rebuttal. I will not offer new arguments or defend my own. ========== \u201cVery few workers even work the minimum wage\u2026\u201d Both pew research and the government bureau conclude that about 4.7% of all hourly-waged workers work at or below minimum wage as of 2012 [1][2]. That translates to about 3.6 million people. And this does NOT include the appreciable number of states and districts that have a minimum wage of above the federal minimum. Clearly, that\u2019s not \u201cvery few\u201d people. In addition, this number has been decreasing significantly since 1979, when 13.4% of hourly workers worked at or below minimum wage, despite increasing minimum lines. My opponent went on to base many of his later assertions on this statement. \u201cPeople have a choice of w[h]ere to work, if they want a very low paying job, it[\u2019]s because they feel it[\u2019]s the best choice\u201d The purpose of minimum wage is so that workers can survive their wages at a reasonable degree of health; in general, earning significantly below minimum wage is supposed to make a worker a very poor person and barely able or unable to survive. Indeed, some times working for inhumane wages and not working for any wages are the two evils that workers are stuck between; minimum wage is meant to alleviate one of those. Sometimes, the choice simply isn\u2019t there, because the companies DO exploit people. \u201cCompetition is better than minimum wage.\u201d [Paraphrase] I have shown this to not be true. Companies do and will exploit workers if there are no regulations. The assertion that \u201cfree market does fine\u201d when it comes to protecting workers can\u2019t be further from the truth. The proof is in Industrial Britain, where workers were regularly exploited until the government stepped in with the Factory Acts, child labor laws [3], regulations, and minimum wage. I have also shown why having a broad worker base that is willing to spend money is good for the economy. The assertion that \u201cBu[s]inesses will try to offer the best wages possible to compete for workers\u201d is ludicrous; worker competition only becomes an issue when a certain skill set is in low supply. This virtually never happens at skills that are worthy of minimum wage. \u201cAs for worker exploitation, that means that countries with no minimum wages will have higher poverty rates.\u201d No. it means that countries without minimum wages will have lower worker wages. Cherry picking states that suit your case doesn\u2019t work. Failing to look outside of the U.S. also doesn\u2019t make it work. The fact that the minimum wage is below the poverty line [4] in the U.S. doesn\u2019t help you either, since this means people in poverty are going to remain in poverty even when their wages are boosted. To make that EVEN worse, your examples of poverty rates are BLATANTLY FALSE; the one thing debaters hate more than arguments from ignorance is inherently FALSE statements; seriously. California\u2019s poverty rate is 13.2%, New Mexico 17.9% [5], and San Francisco 15.2% [6]. I don\u2019t know where you got your news form, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s some right-wing liar. Yes, my liberal colors are showing because I can\u2019t stand it when people lie like this. Oh, and Germany does have pseudo-minimum wage laws [7]. Not only that, they legalize and enforce collective bargaining and have a vague law that bans \u201cimmorally\u201d low payments [8]. \u201cAny one in us who produces less 7.25 an hour is unhireable.\u201d Conceded. However I have shown that this has minimal impact, and encourages people to be more productive. ========== Conclusion: I have shown that: 1. Minimum wage prevents worker exploitation. 2. Encourages progressive action. 3. Has an unappreciable impact on unemployment that is far balanced out by its other benefits. My opponent has: 1. Failed to show that minimum wage causes poverty. 2. Failed to show that companies will treat workers humanely without minimum wage. 3. Lied. Vote PRO. ========== I\u2019d like to add that the current minimum wage laws are far from perfect. Something more along the lines of productivity, more exemptions for people such as part-time college students willing to work for less than minimum wage, or inequality controls like they have in Germany would be more ideal. I believe that the current minimum wage in the U.S. does not need raising; in fact I think lowering it to about $6 per hour would be more sensible, since $6 per hour would still be about the recent historical average minimum wage adjusted for inflation. $15 per hour is ridiculous.

            "discussionTitle": "Minimum Wage Laws Harm the Poor",
            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage Laws Harm the Poor",
            "premise": "PRO: It seems to me that my opponent is still confusing the issue. The question of whether an increase in the minimum wage would help the poor is very different from the question of whether or not the poor would be better off if there were no minimum wage in the first place. My opponent appears to be arguing an issue that is not the topic of this debate.Getting rid of minimum wage laws, is the same as reducing the minimum wage from $7.25/hr to $0/hr. My opponent concedes that an increase in the minimum wage could help the poor when he writes:PRO: My opponent greatly exaggerates the benefits, but essentially, he is correct that an increase in the minimum could help the poor. It seems logical that, if an increase of the minimum wage benefits the poor, then a decrease in the minimum wage will harm the poor. This implies that the minimum wage laws that set the minimum wage at $7.25 rather than $0 do NOT harm the poor. I am not aware of any studies that are done on repealing the minimum wage laws in the USA. And my opponent has not given us any calculations about what would happen if the minimum wage laws were abolished. The best data we have is from the CBO. My opponent agrees with this when he writes:PRO: The CBO report is NOT reliable, it is just the best source we have. Even though my opponent thinks that the CBO report is not reliable, it is the most reliable source we have. And the CBO report projects a decrease in the number of people in poverty when the minimum wage is raised.---PRO: Aside from this false premise though, my opponent\"s numbers are seriously flawed. First, his math is wrong, because he calculates the increase in income before accounting for a decrease in employment. Even using my opponent\"s numbers, the total gain should come out to $25 million per hour, not $26 million. (Because 500,000 should be subtracted from 15.5 million before it is multiplied by two. 15.5-.5= 15 15*2=30 30-5=25) Also, the $30 million number does not account for inflation. According to studies I have cited previously, every 10% increase in the minimum wage leads to an approximately 4% increase in price level. Increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour is a $2.85 or 39.3% increase which will lead to a roughly 15.7% increase in price level. This means that the real benefit to poor workers, even using my opponent\"s numbers is only $21.075 million per hour.My opponent is nitpicking here. I wrote \"Of course this is just a rough calculation,...\" I was just using ball-park figures to make a point: The increase of income for poor family because of the increase of the minimum wage is much larger than the decrease in income from decreased unemployment. The 500,000 people who lose a job earning $10 or less, will still earn at least $2/hr after they lose their job because of government assistance. So going from $10 to $2 is the same as increasing their salary with $2 and then cutting $10. It is fair enough to include inflation in the calculations. My opponent claims that a 10% increase in the minimum wage will lead to a 4% inflation, and he cites [1] for this. An earlier and free version of [1] is [2]. On page 29 the author writes:\"Despite the different methodologies, data periods and data sources, most studies reviewed above found that a 10% US minimum wage increase raises food prices by no more than 4% and overall prices by no more than 0.4%.\"So the overall inflation is 0.4%, not 4%. If we do a rough calculation, we may neglect such a small inflation.My opponent also got the math wrong. If a 10% increase in minimum wage leads to a 4% inflation, then two increases of 10% will lead to 2 increases of 4% in inflation. So if the minimum wage is multiplied by a factor 1.1^n then the minimum wage is multiplied by 1.04^n. If the minimum wage is increased by 39.3%, then the minimum wage increases by a factor 1.393. Solving 1.1^n=1.393 yields n=log(1.393)/log(1.1)= 3.4777. Then prices are increased by a factor 1.04^3.4777=1.1461.This means, that we have a 14.61% inflation, not 15.7% as my opponent claims. But since the inflation is really only 0.4%if the minimum wage is increased to 10%, the actual inflation after raising the minimum wage to $10.10 is 1.4%.(1.004^3.4777=1.014).PRO: But the real problem with my opponent\"s argument is not mathematical errors, but that his numbers are wrong. My opponent says \"Let's assume that the people with the 10% lowest wages will have their wages increased by $2/hr on average.\" The problem is that there is no reason to make this assumption. Barely more than 1% of workers earn the federal minimum wage. There is no evidence to suggest that the number of workers earning close to the minimum wage would bring the total number anywhere near 10%. The CBO report is NOT reliable, it is just the best source we have. While the CBO report does estimate that approximately 10.7% of workers work for less than $10.10 per hour, it fails to account for raises that would have occurred if the minimum wage had not been raised. (The CBO report actually acknowledges this flaw in a note on page 24) This is a very significant flaw to the CBO\"s estimates, as TWO THIRDS OF MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS RECEIVE A WAGE WITHIN ONE YEAR. [1] (This is because most minimum wage jobs are learning wage positions)I could not find that note on page 24. But in any case, if the minimum wage would be increased, people earning minimum wage still get wage increases. A person with some experience always will earn slightly more than someone who just entered the job. If the minimum wage is increased, it will also affect the people who earn a wage that is close to the minimum.Poverty in the USAPRO: The subject of poverty rates, that my opponent references are misleading. This is because \"poverty\" in the United States is defined by an arbitrarily chosen \"poverty line\", which includes many people who are not very poor. 80% of people below this poverty line have air conditioning. The average \"poor\" person in the United States has more living space than the average European. Not the average poor European, the AVERAGE European. The point is that there is a large range in wealth among the people described as \"poor\". [2] Minimum wage laws have the effect of aiding the wealthier (higher skilled) poor, but hurting the truly poor, who have very few marketable skills.Sure, Americans have more living space than in Europe because it is less densely populated than Europe. That does not mean that the Americans with the lowest wages are better of than their European counterparts. More important than space is access to health care. Generally, poor people in Europe have better access to health care than poor people in the USA.In fact, using absolute measures, there is more poverty in the USA than many western European countries.Anyway, this is not so relevant for our debate. If we are discussing poor people in the USA, we will go by the commonly used standard of poverty in the USA. I do not think that this is misleading at all. (Obviously, when we are talking about poor people in the USA we do not mean people dying of starvation. However, there are people in the USA with food insecurity though.)CONCLUSIONA decrease in the minimum wage will have the following effects:1. wages will go down for poor people (with jobs)2. the unemployment will decrease for poor peopleHowever, the overall effect is that the total income for poor people will increase on average, becausethe increase in employment cannot make up for the loss in wages. In particular, getting rid of minimum wage(reducing the minimum wage to $0/hr) will HARM the poor.This conclusion is based on simple calculations, and is confirmed by the CBO report. [3]As I have shown, more refined calculations will not change this conclusion. [1] http://ideas.repec.org...;[2] http://www.le.ac.uk...[3]http://cbo.gov...",

            "conclusion": "The U.S should abolish the Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "Minimum Wages and Employment: Theory Neoclassical Model [1]: The neoclassical model, which is the model taught in most textbooks, is very straightforward. The model assumes labor and product markets are competitive, there is only one type of labor, output is produced with labor and capital, and workers are covered by the minimum wage. According to the model, setting the minimum wage above the equilibrium wage raises a firm\u2019s marginal cost of production, and leads to two effects. First, the price of output rises and thus demand falls, leading to a decline in production (scale effect). Second, higher wages cause firms to substitute capital for labor (substitution effect). As a result, employment declines. Thus, setting a minimum wage prices out workers who do not produce a certain amount per hour. A worker worth $5 an hour will have a hard time finding work at $7, for example. The Keynesian Model [2]: Despite Keynesianism\u2019s association with the left, most Keynesian economists believe minimum wages produce unemployment. Keynesian models say prices are sticky, and sticky prices for labor cause unemployment. During a recession, prices do not fall, and it is difficult for the market to adjust. In a classical perspective, prices adjust rapidly, turning downward and, over time, going back up with full employment quickly restored. But, as prices are sticky, this adjustment does not occur rapidly in a Keynesian model; this is why fiscal and monetary stimulus are so important during downturns. A minimum wage worsens this: prices for labor cannot fall below a certain point, making a recovery much more difficult. This leads to more unemployment. Monopsony Model [3]: The monopsony model is the only model that claims minimum wages do not reduce unemployment. In this model, a business is the single employer and thus faces a downward sloping supply curve. For this reason, a monopsonist must provide higher wages than would occur in a competitive marketplace. Minimum wage hikes, therefore, have no effect on employment\u2014and, in some cases, increase employment. This model, however, is generally \u201cnot viewed by most economists as a sensible model of low-wage labor markets, which in most industries and geographic areas consist of numerous small firms.\u201d[3] There are exceptions, of course, but this theory is not accepted. Therefore, on a theoretical level, we can infer that minimum wages lead to higher levels of unemployment than there otherwise would be. Empirical Evidence The Historical Consensus: Studies dating before the 1980s almost unanimously concluded that minimum wages reduced employment. While a few economists had dissenting theories, the evidence was fairly lopsided. The old research culminated in the Brown, Cohen, and Gilroy review of 1982. The scholars surveyed hundreds of studies on the topic, and concluded that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would lead to a 1-3% decrease in employment for low-skilled workers [4]. The study was seen as to rigorous, so expansive, that little research was published on minimum wages for the next decade. New Minimum Wage Research: The first wave of new minimum wage research arrived in 1992, ten years after the Brown et al. review, in a symposium of the Industrial Labor and Labor Relations Review, a prestigious economic journal. This is where the famous (or infamous) Card, Krueger, and Katz studies were published. These studies challenged the Brown consensus, and argued minimum wage hikes had little effect on employment. A flurry of new research came forth, either backing or opposing the Card et al. research. By the end of the decade, most researchers had again come back to the Brown consensus, and believed minimum wages reduced employment. This section of research culminated in the review by David Neumark, of UC Irvine, and William Wascher, a Federal Reserve economist. They reviewed hundreds of studies from the 1990s to 2006, and confirmed the Brown report: a ten percent increase in the minimum wage leads to a 1-3% decrease in employment [5]. Voting with their feet The way people \u201cvote with their feet\u201d\u2014that is, how people migrate from one area to another\u2014is one of the most accurate ways of gauging how certain policies affect certain groups. The hordes of East Germans who attempted to enter West Germany in the aftermath of World War II suggest the living and political conditions were better in the free West than in the repressed East. The hundreds of Chinese citizens who fled to Hong Kong, one of the freest economies in the world, during the Cold War also suggests the conditions in Hong Kong were superior to those in Communist China. The fact no Western nation had to set up walls to keep people in suggests a lot. In the same way, we can determine the effect minimum wage laws have on low-skilled workers by seeing if low-wage workers flee higher minimum wages. Research by economist Joan Monras, who works with the Paris Institute of Political Studies, answers the question. She believes, theoretically, if minimum wages harmed low-skilled workers, these type of workers would flee to jurisdictions where minimum wages were lower or nonexistent. She empirically tests her theory. To do this, she looked at state minimum wages between 1985 to 2012. Her models showed a few predictable results: 1) Those who kept their jobs earned more. 2) Workers with few skills had an easy time finding full-time employment before minimum wage increases. After minimum wage hikes, the job search became much more difficult. 3) High wage workers, who would not be affected by minimum wages, were used as a control group\u2014evidence also bore out the conclusion that they were not affected. Monras also found that minimum wages, while they increased wages, reduced employment\u2014and employment fell more than wages rose. A one percent increase in wages due to minimum wage hikes led to a 1.2% reduction in full-time employment. Based on this evidence, the model predicted that low-wage workers would flee areas with high minimum wages\u2014and they did. Monras found that, \u201cA 1 percent reduction in the share of employed low-skilled workers [following minimum wage increases] reduces the share of low-skilled population by between .5 and .8 percent. \u2026 workers for whom the [minimum wage] policy was designed leave the states where the policy is implemented.\u201d[6] Harms of unemployment As I have written in other publications, minimum wages price \u201cyoung workers out of the market and prevents them from getting valuable work experience.\u201d Lowering, or fully abolishing the minimum wage, would allow unskilled workers to \u201center the workforce and learn important skills.\u201d For teenagers, who are the most affected by minimum wage laws, abolishing the minimum would \u201cincrease their future wages and reduce their idleness.\u201d[7] As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, \u201cIf the job market were to be represented by a ladder where more experienced and skilled workers climb to the top, a minimum-wage hike would saw off the bottom rungs \u2013 unskilled workers wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to jump on!\u201d[8] Minimum wages, by pricing workers out of the market, make workers worse off because the longer people are idle, the fewer skills they have. Minimum wages undoubtedly harm workers in the long-term. Not only that, but unemployment in general, outside of skill acquisition, causes larges amount of financial and emotional distress. Long-term unemployment leads to not only less income, but also worse health. Children in homes with unemployed parents have lower academic achievement.[9] A Gallup survey found that, \u201cunemployed Americans are more than twice as likely as those with full-time jobs to say they currently have or are being treated for depression\u201412.4 percent vs. 5.6 percent, respectively.\u201d[10] We must remember those who are unemployed due to minimum wage laws are not just statistics. They are living people with dreams, needs, and feelings\u2014just like us. The unemployment caused by minimum wages reduces their future income, is deleterious to their mental health, and is deleterious to their children, who are innocent bystanders in all of this. With this in mind, I call for an end to the immoral, destructive, and disgusting minimum wage law. 1. Neumark, David and William L. Wascher, Minimum Wages, 39. 2. http://www.forbes.com... 3.

            "conclusion": "March Beginners' Tournament: The USFG should significantly raise the federal minimum wage",
            "premise": "Argument 1: Increases to unemploymentCon states that raising the minimum wage would lead to job loss, arguing that businesses will have to respond to new costs posed by higher wages with cutting jobs. A reasonable concern, and seemingly valid as well. However, it falls apart on several levels upon further examination: - To begin with, there are multiple ways in which raising the minimum wage alows for business to save money. A study on the Harvard Business Review by MIT Professor Zeynep Ton [6] found that higher wages boost productivity and decrease employee turnover rate. Another study found a reduction in employee turnover rate within nine months of a state-wide minimum wage hike [7]. - Additionally - as a National Employment Law Project analysis [5] on Census Bureau data found - most low wage employees work for large companies, which can certainly afford the costs of higher wages.Con supports his argument with a report from the Congressional Budget Office, which found that raising the minimum wage would lead to some unemployment. What he neglected to mention, was that the very same report found that a minimum wage hike would result in massive econmic benefits, which outweigh potential costs. The projected effect on employment was essentially insignificant: a mere 0.3% reduction [1].I did say \"projected\" for a reason; the CBO's estimates on the unemployment increase shouldn't be taken to be conclusive. Economist Michael Reich wrote an analysis at ThinkProgress[2], noting that:\"The method used by the CBO to estimate job loss is never clearly explained. According to the Appendix, the figure appears to come almost entirely from its \u201csynthesis\u201d of the research literature \u2014 which it concludes implies an elasticity of teen employment of -0.075 percent. This estimate is a bit below the low end of estimates in papers by Neumark and Wascher or Sabia and Burkhauser, but higher than those in various papers by Dube, Reich, and others. No details are provided concerning how the CBO arrived at this number, except that it discounts some older studies slightly because of publication bias.\"\"Some of the studies that the CBO relied on are also problematic. As is explained in detail in a 2013 paper by Allegretto et. al that the CBO cites, the Neumark and Wascher paper and other studies that find negative employment effects suffer from methodological flaws that bias their estimates.\" Additionally, Con claims historical wage hikes have increased unemployment. He argues that with the introduction of the minimum went several thousand jobs, which is true. However, it suffices to say, comparing the introduction of the minimum wage to an increment makes for a false analogy. Particularly when empirical data does not support his conclusions.He later attributes job losses in Puerto Rico to the minimum wage hike implimented shortly prior. However, this is a misattrubation of the cause. As an analysis demonstrated, much of Puerto Rico's job losses had absolutely nothing to do with the minimum wage increment [3].Ultimatly, Con's case falls apart at an empirical level. Multiple studies have found minimal to no negative impact on employment prospects as a result of minimum wage hikes:- A 2013 report which analyzed the past 2 decades on minimum wage research found that minimum wage increases had next to no negative effects on employment [4].- A 2011 study found that raising the minimum wage did nothing to reduce employment rates, and boosted average income levels. Additionally, it reviewed and criticized past bodies of research that attributed increases unemployment to a higher minimum wage [8]- A 2010 study compared employment levels accross neighboring counties with differing minimal wages from 1990 to 2006, and found that higher minimum wages had no negative effects on employment. [9]Argument 2: Ineffective at decreasing povertyCon argues that, since a minority of living poverty are unemployed, they will not benefit from a minimum wage hike, which is true. However, in addition to repeating the unemployment argument (which was addressed above), he states that the minimum wage will be ineffective at combating poverty.Nonetheless, multiple studies show that raising the minimum wage does, in fact, do exactly that.For just one example, the very CBO report which Con cited in his first argument found that an increment to $10.10 would directly benefit over 16 million families [11]. Additionally, these benefits would raise millions from below the poverty line. Even if we use the report's likely flawed estimate for unemployment, can it really be said that half a million recuperable jobs are more valuable than the livelihoods of several million people?Other studies and analyses have documented the counter-poverty effects of raising the minimum wage [10].ConclusionRaising the minimum wage would not result in significant job losses (if any at all), and it would be effective at decreasing poverty. Even assuming that minimum wage hikes would kill jobs, Con would have to demonstrate that the costs would offset the benefits for his case to stand.Sources:[1] https://www.cbo.gov...[2] http://thinkprogress.org...[3] http://thinkprogress.org...[4] http://cepr.net...[5] http://www.nelp.org...[6] https://hbr.org...[7] http://www.irle.berkeley.edu...[8] http://www.irle.berkeley.edu...[9] http://www.irle.berkeley.edu...[10] https://www.washingtonpost.com...[11] https://www.whitehouse.gov...",

            "premise": "My opponent opens this round by saying that a time frame is a \"red herring\". That position could not be more incorrect. If we aren't allowed to take long-term benefit into account, the entire debate has no merit because no effect is either infinite or instantaneous. I could just as easily say that a minimum wage increase has no effect on employment the day it is signed, and therefore has no impact. The word that is important here is \"Overall\", as it was used both in PRO's initial argument and very much factored into my response. My opponent then goes on to make the extraordinary claim that even \"if the minimum wage is raised ten percent, it temporarily stunts future growth anyway.\" So let me get this straight: Long term benefits to employment caused by a higher standard of living (driven by higher minimum wage) don't count because we aren't allowed to take the long term as having any relevance... yet future growth is \"stunted.\" (A position my opponent does not back up with any sort of explanation.) To summarize, PRO would have you acknowledge future harms that he does not justify in any way, yet ignores future benefits because they're \"a red herring\". Additionally, my opponent's source on this matter is a book, in which he supplies no reference or page number. In future rounds I will in good faith trust my opponent about what books he selects say, but he should at least indicate exactly what that is. (Yes, he links to it later, but again, without knowing what section or quote he finds relevant to his point, it's rather difficult to use here) Rebuttal 1: My Source To say that my source claimed \"All\" recent research was breaking the same way is a Straw man argument. The source I site is clearly only referring to all the studies it was choosing to use as examples, NOT all research being done. His entire argument is predicated upon this slight, which is either a serious confusion on his part, OR a deliberate and misleading statement to ignore what the studies themselves say. But that really isn't surprising. When I read through Neumark (who seems to be the ONLY source my opponent cites in relation to the first half of his arguments...even his use of Gary Becker is only what Gary Becker says about Neumark's writing) I notice that Neumark himself seems to largely address examples grounded in state-level minimum wage. As PRO seeks to assess the effects of federal minimum wage, I find this discrepancy to be troubling at best. Finally, Neumark is clearly rebutting two very specific studies, which are not the ones I cited in my sources. Even if he were refuting these, it's unrealistic to expect a study to somehow address a rebuttal that was made in response to the study itself. (PRO:These new studies themselves are weak and fail to control for the factors they wish to control for. The information cited here is totally misinformed about the academic rebuttal to the studies cited.) Studies are not \"misinformed\" simply because they occur in the past. That's just how linear time works. Rebuttal 2: Productivity My opponent chastises me for being the one to bring productivity up, yet it is he who mentioned productivity in his opening argument, saying that the impact higher minimum wages have on productivity is a negative one. I neatly refute this, illustrating perfectly how this could not be. It is irrelevant to HIS argument, not mine. For clarity: \"First, the price of the output (or workers) rises, and therefore the demand for new workers falls. This leads to a reduction in ---->production<----- and hiring, which then leads to decreased employment.\" These are my opponent's words. He is obliged to devour them now. Rebuttal 3: Numbers I understood that your numbers were hypothetical, obviously, but my point was that they were not an accurate example. By accurate I don't mean specific to exact real-world numbers, but rather that the scale of them was way off. When we're talking about arguments of minimum wages, we aren't talking about the difference of a 10 and 20 dollar worker, we're talking about the difference between a 35-cent worker and a 7 dollar one. This is important because it's a much clearer wrong in the latter case, the former case serves to insinuate a certain greed on the part of workers who are \"not worth that much\". But I digress. Another great mendacity to the examples you give is that they exist both in a vacuum. Sometimes, minimum wage is say, 15% below the poverty line relative to inflation and the costs of consumer goods. But at the same time, in that economy, profits may be at historic highs, giving companies more wiggle-room on whether or not they choose to let people go in response to having to pay more. On the other hand, if times are tight, and minimum wage is actually enough to put workers at say, 20% ABOVE the poverty line, and profits are already low, it is a virtual certainty that they might be let go in the wake of an increase. While it arguable that the Federal Minimum Wages going up might be a catalyst in the latter situation, it is clearly the greater economic environment which has the far greater impact. A catalyst and a cause are not the same thing, though it is easy to confuse the two. Rebuttal 5: Minorities Again, a straw man argument. I did not say nor imply you suggested that the minimum wage is racist. I said that employers who are already doing a poor job of employing unskilled labor from minority populations, and then, clearly, choosing to fire those individuals first when an excuse (not a cause mind you, an excuse) like a heightened minimum wage comes around ARE. And while I know it is not what you are saying, I would add that I find the notion that employers can simply hold minority population's jobs hostage to decry changes in the law they don't like disgusting. Conclusion: The largest point I have made, whether or not the overall impact of increased minimum wage is good for employment, has gone largely un-addressed. While my opponent characterizes this argument as being a red herring, he does nothing to indicate just what the long-term harms of minimum-wage hikes are, nor what their impact is in the long term. I would ask that rather than simply citing the same un-detailed study over and over again, PRO should cite a specific federal minimum wage increase, and then track what its impacts have been through the years or decades he deems relevant. I would submit that any attempt to do so will not end well for PRO. Until they do, my argument stands.",

            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage Laws Harm the Poor",
            "premise": "It seems to me that my opponent is still confusing the issue. The question of whether an increase in the minimum wage would help the poor is very different from the question of whether or not the poor would be better off if there were no minimum wage in the first place. My opponent appears to be arguing an issue that is not the topic of this debate. Aside from this false premise though, my opponent\"s numbers are seriously flawed. First, his math is wrong, because he calculates the increase in income before accounting for a decrease in employment. Even using my opponent\"s numbers, the total gain should come out to $25 million per hour, not $26 million. (Because 500,000 should be subtracted from 15.5 million before it is multiplied by two. 15.5-.5= 15 15*2=30 30-5=25) Also, the $30 million number does not account for inflation. According to studies I have cited previously, every 10% increase in the minimum wage leads to an approximately 4% increase in price level. Increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour is a $2.85 or 39.3% increase which will lead to a roughly 15.7% increase in price level. This means that the real benefit to poor workers, even using my opponent\"s numbers is only $21.075 million per hour. But the real problem with my opponent\"s argument is not mathematical errors, but that his numbers are wrong. My opponent says \"Let's assume that the people with the 10% lowest wages will have their wages increased by $2/hr on average.\" The problem is that there is no reason to make this assumption. Barely more than 1% of workers earn the federal minimum wage. There is no evidence to suggest that the number of workers earning close to the minimum wage would bring the total number anywhere near 10%. The CBO report is NOT reliable, it is just the best source we have. While the CBO report does estimate that approximately 10.7% of workers work for less than $10.10 per hour, it fails to account for raises that would have occurred if the minimum wage had not been raised. (The CBO report actually acknowledges this flaw in a note on page 24) This is a very significant flaw to the CBO\"s estimates, as TWO THIRDS OF MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS RECEIVE A WAGE WITHIN ONE YEAR. [1] (This is because most minimum wage jobs are learning wage positions) The subject of poverty rates, that my opponent references are misleading. This is because \"poverty\" in the United States is defined by an arbitrarily chosen \"poverty line\", which includes many people who are not very poor. 80% of people below this poverty line have air conditioning. The average \"poor\" person in the United States has more living space than the average European. Not the average poor European, the AVERAGE European. The point is that there is a large range in wealth among the people described as \"poor\". [2] Minimum wage laws have the effect of aiding the wealthier (higher skilled) poor, but hurting the truly poor, who have very few marketable skills. Rebuttals Breaking the limbs of poor people should not be construed as charitable, even if they happen to receive insurance money as a result of it. Similarly, raising the minimum wage should not be construed as a boon to the poor, even if it results in more welfare benefits for some people. If the goal is to increase welfare payments, welfare should be increased, not the minimum wage. Conclusion My opponent greatly exaggerates the benefits, but essentially, he is correct that an increase in the minimum could help the poor. However, this is irrelevant to the question of whether having a minimum wage law in the first place is beneficial to the poor. Due to increases in unemployment and price level, minimum wage laws harm the poor. Small increases are different because when minimum wage laws are in place, they create a malformed labor system.

            "conclusion": "Minimum Wage Should Increase From $7.25/hr to $10.10/hr",
            "premise": "My position for this debate is that minimum wage should not increase. Currently, minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. I believe that it is a terrible idea that would prove to be no benefit to America or her people. First off, this is a sustainable salary. For a 40-hour week, that is about $1,250 a month, before taxes. This is obviously enough to survive with. If you do the math, housing, bills, food, and other necessities can be handled with $1,250/month. Now I will state that life on minimum wage is difficult, but it is possible. Second, (I am aware that this will draw some offense.) minimum wage paying jobs usually do not require much skill. I know this simply because I used to work at minim wage. In most cases, there is not much prior education/training needed for most minimum wage jobs. Since the labor is elementary, (once again, in MOST cases, not all. I understand that some off the jobs are labor intensive and difficult) the workers do not necessarily deserve more than $7.25/hr. The easier the job, the smaller the pay. It is that simple. Thirdly, and most importantly, a raise in minimum wage would severely damage the economy. If minimum wage was to increase by $2.85, then the value of the dollar would decrease substantially. Inflation would occur. The economy would be a wreck, money's worth would deteriorate, and we would be back to square one: wanted a raise in minimum wage. Every time there is an increase in minimum wage, the cost of living increases. This would continue in a never ending cycle of raising the salary of blue-collar workers. Yes, an increase in minimum wage looks like a great idea on paper, when you look at the reality of it, there are essentially no long term benefits from it. I do not support the raise in minimum wage. This is the end of my one, and only, argument of this debate.",

            "premise": "No, I did not miss your points. Your argument is basically that lowering the minimum wage decreases unemployment. However, it is truly based on an assumption that a business will create new jobs or more jobs all becasue they can pay employees less and their profits will remain the same. History demonstrates just the opposite. Go back to the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980's. U.S. Steel received relief on corporate tax on profits only to not reinvest in their core business that produced the profits, steelmaking, but to buy marathon Oil. The tax cut savings went to buy a more profitable company for the shareholders, but saw increased layoffs and plant closings for the core business of US Steel.So, trusting a business to protect a workers capability to earn is not the American way. There has to be a set minimum wage to ensure an employee has liveable income. Decreasing it will push individuals off the non farm payroll numbers, and decreases tax collection capability of local, state and federal income tax revenue. As for your theory on competition, that is product focused, not employee focused. Yes, competion is good for producing quality items and encouraging investment in innovation, technology and the advancenent of goods and services. It is good for providing consumers alternatives to monopolistic practices and effects. It has nothing to do with whether a liveable wage should be set at at minimum level to ensure non exploitation of workers.Let's address some of your other points:\"wages continue to go down even as unemployment improves:. Not true, let's look at recent trends. The spike in unemployment since 2008 has not seen a decline in wages even as more people do not get back on the employmnet rolls. That is all I am going to say for this round. I only had 10 minutes to respond, so I am sorry that I didn't answer everything. Thanks!",

            "conclusion": "Raising Minimum Wage Would Decrease USFG Spending",
            "premise": "Thanks for the response. I (Codename_x, Con) will first begin with a few rebuttals for Con's case, then give some of my own arguments.Rebuttal A : \"Burden of Prove\"Con has stated that I have not upheld the burden of proof. Con has also stated that the resolution is \"How does minimum wage impact poverty.\" Quite obviously, con has not read my resolution, it being, \"If the United States Government increased minimum wage, the total federal spending would decrease.\" The impact of minimum wage on poverty is not the same as the impact of minimum wage on government spending. I have supported the burden of proof.As a result, many of Con's arguments do not help to disprove the resolution, \"If the United States Government increased minimum wage, the total federal spending would decrease,\" but instead support Con's, \"How does Minimum Wage impact poverty.\"Rebuttal B: \"Demographics of Minimum Wage\"\"Only 2% of workers in the US is on Minimum Wage.\" ~ConJust five states in the United States do not have their own minimum wage; these states being Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee (1). These states only have to comply with the federal minimum wage, the remaining 45 states, have their own minimum wage, all higher than the federal one (2). So, only workers from these five states are able to receive federal minimum wage, without it being unlawful. This source only counts people earning exactly minimum wage, it does not count people earning only a few cents above it. These people earning only a few cents above minimum wage would still be impacted with a realalistic minimum wage change (3).Most of Con's argument (Demographics of Minimum Wage) is explaining how many minimum wage earners are not below the \"poverty line\". However, this fails to disprove the resolution, as none of this explains how minimum wage would not decrease USFG spending.Rebuttal C: \"Effects of Minimum Wage\"\"However, a number of studies claim they increase disemployment, leading to more unemployment costs, welfare, and food stamps.\" ~ConThere have been 19 minimum wage amendments since 1961 (4). Each of these dates I will give you, the minimum wage was increased: in 1964, 1965, 1967, 1976, 1996, and 1997 unemployment went down the year after the minimum wage increase. In 1961, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1975, 1976, 1981, 1991, 1996, 1997, and 2009, unemployment decreased over a period of 4 years (4)(5). So in 11 out of the 19 amendments to increase minimum wage, there was actually an employment increase, further decreasing the amount of money spent on welfare and foodstamps. Increased minimum wage does not decrease employment.Rebuttal D: \"Less USFG Income = More Debt\"Raising the minimum wage would in fact not hurt the productivity of companies. About 66% of low-wage earners are employed by large corporations (9). The National Employment Law Project produced a paper that proved, there would be no significant decline in the productivity, or hiring of companies employing low-wage workers if the minimum wage was to be increased (9). \"Increasing the US Debt by just $50 bn a year\" ~ConThis is not sourced, and there is no data to back up this claim. The National Employment Law Project's, Big Businesses, Corporate Profits, and the Minimum Wage disproves this theory. Argument A: Social Security, Unemployment & Labor *Copy and pasted from first argument:There is $36,614,800,000 of US government money going to WORKING people who receive food stamps, and $73,864,000,000 of USFG money goes to WORKING welfare recipients. So raising the minimum wage to a \"living wage\" could save the USFG up to $110 billion!Different welfare programs for Walmart workers alone costed the USFG an estimated $6 billion (12)! The average income of a sales Associate working at Walmart is $8.81, so these workers would be affected by a minimum wage change (15). Walmart employs about 1.4 million people in the US, about 1.15% of all of America's workers (13) (14). Overall, the United States would save money if the minimum wage was to be increased.Thank you readers for reading. I would also like to wish anyone reading this a happy New Years (if you are not reading this before New Years that is).Con, I await your response. Sources:(1) http://tinyurl.com...

            "conclusion": "Raise Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "Thanks, Pro.R1) Life NecessitiesOn the surface, this argument may seem like a good one. However, there are many problems that are tied to it and really no evidence that raising the minimum wage will actually help this cause, only theoretical assumptions. The reason some workers receive the minimum wage as pay is because their contribution to the labor market is the smallest possible to be recognized as something worth paying for. The money paid to a McDonald's worker represents precisely the value that they are adding to the economy. Suddenly doubling their wages for doing the exact same amount of work before and after creates an imbalance in society. These workers are being paid a lot more than they're working for, and so the money being given to the workers rises above the amount of effort they are putting into the system. Consider the following scenario: a man gets a job screwing caps onto tubes of toothpaste. The man is paid bare minimum for doing his job, but it's not enough to support his family. Instead of seeking the education to get a better job, the man goes and strike and starts advocating for a minimum wage increase so that he can receive more money for doing the exact same amount of minimal work. The point of this example is to show that workers who need to earn more money shouldn't rely on the government to raise the minimum wage, but to receive a higher income they should instead work for their money and contribute to the economy instead of protesting to receive more for doing less.Pro claims that raising the minimum wage will reduce poverty, but doesn't show any historical evidence of this happening. As the challenger of the status quo, Pro must demonstrate that raising the minimum wage will benefit society, not just in theory, or else there is no reason to change the status quo. Economists have studied whether or not a minimum wage increase would reduce poverty and have concluded that it would have no effect on the poverty rate[1]. This makes sense, because few minimum wage earners are actually poor. In fact, the average minimum wage earner has a family income of $50,000 per year, with less than one-fifth at or below the poverty line[1].To add, the cost of living varies from state to state, so if the federal minimum wage were to be increased, it would create an unfair situation for many states as they would be forced to comply to the increase regardless of whether their cost of living is cheap or expensive.R2) IncentiveThis is Pro's logic: if a worker is given more of a livable wage, then that worker would be more inclined to climb the income ladder even if they are financially satisfied. This is clearly false, because dissatisfaction drives workers to earn more. By raising the wage, a worker would think \"since I'm earning enough now then I don't see a point in working to earn more\". This is a burden for not only businesses but the economy as well because less good jobs are being taken, and less money is being pumped into the system. This issue is also important because the majority of minimum wage earners are between the ages 16 and 24[2], so they are at a critical point of choosing their jobs and decided whether they want to receive more education or not.R3) EmploymentMy opponent's proposal to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $16.97 would be detrimental for many companies because it would force them to pay their employees over double the amount they were originally being paid. Clearly this would cause businesses to cut job openings and lay off more workers, resulting in higher unemployment. We must remember that a small minority of hourly paid workers earn minimum wage: 4.7% to be exact[3], so there a lot of businesses that would remain unaffected by whether the wage was increased or not. That makes the opinions of many businesses irrelevant to this issue.Pro concedes that unemployment would increase due to a higher wage. Since it would mainly affect the 4.7% of minimum wage workers, the unemployment rates would not seem big in comparison to the rest of workers. However, the unemployment rates would have a much more drastic effect if we focused on those workers, the workers that matter, alone. Job rates would significantly decrease for them. As I showed in Round 1, there is higher unemployment in states with higher minimum wages.Additional NotesPro makes a few other assertions that are not backed up by evidence, such as \"increasing the wage provides benefits\" and \"not increasing it creates a burden on the taxpayer\". How exactly? These assumptions can be logically dismissed since they were randomly inserted into the argument without actual evidence.My final point: If the minimum wage were to be increased from $7.25 to $16.97, that would negatively affect workers who were earning above the original wage, like those earning $12 an hour. Does this mean that they will now be paid the exact same as original $7.25 workers who are doing less work than the higher $12 earners? This will create an unfair situation for workers earning between the original federal wage and Pro's proposed increase.Sources[1] http://www.heritage.org...

            "premise": "Thank you for the case ProLet me point out a few things that led up the the Legislation of minimum wage that Roosevelt instituted back in 1938. You have the Federal Reserve starting in 1913, lax borrowing that Americans used to gamble on Wall Street (creating the Roaring 20's). Let by a recall of the loans, sucking the money out of the market, leading to the crash, leading to the confiscation of American's wealth (outlaw gold), followed by many progressive types of legislation (including the minimum wage). You have to keep in mind that with the legislation of a minimum wage, there were also minimum hours required too. The U.S. federal minimum wage was first established during the Depression, and it has risen from 25 cents to $7.25 per hour since it was first instituted in 1938 as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Despite the increases, inflation has eroded its value; returning it to the value it held in 1968 would require an increase to nearly $10 per hour. - See more at: http://journalistsresource.org...Keep in mind, I'm stating that the minimum wage must be increased (to basically keep pace with inflation). Not saying I'm in favor of any specific dollar amount (ie. $10, $15, $20 a hour), but in due time, it will have to reach these dollar amounts eventually. To support my argument, I will be focusing on inflation (monetary).Based on our current fiat monetary system, the money supply is dependant on the creation of debt to create new money to put into circulation. We didn't see practically an inflation (aside from a few wars), until the creation of the federal reserve in 1913. So the ideas of minimum wage couldn't have even been contemplated until we started to have a decrease in our purchasing power. Of course, with Bretton Woods and the stealing of our gold by the federal government, resulted in a 57% drop in the value of our dollar overnight. In your last two paragraphs, may I mention that those individuals are basing their estimated projections from setting the minimum wage at a set dollar amount ($15). I cannot argue with their projections, I however am taking the stance that (Minimum wage in General, will have to increase).",

            "conclusion": "The minimum wage should be raised to $12.50 gradually, by the year 2020",
            "premise": "It seems my opponent also dropped all of my round 3 arguments, so each of them still stand. My opponent has brought up only new arguments in this round, which is usually seen as poor conduct, but I'm okay with it because I still get to respond to it since I'm second to post arguments. Now, I will address points by my opponent:Although record high worker productivity has allowed businesses to earn more revenue, we have not seen similar growth in the wages of workersActually, we have been having wage growth. A look at the past 50 years or so shows that the only times we didn't have much growth were during recessions. Otherwise, we've been averaging around a 4-5% increase in wages every month. [6] There was a study done by Eric French and Daniel Aaronson, economists at the federal reserve bank in Chicago, that showed the effects of raising the minimum wage on aggregate household spending. They estimated that a $1.75 increase in the minimum wage would increase consumer spending by $26 billion dollars.There's more than just one way to increase consumer spending. Lowering the prices of products would also allow people to purchase more. Raising the minimum wage, as I showed, would result in prices of products rising. So, while people would be spending more, they still would likely only be able to afford the same amount of products they did previously. It doesn't really change anything. Because of the fact that employers would have to pay their employees more, it means their profit margins go down, and that results in them raising their prices. It doesn't have any net effect on the purchasing power of consumers. Spending more doesn't necessarily stimulate the economy, what really does is to increase the purchasing power of people so that they can buy more things. Simply making them spend more doesn't necessarily do anything, because how they are spending more is due to prices rising. What really does something to the economy is increase purchasing power. To increase purchasing power, getting rid of those taxes I mentioned would do so. There is another number of ways of increasing purchasing power, such as having wages go up when prices remain the same or go down, and when prices of products go down while wages stay the same or go up. Having wages go up but prices go up at the same time and rate does nothing for the economy because it doesn't increase purchasing power. A minimum wage increase would result in prices going up, as the study I provided earlier, which you didn't refute, showed.Finally, I would like to cite one last piece of empirical evidence. Economists Alan B. Kreuger and David Card conducted a study that analyzed the Full time employment effects on the fast food industry in 1992, when Pennsylvania had it's minimum wage at $4.25, and New Jersey's minimum wage was at $5.05. New Jersey experienced an employment increase in the industry, Pennsylvania experienced an employment decline. If this were to happen on a federal level as well, the employment increase would definitely lead to economic stimulus.This only proves correlation. For one, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are two completely different states which have different state government policies. A number of things could have affected the employment level of the two states. To claim the minimum wage increase is the reason for it is a logical fallacy. Unless you rule out all other potential reasons for the employment difference, this study doesn't prove anything except for correlation. In fact, logic would tell us that minimum wage increases would result in a lowering of employment, because employers wouldn't be able to afford to have as many employees. To claim that the employment rose due to the minimum wage difference is an extraordinary claim that needs extraordinary evidence. Showing correlation doesn't prove it. As the congressional budget office points out, a raise in minimum wage would likely elliminate jobs[7] So, because logic tells us that a minimum wage increase would result in the loss of jobs, there was likely some other reason why New Jersey saw an increase in employment and pennsylvania saw a decrease in employment. This study also suggests that raises in minimum wage decreases job growth[8]. They originally were going into the study with the belief that minimum wage had no effect on employment levels, but discovered that it negatively affects job growth. In conclusion, I believe since there were several important points that I brought up which my opponent dropped, and that I believe I have successfully refuted my opponent's arguments, you should vote con for arguments.Sources:[6] http://www.tradingeconomics.com...

            "premise": "\"All that you have argued only amounts to make the case to not raise the minimum wage, or even keep it the same. This does not mean get rid of it all together.\"Raising the minimum wage is bad, and the minimum wage = a higher wage anyway, therefore lowering it would be benificial and getting rid of it = a lowering. \" South Africa is a sad example of the fact that minimum wage laws end up hurting, rather than helping, the poor and unskilled.\" [1] It is simple how a even small minimum wage is bad:Let's say it is 4$ only:If the cost of your labor is more then the output you make, then chances are the emloyer is losing money and is mor elikely to fire you. [1] The minimum wage has clear effects: The minimum wage reduces employment. [2] [3] The minimum wage hurts the less skilled for the reasons above. [4] The minimum wage lowes employment in industries like retail that have lower paid workers. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Another prof that the minimuwage hurts the economy: The minimum wage increases the amou of people on welfare. [10] [11]That means it increases the amount of people on welfare. Further more, one of the reasons people hire minimum wag eworkers is because of the minimum wage. A minimum wage causes people to hire illegal imagrants. [12]For the reasons above the minimum wage increases unemployment, = worse economy.Also if you are worth 5$, then a 7$ minimum wage disqualifies you from getting a job. If the employer loeses money hiring you he is gonna either 1) not hire you 2) fire you. Further more teenage unemployment is raised and effected more drastically then adult unemployment, althou still effected, by minimum wage laws. [13] [14] [15]My opponent didn't like my other args so I modified, and either way a minimum wage is in itself a wage raise. So if I showed (which I have) higher wags are bad them a minimum wage in itself is raising unemployment, having a miimum wage at 0$ would be better for the economy alower wges are better. Obviously if your worth 2$ you will get paid that. [16]I have provided statistics so I have won ths point.I extend C4.Concusion:I have proven the minimum wage does all of wht I said it did. It is bad, it increses drop out rates. [17] [18] [19] He droped that btw. It does not lower poverty. [20] [21] And it even hurts the poor. [22] All of these things hurt the economy, and the minimum wage causes it. The minimum wage is not good for the economy.

            "discussionTitle": "The Minimum Wage",
            "conclusion": "The Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "Point 1: The Minimum Wage increases teenage unemployment. \"Two years ago Mr. Neumark and William Wascher, a Federal Reserve economist, reviewed more than 100 academic studies on the impact of the minimum wage. They found \"overwhelming\" evidence that the least skilled and the young suffer a loss of employment when the minimum wage is increased.\"[1] As the minimum wage increases, so does teenage unemployment. \"70-cent-an-hour increase in the minimum wage would cost some 300,000 jobs. Sure enough, the mandated increase to $7.25 took effect in July, and right on cue the August and September jobless numbers confirm the rapid disappearance of jobs for teenagers.\"[1] \"Unemployment in 2006 (teenage) was 4.4%, there was a steady minimum wage. In 2009, after a few minimum wage increases, teenage unemployment was 10.2%.\"[2] [2] \"A 2006 University of Georgia study found that every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage was associated with a 4.6 to 9.0 percent decline in teenage employment. This finding was corroborated last summer when the 12 percent hike in the minimum wage corresponded with a five percent unemployment spike for teens.\"[3] \"1995 Michigan State University study showed a higher minimum wage was found to increase the number of idle teens, those who neither work nor attend school by as much as 20 percent.\"[3] As the minimum wage increases, teenage employment decreases. Why? Because as the minimum wage eats into companies' profits, they can employ fewer people. And the first people they fire are the unskilled, young employees. Point 2: The Minimum Wage increase minority unemployment. \"Minimum wage laws effect ethnic minorities the most.\"[4] \"As the minimum wage effects the least productive, minorities are more likely to be effected by these laws. It also effects poor areas most, which are full of miborities, therefore affecting them.\"[5] \"Hardest hit of all: black male teens, whose unemployment rate shot up to a catastrophic 50.4%. It was merely a terrible 39.2% in July.\"[1] So the minimum wage hurts minority teens worst. Point 3: The Minimum Wage increases overall unemployment. \"Economists have studied the job-destroying features of a higher minimum wage. Estimates of the job losses of raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 have ranged from 625,000 to 1,000,000 lost jobs. It is important to recognize that the jobs lost are mainly entry-level jobs. By destroying entry-level jobs, a higher minimum wage harms the lifetime earnings prospects of low-skilled workers. \"[6] \"Only 1 study has reversed 300 years of min wage research, other economists tried to duplicate this study, but couldn't, all other studies indicated minimum wages increase unemployment.\"[7] [8] \"With all of this recessions significant labor market problems, and the expensive federal efforts to offset them, its too bad that the minimum-wage law added so many people to the list of those who today cannot find jobs.\"[9] As the minimum wage increases, unemployment increases. Why? Because with a minimum wage, companies have to pay more to employees. This means that they have to lay off employees to stay on budget. Point 4: The Minumum Wage causes an increase in prices. \"The federal increase from $4.25 to $5.15 costs California families an average of $133 more per year for the goods they normally purchase. Since higher-income families spend more, they would pay more in absolute terms than lower-income families: up to $234 per year compared to $84 per year.\"[10] \"In a series of studies over the last four years, Aaronson and French show that a 10 percent hike in the minimum wage increased restaurant prices on the whole by 0.7 percent, and prices at limited service establishments by 1.6 percent.\"[11] As the minimum wage increases, not only do companies fire employees, they also raise prices to help the budget. And in the end, this will make it harderfor people, especially poor people, to buynecessary things. That in turn reduces GDP growth because there is less buying, and know, this will plungeus into another recession. Point 5: The Minimum Wage causes more high school dropouts. \"One rarely talked about idea is that the minimum wage causes more highschool drop outs.\"[12] Why does this matter? Well with a more less educated population, that is fewer people that can take high-status jobs. This creates a shortage of high-profile jobs and a surplus of low-profile jobs. In other words, there will be a long-term increase inunemployment due to this. Point 6: More arguments against the minimum wage. \"First, raising the minimum wage would not reduce poverty.[13] \"Second, current evidence, see graph, shows when the minimum wage goes up so does unemployment.\"[8] \"An increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour, as President Clinton proposes, would drive teenagers with few skills out of the workplace and out of the schools, say members of the African-American leadership group Project 21.\"[14] \"In china you pay less ------> less cost to you ---> $$$$ Vs the minimum wage Higher wages ---> expensive ---> move to china!\"\"When you force American companies to pay a certain wage, you increase the likelihood that those companies will outsource jobs to foreign workers, where labor is much cheaper. There has been a lot of attention lately on the subject of job \"outsourcing\", where U.S. companies hire foreign workers instead of Americans. When businesses outsource American jobs, they're not doing it because they hate America; they're doing it because they're trying to cut costs. When you increase the price of labor in America, you create an additional incentive for businesses to hire Canadian, Mexican, or other foreign workers. The best way to stop outsourcing of jobs is to provide the best conditions for doing business in America. A minimum wage just makes things tougher for companies to do business in America. Remember that American companies may have no choice but to outsource with the high cost in the U.S.--they may go out of business entirely if they can't cut costs to a level that's competitive with foreign competitors.\"[15] Sources: [1]: http://online.wsj.com...

            "conclusion": "Raising the minimum wage",
            "premise": "CON begins by conceding that his statements contradict each other; he states than an increase in the minimum wage will either reduce employment or lead to inflation. Note that he provides absolutley no empriical data to substantiate his claim, whereas I have provided several studies showing how employers tend to react to minimum wage increases, and that price increases are extremely negligible. My point, though, is that for prices to increase at all, we would either be dealing with demand-pull inflation -- meaning that there is more overall demand in the economy, meaning that more jobs wre created -- or cost-push inflation. The only way for CON to be consistent with his remarks is to argue that any increase in the minimum wage is a supply shock on par with staglation on par with the oil crisis of the 70s. As the evidence I have brought up thus far bears out, this is hardly the case. The second we begin to consider this issue in terms of demand rather than supply, the evidence is heavily favored toward increasing the minimum wage. No, I wasn't speaking of an increase in the minimum wage from $10 an hour because the federal minmum wage right now is $7.25 per hour. Why would I introduce an unrealistic hypothetical scenario that suggests that the minimum wage is higher than it is? The first study piece of evidence I provided from Jeannette Wik-Lims speaks of a ten percent increase in the minimum wage, and the negligible impact on prices. The further evidence I provided, consistent with this premise, comes from John Schmitt, Lynn Thompson, Sara Lemos a UC Berkeley study, and Converse et al. Note that CON does dispute the emirical data that I have provided, nor does he provide any of his own to balance against the weight of evidence I have provided. Note that I am not defining a \"modest' increase as 10 cents an hour, but in order to win this debate, I must only show that any increase in the minimum wage would not have the time of negative impacts that CON is suggesting. Therefore, CON's argument about a ten-cent rise in the minimum wage being virtually negligible is irrelevant to the resolution we are discussing. Granted, he admits that \"over a very large period of time an extra ten cents an hour does become a significant anount.\" Note that this is a concession on his part that there is a conceivable increase in the minimum wage which he accepts would in fact be economically beneficial. CON claims that he \"stands that it could result in the laying of some workers.\" Note that this is nothing more than a bare-assertion fallacy by CON. He has provided us with no evidence bearing out this claim, and in fact has made conflicting statements on the impact of the minimum wage, a contradiction to which he admits. This argument, as of now, can be discarded.CON suggests that I have failed to account for human nature; he claims that the majority of people would \"want to look out for themselves then [sic] than take a pay cut so they can afford to keep their employees.\" This remark is fallacious for a number of reasons. First, not only is his account of radical self-interest -- and, mind you, I accept that this is more likely than not at least among the central forces driving people, though there are indeed others (e.g., commitment to altruism) -- a bare-assertion fallacy as to how he believes people will act, which is nothing more than egocentric, but he again contends that it would actually be necessary for employers to lay people off in order to afford their employees. He has provided no evidence for this, so we have to at ths point discard this claim. If the minimum wage has \"no discernible effect on employment,\" which is the case I have made and that my evidence has borne out, then we know a few things: first, there is no need for radical action by employers, and it simply doesn't occur, as we already know how they respond to increases in the minimum wage, as the UC Berkeley study discusses, and much more than simply reducing profits acts as a check against negligibly rising labor costs. At the same time, CON refuses to account for the fact that increases in the minimum wage increase worker productivity and decrease turnover. At the same time, if employers were to lay off workers, they would actually be producing less and therefore profiting less; this is contrary to radical self-interest that CON contends is at the heart of human nature. His remark on more efficient technologies discounts the fact that (1) I have already demonstrated how employers react to the minimukm wage (2) this is a bare-assertion fallacy and (3) he misunderstands the point entirely. More \"efficient\" means doing more with less, meaning that we're dealing with a decline in costs in this area, not a rise. CON once again fails to account for a net loss of employees, but merely keeps asserting it again and again .CON admits that, in the long run, wages will rise, which again is a concession that wages will rise. Of course, he provides absolutely no evidence that this effect will only take place in the long run. If the minimum wage were increased tomorrow and people had more money in their pockets, they would begin to increase their spending immediately. When people feel wealthier, they spend more, which is why people spent more during the housing bubble even though their real incomes were declining (their home values continued to increase). CON's contention that employers refuse to look to the long run is not only a bare-assertion, but irrelevant unless he can actually contend that the minimum wage kills job and shrinks wages in the short run, a point which he still has not proven. What's interesting is that he contradicted himself. Earlier he noted, \"it will not help our economy or even the workers getting higher pay in the long run.\" Now he concedes that pay in the long run will rise.\" The only way this narrative could work is if wage rise proportionally to wage cuts, producing an impact of net zero. But this is flat-out wrong, and we know from empriical data that minimum wage increases impact far more people than only minimum wage workers. An increase in the minimum wage applies upward pressure on wages generally speaking. Look at this piece from the CBO, for instance: \"The increased earnings for low-wage workers resulting from the higher minimum wage would total $31 billion, by CBO\u2019s estimate. However, those earnings would not go only to low-income families, because many low-wage workers are not members of low-income families. Just 19 percent of the $31 billion would accrue to families with earnings below the poverty threshold, whereas 29 percent would accrue to families earning more than three times the poverty threshold, CBO estimates.\" (1)CON completely misunderstands the point of the minimum wage. In arguing that it is difficult to gauge a worker's MPL, not only does he concede that MPL is not the central determinant of wages, but that the notion of workers \"earning what they're worth\" is merely a crock. For instance, productivity since 1968 has doubled, yet median wages have flat-lined and prosperity hasn't been shared. In fact, the minimum wage in 1968 has more purchasing power than the minimum wage today (2). He contends that we would need a different minimum wage per industry, but refuses to acknowledge that, whilst overall productivity has increased, the vast increase in prosperity has gone to the affluent. The minimum wage merely amelioerates this gap. For instance, if the minimum wage kept pace with inflation since 1968, it'd be $10.52 an hour. If it kept pace with inflation and productivity, it would be $21.72 an hour. Yet that is not my recommendation. ConclusionI am out of characters, so I will have to pass back to CON, though I have more contentions to offer. My central point, however, is that CON is dealing with hypotheticals, not reality, and has provided no empirical data to prove his case.(1) http://tinyurl.com...(2) http://tinyurl.com...(3) http://tinyurl.com...",

            "conclusion": "Laws making Minimum Wage Mandatory are necessary in this society",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate. Its something I've been thinking about recently, and my views have been evolving. I stand in opposition to the resolution for several reasons. My opponent claims that minimum wage laws are \"necessary\" but hasn't explained to what. Judging from his round it appears that minimum wage is necessary to protect the welfare of those working menial or unskilled jobs. In otherwords: to protect the poor. This is false, in that minimum wage laws fail to benefit most poor people in a meaningful way. But such an argument also begs the question as to why employers are responsible for the welfare of their employees. I will expect my opponent to address this portion in round 2. How do minimum wage laws hurt the poor? First, the data: http://oregonstate.edu... Though the minimum wage has been increasing steadily since it was introduced in the late thirties, \"real wages\" (ie wages as adjusted for inflation) peaked in the late sixties and have been falling ever since. Thus, even assuming that the welfare of the poor is a legitimate legislative concern, increasing nominal wages is not necessarily indicitive of an increase in welfare or purchasing power. Second, the theory: Minimum wage laws contribute to both inflation and unemployment. Both of these phenomena hurt the poor. If the minimum wage is raised, that means, for a company employing workers at minimum wage, that the cost of maintaining production at its current levels goes up. Depending on how efficient they are, they may be able to absorb these extra costs and continue to make a profit. However, it is also possible that such an increase will make it unprofitable for them to continue to do business- it will be more expensive to run the company than they make by selling their products. If this is the case then either the business fails or they raise their prices to make up the difference. If many businesses choose to pass their costs onto the consumer, then the increase in the minimum wage was in vain (since the employee now makes more money but the cost of his expenses has increased concomitantly. In general, by setting a minimum wage the government is making certain jobs economically unfeasible. If Bob works for me, and ultimately due to his contributions in 4 hours of work I make 20 dollars, in the current economy I cannot hire him without losing money. I would have to pay him almost 10 dollars an hour (here in San Francisco anyways, I don't know how much the federal minimum wage is), aka TWICE the profit I would make from his labor. I would lose money by hiring him. Businesses that operate at a loss fail. Third, my opponents contentions: \"If you don't have a college education or you are even just working at a grocery store as a part-time job, you must rely on your employer to pay you minimum wage.\" Why must I rely on any particular employer? As it so happens, I DO work part time at a grocery store. And they pay me more than the minimum wage. But I do not \"rely\" on them, I choose to trade my time and effort for their money. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. Were I unsatisfied with the terms, I would leave to seek my fortunes elsewhere. \"If there were no minimum wage laws, employers would be able to hire employees and make them \"slaves\".\" Patently untrue. Slavery is a state whereby one man has ownership rights over another by law. No such law exists in the US. Any employer who attempted to enslave their employee could be successfully sued for human rights violations. A true \"slave\" has no such recourse. \"Especially in the economic situation this country is in currently, employees would be being hired for extremely low hourly wages, since everybody is desperate for a job.\" This is more accurate. However, for several reasons, it is unlikely that any job would pay a great deal less than a \"living wage\". This is because, just as employees compete for employers, employers compete for employees. Though they generally don't need any particular worker (just like no worker needs a particular job) if they are to be successful, they must have some workers (ie people producing value in some way). Any company paying significantly less than a living wage will not keep its workers, as they will be attracted to higher paying options. If no such options exist, the poor will turn to begging. As I said, a business without workers fails, as nothing is produced. The logical extension, since the supply of labor is not unlimited, is that companies will pay their employees enough that they will not starve, and enough so that it is more profitable for them to work than it is for them to not work. On a related note, it is not profitable for businesses in general to pay their employees so little that they cannot afford to buy their product. This is of course not applicable to items such as luxury goods, or especially high end merchandise, but for mainstream consumer products produced by minimum wage labor, its true. A widespread policy of paying wage earners extremely low wages dramatically decreases the market for the goods each company is trying to produce. Paradoxically paying their employees higher wages, companies can actually increase their profits. Furthermore, since we agree that unemployment is a bad thing, why would you make it illegal for some people to work? In essence your argument is that people should not be able to sell their labor at a price less than that which you deem appropriate. How can such an arbitrary designation on your part be \"necessary\"?",

            "premise": "My thanks to my esteemed opponent for an interesting and well-argued case. The weakness in the neoclassical theories PRO posits lie in the lack of specificity of time frame. While it is true that an increase in minimum wage may temporarily decrease both hiring and productivity (the former case is far stronger than the latter, we'll get to that further on in) the use of the term \"Overall\" is misleading. In fact, I intend to prove that in the long term, better paid employees have greater spending power to patronize the businesses both for which they work and those that employ others in their vicinity. The result of this higher level of spending is that in the long term, businesses are able to sell more, hire more and produce more. Furthermore, PRO uses artificially high and artificially specific numbers in the examples given. Lastly, I will illustrate that the impact on an economy from minimum wage laws is too minimal to be counted as detrimental. It is true that dropping a bucket of water into the ocean my \"empirically\" add to the overall amount of water there, but if my opponent intends to claim victory on that scale alone, I would submit that PRO is indulging in the very semantic quibbling that was disavowed by us both in the first round. REBUTLE 1: THE NEOCLASSICAL THEORY The American Center for Progress as well as The Economist and Bloomburg news have all convened case-studies which directly undercut the Neoclassical wisdom on the subject of minimum wage impact. As if often true in the \"dismal science\" of Economics, what sounds good in theory often does not bear up beneath scrutiny in the real world. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"A significant body of academic research has found that raising the minimum wage does not result in job losses even during hard economic times. There are at least five different academic studies focusing on increases to the minimum wage\"including increases ranging from 7 percent to 12.3 percent made during periods of high unemployment\"that find an increase in the minimum wage has no significant effect on employment levels. The results are likely because the boost in demand and reduction in turnover provided by a minimum wage counteracts the higher wage costs. Similarly, a simple analysis of increases to the minimum wage on the state level, even during periods of state unemployment rates above 8 percent, shows that the minimum wage does not kill jobs. Indeed the states in our simple analysis had job growth slightly above the national average. [...] All the studies came to the same conclusion\"that raising the minimum wage had no effect on employment.\" - http://thinkprogress.org... -------------------------------------------------------------------------- \" The Economist, November 2012: \"Evidence is mounting that moderate minimum wages can do more good than harm...Britain\"s small, regular changes [in the minimum wage] may be easier for firms to absorb than America\"s infrequent but hefty minimum-wage increases.\" Bloomberg News, April 2012: \"[A] wave of new economic research is disproving those arguments about job losses and youth employment. Previous studies tended not to control for regional economic trends that were already affecting employment levels, such as a manufacturing-dependent state that was shedding jobs. The new research looks at micro-level employment patterns for a more accurate employment picture. The studies find minimum-wage increases even provide an economic boost, albeit a small one, as strapped workers immediately spend their raises. Let us hope that states lead the way on the minimum wage, and that they tie increases to the cost of living, making endless rounds of legislation unnecessary. Then let us hope that fresh research and improved lives built on hard work compel Congress to follow.\" Perhaps the most glaring example of this is our own recent history. We saw a substantial minimum wage increase in 1990 which immediately proceeds some of the lowest rates of unemployment in our country's history. Or even consider the creation of the minimum wage itself in 1938. Did our country plunge from economic depression into even deeper depression? No. Even the harshest critics of New Deal policies can only weakly argue that the depression might have been prolonged, but there is no argument to suggest that employment (which was ever-growing during the span from 1938 into the 1950's) was even remotely impacted by the introduction of a minimum wage. REBUTLE 2: Productivity As I stated in my opening argument, the case for hiring being impacted by minimum wage may have some truth to it in the short term, but the notion that productivity takes a huge hit is simply laughable. As we sit now with official nation-wide unemployment around 10% and an unofficial total that may be as high as 25% (the disparity in the two numbers owing to discrepancies in how the official number leaves out many groups and does not take into account those who have simply given up) our productivity is FOUR TIMES what it was when unemployment was only 4%, as measured by GDP. http://www.google.com... If you cannot form any link between productivity and employment at all, the notion that said productivity is somehow hurt by job losses driven by minimum wage cannot stand. The argument is utterly without merit. REBUTTAL 3: NUMBERS PRO contends that \"If you are worth 10 dollars an hour it is unlikely a firm will pay you 20 dollars an hour. If you are worth three, the firm will not hire for 7 dollars an hour. If you are employed and the minimum wage is raised above your worth, expect to not last long in the labor market etc....\" The problem with these numbers is two fold. 1. They are too high. A minimum wage of Twenty Dollars an Hour is commensurate more with a distinct \"Living Wage\" That some states and countries have instituted. Even since its introduction in 1938, the minimum wage has always been meager. This is why with the tiny and incremental increases we've seen over the last 80+ years minimum wages have never been able to keep up with inflation or cost increases. While I may think that a living wage has merit, it is not what we're discussing here. 2. He draws odd conclusions from them. Typically even if they may cut back in hiring in the short term due to the impacts of a minimum wage increase, I would challenge PRO to find me strong examples of a company literally firing employees. While it is true this is often threatened and hands are wrung, historically firings and layoffs do not spike in the aftermath of a minimum increase, regardless of what overall employment numbers may look like. REBUTTAL 4: MINORITIES AND TEENS PRO contends that teens, minorities, and minorities teens feel the bite of minimum wage the worst. Not only is there strong evidence to suggest this is simply not the case, http://www.epi.org... but it is an especially odd thing to shift what is in essence a racist burden of blame onto the minimum wage rather than the employers who are choosing to fire/let go minority employees to begin with. Regardless of what factors may make an employer let workers go, the choice to fire those with greater ethnic diversity first, is entirely on them. CONCLUSION: While minimum wages may, (largely through reactionary choices by employers) have a short-term impact on hiring and firing decisions, the overall benefits gained by having a minimum wage that increases WITH the overall GDP are a net benefit to an economy.

            "premise": "I thank Valladarex for the opportunity to debate a highly contentious topic. While it unusual to go first in a debate where I technically don\u2019t have the burden of proof, I will have a chance to refute Pro\u2019s argument in the next round. I will provide some arguments as to why Minimum wage should be implemented, which is slightly different from the resolution as I have the burden of proof in this instance. This is to outline my side of the argument, rather than set the tone of the argument. Anyway, I\u2019ll stop prattling on\u2026 Increases the standard of living for the poorest and most vulnerable class in society Young, a working parent often not only have the demands of taking care of themself or his or her partner, but also a child/children. Evidently, it is not hard to imagine that some of the poorest people in America are young, working parents because they essentially support three people in a developed nation (higher standard of living costs than an undeveloped nation). \u201cAnalysis of the 2005 Current Population Survey reveals that the workers potentially affected by a minimum wage increase are mainly adults who typically work full time and provide significant income to their families. If the federal minimum wage were increased to $7.25 per hour by 2008, 14.9 million workers would see their wages rise. The vast majority (80%) of workers affected are adults age 20 and above. Twenty-six percent of these workers are parents, and as a result over 7.3 million children of low-wage workers would see their parents\u2019 income increase if the federal minimum wage was increased to $7.25 per hour by 2008.1 From a historical perspective, this demographic portrait is consistent with the make-up of workers benefiting from the last federal minimum wage increase\u201d (Bernstein and Schmitt 1998). Clearly, the minimum wage would vastly improve the situation for these parents, in turn dealing with the poverty to some extent. This is the fundamental reason to employ a minimum wage: to prevent people from living below the poverty line because businesses will pay people virtually nothing if they are allowed to. If people refuse to work for such a low pay, the business will simply not employ them or look for someone whom will (overseas if need be). It isn\u2019t like there are only a handful of people whom a business can employ to do minimum wage work for them. Business exploitation and the Anchoring effect In theory, businesses would pay what they thought an employee was worth, so the incentive would be to work harder to get payed more. Keep in mind that this argument is about minimum wage, not high-end wage negotiation where there are few other potential employees due to the qualifications required. This theory is skewered in practice due to an effort called \u2018the Anchoring effect\u2019. The Anchoring effect occurs when someone bases the validity or worth of something by comparing other things of a similar nature within the vicinity (and is a fallacy because it works off relativity rather than objectivity). To put this into context, there is no way to objectively gauge what a person\u2019s working time is worth (i.e. what is a person\u2019s time worth if he or she is stacking boxes?). Arbitrary standards will be set, and will be (unfairly) set by the business (as there are no restrictions on them AND there is a conflict of interest for the business, the conflict of interest inciting exploitation because the bottom line of running a business is to make money). But here is where the fallacy comes in. Say I\u2019m packing boxes full of clothing and getting payed $0.5 an hour. I\u2019m doing a better job than the guy next to me, who is getting payed $0.3 an hour. So, logically, it would seem that I\u2019m getting payed extra for my extra effort, right? This is below the amount necessary to sustain my life, but I\u2019m told to \u2018work harder\u2019 if I want to get anymore pay. In reality, the business has set a very low standard, exploiting people by use of the anchoring effect and paying them less than what a person who sees the situation objectively would demand. This is another reason businesses must have minimum wages set by a separate entity (one which can see the situation objectively and can set objective standards, otherwise the business will set low wage rates which are unsustainable in a developed world (and make people believe that the rates are fair). To demonstrate exploitation in action (not necessarily the Anchoring effect in all instances), in 2006, \u201cthe earnings of a full-time minimum wage worker (working 40 hours/week, 52 weeks/year) with a family of three would earn $10,712 a year, thus falling 35.5% below the official 2006 federal poverty level of $16,600. Although the federal poverty line is an inadequate measure of the income needed to support a family, this comparison highlights the severe insufficiency of the current minimum wage\u201d (Fisher 1999). I\u2019ve outlined the crux of my argument and an important correlation. I don\u2019t think I should go much further because in this argument, seeing that I\u2019m Con, I\u2019m supposed to counter-argue the arguments of my opponent. I will await your response, Valladarex.

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should raise the Federal Minimum wage standard to",
            "premise": "I accept the debate and thank lannan13 for instigating the debate and Forever for setting up the tournament. C1: Poverty Premise 1: The \u2018increased\u2019 minimum wage reduces poverty \u201cAbout 20.6 million people (or 30% of all hourly, non-self-employed workers 18 and older) are \u201cnear-minimum-wage\u201d workers.\u201d [6] This is appalling. The minimum wage at the moment is extremely important in order for us to decrease poverty. Increasing the minimum wage can only continue to have the same effect. The following quotation proves that even a small minimum wage increase reduces poverty significantly. \u201cSpecifically, raising the minimum wage 10 percent (say from $7.25 to near $8) would reduce the number of people living in poverty 2.4 percent.\u201d [5] If an increase this low can have such a huge effect then what will a larger increase do? Evidently, it will create a decrease in the amount of poverty even more than the small increase did. \u201cUsing this as an estimate, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, as many Democrats are proposing in 2014, would reduce the number of people living in poverty by 4.6 million. It would also boost the incomes of those at the 10th percentile by $1,700.\u201d [5] This furthermore proves that an even larger increase would prove to be successful. Premise 2: The \u2018increased\u2019 minimum wage helps the poor \u201chigher minimum wage is a substantial response to the challenges of inequality. Opponents of a higher minimum wage focus on the idea that it largely won\u2019t benefit the worst off.\u201d [5] The quotation is supported by the following graph: \u201cA higher minimum wage will lead to a significant boost in incomes for the worst off in the bottom 30th percent of income\u201d [5] This is extremely significant because by reducing poverty we can ensure that the US can fulfill human rights to its greatest extent possible. Human rights makes direct references to having minimum wages [7]. It also makes references to reducing poverty to the furthest extent possible [8]. By not increasing minimum wages you are stopping people from receiving their human rights. This leads me on nicely to my final premise of this contention in regards to human rights. Premise 3: The current minimum wage violates human rights As introduced previously, the current minimum wage does not properly enforce laws upon poverty. The minimum wage states that we must stop poverty as much as possible without going to unreasonable measures [8]. By increasing the minimum wage this much we will see a huge economic benefit as well as a huge reduction in help for the poor and those living in poverty. The economic benefit proves that increasing the minimum wage to this extent is not unreasonable and the reduction in poverty shows that we must do this in order to bring the US to a place that meets the criteria set out by \u2018Human Rights\u2019. Conclusion We must raise the minimum wage in order for us to succeed in reducing poverty as much as possible in order for us to meet human rights criteria. Therefore the minimum wage ought to be risen in regards to this contention. C2: Productivity Higher wages result in greater worker productivity and this theory is demonstrated by a lot of as my source shows Economic Research [1]. As well as the reasoning being an increase in determination which evidently coming from higher pay raises, workers who have greater income security also see a negative correlation in poverty and financial stress, this ultimately increases work productivity as a result [2]. On to of this when they are paid more, workers are less likely to change jobs, meaning that employers have to waste less money and time attempting to attract more workers / employees, and they also receive obvious benefits such as having workers that are more experienced, long-term employees that can help develop and boost their company's overall [3].In terms of economy, it is shown by multiple studies that businesses will see at least a $228 billion growth in revenues from a minimum wage increase due to productivity [4]. Contention 3: Religion and general agreement Christianity: Christianity is the world\u2019s largest religion [9] at the moment including atheism and non-theistic religions. The Christian case for raising the minimum wage is relatively simple. I now quote: \u201cWhile there are multiple avenues through which the poor and struggling can be supported \u2014 cash transfer programs and wage subsidies, for example, might boast the same outcomes \u2014 the delivery of income through wages, rather than benefit programs, has traditionally interested Christians because it secures relationships at the local level. In this vision of Christian society, interdependence between employers and employees is encouraged as a healthy societal bond. In other words, society becomes stronger and more cohesive as employers rely on workers for their labor, and workers rely on their labor to provide the material necessities of family life. At a broader level, the entire community also depends upon their labor for the production of goods and services needed to support society. It's a vision in which family life, community, and worship are paramount \u2014 but it takes a living wage to realize.\u201d [10] This case is very important since it shows that an absolutely huge amount of people support the minimum wage (ie. most Christians). This quote comes from Christian politicians so they are arguably bias however it is undeniable that one of the most notable Catholics is not going to express his opinion in a bias manner (only in favour of Christianity and the Bible): \u201cA number of well-known Catholics, including Father John Ryan, were early advocates of a higher living wage, pressing the issue even during the era of the New Deal. In Father Ryan's 1912 dissertation A Living Wage, he argues that not only does everyone have a right to live from the bounty of creation, but that they have the right to attain it through work.\u201d [10,11] This argument is powerful since it derives from such a notable Catholic figure. This view is represented, expressed and agreed upon by many Christians, Catholics in particular as the quotation correctly demonstrates. General Agreement: 73% of Americans said that they\u2019d support a minimum wage increase [10,12]! 36% when given the comment to comment said the minimum wage system is generally fair to most Americans and should be increased to make this a fairer system. 60% did not provide a comment and the remaining 4% made a comment against the rising of the minimum wage [12]. Only 4% made comments against the minimum wage! It is evident that there is huge support for the minimum wage among the US general public based on this. Conclusion I have proven with strong and well sourced evidence that the minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour and now I hand it over to my opponent for their neg. case. I affirm the resolution that the minimum wage should be raised. Over to Con!

            "premise": "\"My opponent claims that if we raise the minimum wage, that it would make such a difference that it would make employers not want to hire any laborers.\" My argument against the minimum wage is primarily an argument on economic principle, not an actual dollar amount - I am not arguing that raising the minimum wage to $15/hr is bad but $10/hr is good. I will remind Pro that we are debating \"the minimum wage should be raised\" and not \"the minimum wage should be raised by X\". \"Therefore I can argue that we should increase the wage by one cent.\" Pro did not understand point 1 in my first argument, which was referring to the basic economic principle of of price vs demand. It doesn't matter what the amount of increase is, be it $5 or 1 cent. When the price of anything increases, demand for that good or service decreases. \"And a one cent difference to someone\"s wage, will not deter an employer from hiring someone.\" In fact, all other things being equal, an employer will hire someone who will do the job for $10.00 over someone who will do the job for $10.01. Pro is also suggesting that $0.01/hr increase in wages adds no significant cost to running a business, so let's crunch some numbers for fun: The number hours worked by full time employee: 40 The number of hours worked per year: 2080 The increase per year per employee: $20.08 Now let's take a look at what that would cost Wal-Mart: Wal-Mart employees: 2.1 million [2] Total increase in labor cost: $43,680,000/yr And that's just one cent - proponents of the minimum wage are currently fighting to DOUBLE the current minimum wage. So yes, in fact, even one cent can have very large ramifications to operating a business which might cause the business to think about downsizing it's labor force. \"people also want things like education, clothes, and better food and be able to enjoy themselves.\" I'm sure that most people - those who may not even be of working age at all - want these things too. I'm not too sure how that fit's in to a discussion about the \"livable\" minimum wage, since what you are describing is not what is livable, but what is the minimum luxury. If it is luxury that you want for low paid workers, perhaps you should consider donating a certain percentage of YOUR income every week to the poor, otherwise what you are essentially demanding is that business owners pay charity on your behalf. The minimum wage is not charity and should never be viewed as such. \"...if a mother is raising a children working as a fast food worker, this wage is unlivable.\" Pro will need to provide a citation of the case in question where a mother who works as a fast food worker while raising a family perished due to the fact that the wage she was being paid was in fact \"unlivable\". \"Most minimum-wage workers aren't teenagers these days. They're major breadwinners who need a higher minimum wage in order to keep their families out of poverty.\" I invite Pro to revisit point 3 in my first argument and to at least observe the first 2 pages of the cited source, as these are direct refutations to this claim. \"If this affects only 4% of people, then that mitigates the problems with raising the minimum wage.\" The minimum wage affects 100% of the labor market. \"More jobs and faster growth.\" If raising the minimum wage created positive economic growth, and we could raise it to whatever we pleased, why stop at $15? Why not $20? Why not $2,000? [1] http://thehill.com... [2] http://www.businessinsider.com...",

Due to time constraints, I'm only going to be using this round for rebuttals. == Unemployment == A large part of Pro's case is based on the premise that an increase in MW will result in higher unemployment rates.

However, I can just as easily throw tons of studies right back at him to show that the unemployment effect does *not* exist: \"John Schmitt (2013), conducted a literature review and found that the minimum wage has 'no discernible effect on employment' [1]. Card and Krueger (1994), looked at the 1992 rise in New Jersey\"s minimum wage and found no evidence of negative employment effects [2]. In fact, they found, after comparing evidence from stores in eastern Pennsylvania where the MW remained constant or to stores that were already paying near wages near the MW, that the minimum wage actually worked to increase employment. Dube et al. (2010) replicated the findings of Card and Krueger and found no negative employment effects after adjusting for spatial heterogeneity [3]. Next, a meta-analysis by Doucouliagos and T. D. Stanley (2009) looked at 64 minimum wage studies from 1972 to 2007, and found that, after adjusting for public selection bias, that the evidence is clear that the minimum wage has no effect on employment [4]. Belman and Wolfson conducted a similar meta study on literature revealed since 2000 and, using 27 studies, found no statistically significant negative employment effects [5]\" [6]. The academic literature on this topic is divided to the point that simply citing professional statistical studies is not useful in determining the impact of MW on employment. The fundamental problem with the idea that increased labor costs would result in more unemployment is that demand for labor is not elastic. Companies don't just hire employees simply because they can afford to -- they have the number of employees they do because they *need* that many in order fulfill consumer demand. Thus, when faced with an increase in expenses, 'killing jobs' is one of the *last* things an employer will resort to offset it. For that reason alone, we should be skeptical of any \"evidence\" of MW increases having an unemployment effect. And anyways, if I am able to successfully defend my case next round, then I would have affirmed that MW hikes result in a net profit boost for businesses, thus making the notion of the unemployment effect absurd. That all said, there actually is one particular study which I would like refute empirically, as it is mentioned numerous times throughout Pro's rebuttal -- Neumark and Wascher's study on teenage unemployment. This study has been demonstrated to have many severe methodological flaws in it, the most damning of which was brought to attention in a commentary written by Card and Krueger: \"Neurmark and Wascher's conclusions hinge entirely on whether they hold constant the effect of a variable reportedly measuring 'the proportion of the age group enrolled in school.' When they include this variable, the minimum wage index has a statistically insignificant and positive contemporaneous effect on teenage employment... Neumark and Wascher's enrollment measure clearly is based on a false dichotomy. Not only may teenagers who work also be enrolled in school, but they usually are\" [7]. Because this study is founded upon such a blatantly false assumption (among several others listed out in the commentary), its results and all the studies which cite those results should be dismissed. There is simply no reason to believe that MW hikes result in more unemployment. == GDP & Income Growth == Pro's graphs are misleading, as they only look at the nominal value of the MW. If we look at the real (i.e. accounting for inflation) value of the MW over time, we see that it has only *decreased* since 1968 [7]. Turn Pro's graphs against him because they show that the decreasing real value of the minimum wage is correlated with a declines in average income and GDP growth. Moreover, as Pro notes, there were two instances where the increase in nominal MW did result in economic growth -- BOTH of these were before 1968, when the real MW was increasing as well, thus strengthening the correlation between MW hikes and economic expansion. - I have refuted both of Pro's main harms against the MW. The rest of his case got absorbed into my own case's discussion of whether or not businesses' profits benefit from MW hikes. The resolution remains negated. - [1] http://www.cepr.net...

            "premise": "The benefits of moderate and proportional increases to the minimum wage outweigh the risks.I assume that Pro's argument against minimum wage increases will be something along these lines: an increase in the minimum wage should translate into higher prices, contributing to inflation and nullifying the increase.In the real world, however, economic forces are much more complicated. However much theory says it shouldn't, study after study shows that base wage increases have a minimal impact on prices and that base wage increases are strongly correlated to economic improvement. Economists differ strongly on the relative value and importance of the minimum wage, but history shows that economic strength typically improves after minimum wage hikes and that jurisdictions with higher minimum wages enjoy stronger economies than jurisdictions with lower or no minimum wage law. \"According to a poll of 500 small business owners conducted on behalf of Small Business Majority, 67 percent of these firms favor boosting the minimum wage from the current rate of $7.25 an hour and adjusting it annually as the cost of living rises\" [1]Why? Because savvy small businesses understand that minimum wage hikes improve the economy, stabilize turnover, and contribute little to inflation.Small businesses in Australia account for 95% of GDP [2] compared to 46% U.S. GDP and Australia's minimum wage is twice that of U.S. ($16.88 USD) yet maintains unemployment at 5.7%, [3] and provides a statistically better quality of life than most US population centers(4 largest cities rank in global top ten). Look at Costco vs. Sam's Club. Costco pays 42% better average salary as well as better benefits, yet its grocery prices average 3.6% LESS because Costco employee turnover is 6% vs Sam's Club's 44% turnover[4] Happier, more experienced employees provide better customer service and bring in $21,805 profit per employee compared to Sam's Club's $11,615 profit per employee.Minimum wage earners only represent 5.2% of the US workforce, and that's mostly comprised of high school and college age people. [5] One might not suppose that adjusting the wage for this small sector would significantly impact the economy, but minimum wage increases ripple up into middle class salaries as employers retain wage hierarchies. This has the effect of pushing unused capital at the top of the pyramid down to the bottom where it is quickly spent, improving consumption and economic demand, which leads to higher employment. Minimum wage increases drive employers to improve efficiency. Rather than relying on a pool of cheap labor to take up the slack, employers seek out tech improvements, working smarter not harder.The higher the bottom rung is set, the more people prefer employment to criminal alternatives, boosting the market.Minimum wage laws improve work ethics, reduce absenteeism, and reduce turnover. In tandem, these effects result in significant improvements in efficiency across the economy.

            "premise": "You have conceded that raising the minimum wage in \"very small increments will not destroy our economy\". You stated that the minimum wage in your state is raising from $8 to $8.75 in one year. If this raise in minimum wage was voted on by the voters of your state, then it would go outside your state's constitution to not raise the minimum wage. I do not know what state you reside in, but $8.75/hr in rural Mississippi, may provide a basic living for one individual working full-time, however, in Manhattan, NY, you'll likely not survive on $8.75. The current Federal minimum wage is $7.25 and has not been adjusted since 2009. According to http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com... , the Federal Minimum wage in 1968 was $1.60, adjusted for inflation would amount to $10.90 per hour. So according to your statement, \"we must raise the minimum wage to keep up with inflation\", Obama is shorting those federal employees and your state has made a nice first step. America $7.25, China $2.02/hr, China is communist, the US has a regulated free market. In china the government provides many rations such as food, housing, transportation, healthcare, this all varies depending your status. In America subsidies are minimal and many subsidies are under constant attack by politicians. According to http://livingwage.mit.edu... , 2 working adults, with 2 children (with a poverty line of $23,283) would need to earn $51,224 a year to meet the US median living wage. The MIT website states that, \" A typical family of four (two working adults, two children) needs to work more than 3 full-time minimum-wage jobs (a 68-hour work week per working adult) to earn a living wage.\" The answer to China is not to compete with them on who can keep their wages the lowest. The solution is to place tariffs on China's goods so that we can afford to pay a living wage in this country. China understands that the relationship between us and them is mutually beneficial and China is currently investing heavily in America and our future. As stated in this article, http://nationalinterest.org..., and by \"the Census Bureau, median household income peaked in 1999 and has steadily declined with only a slight reprieve before the housing bubble burst. Adjusted for inflation, the 2012 US median income was below the 1989 level.\" Also, https://marketrealist.com..., States that \"The current environment \" just enough economic growth and suppressed wages \" has allowed corporate America to churn out record profits, a factor helping to support this year\"s big rally in stocks.\" I will go so far as to say we should increase minimum wage to $10.10 by next year, but as evidenced by the current protest at fast food chains and big box stores that many families and individuals are finding it difficult enough to survive that they are just like the Doobie Brothers and they're taking it to the streets. I would argue any employer unable raise the minimum wage given to their employees by 75 cents every five years, was not a financially viable business to begin with.",

            "discussionTitle": "The Minimum Wage",
            "conclusion": "The Minimum Wage",
            "premise": "Monopsony:Pro's source does not show that urban labor markets are monopsony\u2014it argues that they are a sort of \u2018oligopsony\u2019, something between perfect competition and monopsony. This is an important distinction\u2014the paper argues that a minimum wage would not have just positive effects in this environment, as it would with a monopsony, but both raise wages and drive some employers out of businesses. Another important distinction between monopsony and oligopsony is their causes. A monopsony is simply a monopoly buyer\u2014but an oligopsony is more complicated than that. The author\u2019s of Pro\u2019s source theorize that the main reason labor markets aren\u2019t perfectly competitive is that workers have heterogeneous preferences. Workers prefer different kinds of work. They live in different places, and thus may have different transportation costs for the same job. Or they may experience the same transportation costs differently\u2014one person may dislike a 1 hour commute more than another person. So an employee might accept a lower wage in exchange for a shorter commute. Thus, wages may be lower than a worker\u2019s marginal productivity. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a minimum wage will be beneficial. Remember that the paper concludes that under an oligopsony, a minimum wage will decrease employment in some places and increase it in others. It\u2019s not like a monopsony, where higher wages would mean that that employer will increase employment. Some people with low wages might get higher wages, but others will lose their jobs. Even if the minimum wage worked as it was supposed to, and it raised wages with the employment and disemployment effects canceling each other out\u2014workers would still be worse off. Remember that workers with low wages accept those low wages in return for other benefits\u2014they like that type of work more than other, higher paid work, or they\u2019d rather have low wages near home than higher wages with more transportation costs.Pro ignores my argument about different levels of labor market competitiveness in different areas. Even if an area has monopsony employment power, that doesn\u2019t mean a minimum wage will help. If the minimum wage was everywhere, it would help in the monopsony area and hurt everywhere else. And if it varied by area\u2014having a minimum wage in the monopsony area and not anywhere else\u2014it would drive the demand for labor away from the place with a minimum wage and toward other places. This same logic applies to monopsonistic competition. Even if politicians could find the exact right minimum wage\u2014an amount between the competitive and monopsonistic wage\u2014it would be different for different places, depending on the level of competition among employers. If a uniform minimum wage was set across the nation, then it couldn\u2019t be between the competitive and monopsonistic wage rate everywhere\u2014it would raise wages for some people, but lower employment elsewhere. If you had different minimum wages in different places, not only would some of them probably be set at the wrong level, but it would drive labor demand away from high minimum wage areas and toward lower minimum wage areas. This is harmful because 1) employers produce things in the place where it\u2019s most efficient to do so\u2014artificially moving labor demand around reduces efficiency, and 2) the lower demand in high minimum wage areas could drive the minimum wage above the competitive wage, even if it was between the monopsonistic and competitive wage before.Big Increases, Small Decreases:Again, this is irrelevant. My point is that if businesses raise prices in response to a minimum wage, the demand for their goods would decrease, and thus those businesses would demand less labor.Price Elasticity:It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cessential\u201d the goods are. Even if you don\u2019t care about reductions in \u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d for its own sake, any such reduction means that the sellers of such goods don\u2019t need as much labor, and thus will reduce employment. Marginal Productivity:Pro argues that a higher minimum wage has psychological effects, like people feeling properly treated, or people respecting Chinese products more if their workers were paid more. However, he has absolutely no evidence for these claims. I could just as easily say that a minimum wage makes people lazy and lowers their productivity. But obviously, that wouldn\u2019t count as an argument, because it\u2019s just an unsubstantiated assertion.What matters is not whether marginal productivity can be changed, but whether the minimum wage changes it. If it doesn\u2019t, then my theory is correct. And Pro has provided absolutely no evidence that the minimum wage changes marginal productivity. The only evidence he had, the Locke study, concludes that wage increases only increase productivity if they\u2019re tied to productivity increases\u2014it says nothing about minimum wages increasing productivity because of the psychological effects Pro claims.Empirics:Meta-studies about the minimum wage showing publication bias have been criticized for statistical problems\u2014\u201cIn other disciplines, meta-analyses of published papers--generally focusing on clinical trials--provide some evidence consistent with a bias towards publication of significant results (see, for example, Berlin et al. [1989]), under the (reasonable) presumption that the parameter of interest, such as the effect of a drug, should be constant across studies. In economics, however, the parameters of statistical models are more likely to vary across samples---especially when the samples cover different time periods--because of changed behavior (e.g., Lucas [1976]), model misspecification, or measurement changes. The possibility of parameter instability makes it difficult to apply standard meta-analysis techniques to the economics literature, because these techniques draw inferences regarding publication bias from changes in estimates across samples.\u201d [1] In addition, if the minimum wage does, in fact, cause unemployment, then we should expect publication bias. If the minimum wage does cause unemployment, then papers showing that it doesn\u2019t would be more likely to have lower data quality, fewer statistical controls, or other problems, and thus should be less likely to be published. For example, the Card and Krueger study Pro mentions has been criticize for using phone surveys instead of payroll data\u2014further studies on the same area using payroll data instead of surveys failed to replicate their results. [2] So, if there was publication bias, it could be because studies showing that the minimum wage was effective tended to be of lower quality, not because journal editors were biased.

            "premise": "My opponent is either misreading statistics or intentionally misleading people here but either way I'll now explain why these points aren't sufficient to demonstrate the truth of his claims. 1. So in his first contention he claims that businesses would have more money to employ people without a minimum wage. However, this fails for several reasons: A: Many companies simply pocket the money and increase the salary of CEO's rather than employing more workers B: It doesn't really matter if more people get employed if the jobs are not sufficient to support them anyway and require welfare form the government (see my earlier contentions which have still not been refuted) C: There isn't evidence given to demonstrate that this out weighs my previous contentions even if you agreed with him and ignored my refutations. And in regards to his graph, correlation does not imply causation and that does not account for multiple economic factors such as the housing crash. 2. My opponent brings up statistics regarding the demographics for what type of people receive minimum wage, however this is not an accurate representation. I'm a bit short on time again so I'll quote an article that refutes this pretty well and is more articulate than I'd currently be: \"When describing who would see a raise if the minimum wage were increased, it is important to look at everyone who earns between the current minimum wage and the proposed new one, as well as workers earning just above the new minimum wage (who would likely also see a small pay increase as employers move to preserve internal wage ladders). The typical worker who would be affected by an increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by 2015 looks nothing like the part-time, teen stereotype: She is in her early thirties, works full-time, and may have a family to support. Our analysis of workers who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage shows: The average age of affected workers is 35 years old; 88 percent of all affected workers are at least 20 years old; 35.5 percent are at least 40 years old; 56 percent are women; 28 percent have children; 55 percent work full-time (35 hours per week or more); 44 percent have at least some college experience. Claims that mostly teenagers would see a raise if the minimum wage were increased are sometimes based erroneously upon the official Bureau of Labor Statistics data on workers who are earning the federal minimum wage or below\"i.e. workers earning exactly $7.25 per hour or less. These data do not provide an accurate picture of who would see a raise if the minimum wage were increased because they exclude all workers from the 19 states with higher state minimum wages, along with all workers making slightly above the current federal minimum wage but below the proposed minimum, all of whom would see a raise if the minimum wage were increased. Also, see a comprehensive analysis of the impact of raising the minimum wage in Raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 would give working families, and the overall economy, a much-needed boost.\" http://www.epi.org... The major flaw in my opponent's contentions is that they misuse statistics which is very misleading. For these reasons, I negate.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should raise the Federal Minimum wage standard to",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. This round I will focus on the economic and sociological affects that this will have on our nation. Contention 1: Wage Increase=/= More Jobs Wages will not increase jobs For instance the wage will increase and the employers will have to either raise prices in order to shelter the burden of the increased wages (which we'll get to this in another Contention) and the second is that we have roughly 500,000 jobs lost due to the cutting of jobs in order for business can still compete with others at low prices. You see that CBO actually supports my point [1]This will also hurt teenagers in the Workforce making employers having to cut down on their hours and/or favoring adults and a older population. Let's take Wisconsin for example when the minimum wage was last raised the unemployment soared from 15.8%-19.8%. [2]Imagine that on a US wide or even a world wide scale. This is an important factor that we have to look at here since a great amount of people who mainly rely on the minimum wage are teenagers and unskilled labor and if the very people that it was intended to help are being significantly harmed then this plan should not be enacted. It has been estimated originally before the last rise in the minimum wage that it would end up costing well over 300,000 jobs for teens and this ended up holding true as the last raising of unemployment saw teenage unemployment jump from 4.4% to 10.2%. [12] This causes a huge problem in this debate as we can see in a study done as the minimum wage rises we see a higher drop out level in schools. This increases the problems in the labor force as we will see more unskilled workers as well as more people that do not have a good education. This lack of education will cause a dramatic harm of these workers as it will show that they will have dramatically lower wages and this will cycle through causing a higher demand for another wage raise which restarts this dramatic cycle. [13] We have no choice, but to stop this cycle and that way we will see a betterment of our workforce and it will begin to lift us out of poverty. Studies have also been done and have shown that this will result in an decrease the unskilled labor force will receive when training for jobs and this will hurt them even more since they will be unable to pick up enough skills to help their careers later in the future. \"Economists have studied the job-destroying features of a higher minimum wage.Estimates of the job losses of raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 have ranged from 625,000 to 100,000 lost jobs.It is important to recognize that the jobs lost are mainly entry-level jobs. By destroying entry-level jobs, a higher minimum wage harms the lifetime earnings prospects of low-skilled workers. \" [14]1 million jobs lost subtracted from the 900,000 that will be lifted from the poverty line and that equals 100,000 people unemployed and living in poverty. Not to mention the other side effects from raising the minimum wage such as loss of jobs for teenagers. The last time Congress raised the minimum wage in July of 2009, 600,000 teen jobs disappeared within 6 months. [3]With the last minimum wage teen unemployment percentages went from 14.8% to 27.1% [4]. The Inflation will also rise, but let's look at the minimum wage increase. It's going to go from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour which is over a 25% increase. (in the US) This will cause prices to rise by 25% again. [5] Contention 2: Inflation Why don't we raise the minimum wage to $20 per hour or why not make everyone a millionaire and have them make $million per hour? The answer to this question is a very simple one and it's simply causes prices to increase and inflation to rise. [6] You see this is a lesson in supply and demand is that when the minimum wage is increased it will cost more for companies to hire and train employees causing more people not to be hired, this results in less jobs, the costs of businesses also rise to keep up with the increased wages and that this ends up causing inflation. [7] \"The federal increase from $4.25 to $5.15 costs California families an average of $133 more per year for the goods they normally purchase. Since higher-income families spend more, they would pay more in absolute terms than lower-income families: up to $234 per year compared to $84 per year.\" [15] Here we can see that when the minimum wage is raised that we will see the costs will not only eliminate jobs as I have shown in my previous contention, but the burden will be placed on consumers and this harms the average household as they now have to pay more. Not more as in numerical value, but the adjusted income which takes into affect what then occurs after the raising of the minimum wage. You see this will be a continuous cycle. If you continue to rise the minimum wage then inflation will fallow causing the minimum wage to rise again and again until we end up with a problem like Zimbabwe. When the minimum wage was risen once more the US saw products prices increase via inflation by a factor of 10. [8][9] Contention 3: Inflation's affect on Global Trade Here when we observe the above chart we can see as the minimum wage increase the value of the dollar decreases. This only creates a terrible cycle that the average citizen is unable to get out of. The reason that this is important is because we would be raising the minimum wage to meet living requirements, but the thing that makes it contradictory is that prices will skyrocket causing for another call to raise the minimum wage to meet this resolution. It will be a vicious cycle that will the dollar to be worthless and have a devastating effect on the Global Economy. The higher the inflation rate also affects international trade as the higher the inflation is the higher the interest rates. [10]According to Paul Krugman, the devaluation of the dollar (caused by the resolution here) will lead to a decrease in people people buying product which hurts the economy of the nation. [11] People would have to spend more money, becuase of the inflation and with the devaluing of the dollar we can see that if I spent a dollar on the US maket in the 1960s it would be a whole lot more then if I spent a dollar on the US market today. Economist Gagnon has shown that devaluing of the US dollar caused by the inflation can lead to a massive increase in import prices and since we get many of our things from abroad it will be even harder to get that new XBox video game you were wanting. He also shown that it harms nation's holding our debt, because the value is worthless and makes other nation's not want to purchase from us. The US in turn raises the interest rates, but we cannot afford to raise them any higher. [16]Why's this you may ask? If we observe the graph bellow the US interest rate on debt alone dwarfs most of the US federal budget. The US federal debt is getting so enourmously large that the US is getting to a breaking point in economic trade to were we have to pay off a massive amount of debt or commit financial suicide and raise the interest rates. If we observe the chart bellow we can see the different rates that a our interest rates will cost the US in the future. We have no choice, but cannot decend this slippery slope and further devaluing of the US dollar will harm the American economy by forcing us to lose jobs and rely more on imports causing the the nation to slide into the interest disadvantage furthering harming our nation's economy causing a world wide economic collapse greater than that of the Great Depression and rising the minimum wage will cause us to go flying off the fiscal cliff.

            "premise": "Rules 1. No trolling 2. Please keep some sort of format when responding 3. BOP is shared 4. 1st round is a constructive speech round Definitions Federal minimum wage: The wage set by the American government as the lowest possible wage for American workers set at $7.25 an hour. https://www.dol.gov...... I negate the resolution that the US federal government should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for the following contentions: Contention 1: States are much better actors The economies of different states vary drastically for a reason. Certain states may be able to only support one minimum wage due to circumstances such as the labor pool, average education of workers, and how many businesses pay at minimum wage to any of their employees. Mr. Holzer, a previous chief economist of the Department of Labor wrote for the Brookings Institute in 2015 and has stated the following: \u201cIn a city like Washington D.C. where unemployment among those with a high school education or less is at a worrisome 15%, jobless rates will almost certainly rise. Many employers will be very reluctant to pay high wages to workers whose skills \u2013 including the ability to speak English, in the case of many immigrants \u2013 are so modest. A likely result would be not only increases in unemployment but also drops in formal labor force activity (where workers work or search for legal jobs) and perhaps some growth in undocumented work among immigrants.\u201d http://www.brookings.edu...... We can see proof of this in the status quo with the failed project in Washington D.C where the minimum wage was raised, which failed miserably as there was little job growth in industries with low-wage workers as well as the fact that benefits and expenses on employees were cut so businesses could stay in the red. http://www.forbes.com...... This gives a valid example of how a minimum wage can actually harm the very people we are trying to help federally, which applies to the whole country. However, individual states are more understanding of their own limitations and can fairly regulate, and possibly raise, the minimum wage to fit the needs of the people while not being too stressful on the job market. A much more reasonable way to fix the problem would be to mandate that states raise the minimum wage by at least five percent, and at most 15%. We could see a moderate increase in revenue for people that could push more people into jobs with a higher incentive to join the labor market. However, as it stands, we cannot pass the resolution on the pretext that we are relying on the federal minimum wage, and not the states. Contention 2: Increase price for consumers Businesses exist for a one, primary goal: to make a profit. So, if we raise the minimum wage, we would see that businesses would be paying more on their employees and less on their products while demanding a higher price to still maintain a profit. A fifteen-dollar minimum wage, which is a huge increase for many states, would no doubt have this affect. In fact, we can look at Breitbart in August of 2015 which shows this exact problem occurring as pizzas, an everyday consumer item, cost thirty dollars at one pizzeria. This is only one example listed in the article. There have been estimates in the article from the National Federation of independent businesses that point out other harms as well as illuminate the problems associated with the minimum wage hike as well which includes the following escribing a possibility of legislation that would come through the state congress in California: \u201c\u2026The state\u2019s 2013 legislation raising California\u2019s minimum wage rate to $9 per hour in 2014 and $10 by 2016 would shrink the state\u2019s economy by $5.7 billion in the next 10 years and would cost the state roughly 68,000 jobs\u201363% of which would come from small businesses.\u201d http://www.breitbart.com...... We can see another example of this problem if we were to look at the American Enterprise Institute in 2016 where it is shown that: \u201c\u2022 In our weekly survey of ten of Chipotle\u2019s markets, we found the company implemented price increases in half of the surveyed markets this week\u2014San Francisco, Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Orlando. In most markets, the price increases have been limited to beef and average about 4% on barbacoa and steak, toward the lower end of management\u2019s expectation for a 4% to 6% price increase on beef. \u2022 San Francisco, however, saw across-the-board price increases averaging over 10%, including 10% increases on chicken, carnitas (pork), sofritas (tofu), and vegetarian entrees along with a 14% increase on steak and barbacoa.We believe the outsized San Francisco price hike was likely because of increased minimum wages (which rose by 14% from $10.74 per hour to $12.25 on May 1) as well as scheduled minimum wage increases in future years (to $13 next year, $14 in 2017, and $15 in 2018).\u201d https://www.aei.org...... We can clearly see from the examples shown that there is no such thing as a minimum wage that does not affect prices for consumers, showing that there is a balance that needs to be achieved between the personal need of people working the minimum wage and the consumer\u2019s need for affordable goods and services. Since the fifteen dollar minimum wage does not account for this, we need to negate, if only to keep a fair and balanced system that can be tweaked later to bring about better effects. Contention 3: Counter-plan I will concede the following, the minimum wage needs to be increased moderately and on the state level to ensure that the previously mentioned points do not take effect. What also needs to happen is that we need to guarantee that there is a happy medium between the hike of the price for consumer goods and the individual need of money to support families for the people on the minimum wage. That being said, we should also incentivize getting into higher education and high-skilled jobs through prioritizing education in less affluent regions of the country and try to make college more attractive to those who come from poverty. Finally, we need to ensure that small businesses do not fail, so an annual audit of small businesses in all states should be done by the Department of Labor to ensure that progress is being made economically and to combat poverty and raise the standard of living. This will also help determine what states would need higher minimum or lower minimum wages. Until my opponent can refute my counter plan as a worse idea, we can\u2019t pass today\u2019s resolution with a clean conscience as we can tell there is a much better solution that could be enacted. As clearly shown, one must negate the resolution and favor the counter plan instead to ensure that the previous points mentioned will not occur and we can have job security. Thank you.",

            "conclusion": "Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour will benefit the US economy",
            "premise": "To begin, I want to thank my daring opponent Jevinigh for taking this debate. I wish her well and I know she will present me with a good challenge. This is, after all, the purpose of these debating engagements.As I stated in ROUND 1, I will be defending the position that increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour will mostly benefit the U.S. economy; I will also be arguing that any proposed minimum wage hike should be indexed to inflation, to allow it to rise with the increasing cost of living. A minimum wage hike will increase the number of jobs in the United States and is likely to increase the nation's gross domestic product--this according to the congressional budget office's latest projections on such a hypothetical raise [1]--and it will have a mostly positive impact on low wage workers, or those that make minimum wage or less to about 5 times the poverty threshold [1]; to give you an example of what this means, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would not only directly benefit those making the new minimum wage but it would also benefit a single person family (working) that makes up to $68,825 per year, by putting more money in his pocket--this according to the congressional budget office's estimation [1][2]. And of course larger working families will see even greater monetary rewards [1].But before we get into that discussion, I'm going to demonstrate in this ROUND why a minimum wage increase is badly needed and why failing to raise it will only continue to hurt the nation's workforce, which has seen the purchasing value of its wages go down over the last 30 years because of inflation [3][4].Purchasing Power of the Dollar isn't what it use to beBecause of inflation, the vast majority of America's workforce has either seen the purchasing value of its wages stagnate or decrease steadily [3]; low wage earners have seen the value of their wages decrease the most [4]. In comparison, the nation's top 1% of earners saw their incomes rise by 31.4% from 2009 to 2012, comfortably exceeding the 9% inflation rate during that period [5][6]. While the value of earnings of the top 1% of earners outpaces the rate of inflation, the vast majority of working Americans are seeing the value of their wages stagnate (upper-middle class) or decrease (below). Income inequality in the U.S. is now at the highest its ever been since 1928 right before the Great Depression [5]. According to economist/professor Emmanuel Saez at the University of Berkeley, the top 1% of earners in the nation get 22.5% of all pre-tax income while 90% of remaining earners get less than half, 49.6% [5]!Low-wage earners have the seen the value of their wages decrease the most. For the last 40 years, the federal minimum wage has badly fallen behind inflation in real terms. Studies by the U.S. Labor Department, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Pew Research Center have shown that, accounting for inflation, the current minimum wage of $7.25 is even less than what it was in 1968, when it had a value of $8.56 in 2012 dollars (see graph below) [5][7][8]. The U.S. Labor Department has concluded that today's minimum wage workers are paid even less in real terms because of inflation when compared to their 1968 minimum wage counterparts [8]! In fact, since it was last raised to $7.25 in 2009, the federal minimum wage has lost about 5.8% of its purchasing value due to inflation [7].In a 2012 study, The Centers for Economic and Policy Research concluded that if the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since it was first enacted in the 1930s, it would now be at $10.52 an hour [5].To provide an accurate sense of how badly lagging behind the federal minimum wage now is, in 1968 a full-time minimum wage worker earned about $20,000 per year in today's dollars; today a full-time minimum wage worker earns about $15,000 per year [4]. In 1968 a full-time minimum wage worker earned about half of the average annual income during that period; today a full-time minimum wage worker earns about 37% of the average annual income [4]. A steady decline.While the price of food, services, goods, and healthcare go up both in terms of cost and inflation, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has significantly eroded over the years [3]. While the average price of the McDonald's Big Mac has risen from $2.71 in 2004 to $4.62 in 2014--an increase of 70.1% over 10 years--the federal minimum wage has only increased by $2.10 to its current rate over the same period, or by 41% [9][10]. Over the years these less than adequate minimum wage increases accumulate and they create poverty were previously there wasn't any or where it was less pronounced.As the graph above shows, when accounting for inflation, the current minimum wage has less purchasing power now than it did in the late 1960s. In order to rectify the reduced value of the minimum wage, it needs to be elevated to at least $10.00 in today's dollar value! Failure to do so will only expand poverty in America and deepen the crisis facing low wage workers.Raising the Minimum Wage would directly benefit 21.4% of the worforceCurrently 3.8 million workers are paid the nation's minimum wage, but raising the wage to $10.10 would directly benefit 21.4% of the workforce--about 30 million workers--by putting more money in their pocket [5][4].21.4% of the nation's workforce would now have more money in their pocket; the accumulated losses caused by inflation over the years straining the minimum wage worker would be effectively eliminated! A fierce proponent of this idea, the current President has advocated tying this proposed minimum wage hike to inflation, that way any adverse effects created by inflation are effectively handled [11]. This is an even better idea!Recognizing the current crisis facing the nation's million of low wager earners, President Obama has already signed an exectuve order raising the minimum wage for federal workers from $7.25 to $10.10 [11]. The rest of the nation should follow this example.Who directly benefits?As of 2012, 49% of all minimum wage workers are 25 years old or older (see graphic below). However, more than 85.5% of all minimum wage workers are 20 years old or older (not teenagers) [7]. 55% of federal minimum wage earners work full time [4]. But of course many more people making less than $10.10 per hour would see a pay raise. As I stated earlier, nearly 30 million workers would get a pay raise with the minimum wage increase; 9 million of these workers are parents [4]. 57.3% of those who would be effected are women [7]; a low minimum wage is one of the reasons why females continue to make 77 cents per dollar that a man makes [12]. Increasing the minimum to $10.10 would help close that gap by 5% [12].And increasing the minimum wage is the sensible thing to do. Already 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum [7]. Numerous business executives and CEOs are in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10. Costco President and CEO, Craig Jelenik, has come out in favor of this proposal by President Obama, stating \"Instead of minimizing wages, we know it\u2019s a lot more profitable in the long term to minimize employee turnover and maximize employee productivity, commitment and loyalty\" [5]; executives of GAP have come out in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10 as well [12]. Already a full 85% of small businesses pay wages higher than the minimum [4].Conservative estimates by the congressional budget office (CBO)--a federal agency within the U.S. government that provides economic data to congress--places the total immediate gains of raising the minimum wage to $10.10 at $5 billion for working families that make less than the poverty threshold (live in poverty); their income would increase by about 3% and 900,000 people would be moved above the poverty threshold [1].The CBO also projects that families making one to three times the poverty threshold would see $12 billion in additional real income; families making three to six times the poverty threshold would see $2 billion in additional real income [1].Overall, the CBO estimates that the nation's poverty would be reduced and that a total of $2 billion would be immediately added to the U.S economy because of the minimum wage increase [1].2 out of 3 Americans Support Raising the Minimum WageFinally, a large majority of Americans approve of raising the federal minimum wage. As inflation continues to increase and as wealthy employers increasingly keep more of their profits and distribute less to their employees, widening the income gap, Americans are recognizing the need to increase the federal minimum wage! A recent Wall Street Journal/CNN poll shows that 63% of Americans support raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour [13][14]; some polls show even greater support for hiking the federal minimum wage [4].[1] (http://cbo.gov...)[2] (http://aspe.hhs.gov...)[3] (http://www.epi.org...)[4] (http://www.epi.org...)[5] (http://www.mybanktracker.com...)[6] (http://www.bls.gov...)[7] (http://www.pewresearch.org...)[8] (http://www.dol.gov...)[9] (http://news.yahoo.com...)[10] (http://www.bls.gov...)[11] (http://www.foxnews.com...)[12] (http://www.whitehouse.gov...)[13] (http://www.cnn.com...)[14] (http://online.wsj.com...)",

            "premise": "In ROUND 2 my opponent makes several points--including accusing the U.S. Federal Reserve of forcing inflation to benefit the U.S. economy. She also accuses this federal organization of \"crook[ing] the books\" to make the numbers it reports look good to the American people. This second specific point is an allegation of wild conspiracy and I consider it irrelevant to the debate; however, she does use this argument to indicate that inflation is actually higher than what is reported, because of alterations to the way the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is computed since the early 1970s [1]. (My opponent is actually wrong. Excluding the prices of fuel and food from the CPI has been the way the U.S. Federal Reserve has been computing this parameter for decades now--not beginning in 2009, as she claims [2].)I want to point out that if inflation is actually higher than what the U.S. Federal Reserve is reporting, than this should motivate us even more to hike the minimum wage and index it to inflation! This means that the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage is even less than what the U.S. Labor Department is already reporting--and it's reporting a significant decrease in the value of the minimum wage over the last four decades in real terms with great worry [3]. (However, the inflation rate as reported is accurate; my opponent is in fact mistaken about the way the CPI is traditionally computed since the 1970s [2].)My opponent also claims that worker output should decide \"pay scales in a real economy\". I will demonstrate why she's correct, and why the 20% increase in worker productivity observed over this last decade should correspond with an increase in the federal minimum wage [4].I will demonstrate this and other reasons for hiking the federal minimum wage in this ROUND.Inflation has many causes, which is why the Federal Minimum Wage should be Indexed to InflationMy opponent argues that raising the federal minimum wage would be pointless, as inflation would eventually eat the gains caused by increasing the minimum wage. And on this point she is moderately right; however, inflation has many causes, as economists point out, and it's a healthy economic trend in any growing economy--as long as it stays within limits [5]. Inflation is caused when demand for a product or service outstrips supply, which causes prices to go up; it can also be caused when new popular technology is introduced--some brand names demand higher prices; but it can also be caused by the depletion of natural resources, by natural disasters, by an increase in production costs, by the deregulation of banks, by government regulation and taxation, by business monopolies, by the expansion of the money supply, and various other reasons [5]. Inflation is natural and unavoidable in any economy. But too much of it can present problems, which is why the federal government tries to regulate it wherever it can [5]. Increasing wages can also create inflation if a business passes on the wage increase to consumers, but this doesn't always happen [6]. Recently, inflation has caused even pay raises among middle class workers to be fruitless, as the modest pay increases simply aren't enough to deal with the deleterious effects of inflation, especially as the income gap grows between well-to-do employers, who are increasingly keeping more of their profits, and all other wage earners [7][4]. As I demonstrated in ROUND 2, the nation's wealthiest Americans are generating income comfortably exceeding the rate of inflation; the middle class has seen either stagnant wage growth or negative wage growth when accounting for the effect; the lower classes have seen the worse decline in income over this last decade [4]. Raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 would eliminate the accumulated deleterious effects of inflation over the years for low wage earners; linking (or \"indexing\") it to inflation would ensure the effects are prevented in the future.Four states--Florida, Oregon, Washington, Vermont--have already indexed their state minimum wage to inflation, and Minnesota is currently proposing to do so [8]. After raising the state minimum wage and indexing, the state of Washington saw no negative impact on employment some initially feared would be there [9]. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10, and then having it adjusted every year to keep pace with the rising cost of living [10]. It is a congressional bill President Obama endorses and continues to endorse [11], particularly in light of the recent executive order he enacted which hiked the federal minimum wage for federal contractors from $7.25 to $10.10 [12].Since 2000, worker productivity is up 20%In ROUND 2, my opponent claims that worker productivity should decide their pay wages. I whole-heartedly agree! That's why I endorse raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. Since 2000 worker productivity has risen 20%, even while median hourly wages among all workers have increased by only 3% [4]. Even more astounding is that since 2003, median hourly wages among all workers have not increased at all--zero increase in hourly wages--while the income of the nation's richest 5% have increased by 9% [4]! The nation's top 1% of earners have seen their incomes rise by 31.4% since 2009 [13]!This trend is frightening. While the nation's workers have seen their productivity rise, their income has not grown at all; yet the income of the nation's top 5% of earners continues to surge upward [4][5], widening the income gap. When the effects of inflation are incorporated, middle-class workers have seen their incomes stagnant while lower-class workers have seen the value of their wages depreciate, contributing to an uptick in poverty [4][14].Inadequate Increases in the Federal Minimum Wage have Increased PovertyIn the U.S. poverty is measured by whether a household fails to make enough income (or show enough savings) per year to surpass the \"poverty threshold\" assigned by the U.S government for the number of individuals living in the household [15][19]. Because of inadequate increases in the federal minimum wage with respect to inflation and because employee paychecks have become smaller in real terms for the same reason, poverty in the U.S. has increased over the last three decades [16]. The chart below illustrates the \"povery guidelines\" used by the Department of Health and Human Services for assigning poverty to a household based on annual income and number of people. Households making less than the income enumerated for the corresponding number of people in them are classified as \"living in poverty\". The \"poverty guidelines\" are in actuality simplified versions of the \"poverty thresholds\" used by the U.S. Census Bureau [19]. Now, from first appearances via this chart a full-time minimum wage earner might appear to not be in poverty, but if his/her family consist of another person not employed and not receiving any type of income (a child perhaps), that would assign this person as \"living in poverty\", simply because his/her income falls below the poverty guideline for the household number [17].In 2012 the U.S. Census Bureau announced that more than 16% of the U.S. population lived in poverty, including about 20% of all U.S. children, up from 13.2%--39.8 million people--in 2008 [15]. Since the 1980s, relative poverty in the U.S. has consistently exceeded that of other wealthy nations [15]. In 2011, child poverty reached historically high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households; in 2013 a UNICEF report ranked the U.S. as having the second highest relative child poverty rates in the developed world [15].The congressional budget office (CBO) projects that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 will not only add billions of dollars to the economy and provide additional income to low-wage earners, but that it will lift a full 900,000 people out of poverty [18]!American Tax-payers Subsidize Low-wage BusinessesFurthermore, American tax-payers subsidize low-wage businesses. Many low-wage earners have to rely on public assistance such as food stamps or the earned income tax credit (EITC), because their wages are simply too low. Programs like the EITC are useful protections against poverty, but we shouldn\u2019t let them act as subsidies to low-wage employers, who currently pay lower wages because the American taxpayer will make up the difference [14].Raising the minimum wage would shrink the federal deficit, since fewer workers would qualify for the EITC [13]. Finally, a recent study by U.C.-Berkeley concluded that raising the minimum wage would allow 3 million people to quit the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) formerly known as food stamps [13].(Note: R2 = Round 2; S# = Source number)[1] (http://www.bankrate.com...)[2] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[3] S8, R2[4] S3, R2[5] (http://useconomy.about.com...)[6] (http://www.wisegeek.com...)[7] (http://www.washingtonpost.com...)[8] (http://www.ehow.com...)[9] (http://seattletimes.com...)[10] (http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com...)[11] (http://www.nytimes.com...;)[12] S11, R2[13] S5, R2[14] S4, R2[15] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[16] (http://www.worldhunger.org...)[17] (http://poverty.ucdavis.edu...)[18] S1, R2[19] S2, R2",

Furthermore, the minimum wage was invented to protect workers from corporate greed. Reason #2 - The Constitution - The Consdtitution never grants the Federal Government the power to establish a Federal minimum wage, rather, under the Tenth Amendment, as this power isn't prohibited to the states, the power to establish a minimum waste should be given to the states respectively (state minimum wages), or to the people (labour unions) Reason #3 - Economics - In the United States, we are having an inflation rate of 8-13%, and raising the minimum wage will only make it worse. Besides, raising the minimum wage will harm small businesses the most, and since 60% of new jobs come from small businesses, this will significantly raise the unemployment rate.",

            "premise": "\"In the end, the trade-off is clear. People who keep their jobs get more money; those who lose their jobs, or fail to get new ones, suffer.\"Pretty much. \"According to recent research by Richard V. Burkhauser and Joseph J. Sabia if federal minimum wage were increased from $7.25 an hour to $9.50 an hour, only 11.3% of workers who would gain from the increase belong to poor households. [1]\"So raising the minimum wage doesnt just help out the poor, it helps out everyone. Got it. \"Raising the minimum wage is therefore an ineffective anti-poverty proposal.\"But raising the minimum wage benefits more then just those living in poverty as you said earlier. It helps lower, middle, and in some cases even upper classes alike... It still helps those 11.3% of people who do live in poor households as well, and not many other economic moves/forces can potentially reduce poverty by 11.3% \"One of the more effective methods to helping those in poverty is a tax credit for those in poverty\"They also have to be paid by the federal government with money it clearly doesnt have, whereas the minimum wage doesnt cost them nearly as much.... While tax credits do help the poor, that doesnt deny that the minimum wage still has its benefits and overall can be a net positive if used correctly. \"A great example of what would happen if the minimum wage was raised is my very own workplace...... (30 minutes later)... Plenty of small businesses across the country would go under. \"Most minimum wage jobs though ARE owned by big service industry giants like McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King, etc. In fact of the 3.8 million people who work on the minimum wage in the US, well over half of them work in service industries that are primarily food services, namely restaurants and fast-food chains. http://www.bls.gov...That means that raising the minimum wage would primarily effect workers who work for companies that make millions, even billions of dollars a year... Companies that could afford to take a hit like that and still operate business as usual without a tremendous loss of jobs that were poorly paid anyways. In addition to the 50% who work on the minimum wage in the food service industry, another 30% who work on the minimum wage work for retail stores such as Macy's, JCPenny, Walmart, Target, etc who also make millions a year and could more then afford to pay increased wages without being driven into bankruptcy. http://www.bls.gov...==========================================================================================Yes, raising the minimum wage costs job, no one in their right mind will dispute that. But a majority of people who do work minimum wage work for corporate giants who can afford to pay out increased wages without being driven into ruin, and raising the minimum wage helps more then just those living in poverty, it helps the lower and middle class alike. There is also one last argument for raising the minimum wage: curbing inflationhttp://www.financialramblings.com...Inflation has chewed away at the buying power of the dollar so much, that the $7.25 minimum wage today is the market equivalent of making $1.25 back in 1956......So lets look at 2 scenarios:If the minimum wage stays at its current level and inflation continues to grow, then the buying power of the dollar will only decrease over time and cause more people who do work minimum wage to fall into poverty or deeper into poverty. There arent enough tax credits in the world to counter such prospects, especially since those come right out of the federal budget which has a problem with not being balanced. So people go into/deeper into poverty, and the government spends a sh*tload of money it doesnt have to help these people get out of it assuming it chooses to, when it easily could decide not to. Thats what we end up with if we dont raise the minimum wage by just a smidge.On the other hand, if we DO raise the minimum wage it helps out both lower and middle class families, it helps a considerable number of people who are living in poverty get out of poverty (depending on how much it is raised by), and most of these minimum wage jobs are jobs that are owned by massive companies that could afford to pay for such wages without being driven into bankruptcy while other non-retail and non-service sector business do take a bit of a hit. The minimum wage will cause some jobs to be lost yes, but jobs can be added and created just by having a healthy economy and letting the free market be free. What cant be curbed naturally is poverty and inflation, which are the two main things that a raise on the minimum wage can impact the most. That is why I feel the minimum wage should be raised at some point in the future by a reasonable amount.",
