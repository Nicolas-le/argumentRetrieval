            "premise": "\"One of the main arguments for USDA recommendations is that drinking milk or equivalent dairy products will reduce the risk of fractures. But in fact there\"s very little evidence that milk consumption is associated with reduced fractures,\" Willett tells WebMD. (1) This is the biggest thing I hear about milk, is that if you drink milk you will help strengthen your bones. With their being little evidence that this is actually true I will toss this up to hype. This has always been on TV and in magazines. And think of all those adds with stars and the \"milk mustache\", this is just s ploy to sell something plain and simple. \"But many scientific studies have shown an assortment of detrimental health effects directly linked to milk consumption. And the most surprising link is that not only do we barely absorb the calcium in cow\"s milk (especially if pasteurized), but to make matters worse, it actually increases calcium loss from the bones.\" (2) How ironic is it that the very thing people tell you to drink to increase your calcium intake is actually causing you to lose calcium. This is a precious thing that is needed in our bodies and if drinking milk causes you to lose it, then I would say stop drinking milk. Milk acidifies in the body. Our bones/calcium in our bodies work to get rid of that. So instead of helping our bodies do that it is forced to neutralize the acidity of the milk that we just drank. After looking at some of these facts I would say that there are other ways to get calcium in our bodies than just drinking a glass of milk. (1)http://www.webmd.com... (2)http://saveourbones.com...

            "premise": "I thank whoever accepts this debate. *Note: I would like to say that I am not encouraging excessive use of alcohol. It is important to recognize that beer can also have a significant impact on your health if abused. I will clarify that \"moderation\" is one or two drinks a day, and half that for women (because of their ability to break down alcohol), not consumed one directly after the other (http://www.allaboutbeer.com...). Resolution: For the average, healthy person, beer, in moderation, is healthier for you than milk. Of course it there are exceptions. Pregnant women should obviously not drink any alcohol, nor should diabetics or people taking prescription medicine. People also driving or working machinery shouldn't drink as well. I will start by attempting to reproduce a nutritional table showing beer and milk: United States Department of Agriculture Nutritional Data for Milk and Beer ------------------------| MILK (I cup, 2% milk)----- | BEER (1 cup) ----------- Fat (g) ----------------|------------ 5---------------- | --------- 0 ---------------- Fiber (g) --------------| ----------- 0 ---------------- | --------- .5 -------------- Sodium (mg) -------- | ---------- 122 -------------- | ---------- 12 ------------ Cholesterol (mg) ---- | ---------- 20 --------------- | ----------- 0 ------------- Calories -------------- | ---------- 122 -------------- | ---------- 97 ------------ Calories from fat (%)-| ---------- 37 --------------- | ----------- 0 ------------- I don't think this posted properly so here's the link as well. (http://www.milksucks.com...) Beer has no fat or cholesterol but does contain less calories and ten times less sodium than milk. Milk is found to actually cause osteoporosis because dairy products have high levels protein. When protein levels in the body are doubled, but no other nutrient levels are changed, the levels of calcium in the urine increase by about fifty percent (Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 1993). Milk is also loaded with pesticides and antibiotics, because cows are producing ten times the amount of milk they would normally produce, their udders get swollen and drag on the ground. Pus and blood have been foound in milk as a result. Antibiotics are used to treat the inflammation and trace amounts have been found in milk, pesticides are also found in the dairy product. These chemicals can build up and negatively effect the immune system, reproductive system and central nervous system. These pesticides have been linked to cancer as well (http://www.pcrm.org...). In the book Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School's Guide to Healthy Eating, consuming alcohol in moderate levels \"protects against heart disease and ischemic strokes, and mounting evidence [shows] that it protects against diabetes and gallstones\" (Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School's Guide to Healthy Eating, 2001). Alcohol reduces the risk of strokes and heart attacks and increases brain function as well. (http://www.allaboutbeer.com...) Also, if you have time, read this : http://www.guardian.co.uk... OK, that's all for now. I look forward to a fun debate with whoever decides to accept it.",

            "premise": "Stating that chocolate milk tastes better is purely opinion. People do indeed drink chocolate milk more than \"that other milk\" you describe it as, but this does not make it healthy to humans. To be complete with this debate, I'll be covering all aspects of chocolate milk, including: Its elemental buildup, its usage today, and how it influences the human body. After graphing the general overview of chocolate milk, I will then compare it to the overview of \"that other milk\". Sound good? Good. The most common way chocolate milk is made, is by taking regular whole milk (or \"that other milk\" by your preference) and blending that whole milk with a powder (typically cocoa) and sweeteners such as sugars. Both \"that other milk\" and chocolate milk come from the same cows, contrary to some people's beliefs, but the key difference between the two is that chocolate milk is richer in sugars and carbohydrates than whole milk is. Yes, we are taught that carbohydrates are used as the basic unit of energy storage, but there are different types of carbohydrates, the most unhealthy being sugar. A small amount of consumption of these sugars won't have a significant amount of harm to your body, but large amounts can lead to obesity and diabetes in its consumers, and eventually heart diseases and cancers. (Source: http://www.self.com...) While most people from the Pro stance of this topic do think that flavored milk is tastier, it is not healthier, similar to most things we eat. We can continue to drink chocolate milk, but this will only damage us as time passes. It is much safer to drink the regular whole milk, with a little less flavor, but removing those excess sugars that grow to harm us in the future, than to drink chocolate milk, which has been shown to have those influences on the human body.",

Milk should always be in the preserved in low temperatures which is why supermarkets always have milk in the cooler. 5) The claim that the cholesterol in mil is equivalent to 53 slices of bacon is far fetched.

            "premise": "Again, thanks to Kleptin for responding. \"My opponent's restriction on people who drive\" One of my restrictions was on people who are *driving*, not on people who drive. I was basically saying don't drink and drive, because that may seriously injure, if not kill a person. This would be incredibly detrimental to one's health. \"Another exception that my opponent lists are diabetics.\" This is one of my exceptions. Although you say that diabetes affects 8% of Americans (it is actually 7.8%), it only affects 2.8% of the World's population (http://en.wikipedia.org...). This number is a lot smaller than what you said and although it is large, it is not significant enough to be considered average. \"And finally, a whopping 44% of Americans are taking at least one prescription medication, and 17% are taking at least three at once.\" About 3-4% of the World's population is abusing drugs 9http://www.prescription-drug-abuse.org...). Taking three prescription medication at once is abuse, and there is a chance it can kill you (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Also, anywhere from 50 to 75% of prescription medications taken in America are prescribed and used irresponsibly (http://books.google.com...). Abusing prescription drugs is like using recreational drugs, which can harm someone more than help them. \"...heavily restricting massive amounts of people who for all intents and purposes make up the statistically average US citizen?\" US has 306 million people out of the 6.77 billion in the world. In the year 2000, the US had just under 5% of the World's population (http://en.wikipedia.org...)(http://nationalatlas.gov...). Although these statistics may be correct, they are US, not Worldwide, statistics. \"Asian Curse\" You say that about 50% of the the Asian population has the \"Asian Curse\", but you do not take into account how many people with this condition still drink beer despite the fact. You are implying that everybody who has this condition cannot have a drop of alcohol. In fact, some people who suffer from this condition take ranitidine or famotidine an hour before drinking to counteract the effects of alcohol flush, AKA the \"Asian Curse\" (http://www.steadyhealth.com...). Some people even drink moderate amounts of alcohol to build up concentration levels of Alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme they were lacking in the first place (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Your case of alcohol flush is extreme, not everybody with this condition is as sensitive to alcohol as you are. There are still numerous amount of people who suffer from this condition and still drink moderately, they just can't drink copious amounts. My resolution states that moderate amounts of beer can be beneficial for a person. \"Simply put, my opponent's assertion that this particular sensitivity means I am not average, is unjustified and a bit absurd. In fact, his entire argument around designating an \"average\" person is absurd.\" I was trying to avoid a semantic debate. You have even said that I said people who *drive* shouldn't drink beer when what I really was people who are *driving* shouldn't drink beer. \"Even setting this aside, my opponent (despite what he as said previously) made no mention in this debate as to what he meant by \"you\". When people say \"hey you!\" in a conversation between the two of us, I assume he is referring to me. Thus, since this word \"you\" is used both in the resolution and my opponent's extended resolution, why would I believe otherwise?\" Frankly, we can argue this point of \"you\" all we want, but it will be ultimately up to the voter to decide how they interpret the usage of the word \"you\" in this debate. Many chronic health conditions in humans are caused by cow's milk. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says that this type of milk is also the most common food allergen. Cutting milk out of your diet can reduce obesity levels, arthritis up to 90% and even get rid of acne (http://www.collectivewizdom.com...)(http://www.milksucks.com...)(http://www.milksucks.com...). Consuming cow's milk is linked to high levels of mucus in the body. This can lead to ear infections, difficulty breathing and runny noses, stomach problems and possibly even kidney problems. It is also believe that these high levels of mucus can line the intestine and harden, making absorption of nutrients difficult (http://www.milksucks.com...). Roughly 70% of African Americans, 53% of Mexican Americans, and 74% percent of Native Americans and 65-75% of South Americans are lactose intolerant. 90% of Asian Americans, 98% of Thais and Southeast Asians, 95% of Chinese, 88% of Inner Mongolians and 80% of Central Asians are lactose intolerant as well (http://www.pcrm.org...)(http://en.wikipedia.org...). Let us also not forget that China itself has 1/6 of the world's population, and I am not counting Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, etc. It makes sense. We are the only species on Earth that drinks other animal's milk. As adults, we have decreased levels of lactose activity in our body because we no longer need milk, not even human's milk to maintain a healthy diet. How does it make sense that we need other species' milk, milk that was meant for that species' babies, to be healthy? Thank you for your time.",

            "premise": "\u201cBecause no explicit of burden of proof was stated in the rules and neither me or my opponent claimed the other had burden of proof, we must assume a shared burden. This is only strengthened by the fact that my opponent does attempt to show the superiority of Soy milk via his offensive.\u201d So I've taken some of your burden proof onto my own shoulders just because I provided both rebuttals and offensive arguments? That doesn't make sense. Your position is that Cow's Milk is superior to Soy Milk; I merely need to prove that Soy is at least equal to win this debate. \u201cHence even if you say my argument is completely invalid at best you should award us a tie in the arguments portion of the debate.\u201d So if your argument is completely invalid, and mine isn't, you deserve a tie? That makes even less sense! \u201cI was mistaken on the protein portion of the contest\u201d Thank you. \u201cHowever, my opponent drops my portion of the argument about biological values and different types of protein and therefore concedes that even if they have the same amount of protein, Cow's Milk is still far superior in types of protein.\u201d Both Cow's Milk and Soy's Milk contain all the EAAs and have individual traits thought to offer a unique advantage for muscle growth.1 \u201cHe also never addresses the fact that Soy is a plant protein and therefore not a complete protein. I will consider this dropped.\u201d According to a 2009 paper called Soy: a complete source of protein,2 \u201cSoybeans contain all of the essential amino acids necessary for human nutrition\u201d. It goes on to clarify that Soy actually \u201cis a complete source of protein\u201d. (emphasis mine) \u201cFurthermore, there are many many sources of folate. You don't need Soy Milk at all to get folate.\u201d And you don't need Cow's Milk at all to get any vitamins. \u201cI would ask my opponent, are cigarettes of higher quality and importance(emphasis) than say his Soy Milk. Because it would seem that it costs more. We could also ask if a Big Mac is better Quality than Soy Milk.\u201d That's the fallacy of False Analogy; comparing a Big Mac with Soy Milk is like comparing apples and oranges. I compared two types of milk, and it's a perfectly valid analogy. People pay more for Soy Milk because it's superior to Cow's Milk. I won't waste time rebutting your YouTube experiment, since you already did that by clarifying that it was biased. \u201cMost people are not lactose intolerant[...] Anyone who clicks on his source will see even if you read the entire case study it never ever says that most people are lactose intolerant\u201d Sorry, I must've cited the wrong source. Here is the source I meant to site: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov... You will find that this government page agrees that most people are, indeed, lactose-intolerant, as the number of those with reduced lactose digesting ability is \u201c65 percent of the human population\u201d. The Nottingham Institute of Genetics backs this up, stating that \u201cMost people cannot drink milk as adults without the symptoms of lactose intolerance\u201d.4 \u201cMy opponent is being dishonest when he says that Soy Milk can be drunk by everybody. There two distinct groups that cannot drink Soy that can drink Cow's Milk. People who are allergic to Soy.\u201d \u201cOverall, soy is well tolerated\u201d.2 Furthermore, according to this graph from EuroPrevall, an EU-funded project about food allergy, it's clear that far more people are allergic to Cow's Milk than Soy Milk5: \u201cPlus people who are bodybuilder because it lowers testosterone and raises estrogen. This is because it reduces muscles gains.\u201d That's a myth. Soy Milk has never been shown to reduce muscle gains. Also, you are completely ignoring the fact that Cow's Milk has estrogen too. According to the Harvard News6: \u201cAmong the routes of human exposure to estrogens, we are mostly concerned about cow's milk, which contains considerable amounts of female sex hormones\u201d. The paper goes on to say that Dairy \u201caccounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of estrogens consumed.\u201d So most of the estrogen that you are worried about actually comes from Cow's Milk, not Soy Milk. \u201c[Con] must concede Soy Milk does contain more carbs even if he doubts the importance which I will explain is a mistake\u201d I do not doubt the importance of the presence of healthy carbs in Soy Milk, which Cow's Milk does not have. That's because, as I already pointed out in the previous round, Soy Milk has fiber, a type of carbohydrate needed for healthy digestion.7 Cow's Milk doesn't have any! \u201cMy opponent says bodybuilders eat tons of carbs. While many bodybuilders do eat many carbs and no one would argue they don't , however they are referring to complex carbohydrates with a high glycemic index.\u201d No, they are not only referring to complex carbohydrates, and you've given no reason for anyone to believe that's the case. Besides, I already showed a picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger consuming a massive pizza, which is composed almost entirely of simple carbohydrates with a high glycemic index! \u201cIt is laughable that they show the California governor instead of the bodybuilder Schwarzenegger to support their point.\u201d It's laughable that you think that Governor Schwarzenegger and bodybuilder Schwarzenegger aren't the same person. Mr. Schwarzenegger is still bodybuilding, as evidenced by this photo taken this year8: \u201cAnother problem with carbs is that they are hard to digest in comparison to Fat.\u201d Completely wrong. \u201cAlmost all carbohydrates[...] are the quickest to digest and absorb [\u2026] Fats take the most time to fully digest and absorb because they are the largest molecules\u201d.9 Cow's Milk is not superior to Soy Milk.

Burden of proof will be on me to prove that drinking cow's milk is usually immoral. OutlineI. IntroII. Animal ethicsIII. HealthIV. EnvironmentV. ConclusionVI. SourcesI. IntroWe shouldn't drink bovine milk because it encourages the slavery, exploitation, and mistreatment of cows. Not only that, but slavery, exploitation, and mistreatment of one animal paves the way for this same treatment towards other animals. Cows milk is unhealthy nor environmentally sustainable. II. Animal ethics\"A factory farm is a large, industrial operation that raises large numbers of animals for food. Over 99% of farm animals in the U.S. are raised in factory farms, which focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of animal welfare.\" [0]Animals on so called \"humane\" farms don't fare much better. [1][2] \"Even under the best circumstances, the incentive to treat animals \u201chumanely\u201d is limited to the extent to which it is necessary to raise them to market weight (which is just a fraction of their natural lifespan). Any humane practice beyond this would be seen as inefficient and unsustainable by today\u2019s business standards.\" [3]Between the inherit conflict of interest between animal welfare and profit. and the brutal realities there is no moral justification for humans drinking bovine milk.III. HealthMilk causes osteoporosis and increases chances of hip fractures. Contains, IGF-1, cholesterol, casein, lactose, high in fat, high in saturated fat, and high in dead bacteria endotoxins. \"These results support the hypothesis that dairy products and calcium are associated with a greater risk of prostate cancer. \" [4]\" Studies have shown that IGFs are potent mitogens for a variety of cancer cells including prostate cancer since they stimulate cancer cell growth and suppress programmed cell death. \" [5]\"Naturally occurring milk IGF-1 levels were recorded in 5777 random milk samples from the Bavarian dairy cow population.\" [6]As you can see from above, milk increases cancer risk. IGF-1 is found in cow's milk and is associated with increased cancer risk. \"These findings suggest that even small intakes of foods of animal origin are associated with significant increases in plasma cholesterol concentrations, which are associated, in turn, with significant increases in chronic degenerative disease mortality rates.\" [7]Casein is a protein that can cause an immune system response which can lead to type I diabetes. \u201cTotal protein consumption did not correlate with diabetes incidence (r = +0.402), but consumption of the beta-casein A1 variant did (r = +0.726). Even more pronounced was the relation between beta-casein (A1+B) consumption and diabetes (r = +0.982). These latter two cow caseins yield a bioactive peptide beta-casomorphin-7 after in vitro digestion with intestinal enzymes whereas the common A2 variant or the corresponding human or goat caseins do not. beta-casomorphin-7 has opioid properties including immunosuppression, which could account for the specificity of the relation between the consumption of some but not all beta-casein variants and diabetes incidence. \u201c [8] \u201c\" Women who drank three glasses of milk or more every day had a nearly doubled risk of death and cardiovascular disease, and a 44 percent increased risk of cancer compared to women who drank less than one glass per day, the researchers found. Men's overall risk of death increased about 10 percent when they drank three or more glasses of milk daily, said the study, published online Oct. 28 in BMJ.\"\u201d [9] \u201cThe risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent, the findings indicated. \u201c [10] Fat is not only the densest of the three macro nutrients at 9 calories per gram as opposed to 4 for carbohydrates and proteins. This can lead to obesity and intramyocellular lipid build up.Saturated fat increases blood viscosity which makes the heart work harder. Lactose is a sugar that many people are intolerant towards. IV. EnvironmentInherently due to trophic levels milk must be worse for the environment. From the American Journal of Clinical nutrition we can see that lupine, a vegan alternative, is better for the environment than cow's milk. [11]V. ConclusionIn conclusion, there is only one ethical choice, and that is to stop drinking bovine milk. Thanks for the debate.VI.

            "conclusion": "Chocolate Milk: The Harmful Stuff",
            "premise": "What does the research say about sugar and flavored milk? Sugar is a contributor to the health problems that are harming our kids. Sugary drinks are often called \u201cliquid candy\u201d, and are an easy way for kids to consume large amounts of added sugar. Several studies have shown that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to obesity and risk for chronic disease;8 it seems to be the one part of kids\u2019 diets most linked to increased weight.9 Flavored milk is a sugary drink, along with soda, sports drinks and many juice drinks, but the majority of these studies did not include it, and there has been very little research to directly investigate the effects of flavored milk on children\u2019s health. The few studies that have been conducted were sponsored by the dairy industry. How much sugar is too much? Recommendations for sugar consumption vary depending on age, gender, and level of physical activity. Health experts recommend that sugar should come from our daily \u201cbudget\u201d of discretionary, or spare calories. For example, girls between 9 and 13 who get less than 30 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous physical activity, only have 130 calories to spare.10 The American Heart Association recommends that no more than half of your discretionary calories come from added sugar,11 so in this case, just 65 calories. One serving of flavored milk provides 64 calories of added sugar, which would equal a whole day\u2019s allowance. What about using cane sugar or non-caloric natural or artificial sweeteners? Replacing high fructose corn syrup with another sugar, such as cane sugar, does not reduce the added sugar content. Cane sugar is similar in composition to high fructose corn syrup (it\u2019s 50% fructose), and neither is beneficial for children\u2019s health when consumed in high quantities. Some processors are considering adding non-caloric sweeteners to milk, but adding any kind of sweetener teaches kids that foods need to be sweeter or flavored in order to be enjoyable, rather than encouraging them to appreciate the taste of whole, natural foods, such as plain milk. Furthermore, not enough research has been conducted to assure the safety of giving children alternative sweeteners on a regular, prolonged basis. If we take away flavored milk, will kids get less calcium and other essential nutrients? Isn\u2019t it worth giving them the extra sugar to make sure they get these? A Dairy Council sponsored study reported that children who drink flavored milk consume more servings of milk daily.12 However, in the majority of age groups, the flavored milk drinkers did not have a significantly higher intake of calcium, or other nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium, or potassium than kids who just drank plain milk. Other dairy products are a good source of nutrition and kids can get calcium from leafy greens, soy, nuts, and beans. Exercise also contributes to good bone health. MORE AND MORE SCHOOLS ARE MAKING THE MOVE TOWARDS PLAIN MILK Pioneering school districts \u2013 New Haven, CT; Boulder Valley, Colorado; Washington, DC; Ventura, California \u2013 have replaced flavored milk with white. They say that although selection drops initially, once the kids get used to it, the selection goes back up again. Many more districts are following suit \u2013 more than 50 in all, led by places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis this year. WILL SCHOOLS LOSE MONEY IF THEY SWITCH OUT FLAVORED FOR WHITE? Schools can still receive their full federal reimbursement for school lunch by offering just plain milk. Generally flavored milk costs more than white milk for the schools to purchase, though suppliers may vary. So school meal budgets should not be impacted by the switch. STILL HAVE QUESTIONS? HERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL FAQS: Why is the Food Revolution focusing on flavored milk? Jamie\u2019s position on flavored milk is that it has no place in schools, and right from the start of the Food Revolution, he has advocated going back to plain, white milk. Milk is a great source of nutrients for kids, but the flavored varieties have more calories, are highly processed and contain unnecessary sugars and additives which don\u2019t add any nutritional value. How can we encourage kids to choose white milk? Chef Ann Cooper, better known as the \u201cRenegade Lunch Lady\u201d, serves only white milk in the Boulder, CO schools. She says that it is important to serve the milk cold, and preferably in a glass as opposed to a carton.7 Kate Adamick, who has led the same change in districts in central California, says that educating the cafeteria staff and teachers around the sugar math helps them to explain the reasons to the kids. In Washington, DC, Jeff Mills started fresh in the fall and got very little push back. Switching at the start of a new semester is always going to be less controversial than half way through. Flavored milk can still be served on special occasions only, so the kids come to view it as a treat. Milk is a great source of nutrients for kids, but the flavored varieties have more calories, are a processed food product, and contain unnecessary sugars and additives, which don\u2019t add any nutritional value. The food industry has convinced many schools and parents that they need to serve flavored milk to ensure kids get essential vitamins and minerals, and is backing chocolate and flavored milk with a multi-million dollar marketing campaign, led by \u201cRaise Your Hand for Chocolate Milk.\u201d4 Science and common sense don\u2019t back that position up. Other dairy products are a good source of nutrition and kids can get calcium from leafy greens, soy, nuts, and beans. All that\u2019s needed is to invest those marketing dollars behind good old, white milk. We know that with the right backing from the school community to promote plain milk, kids are happy to drink it. An 8 oz carton of flavored milk typically has about 4 teaspoons (64 calories) of added sugar. 1 Industry claims that beginning this school year chocolate milk will average 2.5 teaspoons (40 calories) of added sugar.2 Milk always has 12 grams (about 3 tsp) of its natural sugar, lactose.* If a child drinks flavored milk at breakfast and lunch they are getting 5-8 teaspoons of added sugar, 80-128 extra calories, every day. An 8oz serving size of Coca-Cola has just under 7 teaspoons of sugar. Over a 180-day school year, that adds up to almost 8 pounds of unnecessary sugar (and at least 14,400 calories!). Imagine if they drank it all 365 days\u2026 *Calculate your added sugar at www.jamiesfoodrevolution.com/MilkAction *Formulations and sugar content varies by school district. Read your labels! KIDS ARE DRINKING A LOT OF FLAVORED MILK AT SCHOOL About 70% of the milk consumed in schools is flavored.4 Low-fat chocolate milk is the most popular choice.5 80% of flavored milk sold in America is to schools. It\u2019s the place kids get flavored milk. \u201cFlavored milk is not the nutritional equivalent of unflavored milk. It is significantly higher in calories, sugar, and sodium, and usually contains artificial colors and flavors.\u201d \u2013 Marlene Schwartz, PhD, Deputy Director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesityat Yale University",

I am also thinking that this choco milk also you will think, what this does not make sense.

            "premise": "OK, thank you Kleptin for accepting this debate, and may I ask, what component of beer are you allergic to? It seems my opponent has not read my arguement. In R1 I clearly laid out my full resolution: \"For the average, healthy person, beer, in moderation, is healthier for you than milk. Of course it there are exceptions. Pregnant women should obviously not drink any alcohol, nor should diabetics or people taking prescription medicine. People also driving or working machinery shouldn't drink as well.\" I would have liked to fit this resolution into the field given when starting a debate, but space was limited, so I resorted to fully explaining my resolution in R1. In my resolution I stated that beer was beneficial to an \"average, healthy person.\" Average is defined as \"typical; common; ordinary\" (http://dictionary.reference.com...). Since the ordinary person is not allergic to beer, Kleptin, then you are not the \"average person\" that I was referring to. Also the word \"you\" can be defined as \"one; anyone; people in general\" (http://dictionary.reference.com...). Earlier I specified \"you\" to be the average person, the general public, which would exclude my opponent. I assume that my opponent accepts the definition of milk to be: \"liquid as secreted by cows, goats, or certain other animals and used by humans for food or as a source of butter, cheeses, yogurt, etc\" because in R1 he says \"I am perfectly fine with milk, and do not have lactose intolerance.\" Cow and goat's milk have lactose in them, which leads me to believe he agrees with this term. Dairy milk also contains casein, which breaks down into beta-Casomorphine-7, an opiate. Other examples of opiates are morphine, codeine and fentanyl. Opioid is defined as a \"drug, hormone, or other chemical substance having sedative or narcotic effects similar to those containing opium or its derivatives\" (http://www.thefreedictionary.com...). Some reactions that people have to opiates are: nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, itching, dry mouth, and constipation (Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine, 3rd ed.). There has also been studies showing that casein can aggravate, if not cause autism. It has also been linked to cancer, schizophrenia, heart disease and diabetes. Since casein is a drug, it is addictive (especially cheese, because of the high concentration of it) and can even affect a person's personality, causing depression and overeating (http://danmahony.com...). Beer however, has a positive effect on blood vessels, decreasing the risk of clotting or rupturing. People who drink beer in moderation also have less of a risk of dementia and can even increase cognitive functions (http://www.forbes.com...). It can also increase metabolism, lower calories and reduce stress (http://www.menshealth.com...). Kleptin, sorry to hear about your unfortunate condition, but in my resolution, you are classified as an exception. I said in R1 that, for the average person, beer is healthier than milk and you have yet to prove otherwise. I look forward to the second round of this debate and again, thank you for accepting.",

I strongly believe that schools should not allow chocolate milk because a 7.5 ounce can of Coke has 25 grams of sugar while chocolate milk can have up to 20% more, a 8 ounce glass of chocolate milk can have from 15-31 grams of sugar, and yes, chocolate milk may have calcium but all the added sugar doesn\"t let your body absorb it. One reason that chocolate milk should not be allowed in schools is because a 7.5 ounce can of Coke has 25 grams of sugar while chocolate milk has 20% more. For example if you take 25 and add 20%. You would have about 30 grams of sugar in one 7.5 ounce glass of chocolate milk. Also, when you drink chocolate milk all of the sugar that you get from it is really bad for your body. In addition, chocolate milk is drank a lot. So, if you drink a lot of chocolate milk then you are getting a lot of sugars, therefore wrecking your health. Another reason that chocolate milk should not be allowed at school is because most children don\"t get chocolate milk except in school. \"Many children only get to have chocolate milk at school\"but they get to drink a lot of it there. Some children consume as many as 10 or even 15 cartons of chocolate milk in a week at school.\" Says Jonathan Smith, writer of Chocolate Milk: More Harmful Than Healthful. This is not a good thing! Because of this, kids might get... FAT! The final reason that schools should not allow chocolate milk is because yes, chocolate milk has calcium and other nutrients but all of the added sugar doesn\"t let your organs absorb it. There is just so much sugar that all the good things in it will not be absorbed because of the sugar. Even if you drink fat free, you still get all the sugar and not enough nutrients.

            "premise": "First, I want to thank Pro for accepting this debate. Here is why milk is bad for your bones : Point 1 : Milk depletes the calcium from your bones The milk myth has spread around the world based on the flawed belief that this protein and calcium-rich drink is essential to support good overall health and bone health in particular at any age. It is easy to understand that the confusion about milk's imaginary benefits stems from the fact that it contains calcium, around 300 mg per cup. But many scientific studies have shown an assortment of detrimental health effects directly linked to milk consumption. And the most surprising link is that not only do we barely absorb the calcium in cow's milk (especially if pasteurized), but to make matters worse, it actually increases calcium loss from the bones. Here's how it happens. Like all animal protein, milk acidifies the body pH which in turn triggers a biological correction. You see, calcium is an excellent acid neutralizer and the biggest storage of calcium in the body is - you guessed it... in the bones. So the very same calcium that our bones need to stay strong is utilized to neutralize the acidifying effect of milk. Once calcium is pulled out of the bones, it leaves the body via the urine, so that the surprising net result after this is an actual calcium deficit.[1] 2 : Milk increases fracture risks Many scientific studies contradict the conventional wisdom that milk and dairy consumption help reduce osteoporotic fractures. Surprisingly, studies demonstrating that milk and dairy products actually fail to protect bones from fractures outnumber studies that prove otherwise. Even drinking milk from a young age does not protect against future fracture risk but actually increases it. And the 12 year long Harvard Nurses' Health Study found that those who consumed the most calcium from dairy foods broke more bones than those who rarely drank milk. This is a broad study based on 77,761 women aged 34 through 59 years of age.[1] Conclusion Milk is bad for your bones because of those reasons. I have more sources that can strengthen my argument.[2][3][4][5] 1. http://saveourbones.com... 2. http://www.news-medical.net... 3. http://www.care2.com... 4. http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com... 5. http://www.sott.net...",

According to the Centers for Disease Control, a serving of low-fat chocolate milk contains 53 more calories than a serving of low-fat white milk. These are mostly empty calories, which have no nutritional value whatsoever.\" A 2005 study by the New York City (NYC) Department of Education found that by removing whole milk and replacing it with low-fat to fat-free chocolate milk, students were served an estimated 5,960 fewer calories and 619 fewer grams of fat per year.(1) \"Chocolate contains oxalate, a naturally occurring compound in cocoa beans, which can inhibit the absorption of calcium. \" \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt is present in small enough amounts that the effect on calcium absorption is negligible(2)(3). \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAs chocolate contains relatively small amounts of oxalate, it is unclear to what extent chocolate consumption affects healthy people who eat calcium-rich diets. \"Opponents of banning flavored milk also argue that some children simply will not drink plain milk. However, most students will select healthy foods if they are prompted to do so. Furthermore, evidence has shown that children who are continually exposed to healthy foods will learn to prefer these foods. These children will also develop a decreased preference for sweetened foods.\" Of course, not everyone likes plain milk(4), so by only offering plain milk you're depriving a certain amount of kids their calcium.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdFlavoring milk \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdis the only way to get students to drink it. Milk provides a host of nutrients, including calcium, protein and vitamin D, which recent studies show is deficient in about three-quarters of teenagers and adults. To simply claim that, under verbal prompts, students will defy their taste buds is ridiculous. The experiment given here is invalid. \"It's better for them to have some milk with some flavoring and a little added sugar than to go without milk,\" said Ms. Pratt-Heavner, whose organization last month helped release a study that showed that elementary school children drank 35 percent less milk at school on average when flavored milk was removed. Conclusions: While chocolate milk isn't exactly on par with non-flavored milk in terms of calories, the benefits still outweigh the costs by drinking chocolate milk. There are some students who simply won't drink plain milk, and prefer flavored milk instead. What about those students? Won't someone think of the children?

Cow's Milk costs less.\u201d That's because it is of lesser quality and importance. Cheaper things are less superior to more expensive ones. This is common sense. \u201c4. Therefore(from 2-3), Cow's Milk is superior to Soy Milk.\u201d False, as I've already explained and will elaborate on. \u201cWhen comes to fat, Soy Milk certainly does has the advantage for fat in both overall fat and saturated fat, this is not in question. I don't think that the higher fat quantity is what really makes us fat. Why is it so bad then? The carbohydrates.\u201d That argument fails before it even starts. Fat people are fat because they have a lot of... fat! Not carbohydrates. Nobody calls people with a lot of carbohydrates... \u201ccarbo\u201d or anything like that. Besides, a popular bodybuilding practice is to load up on carbohydrates (read: consume a LOT of carbohydrates) both before and after a workout. Carbohydrate loading is even done before bodybuilding exhibitions! If carbohydrates were so evil, bodybuilders wouldn't be eating so much of them. Allow me to quote Arnold Schwarzenegger himself: \u201cI was carb backloading before it was hip\u201d4 And here is an unflattering photo of Arnold devouring pure carbohydrates: FAT is the problem, not carbohydrates, and your beloved Cow's Milk has more fat than the Soy Milk you attempt to vilify. I will now initiate my offensive. Most people are lactose intolerant.1 This means that Cow's Milk makes them sick, makes their farts stink, causes bloating, diarrhea, and a host of other nasty problems. Soy Milk can be drunk by everybody, even people with lactose intolerance, with 0 ill effects! Soy Milk can also be drunk by vegetarians, as it isn't derived from animal products. Cow's Milk cannot be argued superior if the majority of the world's population cannot even drink it without violating their beliefs or becoming physically ill! \u201cI didn't even need to go into the testosterone lowering effects of Soy or the detrimental effect of Soy on the digestive system.\u201d Cow's Milk is worse for the digestive system than Soy Milk is. Also, the testosterone lowering effects of Soy help to prevent Roid-Rage6, which is known for causing violent crime. You don't hear about Soy Milk turning people into killers, do you? Didn't think so. Cow's Milk is not superior to Soy Milk. 1http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... 2http://ndb.nal.usda.gov... 3http://ndb.nal.usda.gov... 4http://www.hollywood.com... 5http://ods.od.nih.gov... 6http://www.foxnews.com...",

            "conclusion": "Beer, in moderation, is healthier for you than milk.",
            "premise": "A very good round by my opponent. I will begin by addressing some issues I left unresolved since I wanted to do more research. So first, a few counterarguments for my opponent's points so far: A. Milk does not cause Osteoporosis. My opponent's source is an article talking about the safety and benefits of animal hormones. It says absolutely nothing about high protein levels. Even if so, my opponent is severely misinformed and drawing the wrong conclusions. What my opponent is confusing himself about is that during kidney failure, high protein levels in the blood change the charge of the ion flow in the nephrons of the kidney and calcium is excreted into water that leaves as urine. the body contains a massive number of proteins in the blood in the form of albumin and red blood cells. The protein in milk is digested and broken down into amino acids and never gets into the blood in the first place. B. Milk is not \"loaded\" with pesticides or antibiotics. According to the following links, The FDA has done numerous studies, all of which show that the trace amounts (if any) of hormones, pesticides, or possible antibiotics in milk are safe for human consumption even taking into account the fact that people drink it daily. There are also many regulatory procedures that ensure the safety of milk. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.ces.ncsu.edu... http://www.organic-center.org... http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org... C. I also find my opponent's assumption of dragging udders to be a stretch (no pun intended) as most cows are milked on a frequent basis by machine and thus, would not get a chance to have swollen udders. D. Antibiotics are not used to treat inflammation, but are used to treat infection (which is never prophylatic in cows so my opponent is probably wrong in assuming that they are injected with it constantly). E. My opponent is also wrong in citing his own source. There is no mention about pesticides causing cancer, rather, the insulin-like growth factor present in cow milk. However, in the links above, it is shown that pasteurization destroys the already minuscule amount present and the rest is destroyed in the stomach as IGF-1 is a protein. Furthermore, the citations that my opponent cites are heavily biased. The original journal articles involved experiments with existing IGF levels in humans, where the word \"milk\" appears a total of 0 times. F. My opponent connects many dots using bad logic. While it is true that Casein breaks down into casomorphines, that is just an intermediate step in the stomach. Casein forms a micelle in the stomach that clots and gets slowly dissolved. The casomorphines are just potential chains that Casein might get broken down into, and even then, the stomach eventually reduces that protein down to base amino acids where it has no effect in the bloodstream. Proteins get broken down in the stomach but the majority of protein digestion takes place in the intestine after the pancreas releases the proteases that ensure complete reduction to amino acids. http://www.wisegeek.com... Furthermore, this link above states that the presence of casomorphines and their action as opiate-like molecules only takes place in autistics, who may have an inability to break down the casomorphines. http://en.wikipedia.org... This article states that outstanding experiments and trials with positive results are biased and unreliable. G. Cutting milk can reduce obesity, but my opponent is comparing 1 glass of beer to 1 glass of milk. You can fix obesity, but you can't fix progressive liver damage. In addition, there are plenty of non-fat varieties of milk but nonalcoholic beers may be a little harder to knock back. Acne is more likely due to excess oil and fat. Non fat milk is a viable option for those who are focused on cosmetics. However, the experiment that I found, the one that allegedly \"sparked\" the controversy, only showed results in polling people who consumed 3 or more servings a day, and we are arguing a 1:1 comparison, making this point moot. http://www.healthcastle.com... H. As for arthritis, my opponent's claim is due to reading too quickly. The source he provided claimed that most arthritis is due to allergen response and most food allergies are caused by milk. THis is misleading as most arthritis is caused by an allergic response to self, when the body's own white blood cells attack joints, causing joint pain. This is why Glucosamine and Chondroitin help with arthritis: they contain the same material in the joints that the white blood cells attack, leaving the actual body parts unharmed. I. My opponent's source regarding mucus is also biased and premature, connecting the wrong dots. Fact, milk is the most common food allergen. Fact, allergies can manifest into mucus production and cough. Lactose intolerance is categorized as a milk allergy and accounts for it being the most common food allergen. However, we know that the symptoms for lactose intolerance are not related to these, so by elimination, we can estimate that a far lower percentage of milk allergies is due to things other than lactose intolerance. J. In discussing prescription drugs, the number of drug abusers worldwide is irrelevant to this debate. Also, as a Pharmacy student, I can say that my opponent's assertion (\"Taking three prescription medication at once is abuse\") is also misleading and faulty. My opponent's sources lead to a term specifically for excessive medication use. However, we are speaking about legitimate prescriptions that are required for maintaining health. It is not uncommon for a person to be on a cholesterol medication, a blood pressure medication, and another medication (such as an asthma medication, an antihistamine, a sleeping aid, pain medication, antibiotic) at the same time. To simply categorize it as abuse and unhealthy is simply manipulation of data and language. Regardless, it it is a fact that prescription medication use is as high as it is. Whether or not it is healthy is outside the scope of the debate. What is important is the fact that my opponent's description of an \"average\" person is either unrealistic or harmful to his case, as moderate drinking of alcoholic beverages would interfere with drug metabolism and the imaginary health detriments that my opponent is conjuring can and will become a reality. K. Ranitidine actually raises blood alcohol levels because it inhibits the enzyme responsible for the 3 step metabolism of alcohol. The \"asian flush\" does disappear, but only because the alcohol isn't being digested at all in the beginning and because the antihistamine effects of the two drugs decrease the flushing. However, when the drug effects wear off, alcohol is metabolized at the same mid-way speed, allowing for an increase in the toxic acetaldehyde intermediate. This puts excessive strain on the liver because not only is the liver busy metabolizing the drugs, but it gets the added load of the unmetabolized alcohol to follow suit. Famotidine, though slightly safer, also harms the liver over long periods of use. L. My opponent brings up the topic of lactose intolerance. Just as there are many, many different kinds of beer, there are also many varieties of milk, and a good number of them are lactose-free. I don't see how lactose intolerance is an issue in this debate because although non-alcoholic beer is hard to find and probably not healthy, fat-free or lactose-free milk is readily available and usually fortified with vitamins. Soy milk is also very healthy. There are many varieties of milk free of the chemicals my opponent mentioned. I will allow my opponent to address these first and conclude at the end.",

It has calcium, which makes the kids grow taller, and also the sweet taste, unlike white milk which some kids can call \"yucky\" or \"too plain\". I know what you are thinking, that it causes obesity and stuff, but then, kids are kids. They run around the playground at lunchtime, so there is not a big chance that they will turn suddenly obtuse just because they drink chocolate milk. Now, you night think that there are too much sugar, but the truth is, The little bit of sugar is what keeps them going during the day and keeps them energetic and healthy.

            "conclusion": "Beer, in moderation, is healthier for you than milk.",
            "premise": "Thanks Kleptin, good luck in the final round. \"My opponent's source is an article talking about the safety and benefits of animal hormones\" My source was the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 1993. It does not have a link because it's not on the Internet. The research was done by Dr. Robert P. Heaney. I did find the excerpt that I was referring to on the Internet however: (http://www.ecopolitan.com...) (scroll about halfway down). In the text he says: \"The net effect is such that, if protein intake is doubled without changing intake of other nutrients, urinary calcium content increases by about 50 percent.\" The other article that I cited was referring to my claim there was pesticides and and antibiotics in milk. I will take a paragraph directly out of the source that I used in round one: \"Milk contains contaminants that range from pesticides to drugs. Milk naturally contains hormones and growth factors produced within a cow's body. In addition, synthetic hormones such as recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) are commonly used in dairy cows to increase the production of milk.27 Because treated cows are producing quantities of milk nature never intended, the end result can be mastitis, or inflammation of the mammary glands. Treatment of this condition requires the use of antibiotics, and antibiotic traces have occasionally been found in samples of milk and other dairy products. Pesticides, poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins are other examples of contaminants found in milk. These toxins do not readily leave the body and can eventually build to harmful levels that may affect the immune and reproductive systems. The central nervous system can also be affected. Moreover, PCBs and dioxins have also been linked to cancer.\" (http://www.pcrm.org...) In regards to my opponent's sources, one source says: \"The newly approved tests detect only four, or at most, five beta lactams. What about the several other families of antibiotics currently available for use?\" (http://www.ces.ncsu.edu...). Another source, when looking at the \"Human Health\" section, is one big \"citation needed\" after another(http://en.wikipedia.org...). His third source says: All 739 milk samples tested contained residues, and in fact the average sample had 2.88 residues \u2013 a HUGE jump from the testing just eight years earlier.\" and it also says \"The good news is that the levels of DDE, DPA, and other pesticides found in milk in 2004 were very low. Most fell below one part per billion (ppb). The highest residue levels found were, at most, one-quarter of the applicable EPA tolerance (the maximum allowable limit of a pesticide in a given food).\" (http://www.organic-center.org...). These pesticides build up in the body. The samples that contained high amounts of pesticides could easily build up to harmful levels. \"I also find my opponent's assumption of dragging udders to be a stretch (no pun intended) as most cows are milked on a frequent basis by machine and thus, would not get a chance to have swollen udders.\" Not EVERY cow has swollen udders, but there are cows that do, here's a picture. (http://www.milksucks.co.uk...) \"Antibiotics are not used to treat inflammation, but are used to treat infection (which is never prophylactic in cows so my opponent is probably wrong in assuming that they are injected with it constantly.\" I probably did mix up the words antibiotics and anti-inflammatory, but when cow's udders drag on the ground (see above picture), they are sure to be cut. Those cuts may also come into contact with the manure left on the ground in the cow's living space, and can infect the udders. \"The original journal articles involved experiments with existing IGF levels in humans, where the word \"milk\" appears a total of 0 times.\" Again, you must have missed a part in my article. In my source (http://www.pcrm.org...), it says: \"Prostate and breast cancers have been linked to consumption of dairy products, presumably related to increases in a compound called insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I). IGF-I is found in cow's milk and has been shown to occur in increased levels in the blood of individuals consuming dairy products on a regular basis. Other nutrients that increase IGF-I are also found in cow's milk.\" In the section labeled \"Cancer,\" the word \"milk\" shows up five times. \"This article states that outstanding experiments and trials with positive results are biased and unreliable\" The Wikipedia article? I didn't see that in the article anywhere. \"You can fix obesity, but you can't fix progressive liver damage.\" Moderate Drinking does not cause liver damage. (http://www.liverfoundation.org...) \"In discussing prescription drugs, the number of drug abusers worldwide is irrelevant to this debate.\" It is relevant, because although those numbers are high in the US, other countries may not take nearly as many drugs. Since we are dealing with a worldwide scale here, those figures may not be nearly as high. Ranitidine is also known as Zantac, and famotidine is know as Pepcid, both are over the counter prescriptions. These can be taken with alcohol, how many other prescriptions can be taken with alcohol as well? \"Just as there are many, many different kinds of beer, there are also many varieties of milk, and a good number of them are lactose-free.\" That is true, but in R1 you defined beer to be \"an alcoholic beverage made by brewing and fermentation from cereals, usually malted barley, and flavored with hops and the like for a slightly bitter taste.\" and in R2 I defined milk as \"liquid as secreted by cows, goats, or certain other animals and used by humans for food or as a source of butter, cheeses, yogurt, etc.\" You did not alter my definition of milk and I accepted your definition of beer. Your definition of beer says it is an alcoholic beverage and my definition of milk says it is a liquid secreted by animals like cows and goats. Cow's and goat's milk has lactose in it. So to bring up non-alcoholic beers and lactose-free milks is irrelevant. Even if we were to argue non-alcoholic beers and lactose-free milks, who says non-alcoholic beers aren't healthy? And they are not hard to find, I can walk down to my local grocery store and a buy a 24-pack if I wanted to. Granted, lactose-free and fat-free milks probably remove some of the health problems that arise from milk, it isn't just the fat or lactose in the milk that is the problem. It is the casein and the chemicals too. Also, my sources are not biased, they are merely compilations of evidence that have found milk to be detrimental to one's health. If I wanted to read a book on communism, it isn't biased because it doesn't mention fascist ideas as well. I was researching how milk is unhealthy for a person, and that is what I found. So, in conclusion: Beer has no fat, ten times less sodium, no cholesterol and less calories then milk. Beer can protect against diabetes, strokes, heart disease, dementia and lower stress. Milk has small amounts pesticides and antibiotics that can build up in the body that can effect the immune system, central nervous system and reproductive system. These pesticides have been linked to cancer too. Milk has casein, which breaks down into casomorphine, which can aggravate autism. My opponent has misread my sources, claiming they are saying something completely different that what they are actually saying. He has gone so far as to twist my resolution and say my restriction was on people who drive, which is not what I said. Cow's milk is made for baby cows, not humans of all ages. We do not need milk to maintain a healthy diet beyond the age of 12 months old. Thanks to Kleptin for the great debate.",

However, Instigator has not taken a few things into consideration:Studies show that in 8 oz of chocolate milk, there is approximately 3 teaspoons of sugar is added to chocolate milk.[1] That's almost as much as soda, which the example I'll use, Cola, has 11 teaspoons in a 16 oz soda (44g of sugar), which is 4.5 teaspoons of sugar in an 8 oz soda.[2] Also, even if the chocolate milk was low-fat, fat is not the same thing as sugar.Why is sugar a big deal, you ask? Well, sugar is high in fructose, or fruit sugar. Too much of it can overload your liver, can also give you Type II cancer, raises your chorestrol level (giving you a higher risk of heart diesese), among many other things. And since it also releases dopamine, a \"feel good\" chemical, sugar is highly addictive.[3]Point: Chocolate milk is much less healthier than normal milk, since it contains much more sugar that normal lactose milk.

As it turns out, this study was funded by the Milk Processor Education Program (MPEP), the dairy industry\u2019s national marketing group (1). The MPEP has spent over a million dollars to promote chocolate milk in schools. As extensive research has shown, the conclusions of a scientific study usually support the interests of the study's financial sponsor (2-3). Therefore, the results of this research article should not be weighted heavily. When we consider only objective research, we realize that banning flavored milk will not lead to decreased consumption in the long-term. For example, let\u2019s examine the implications of limiting the availability of flavored milk in New York City schools. Beginning in 2006, flavored milk could be purchased only three days a week (4). In this year, most NYC schools also stopped serving whole milk. Initially, there was an 8% decline in milk purchases following the implementation of these new policies. Several students were probably not accustomed to drinking low-fat, plain milk. As a result, some kids may have initially avoided drinking milk altogether. However, by 2009, milk purchases had actually increased by 1.3% (4). This proves that children will eventually learn to accept unsweetened, low-fat foods. As Dr. Marlene Schwartz concluded, \u201cIt is probable that, immediately following removal of flavored milk from schools, children will drink less milk. Who really is surprised that, given the option, children prefer the taste of flavored milk to unflavored milk? Research with both animals and humans show that we all like the taste of sugar. However, examining what happens in the short-term is inadequate; the relevant question is what happens in the long-term when children are only served unflavored milk\u201d (5). Conclusion: By serving our children flavored milk, we\u2019re only training them to prefer, and eventually over-consume, sugar-sweetened beverages. Scientific studies show that banning flavored milk does not decrease overall milk consumption. Thus, all of our schools should stop serving flavored milk.

            "premise": "The Los Angeles Unified School District is taking a stand against child obesity by banning chocolate and strawberry flavored milk. In the past few years, schools in the District of Columbia, Boulder Valley, Colorado, and Berkeley, California have also banned flavored milk. The decision to offer only plain milk is clearly better for the students. According to the Centers for Disease Control, a serving of low-fat chocolate milk contains 53 more calories than a serving of low-fat white milk (1). These are mostly empty calories, which have no nutritional value whatsoever. Children under the age of 9 should not take in more than 120 empty calories a day (2). By drinking a carton of chocolate milk, young children are consuming nearly 50% of this daily limit. For this reason, the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity strongly discourages serving flavored milk (3). Opponents of banning flavored milk argue that all flavors of milk contain the same quantities of important nutrients. While this is true, children will absorb more of these nutrients if they choose to drink plain milk as opposed to chocolate milk. Chocolate contains oxalate, a naturally occurring compound in cocoa beans, which can inhibit the absorption of calcium. One study found that a single 100 gram dose of dark chocolate increased calcium excretion by 147% (4). According to another study, \u201cHigher frequency of chocolate consumption is linearly related to lower bone density and strength\u201d (5). Opponents of banning flavored milk also argue that some children simply will not drink plain milk. However, most students will select healthy foods if they are prompted to do so (6). Furthermore, evidence has shown that children who are continually exposed to healthy foods will learn to prefer these foods. These children will also develop a decreased preference for sweetened foods (7). Based on these conclusions, students who drink plain milk on a regular basis should develop less of a preference for chocolate milk. This has several important implications for schools. Administrators may feel that it makes sense to serve chocolate milk to increase children\u2019s initial acceptance of milk. However, this strategy will actually result in decreased long-term acceptance of unsweetened foods, including white milk. Conclusion: Our society has a responsibility to help students develop healthy eating habits. Banning flavored milk in our schools is an excellent way to accomplish this task.

            "conclusion": "Soft Drinks are unhealthy and bad for you.",
            "premise": "Hello and thanks for posting this debate. I'd like to note that English is not my first language and that this is my first debate. I apologize in advance for any grammar or debate structure errors. I will start by showing that it is we are debating. My opponent makes the claim that \u2018soft drinks are bad unhealthy and bad for you\u2019. I\u2019ll go about showing that most of the arguments against soft drinks are based on incomplete truths or outright myths, and that as many other types of foods, soft drinks\u2019 healthiness depends largely on the drinker\u2019s diet, while also rebutting Pro. Let\u2019s define the language used by my opponent and see what we need to look for in determining if Pro is right or wrong. Definitions: Soft drink \u2013 a beverage that typically contains water, usually a sweetener, and usually a flavoring agent. http://en.wikipedia.org... Unhealthy \u2013 not conducive to health http://www.merriam-webster.com... Bad \u2013 failing to reach an acceptable standard http://www.merriam-webster.com... By Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition, unhealthy could be understood not necessarily as damaging to a person\u2019s health, but only not improving it, referring so as to remain in a current health status. I assume unhealthy in the sense that it is harmful to your health because the Pro also argues that they are \u2018bad for you\u2019 and in the context of his arguments. The consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other obesity related diseases. My argument is that soft drinks are one of many foods with high sugar content. To be nutritionally healthy, one has to consume a recommended amount of sugar and calories. These associations with obesity and its resulting diseases, such as diabetes, are correlated with high sugar consumption and high calorie diets, not soft drinks per se. Obesity is mainly caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and soft drinks will not cause obesity if consumed in amounts that do not surpass the recommended daily calorie and sugar intake. Americans level of obesity is tied to a very unhealthy lifestyle caused by a poor diet in general, and low levels of exercise. I argue later about the specificity of the American population's health and its relation to soft drink consumption. The calorie and sugar content in an average soft drink is under their respective recommended daily intake. For them to reach unhealthy levels, excess amount need to be drank. One could maybe argue that soft drinks are unhealthy if the consumption of the average ration surpasses daily recommendations of its ingredients, but this is not the case. I will ignore the following arguments for several reasons and give a rebuttal about the rest later: -\u2018The sugar in a normal Coca-Cola can make you vomit if it is eaten itself.\u2019 Correlation does not imply causation. Assuming the cause of vomiting is the amount of sugar eaten and no other causes of nausea by sugar such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Proof is needed so that this argument can be taken as true for the general population. Even the nausea itself could be triggered by so many arbitrary reasons that singling out pure sugar as a cause of vomiting would require very specific experiments. Lastly, even assuming it does indeed trigger vomiting, vomit does not mean that you are eating something unhealthy. Maybe for this argument to be more relevant to our debate, the normal Coca-Cola should be the one triggering the vomit. -\u2018Soft-Drinks account for a nearly 13% of total calories. An average American drinks 50 gallons of soft drink a year.\u2019 A percent of an unknown total amount of calories gives no base to the rest of the consumed foods and its healthiness. Volumes of soft drink in a group only means a particular population has the habit of consuming an amount of soft drink. Even if the American population is known to have high indexes of obesity, the volume of soft drinks does not cause an amount of daily calorie intake which is the main correlation to obesity. Soft drinks have a high variance in its caloric and sugar content, they can go from 0 to the hundreds (caloric units and grams respectively). -\u2018Think about the amount of sugar you are drinking. The result is deadly. This leads to diabetes and eventually death.\u2019 High daily sugar intake is deadly. Sugar intake effects cannot be generalized without a specific amount and the health status of the person taking it. The average amount of sugar in a can of soft drink does not surpass the recommended daily intake, so soft drinks, because of their sugar, cannot be deadly. -\u2018Secondly, calcium is important for the maintenance of strong bones. Without calcium, our bones will slowly rot and it can't maintain the sufficient integrity of teeth\u2019 The lack of an ingredient in a soft drink has nothing to do with the lack of calcium in a diet. I will give a formal rebuttal in the next round of the unhealthiness of soft drinks assuming an average ration. http://en.wikipedia.org...http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...http://en.wikipedia.org...http://www.sugarstacks.com...http://en.wikipedia.org...http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "conclusion": "Beer, in moderation, is healthier for you than milk.",
            "premise": "I have greatly enjoyed this debate and hope to engage in another one with my opponent in the future. As for now, let us finish up. 1. Providing the actual source now is inadequate. As I have said before, the research is being used out of context. Does calcium excretion increase if protein levels increase? Yes, because as any student who took anatomy&physiology knows, charged proteins maintain an ionic balance and charged calcium ions can flow differently depending on the amount of protein in the blood. However, animal proteins are broken down into amino acids and their net charge becomes neutral. This in addition to the amount of protein in the blood made up by albumin and blood cells, as well as the fact that Dr. Heaney is talking about extracellular calcium as opposed to the calcium in bones, makes my opponent's point negligible in terms of calcium loss. This is simply a propaganda ploy. 2. I have never said that there is no trace of those chemicals in cows. I have provided sources showing that they have been tested to healthy levels, my opponent is making a strawman argument. Furthermore, my opponent's source is flawed. Anyone who indicates that inflammation is treated with antibiotics is either an idiot, or is talking about a bacterial infection. As such is the case, we can assume that antibiotics are not given for long term prevention, but when the need arises. In such case, the presence of antibiotics would be minimal. And yes, the chemicals are linked to cancer, but the concentration in milk is nowhere near a cancerous dose in any way, shape or form. A point that my opponent's biased source cares not to mention. 3. In regards to testing for beta lactams: beta lactam antibiotics make up the most common types of antibiotics. The other families are not widely used in cows and many of them are heat labile or denature quickly in hostile environments outside body pH and temperature. Thus, they are a minimal concern. 4. My opponent in his next section, uses some pretty sneaky tactics. First of all, he puts my source into question by stating that a citation is needed. However, the citation is only needed on a statement saying that a panel agreed with the FDA's declaration that milk contained safe levels of animal hormones. The actual FDA statement contains a citation. 5. In addition, my opponent criticizes the \"huge jump\". Yes, while the jump is big, the numbers were still low, and as I have said before, the study DID take into consideration the fact that milk was widely used. The source even stated that as the reason the investigation was being performed. 6. In such case, how is my opponent to know that this cow's milk is actually going to be used? It seems to me that he just google-imaged a picture of a cow with swollen udders. Logically speaking, FDA moderated farms and centers for milk production would be mechanized such that this could be prevented. 7. As I have stated, I was referring to the original journal articles regarding the experiments that my opponent's site has cited as a source. In other words, the source of your source said nothing about milk. How are they connecting the dots? This is to show that my opponent's source is drawing information incorrectly. I have provided sources that show that IGF-1 is at safe levels in milk, and that the assumption that it causes problems in the body is founded on half-logic. 8. In reference to the biased and unreliable experiments/trials http://en.wikipedia.org... My opponent did not scan through well enough. See \"Constroversies\" \"none of the studies were performed in a manner to create an unbiased scientific opinion\" \"indicated no statistically significant findings\" \"Evidence for efficacy of these diets is currently unsubstantiated\" 9. I was not declaring that moderate drinking causes liver damage. I was stating that those who are on prescription medication to allow for moderate drinking would be susceptible to liver damage. 10. It actually is not relevant. Number of \"drug abusers\" is irrelevant to this debate because your definition of a \"drug abuser\" is incorrect. However, the number of people on prescription medication is relevant. In developed countries, use of prescription medication is almost exactly the same as in the U.S. In underdeveloped countries, the benefits of beer that you list are of no consequence because the benefits are only good for a civilization with cardiovascular impairment. Developing countries would be more focused on sustenance, and milk would be healthier for them than beer in that regard, because their children are starving. 11. I am familiar with the generic and brand names of these drugs, but are you also aware that OTC does not mean \"take as you please\"? Have you ever tried the combination of alcohol and sleeping pill? Zantac should NOT be taken with alcohol, the fact that you are advocating it is like a stab to the professional side of me. 12. In that case, we will not discuss non-alcoholic beer because I find it ridiculous anyway. However, I accepted your definition of \"milk\" and apologize for including soy milk. However, I can very freely mention lactose-free milk if the milk simply has the lactose removed or cleaved. Things are added to beer and they can still be called beer. Simply adding lactase to milk destroys the lactose and makes lactose intolerance irrelevant. Removing the lactose or the fat is perfectly fine too, because the fluid itself came from the cow or the goat, but lactose is a sugar, a solid. You made no mention of the solid. I would also like to note that while watching \"Yakitate Japan!\", an anime about making bread, I learned that goat milk actually has little to none of the controversial problems that cow's milk has, and have found verification online, since my opponent has mentioned goat milk several times. http://altmedangel.com... http://www.goatworld.com... http://naturalmedicine.suite101.com... http://www.crohns.net... http://www.associatedcontent.com... Goat milk is consumed more than cow milk worldwide, and those with lactose intolerance can somehow consume goats milk without any problems. In addition, goat milk is devoid of all the high-industry chemicals, has healthier fats and cholesterol that help rather than harm, has a different type of casein that people are insensitive to, and is responsible for nearly no allergies. Goat milk is widely used as a replacement for cow milk worldwide. My opponent's burden in this debate is to show that beer is more healthy than milk. He himself has specified that the debate was limited to milk that comes from animals. I have not only shown most (if not all) of his sources against cow milk to be questionable, but also that his arguments for the \"average person\" show that the inclusion of alcohol in an average person's lifestyle will be more harmful than helpful. Furthermore, in my curiosity as to why my opponent has mentioned but not spoken about goat milk, decided to research it for my opponent, and found that it has absolutely none of the defects my opponent complains about in terms of cow milk. Thus, I have not only reduced my opponents points to the speculation that it is, but also provided an example of a milk that is far healthier than beer. Thank you for the debate. I urge a CON vote.",

My argument naturally follows to it's conclusion albeit with an implicit premise and therefore my argument has great explanatory power, that is, if my argument hold strong no matter if my opponent likes it or any one does we have to concede the argument. My opponents argument however, has no explanatory power at all. Even if we grant all the premises he brings forward(which we will not be doing if you were wondering), it doesn't naturally follow that Cow's Milk isn't superior. At best it shows that Soy Milk has some advantages which I in fact never argued wasn't the case. My opponent offensive therefore really doesn't hurt my case at all, but nor does it strengthen his own. Hence even if you say my argument is completely invalid at best you should award us a tie in the arguments portion of the debate. The Protein Issue While I was mistaken on the protein portion of the contest, it was because of an oversight of serving size, in which I deeply apologize. However, my opponent drops my portion of the argument about biological values and different types of protein and therefore concedes that even if they have the same amount of protein, Cow's Milk is still far superior in types of protein. He also never addresses the fact that Soy is a plant protein and therefore not a complete protein. I will consider this dropped. The Vitamin Issue So I mention 4 vitamins are essential for the growth and development of human beings as well as the maintaining of a healthy lifestyle and my opponent mentions two. Furthermore, Vitamin B-12 and Vitamin A are both essential nutrients and without them you will die. So his folate argument really falls short here. Furthermore, there are many many sources of folate. You don't need Soy Milk at all to get folate. Anyway you look at it, four is still more than two. The Price Tag My opponent breezes past this point but he fails to say what he is saying. I would ask my opponent, are cigarettes of higher quality and importance(emphasis) than say his Soy Milk. Because it would seem that it costs more. We could also ask if a Big Mac is better Quality than Soy Milk. Quality isn't determined by market value. Quality is determined by comparing characteristics and benefits of one thing over another, while the market is determined by what people are willing to pay for. While some things that are more expensive are of high quality, it does not follow that everything of a higher price is of higher quality. To illustrate this point I will further elaborate, a experiment was preformed by a youtube channel called Brad Hensen did a taste test of In-N-Out versus Five Guys. There was obviously slight bias here, since it was out of California nonetheless the In-N-Out fries taste test was near even with In-N-Out only winning by one point. When it came to burgers however, In-N-Out blew Five Guys out of the water with a score of 18 to 1. However, the price of one In-N-Out burger was much much less than Five Guys(about 5.39 versus 3.80). So my opponents argument is invalid and my premise stands to support the argument. Most people are not lactose intolerant Anyone who clicks on his source will see even if you read the entire case study it never ever says that most people are lactose intolerant, what the case study shows is that if you eat excess lactose foods( 33 grams a day!!) you will suffer negative effects. There are only 5 grams of Lactose in a serving size of Cow's Milk. So unless you drinking 6 glasses of Milk a day, then this study is irrelevant. Another problem with the study was that it was only 21 days long and the short term effects were only shown. We don't know if there bodies would have adapted in the long term to this diet. If you change your diet dramatically in anyway you bound to have some negative effects. This includes with Soy. My opponent is being dishonest when he says that Soy Milk can be drunk by everybody. There two distinct groups that cannot drink Soy that can drink Cow's Milk. People who are allergic to Soy. Plus people who are bodybuilder because it lowers testosterone and raises estrogen. This is because it reduces muscles gains. And even if that were true that most people couldn't drink it, it would be irrelavent because we could only compare these two things in the realm of people who could drink both. Also steroid rage, only applies to the small number of people who take steroids and even then it's never been scientifically proven that steroid rage actually exists. The only cases of evidence are anecdotal not scientifically studied claims. Carbs versus Fats I would like point out he never argues aganist my points explicitly for carbs being worse he just says because it sounds like fat is what makes us fat therefore it must be what makes us fat. Obviously this is a vast oversimplification and he consequenitally drops my carbs portion of the case, so he must concede Soy Milk does contain more carbs even if he doubts the importance which I will explain is a mistake below. My opponent says bodybuilders eat tons of carbs. While many bodybuilders do eat many carbs and no one would argue they don't , however they are referring to complex carbohydrates with a high glycemic index. My opponent just completely drops the point about carbs and only tries to punish me on fats. Nonetheless, just because nobody says \"your a carbo\" doesn't prove anything as my opponent fails to understand. It is laughable that they show the California governor instead of the bodybuilder Schwarzenegger to support their point. A analysis of 21 studies published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that \"a diet filled with saturated fat was not associated with increased risk.... [ of coronary heart disease, stroke or coronary vascular disease]\". The problem with carbohydrates is that it's very easy to binge on them because they satisfy us often more than the fatty counterparts, for example cheesy puffs versus pork chops(pork has more fat, cheesy puffs more carbs). Fat is actually the preferred fuel of the human body. Evolutionarily speaking, we have been eatting fat heavy fat foods for thousands of years and we only(relatively) recently started eating all these carbs. I mean meat naturally contains a decent amount of fat. Another problem with carbs is that they are hard to digest in comparison to Fat. If you are still doubting my position, think about this. We absolutely need fat to survive, lipids are absolutely required for making ATP while the body can produce it's own glucose. In fact, carbohydrates are the only macronutrients we can completely cut from our diet and be completely fine, eliminate fats or protein and eventually you will die from a nutrient deficiency. I thank my opponent as well as the judges for a good debate and hope the judges will vote Pro, Thank you.",

            "discussionTitle": "Cow milk is superior to Soy Milk.",
            "conclusion": "Cow milk is superior to Soy Milk.",
            "premise": "http://www.youtube.com... I thank my opponent for accepting this challenge to debate, I think this will be an enlightening experience for us both. I will be taking the position that Milk superior to Soy Milk today. I will explain why Cow milk is superior to Soy Milk via a series of contentions in this logically sound argument: 1. Superior means to be better or of greater quality or importance. 2. Cow's Milk has greater nutritional value then Soy Milk. 3. Cow's Milk costs less. 4. Therefore(from 2-3), Cow's Milk is superior to Soy Milk 1. The first premise is self-explanatory and is taken for granted via the definition of Superior. We can obtain the definition from Merriam-Webster Dictionary but I cross-referenced other dictionaries to check other definitions. They seemed to vary a bit on their definition so I took the two most common words, quality and importance. Furthermore, this is supported by our intuitive notion of what being superior means. Generally when we think of something being superior, we mean that the thing in question is better than something else in some way. 2. I am imagine that this will be the major point of contention so I want to make a few things clear: We should be using USDA standards for Soy Milk and Cow's Milk as specific brands are bound to vary(I should clarify I am using their official food reports from both). I mean if I select the carb and fat free Soy Milk from shelves then obviously it will have a different caloric composition than a Silk or the USDA official statistics. Also via the milk consumption statistics at the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, 11-28-13, the most common milk drunk by Americans is 2%. I couldn't find statistics from other countries, therefore I will use the nutrition facts from 2% even though I could argue from the perspective of whole milk and still win. When comes to fat, Soy Milk certainly does has the advantage for fat in both overall fat and saturated fat, this is not in question. What I am going to question is the value behind this, I don't think that the higher fat quantity is what really makes us fat. I will attempt to prove this intuitively as well as empirically. First, intuitively think about the classic unhealthy foods for example the cheesy puff, according to Calories Count About for one serving the cheesy puff has only 5 grams of fat which is about equivalent to a glass of Soy Milk. Why is it so bad then? The carbohydrates. The carbs in Cheesy puffs is what makes it so fattening, and the type of carbs that it is, namely glucose. This can be applied to Cake, Soda, etc. Next, let's move to Calcium now generally speaking Soy Milk's are not fortified with Calcium. Only certain brands are and they generally cost even more than regular soy milk. The USDA recognizes this in it's statistics. Soy Milk only gives you 6% of your daily value of Calcium while Cow's Milk provides 29%. That's nearly a 500% difference! Why is this important? Well, it's important because we have group of people called senior citizens who need cheap sources of calcium to help fight off many diseases such osteoporosis. Just staying in the realm of Calcium, Cow's Milk provides more in terms of Vitamin B-12, Vitamin A, and Potassium. Soy Milk not only has more carbs per serving than Cow's Milk(15g vs 12g) it has a worse quality of sugar than Cow's Milk does. See when nutritionist's take about Carbs being bad for you they referring to simple sugars like glucose, the kind of sugar found in Soy Milk, because they are hard to digest. However, they are not referring to carbs with a low glycemic index, like lactose(the kind of sugar in Cow's Milk). Now some argument might be made to the effect of some people are allergic to Lastose but some people are allergic to Soy and their is no fix for that. You can get Lactose free milk or take a supplement Lastase enzyme. Now the next point I want to make is on the subject of Protein. The word Protein comes from the greek and means of first importance, I would refer the judges to the definition I provided in premise one of superior. Not only does Cow's Milk have more protein(8 vs 3 grams) it's protein of a higher quality. Casein and Whey Protein are the most frequently proteins used by bodybuilders, they are animal proteins as well so they are a complete protein and contain all of the branch chain amino acids. Soy however, is a plant protein and generally incomplete protein's that need to be supplemented with something else. Furthermore, Whey and Casein have higher Biological Value than Soy does. Soy Protein has 74, Whey has 104, and Casein has 77. In fact according to a study done by Nutrition Metabolism, dieters who increased their protein intake by 30 percent had lost about 11 pounds over a 12 week period. Eat more protein, get leaner. Cow's Milk may have more fat but the protein will help us lose weight anyway. 3. Cow Milk tends to cost less than Soy Milk by a lot. For example, for a half-gallon of Soy Milk(according to Forbes) it costs from 3.99-4.29. This is for a half-gallon of Soy milk people! For entire gallon of Cow's Milk I can get the same price! Given people use Soy Milk for pretty much the same purposes and ends as Cow's Milk it's absolutely frivolous to pay twice as much for the same amount. Especially since 9.1% of the population drink a gallon of Milk a day from the mentioned Milk Consumption statistics. It would absolutely ridiculous to spend 8 dollars a day when you can spend half that budget. 4. This follows from deduction/induction. I have shown via definitions,intuition, scientific studies, and statistics that Cow's Milk is healthier and cheaper, and therefore is superior to Soy Milk. I didn't even need to go into the testosterone lowering effects of Soy or the detrimental effect of Soy on the digestive system. Please Vote Pro today :)",

            "premise": "Energy drinks are beneficial to students and can help improve their experience within the educational system. They have many benefits over regular beverages and are not as bad as many people think. Since they have an excess amount of caffeine, sugar, and other related ingredients, it allows them to have and give the consumer a high amount of excess energy. Since the person has consumed such a high amount, it allows them to complete tasks that they normally would not be able to do, whether mentally or physically. In physical terms, this is obvious as it can allow athletes to go beyond their body limitations and outperform those that have not used an energy drink. In mental terms, excess energy can make one go in a \"hyper\" state - which they cannot stop and stay idle and must continue to talk, move, think etc. This can be used to one's advantage if used and maintained properly, as the user can now process information and solve complex problems much faster than before, can have faster reactions and reflexes to reduce the amount of time and effort spent on the easier challenges in school, and the \"hyperness\" itself allows the user to have full concentration and motivation on what they desire (key factors to succeeding in anything). Unlike soda and juice which has excess chemicals and acids that are not healthy for one's body, there are many nutrients, minerals, and vitamins found in these drinks as well, making them great alternatives to water and milk. That's not to say there are no flaws, as once the hyper state is over, the exact opposite occurs which can do more bad than good to the user. Also too much of excess energy can even damage your health in the long run. Many ingredients also either do nothing at all or they simply are part of soda as well, not making them very healthy. But overlooking those past flaws and using energy drinks in moderation (everything needs moderation), students can indeed use these in educational facilities to better benefit their learning.",

Your examples are of omnivore diets; eskimos eat fish, and game, amazons insects, fish, livestock, and game. Being omnivores is what allows us to eat such a wide range of nutrition as a system is totally interwoven into our other bodily systems and so it is actually very incomplete to deduce that children who dont drink milk will have weaker bones or a calcium shortage. You are right. You could eat 33 cups of baby spinach, or 5 to 6 cups of cooked spinach to get the same calcium as 8 oz of milk. My point was more that no one really eat this much.

Actually there has been scientist that have claimed this; as a reason behind lactose intolerance. There was not much of a rebuttal. The rebuttal is we are getting used to it, because we have drank goat\u2019s milk and not cow\u2019s milk though out most of human history. large parts of indian civilisations up until the present have remained vegan for 1000s of years without any scientifically noticeable calcium deficient conditions incidentally these same people have also been reported to not spending their whole lives grazing on their vegetable curries to keep their nutritional standards in line with their omnivore brethren Can you site a source for even one Indian tribe that is vegan? however, realistically lets start by protecting the cows and hens whose pain we can clearly perceive......then we can go searching for carrots' tears and emotions.

I should like to reply to her contributories as follows: 1 \u2013 \"Tax payers should not be responsible for keeping other people happy and healthy.\" Britain is a civilised country where health care is considered to be a universal right and is provided according to need rather than ability to pay. I mean, why should a man go without a potentially life-saving beer just because he doesn't have the price of a pint? 2 \u2013 \"The resolution discriminates against women.\" When a man and a woman fall in love they may decide to get married. By convention, the man then buys the woman an engagement ring costing the equivalent to 20% of his annual salary. Then he provides her with a wedding ring, a house to live in and pays for the honeymoon. Then when they have children he works all the hours god sends to earn enough money to allow his wife to give up work to stay at home with the kids. Then she has an affair with the milkman / postman / window cleaner and files for a divorce. Then the court rules that she gets custody of the children and gets to keep the house and half their savings and although the man is chucked onto the streets and has to shell out for somewhere else to live, he still has to pay the mortgage on his old house and give his former wife enough money to enable her to live in the manner she is accustomed to. Hardly just and equitable is it? No, but it is a typical scenario. Never mind that though, it's still not enough apparently. Now my opponent is demanding that women get FREE BEER on top of all that! And most women don't even drink beer. It's just pure spite and greed, that's all it is. 3 \u2013 \"\u2026while there are some health benefits to drinking alcohol, there are some risks as well\u2026\" This is true but adults must be given the freedom to make their own decisions about what is good or bad for them. Nevertheless, most producers and purveyors of alcohol protect themselves from lawsuits display notices advising consumers to \"drink responsibly\" and no doubt something similar can be printed on the beer vouchers. 4 \u2013 \"Does that mean the government should be responsible for giving everyone vouchers to the gym or yoga seminars as well?\" The Government does provide free gymnasium and yoga sessions to people on low incomes. Indeed, jobless women who are lone parents can even get free pamper sessions at private spas to help boost their self-esteem. (1) And yes, the government does give out vouchers for free milk, fruit and vegetables to young mothers to keep their babies healthy (2) so why shouldn't they give out beer vouchers to keep men healthy? 5 \u2013 \"The government should not make their decisions solely on cost benefits alone.\" Putting to one side the fact that my opponent values lower taxes over human lives, people who work longer pay for their own retirement through their National Insurance contributions \u2013 the scheme is self-financing. (3) 6 \u2013 \"There's no proof that (a) Englishmen will utilize these vouchers or (b) that more employees would be needed.\" The British like their beer, make no mistake about that. In fact, the British drink almost 100 litres (210 US pints) of beer each per year - compared with around 80 litres per capita per annum in the US, 50 litres in Japan and 20 in China so the vouchers will definitely be used. (3) Indeed, since a lot of British men who previously didn't drink or drank very little (Muslims, ladyboys / Tottenham Hotspur fans, etc.) will take up drinking beer when they realise what health benefits can accrue from its consumption it stands to reason that the breweries and pubs will be busier than ever and crying out for new staff. 7 \u2013 \"\u2026you'll have a greater chance of there being people who are drunk and/or who can't handle their alcohol.\" It is true that there are problems associated with misuse of alcohol, but they are normally associated with strong yet cheap drinks like cider and vodka. Beer is relatively weak and you can easily drink two pints and still be under the legal limit allowed to drive a car. (4) 8 \u2013 It may well be the case that vouchers will exchange hands for cash. Muslims, for example, may put their faith before their health, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is a free country. So, in conclusion we can see that there are no legitimate reasons why free beer vouchers shouldn't be given to all adult males in Britain in order to protect their health and I would urge you to vote Pro for in support of this very worthwhile scheme.

            "premise": "My opponent who made statement saying that you need highly educated nutritionist to make sure you get all your nutrients from a vegan diet which is certainly not true. Then my opponent made a claim that if you eat from wide source of foods it is very hard to be deficient in vitamins but if you are vegan it is easier which is true since some animals have more amounts of certain nutrients by how much not that much. He also said that excluding fish form your diet will make you deficient in omegas 3 and omegas 6 which also not true there are many plants that have those same nutrients that have about the same amount of grams ratio of fish. These foods include avocados and green leafy vegetables which if you are vegan you will be eating a lot of green leafy vegetables, and if you don\"t corn, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and nuts too. Also, too the calcium and protein deficient problems which rarely happens in any diet it\"s almost impossible to get protein deficiency\"s beans have about the same amount of protein for beef that weighs 100 grams and many other plants that give you the sufficient amount protein you need broccoli, kale, and many other vegetables that are like them. Back to the calcium part cup almond milk roughly have same amount of calcium of cup of milk and if you don\"t drink almond milk you can drink orange juice that good source of calcium too. So, you don\"t have to take huge amounts of plants, so you don\"t have to be deficient in certain nutrients. So being vegan will ultimately keep your sufficient in key nutrients and you will not get deficient or starve. All these foods will not make you cause to get animal related diseases making you ultimately healthier. Also to the part where my opponent made statement that I was saying that going vegan you make all your whole life aspects healthier, well to some I might be trying to say this but I wasn\"t I was trying to say it make your health in your body healthier that\"s all even though if you are healthier you are more likely to e ore active.",

I hope this will be a good debate and wish him good luck in this debate and in the Tournament.Arguments:The resolution is \"Access to drinking water ought to be valued as a human right instead of as a commodity\".P1: About \"Access\"Human beings need water to survive. Because of physical processes like breathing, the body losses water all the time.Deshydratation [1] occurs when your body doesn't have as much water as it should.Causes may be diseases that cause vomiting or diarrhea, fever, urinating too much, or because you don't drink enough water.The lack of access to water leads to deshydratation which with enough time is fatal. In other words, water is a primary necessity.P2: About \"drinking water\"The mentioned water needs to be \"suitable for drinking\". Contaminated water leads to a lot of diseases.Here are some statistics from the World Health Organization: [2]Diarrhoeal disease: 2 million annual deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.Cholera: more than 50 countries still report cholera to the World Health Organization.Cancer and tooth/skeletal damage: millions exposed to unsafe levels of naturally-occurring arsenic and fluoride.Schistosomiasis: an estimated 260 million infected \"Drinking water\" is necessary for a healthy life, and in a lot of cases, for life.P3: About human rightsCon here gave a counter definition for human rights. I accept this definition and add that it might be way better for the debate.\"The freedoms, immunities, and benefits that, according to modern values, all human beings should be able to claim as a matter of right in the society in which they live.\"Why access to drinking water should be considered a human right?The article 3 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [3] is about the right to life, liberty and security of person. The right to access to drinking water is akin to the right to life.For that reason, the UN General Assembly recognized the human right to water and sanitation. The right to water is a need-based human right.Now, the fact that the right is recognized by an organization doesn't mean it ought to be like that, but it's clear what is the argument about.\"Drinking water\" and sanitation are essential for the realisation of all human rights.P4: About \"commodity\"Here, Con propose another counter definition. I accept the definition again.Now, the resolution says \"instead of a commodity\".Drinking water should not be a commodity because we can't ensure the right to water and the commodity at the same time.Right now you can buy bottled water, but 43% of Africans in cities don't have access to water. [5]For all those reasons I think access to drinking water should be considered a human right and not a commodity.Thanks.

            "premise": "Hello, thank you for taking the time to read my position on veganism. Living a vegan lifestyle is the best way to ensure your own personal health, as well as the stability of the environment, and the health and happiness of sentient beings. ENVIRONMENT: Animal agriculture is an absolute disaster for our planet for many reasons. It is a major cause of deforestation and ocean dead zones. There is a constant demand for more land to keep livestock and grow crops to feed said livestock and most of the time, the only available land is covered by forest. Forests are an extremely important part of keeping the planet's climate in check and provide habitats for wildlife. The waste from the animals ends up in our fresh water and in the oceans, which creates incredible amounts of pollution, which create dead zones in the oceans. Factory farms majorly contribute to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In fact, animal agriculture adds at least 32 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere EVERY YEAR. There is also the ridiculous amount of methane produced by cattle. In addition to all of this, animal agriculture is a massive waste of water. Think about it, there are millions of animals that drink many, many gallons of water every day. Agriculture uses around 70% of the world's fresh water. That water could be going towards humans who need it and towards sustainable crops to feed humans. The land used by animal agriculture could also go towards growing sustainable crops for human consumption, which would result in diminishing world hunger. HEALTH: Consuming animal products increases our chances of serious diseases and shortens our lifespans. Proteins in animal products can not be properly and fully digested in our systems. Consumption of animal products contributes to cancer, heart diseases, and strokes, among other issues. Animal products also change the pH in our bodies, creating a great environment for bacteria and cancer cells to thrive. This pH change in combination with the proteins and hormones (particularly from dairy) also decreases our bone density, which ultimately results in osteoporosis. Animal products are also dangerously high in saturated fats and cholesterol, which are common knowledge awful for our health, and are the main causes of the health issues from animal products. ETHICAL Humans exploit and enslave animals in a multitude of ways, but here, I will focus on the food aspect. I will start this with dairy. Humans are the only animals on the planet that not only continue to consume milk after they are weaned from their mothers, but we are also the only ones to take the milk from mothers of different species. Dairy cattle are forcefully bred each year, and within a couple days of a cow's calf being born, her calf is ripped away from her and forced into a veal crate. If you are against veal, you are also against dairy, because without dairy, there is no veal. These cows live in unforgivable conditions. More often than not, they don't even have room to even turn around and they spend their days up to their ankles in their own waste. They are hooked up to milking machines which hurt the cattle and create open sores on their udders. Keep in mind that the blood and pus from these open sores ends up in your milk, along with traces of feces and urine. Beef cattle are packed like sardines into holding pens and live (and die) in extremely stressful, traumatizing conditions. Killers attempt to knock the cattle unconscious before hanging them upside down and slitting their throats, but more often than not, the cattle are still alive throughout the entire process until they eventually bleed to death or choke to death on their own blood. Both egg and meat chickens live either in tiny cages or packed warehouses. These chickens are packed with hormones to grow faster and to produce more eggs. The chickens endure debeaking (having the tips of their beaks burned off) while fully conscious with no painkillers or aftercare. Once chicks hatch from eggs, if they are male, they are typically ground up alive, and if they are female, they are forced to live the miserable life of an egg laying hen. Pigs also live in very confined spaces and up to their bellies in their own waste. There are so many atrocities, I can not list them here. If you take the time to watch Earthlings (link is in my sources) you will see just how cruel humans are to animals. Animals are sentient, self-aware creatures who want to live and be healthy just like the rest of us. They feel fear and pain their entire lives up until the very moment they are brutally murdered. FINAL THOUGHTS Human beings were never supposed to consume animal products on the scale we do today. It is unsustainable for our planet and our own well being. If we were meant to eat it, we would be able to eat it raw without worries and we wouldn't have to season and marinate it in order for it to taste good to us. Animal agriculture is unnecessary and detrimental. You can get the same exact flavors from plant based items and far more health benefits. VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLAR AND YOUR LIFESTYLE.

            "conclusion": "Fast food should be banned in the U.S!",
            "premise": "In spite of fast food being unhealthy, there are healthier alternatives fast food restaurants provide. For instance, the article on USA TODAY, \"Fast-food restaurants pledged to offer healthier options for kids. How have they done?\" written on August 10,2017 by Sarah Toy stated,\"Here\"s the good news for public health advocates: In 2016, none of the chains\" websites listed sugary soda and other soft drinks on the kids\" menu. And online, they had all added at least one healthier drink to their kids' menus, such as juice, water or low-fat milk, and at least one healthier side dish, such as fresh fruit or yogurt.\"(Toy). These restaurants are not out for our health, they're simply just here to help. With healthier alternatives we don't have to fear. In, \"allaboutmanners\" an article written in January 27, 2014, they claim, \"Just about every fast food restaurant offers some kind of healthy alternatives today. Whether it\"s grilled chicken sandwiches, wraps, or salads, there is usually something for everyone.One thing to keep in mind is that healthier options generally tend to be a little more expensive. But because it is fast food, you are still going to save money over homemade foods.\"(ALLABOUTMANNERS\"). In conclusion fast food restaurants should not be banned in the US due to it being saving people money,time, and also being a bit more healthy. https://health.usnews.com... https://allaboutmanners.wordpress.com...",

It would increase the rates of binge drinking and intoxication. Using other countries that have lower drinking ages as a standard, allowing alcohol consumption at the age of 18 would create higher rates of binge drinking and intoxication in the 18-20 age demographic.

            "conclusion": "California should adopt New York City's restriction on the sale of sugary drinks.",
            "premise": "Hello, first I would like to refute and make rejoinders, then I would like to refute their new points.First we said,Proposition: Point #1 is \"Americans are becoming obese.\"Opposition: Banning certain sizes of soda is not the correct solvency. (People can go back for seconds....) The solvency instead, is to place a tax on the sugary drinks. With the money earned, the government can spend money on more important things in life, such as the educational system. (The government can use the money to teach kids about good healthy eating ways. Proposition (2): Schools already doing that, but it does not stop adults from drinking sugary drinks.Opposition (2): The realization is that these kids have not yet become adults, so they have not had a chance to prove what they have learned. I would like to also mention that we aren't trying to STOP people from drinking sugary drinks, instead, drinking safely. Proposition (3): Students are learning everyday, and they are being tested everyday, so instead of just shoving them all their tests when they become adults, we are making them learn day by day. Proposition: Point #2 is \"Sugary Drinks lead to health problems.\"Opposition: However, this argument is non-unique as it can happen anywhere, with anything, to anyone. Eating too much rice leads to a negatively affected back. Too much weightlifting could injure your arms. Too much reading can hurt your eyes. Obviously, this also applies to sugary drinks, and also everything else in the world. Tying into the proposition's third point, they mentioned such \"health choices\" such as Iced Coffee, but Iced Coffee is not a healthy choice as the result of caffeine. Proposition (2): They said to my second point that health problems can happen anywhere, not just sugary drinks. According to (http://www.livestrong.com............) in the article Health Problems and Soft Drinks, it states that soft drinks cause tooth decay, obesity, and other health problems.Opposition (2): The proposition has not directly rejoined, as in their Prop. 2, they only showed statistics that soft drinks do cause health problems. They did not refute the point made that their second argument is non-unique.Proposition (3): Actually, it is directly joined because our point is that it leads to health problems, and we have clearly brought up evidence that leads directly to Sugary drinks causing health problems. Proposition: Point #3 is \"Healthy alternatives are available.\"Opposition: My opponent's third point was that healthy alternatives are available. Unfortunately, it does not make an impact whether there are healthy choices or not. There are already lots of healthy alternatives, with or without sugary drinks, and either way, they won't work if they aren't enforced. Thus, this argument that the Proposition side makes has no ground. Again, as an example, Iced Coffee was included. Iced Coffee is unhealthy because of all the caffeine affecting your brain and so is not a healthy choice at all. Proposition (2): They said to my third point that it is not impacted, so I will impact it now. My third point is trying to say that there are other healthy alternatives that are available, and not as expensive, such as water. Water is very healthy for you, and it does not make you become obese.Opposition (2): The proposition commented on how that water, an healthy alternative, is not as expensive. However, in some places that is the exact opposite. In the middle of the desert, for ex. Utah, water is an unavailable resource that cannot be easily retrieved and must be bought. Additionally, the Proposition has dropped the fact about their mentioning of Iced Coffee. Proposition (3). What we are trying to point out is that in most places, water is very free and it is healthy for you. Also, that still does not refute their point about having healthy alternatives because all they are saying is that water is expensive. The problem is that water is less expensive then sugary drinks, even in the desert because sugary drinks needs some sort of water to start it off, and water by itself is good. The bad things about sugary drinks is that they add sugar to the water. Proposition: Point #4 is \"It's an expense that people don't need to spend.\"Opposition: My opponent's fourth point was that \"It's an expense that people don't need to spend\". First of all, it should be an individuals choice of what to do. Additionally, the money is keeping our economy circulating. At this time, we cannot have a worse economy. Proposition (2): They said to my fourth point that it's the people's choice. It is their choice, we are just limiting the amount that they drinks. We are not saying that they can never drink soft drinks anymore, we are just changing it so that the amount that you drink is a healthy amount for your body. Since it is the government's duty to protect its citizens, we should adopt New York City's restriction on the sale of sugary drinks.Opposition (2): My opponent has stated that it's still the people's choice, just a bit more limited. However, a individuals choice isn't as free if there are limits. On top of this, they have mentioned that it is the government's duty to protect it's citizens. But it is also the government's duty to make sure their citizens are happy. By limiting freedom, by placing a limit on choices, citizens will not be happy at all. I would like to comment that they have dropped the refutation of economy. Proposition (3): What is more important, people staying alive while being a decent amount of happy, or citizens becoming obese and not able to do anything so the economy goes down, because people with health problems will not be able to work. (That also refutes their statement about the economy) We are not making all citizens unhappy. Half of them will be really happy, while others will be safer and a descent amount of happy.Opposition: Point #1 \"Banning Sugary Drinks Violates the People's Freedom.\"Proposition (2):Their first point is that Banning Sugary Drinks Violates The People's Freedom. If we follow along to what they are saying, taxing sugary drinks is also taking away people's Pursuit of Happiness, because they don't want to pay a tax on their sugary drinks.Opposition (2): Of course, there is a limit to freedom. However, the limit does NOT INCLUDE CHOICES. Choices will and cannot be denied. On top of this, taxing will not take away the pursuit of happiness because it gives back directly to the people, by adding conveniences such as better roads and education.Proposition (3): In fact, most people hate paying taxes, so that actually is going against the pursuit of happiness by taxing them, as their plan clearly states. Also, most of the taxpayers money doesn't go back to them, and since they have not stated any clear evidence, please make sure that they will not post any sources in their 3rd argument, because that is bringing up a new source (a new point).I will not post our arguments here, because I will run out of characters. This is to their second point: Again, they also have not brought up an sources that the tax money will go to places like medicare, so please make sure that they do not bring this up in their next argument. And they also have agreed with us that without a good economy, we can't have the needs for a halthy life. Now I would like to way this debate. Their main point is that it helps the economy. We have clearly stated that if people get health problems, it will hurt the economy because a) People will become to obese to work and so their will be less people working and b) And people might die. Since lives and the economy are the most important thing in this debate, I strongly urge a proposition ballet.Thank you.",

            "conclusion": "California should adopt New York City's restriction on the sale of sugary drinks.",
            "premise": "Hello again!First of all, I would like to refute/rejoind my opponents' points. Then, if space allows, I will bring up new arguments. To make this debate easy to understand, for my refutations/rejoinders, I have made the opposition side in bold, and the proposition side italic. Please also know that (2) means the second round. Thank you!Proposition: Point #1 is \"Americans are becoming obese.\"Opposition: Banning certain sizes of soda is not the correct solvency. (People can go back for seconds....) The solvency instead, is to place a tax on the sugary drinks. With the money earned, the government can spend money on more important things in life, such as the educational system. (The government can use the money to teach kids about good healthy eating ways. Proposition (2): Schools already doing that, but it does not stop adults from drinking sugary drinks.Opposition (2): The realiazation is that these kids have not yet become adults, so they have not had a chance to prove what they have learned. I would like to also mention that we arn't trying to STOP people from drinking sugary drinks, instead, drinking saftley. Proposition: Point #2 is \"Sugary Dinks lead to health probelms.\"Opposition: However, this argumen is non-unique as it can happen anywhere, with anything, to anyone. Eating too much rice leads to a negativly affected back.Too much weightlifting could injure your arms. Too much reading can hurt your eyes. Obviously, this also applies to sugary drinks, and also everything else in the world. Tying into the proposition's third point, they mentioned such \"health choices\" such as Iced Coffee, but Iced Coffee is not a healthy choice as the result of caffeine. Proposition (2): They said to my second point that health problems can happen anywhere, not just sugary drinks. According to (http://www.livestrong.com.........) in the article Health Problems and Soft Drinks, it states that soft drinks cause tooth decay, obesity, and other health problems.Opposition (2): The propostion has not directly rejoined, as in their Prop. 2, they only showed statistics that soft drinks do cause health probelms. They did not refute the point made that their second argument is non-unique.Proposition: Point #3 is \"Healthy alternatives are available.\"Opposition: My opponent's third point was that healthy alternatives are available. Unfortunatly, it does not make an impact whether there are healthy choices or not. There are already lots of healthy alternatives, with or without sugary drinks, and either way, they won't work if they aren't enforced. Thus, this argument that the Proposition side makes has no ground. Again, as an example, Iced Coffee was included. Iced Coffee is unhealthy because of all the caffeine affecting your brain and so is not a healthy choice at all. Proposition (2): They said to my third point that it is not impacted, so I will impact it now. My third point is trying to say that there are other healthy alternatives that are available, and not as expensive, such as water. Water is very healthy for you, and it does not make you become obese.Opposition (2): The proposition commented on how that water, an healthy alternative, is not as expensive. However, in some places that is the exact opposite. In the middle of the desert, for ex. Utah, water is an unavailable resource that cannot be easily retrieved and must be bought. Additionally, the Proposition has dropped the fact about their mentioning of Iced Coffee. Proposition: Point #4 is \"It's an expense that people don't need to spend.\"Opposition: My opponent's fourth point was that \"It's an expense that people don't need to spend\". First of all, it should be an individual's choice of what to do. Additionally, the money is keeping our economy circulating. At this time, we cannot have a worse economy. Proposition (2): They said to my fourth point that it's the people's choice. It is their choice, we are just limiting the amount that they drinks. We are not saying that they can never drink soft drinks anymore, we are just changing it so that the amount that you drink is a healthy amount for your body. Since it is the government's duty to protect its citizens, we should adopt New York City's restriction on the sale of sugary drinks.Opposition (2): My opponent has stated that it's still the people's choice, just a bit more limited. However, a individual's choice isn't as free if there are limits. On top of this, they have mentioned that it is the government's duty to protect it's citizens. But it is also the government's duty to make sure their citizens are happy. By limiting freedom, by placing a limit on choices, citizens will not be happy at all. I would like to comment that they have dropped the refutation of economy. Opposition: Point #1 \"Banning Sugary Drinks Violates the People's Freedom.\"Proposition (2):Their first point is that Banning Sugary Drinks Violates The People's Freedom. If we follow along to what they are saying, taxing sugary drinks is also taking away people's Pursuit of Happiness, because they don't want to pay a tax on their sugary drinks.Opposition (2): Of course, there is a limit to freedom. However, the limit does NOT INCLUDE CHOICES. Choices will and cannot be denied. On top of this, taxing will not take away the pursuit of happiness because it gives back directly to the people, by adding conveniences such as better roads and education. Opposition: Point #2 \"Adopting The Ban On Sugary Drinks Hurts The Economy/The Opposition's Plan (mentioned above) Helps The Economy.\"Proposition (2): Their second point is that Adopting The Ban On Sugary Drinks Hurts The Economy. They said that helping the economy is more important then obesity matters. Unfortunately, if all people become obese, half of them would probably die, and half would be to obese to do any work, so the economy would fail anyways. And since lives are the most important things in this debate, I strongly urge a proposition ballet. Opposition (2): Their refutation can be used both ways. Without a good economy, one cannot have the nessasary materials to have a good healthy life. On top of this, the money earned from taxing could also be used to fund Medicare, Medicade, and other medical resources. Opposition: Plan; The counter plan would be that instead of banning sugary drinks, the govenrment would pass a law that would add 1cent of tax per 1 ounce. Thus, a 8 ounce can of sugary drinks would cost the original price and original tax, plus and 8 cent extra tax. This way, the government would not only make money, but it would also help decrease the amount of obesity in today's America. Proposition (2):They said that adding a tax would decrease the amount of obesity, but it's not like people that usually drink sugary drinks are going to stop drinking their normal amount because they have to pay 1 cent per ounce.Opposition (2): First of all, the Proposition has not provided a plan, thus, by defult we would go with the opposition's counter plan. On top of this, the proposition also impacted how charging 1 cent per ounce will not change the obesity rate. However, the realization is that with the money earned, we can heal not only obesity, but also other medical probelms such as cancer! We can SAVE LIVES, and lives are the most important thing in this debate. Additionally, they dropped the fact that the counter plan would help the economy. Unfortunatly, I won't be able to bring up any more points because I don't have enough space, and it won't be fare for the Proposition team if I bring up any more points. Have a nice day!Thank you!",

            "premise": "I will gladly accept this debate. Pro i hope this will be a learning session for you regarding the benefits of Chocolate Milk vs Milk (Normal Milk as you call it). First let me state that Milk can be 1%, 2%.3.7% fat or powedered. All of these affect the Nutrition Values. But for the sake of the argument we will use the Milk 1% and the Chocolate Milk (not reduced fat).Chocolate Milk Nutrition Values Calories 83 % Daily Value* Total Fat 3.4 g 5% Saturated fat 2.1 g 10% Polyunsaturated fat 0.1 g Monounsaturated fat 1 g Cholesterol 12 mg 4% Sodium 60 mg 2% Potassium 167 mg 4% Total Carbohydrate 10 g 3% Dietary fiber 0.8 g 3% Sugar 10 g Protein 3.2 g 6% Caffeine 2 mg Vitamin A 1% Vitamin C 1% Calcium 11% Iron 1% Vitamin D 12% Vitamin B-6 0% Vitamin B-12 5% Magnesium 3% Milk Nutrition Values Calories 42 % Daily Value* Total Fat 1 g 1% Saturated fat 0.6 g 3% Polyunsaturated fat 0 g Monounsaturated fat 0.3 g Cholesterol 5 mg 1% Sodium 44 mg 1% Potassium 150 mg 4% Total Carbohydrate 5 g 1% Dietary fiber 0 g 0% Sugar 5 g Protein 3.4 g 6% Vitamin A 0% Vitamin C 0% Calcium 12% Iron 0% Vitamin D 0% Vitamin B-6 0% Vitamin B-12 8% Magnesium 2% As you can see from the above tables taken from google (just google search Milk or Chocolate Milk) you can deduce that Chocolate Milk has more Vitamin C, More Iron, more Magnesium, more Vitamin D (12% more) and more Vitamin A. Milk has 5g less sugar than Chocolate Milk (has 10g) in a 100g sample. If fat is a problem for you then choose reduced-fat Chocolate Milk.Therefore Chocolate Milk is far more nutritious than Milk.

            "discussionTitle": "\"The minimum legal drinking age should be age 25\"",
            "conclusion": "\"The minimum legal drinking age should be age 25\"",
            "premise": "I thank darkkermit for the topic. ==Burden of proof== As the instigator, affirmative, and the one advocating a change to the status quo, my opponent has the burden of proving that changing the drinking age from 21 to 25 would be a good idea. ==Rebuttal== (a) protect oneself from harm My opponent assumes here that the paternalism principle \u2013 that government should protect us from ourselves \u2013 is sound. However, John Stuart Mills explains that we know our own preferences better than the government. [1] If someone over 21 gets more value from drinking alcohol than the potential detriment to her brain or liver, then she has the right to choose to consume alcohol. Libertarian ethics argue, in contrast, that if something does not harm others, the government should not regulate it. My opponent cites a few examples of good paternalistic policies: ---The war on drugs--- The war on drugs is largely considered a failure. [2] People simply refuse to stop using drugs in spite of their illegality, leading to the development of large crime networks for drug smuggling. James Gray of Rice University points out that it is easier for a teenager to purchase drugs in this country, than to purchase alcohol. [3] Mark Thornton of the Cato Institute points at that Alcohol Prohibition was equally a failure, and merely contributed to a rise in organized crime due to alcohol smuggling. [4] ---Seatbelts--- Lives saved due to seatbelts are mostly attributable to public education campaigns. [5] Even so, if people are dumb enough not to wear seatbelts, it's their right to risk their lives for the marginal comfort benefits. ---Helmets--- A study of 2500 overtaking motorists in the U.K. found that cars pass much closer to cyclists wearing helmets than those without, negating the safety benefits; thus, \"a blonde wig is safer than a helmet.\" [6] People should get to choose if they want to accept the safety risks of wearing a helmet. ---My opponent argues that people's brains aren't fully developed until age 25--- A federally funded MRI study on maturity levels looked at 12,000 brain connections in 238 volunteers and found that the brain is done developing by age 21. [7] ---My opponent argues that alcohol impedes adolescent development--- Adolescents are, by definition, under the age of 21 and thus cannot drink under current law. All the other detriments of alcohol are not unique to people aged 21-25, so they are irrelevant. My opponent is not advocating that alcohol be entirely banned, so he should limit his arguments to this age group. (b) protect others from harm My opponent notes that since the implementation of a minimum drinking age law in 1984, drunk driving deaths have declined among young people. What he fails to mention is that a significant public health campaign started during this time period involving groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). A good test of the minimum drinking age law is to see whether adult drunk driving fatalities also declined during this period. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, between 1982 and 2008, adult drunk driving deaths declined by 5,585, a decline of 35 percent. [8] This proves that drunk driving fatality declines are due, in large part, to education campaigns telling people to assign a designated driver and due to raising awareness of the dangers of drunk driving. The educational video Red Asphalt should convince anyone not to drive drunk. My opponent's statistics here also go to prove that people don't stop drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21, in spite of a minimum drinking age law. Lastly, the right to drink alcohol should be considered separate from issues regarding drunk driving. The dangers of drunk driving only prove that drunk driving should be illegal. Something being dangerous while driving is not a good standard for banning something entirely. Reading a book while driving is extremely dangerous. This doesn't mean reading should be banned entirely. A raised drinking age on the basis of drunk driving would be unfair to the vast majority of drinkers who never get behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated. ---Alcohol related crime--- Alcohol related crime, again, is not specific to the age group 21-25. My opponent takes no actions against a 26 year-old drunk husband who beats his wife, but punishes all 21-25 year-olds for the actions of a 24 year-old drunk husband who beats his wife. (c) overall benefits to society of a drinking age of 25 My opponent, again, fails to show any benefit of denying the specific age group 21-25 of alcohol privileges. I agree that Einstein should not be binge drinking at age 14. I, however, uphold his right to choose whether or not to drink after the age of 21. ==My case== C1) Revoking a right is impractical There will be significant backlash against raising the drinking age, among people who are between the ages of 21-25. These people have grown accustomed to the right to drink and will go to significant lengths to circumvent the new law. C2) Damages social lives Most people's social lives post-college (ages 22 and up) revolve around bars, nightclubs, and house parties. Many co-workers get to know each other outside work during happy hours. Denying alcohol consumption to working-age 22-25 year olds is extremely harsh, will limit their friendship circles, and will prevent them building relationships with co-workers. C3) Career opportunities Many business deals are struck over alcohol \u2013 the new law would hurt people's business opportunities if they are 25 or under. According to David Hanson, Ph.D., \"Sharing an alcoholic drink is a common part of doing business around the world. There's an expectation that people will indulge in alcohol on business-social occasions and it's useful in building business relationships.\" [9] C4) Treats the issue incorrectly Raising the drinking age treats alcohol consumption as an issue of criminal justice instead of as an issue of public health. I've already shown how criminal justice (War on Drugs, Alcohol Prohibition during the 1920's) fails, and how public health education campaigns (seatbelts, drunk driving) succeed. C5) Diminished likelihood of calling for help If drinking is \"illegal,\" people are less likely to call for help when someone gets alcohol poisoning. [10] This often leads to death. C6) Increases risky behavior Pushing drinking for 21-25 year-olds out of public places (bars, nightclubs), behind closed doors, increases risky behavior like binge drinking. According to Professor John McCardell, the law would create \"a dangerous culture of irresponsible and reckless behavior, unsupervised binge and extreme drinking.\" [11] C7) It's a right The act of drinking itself doesn't harm others. It, therefore, ought to be considered a right, and rights should not be unjustly revoked by the government. ==Conclusion== My opponent has only proven one harm to alcohol that is specific to the age group 21-25: that it stunts brain development. Yet I have proven that the brain is fully mature by age 21. In contrast, I cite benefits to the current drinking age law that are specific to the age group 21-25, such as the importance of alcohol to a social life and business relationships. I have thus upheld the Con side of the resolution. [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] http://tinyurl.com... [5] http://tinyurl.com...

            "premise": "I want to thank my opponent for accepting this debate challenge. With that being said it is very clear what has done to try and prove his position. He has taken found a few verse about wine that sound negative and posted them; in doing this he has ignored the context of all of these passage. This debate is about a whether or not the Bible condemns drinking wine. If it condemns it, it must be universal. A quick example of his misunderstanding of this issue is as follows. Isaiah 5:11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine. Isaiah 5:22 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks, Isaiah 24:9 No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers. Isaiah 28:7 And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. Each of these text condemn drunkeness, not drinking wine. My proposition is not the Bible condemns drunkeness, I agree with that, it does. While it condemns drunkeness it does not condemns drinking wine without getting drunk. Most of his other text refer to the law of the Nazarite and their pledge to not drink wine. That pledge also included grape juice. If his vow universally condemns all wine for everybody then it also condemns grape juice as well. The point is that it was a particular vow for a paticular person. If wine, not drunkenness, was condemned then Jesus would have never turned water into wine -John 2 Pauld would not have told Timothy to drink it for his stomach -1Timothy 5:23 Jesus would not have drank it - Matthew 11:18-19 The fact that Jesus drank it ends this debate. If it was a sin to drink it, then Jesus, who was God manifest in the flesh, could not have drank it. If Jesus drank it, then the bible does not condemn it. What we would like for our opponent to do is to give us a verse that condmens drinking wine, not drunkeness. If he does this then he will prove his point and disprove mine. I look forward to his attempt to do the impossible.",

Dairy is High in Calcium \". . .animal protein, including that from dairy products, may leach more calcium from the bones than is ingested, said Campbell, professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell and director of the Cornell-China-Oxford Project, the most comprehensive project on diet and disease ever conducted. 'This phenomenon could explain why Americans, who ingest much higher levels of calcium, have much higher rates of osteoporosis and hip fractures compared with many Chinese and other Asians who consume few dairy products and ingest low amounts of calcium,' Campbell said. Hip fractures in the United States, for example, are approximately five times more frequent than in China. . .increased levels of animal-based proteins, including protein from dairy products, 'almost certainly contribute to a significant loss of bone calcium while vegetable-based diets clearly protect against bone loss,' Campbell reported. This view is consistent with evidence comparing bone fracture rates among different countries, which shows that countries having the highest calcium intakes also have the highest fracture rates. It is also consistent with other studies on nutritionally rich 'Western' diets and 'Western' diseases showing that low-calcium, vegetarian diets are associated with increased bone density; that casein, milk's principal protein, is a well-established contributor to high blood cholesterol in the Western world; and that casein significantly enhances the development of tumor growth in experimental animals\" (http://www.news.cornell.edu...). Not only is the calcium component of dairy undermined by its casein component, which causes a loss of calcium from the bones, especially over long term consumption, but the risk factors associated with dairy, such as high blood cholesterol, far outweigh the benefits (https://www.drmcdougall.com...). There are plenty of safe, healthy sources of calcium in the plant kingdom: broccoli, kale, spinach, bok choy, soybeans, okra, watercress, and the list goes on. Dairy is High in Vitamin D Since I have already pointed out a few risk factors with dairy consumption, it should be obvious that one vitamin component does not outweigh the health risks associated with dairy. Almond and soy milk tend to be fortified with both calcium and vitamin D; they're a great alternative to dairy. Certain mushrooms such as portabella and maitake have more than five times as much vitamin D than a cup of cow's milk. Juices and cereals also tend to be fortified with vitamin D. It should be pointed out that vitamin D is produced naturally in the skin when exposed to sunlight and is a much more efficient source as 15-30 minutes of exposure to the arms and legs can give you more than six times as much vitamin D than an 8oz glass of milk (http://www.sunshinevitamin.org...). You would have to drink six glasses of milk, or 48 ounces, to get the daily recommended amount of vitamin D as proper sun exposure would give you (approx. 600IU)! And consider that 4,000IU is considered a safe upper-limit for adults (http://ods.od.nih.gov...). Milk is definitely not a healthy source of calcium and vitamin D. Here is a letter by Dr. Robert M. Kradjian warning people about the health risks associated with dairy that the prospective reader may be interested in (http://www.notmilk.com...).",

            "conclusion": "New York's Restriction on Sugary Drinks",
            "premise": "Thank you for posting so punctually and lucidly. I will begin with my rebuttals, and then my counter rebuttals.Refutations1. Legal Basis for the LawMy opponent mentions Motorcycle Helmet Laws, Drug Laws, Seat Belt laws. First of all, as to motorcycle helmet laws and seat belt laws, there is a much stronger clink between no motorcycle helmets or no seatbelts and death. Drinking soda leads to nothing, unless you drink too much of it. Then, sometimes, it leads to obesity, sometimes that leads to diabetes, and sometimes that leads to death. With motor cycles, if you don't wear a helmet you will die in an accident[1]. Also, it is much easier to wear a seatbelt, and there are no side effects of the seatbelt restriction. Wearing seatbelts doesn't affect small businesses... As to drug laws, drugs harm people other than the user. People go insane and kill people on drugs, people have underground illegal businesses with drugs. There is no such thing as \"soda driving\" (aka driving) or \"soda induced killing spree\". To quote the philosopher John Stuart Mill, \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right....\" I am personally against seat belt laws and motorcycle helmet laws because the safety of a human is up to the human, not the opinion of someone higher than them. That is not what we are debating, though. We are debating sugary drinks.2. Protecting the larger population (health care costs).a. I have two refutations for this point. First off, if we tax sugary drinks we can pay for health care. Considering the hundreds of billions of soda cans sold each year, we could tax each one a little bit for health care costs. Also, my opponent is apparently assuming that all $147 billion of health care is caused by soda. I would like to see some figures on how much of that obesity is caused by soda.b. There is no evidence that this bill will stop people from drinking soda. This ban wasn't even passed, so my opponent can't cite any evidence. It was struck down by New York certified Judge Milton Tingling a couple of weeks ago, being called \"arbitrary\" and \"capricious\" becuase of how it will harm small businesses. People who really want sodas can still buy two ten oz. sodas, get a refill, or just go to a 7-11 or grocery store. That's right, this ban allows you to get sodas over 16 oz. at 7-11s still, even though 7-11s are famous for selling big gulps! This ban only affects \"Food Service Establishments (FSE)\", so it will clearly affect small businesses badly.Counter Refutations1. Small BusinessesMy opponent refutes my opponent by talking about health care costs, however I have a plan that will tax sugary drinks to pay for obesity.2. Freedom of ChoiceI have already refuted this in my points. Remember the John Stuart Mill quote. The only way soda drinking harms other people is by health care costs and I have already refuted this with my plan, and if it doesn't harm other people then you should be allowed to do it!2b. Mayor BloombergIf you read the notice that Judge Milton Tingling, he says one of the reasons he struck it down was because the way it was passed was unconstitutional. The judge says that passing a law like this over the Board of Health is completely unconstitutional.3. Warning Labels.My opponent refutes this point only by discussing how other education methods are better than warning labels, but this is exactly my point. We need to educate, not just by warning labels, but by increasing educational awareness. This will stop obesity, not an arbitrary ban like this one.Vote con.Sources[1] http://www.foxnews.com...",

            "premise": "Hello. First I would like to thank Fun-And-Easy for accepting this debate. Now I would like to make rejoinders. They said to my first point that the government will help them think of healthy methods of eating. The problem is that schools are already trying to do that. Does it stop kids and adults from not drinking sugary drinks? Obviously not. They said to my second point that health problems can happen anywhere, not just sugary drinks. According to (http://www.livestrong.com......) in the article Health Problems and Soft Drinks, it states that soft drinks cause tooth decay, obesity, and other health problems. They said to my third point that it is not impacted, so I will impact it now. My third point is trying to say that there are other healthy alternatives that are available, and not as expensive, such as water. Water is very healthy for you, and it does not make you become obese. They said to my fourth point that it's the people's choice. It is their choice, we are just limiting the amount that they drinks. We are not saying that they can never drink soft drinks anymore, we are just changing it so that the amount that you drink is a healthy amount for your body. Since it is the government's duty to protect its citizens, we should adopt New York City's restriction on the sale of sugary drinks. Now I would like to continue on to making refutations. First their plan. They said that adding a tax would decrease the amount of obesity, but it's not like people that usually drink sugary drinks are going to stop drinking their normal amount because they have to pay 1 cent per ounce. - Their first point is that Banning Sugary Drinks Violates The People's Freedom. If we follow along to what they are saying, taxing sugary drinks is also taking away people's Pursuit of Happiness, because they don't want to pay a tax on their sugary drinks. - Their second point is that Adopting The Ban On Sugary Drinks Hurts The Economy. They said that helping the economy is more important then obesity matters. Unfortunately, if all people become obese, half of them would probably die, and half would be to obese to do any work, so the economy would fail anyways. And since lives are the most important things in this debate, I strongly urge a proposition ballet. Thank you.",

This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. Numbers 6:3 he must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or from other fermented drink. He must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins. Deuteronomy 29:6 You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the Lord your God.

            "premise": "I have a feeling I'm going to lose this debate simply because of many of the voters' lifestyle choices, but let's go anyway. I'd like to ask the voters to consider keeping an open mind about vegetarianism and to judge the round on who is a better debater, not on who supports your opinions. Know that I'm not here to condemn you unless you condemn me first. :) For the purposes of this debate, \"vegetarianism\" will be defined as a person whose diet completely excludes meat (including fish), gelatin, and eggs. Otherwise known as a lacto-vegetarian. Pro burden: Prove that vegetarianism is, on balance, healthier than an omnivorous diet. Con burden: Prove that an omnivorous diet is healthier than a vegetarian diet. Now that those very-obvious burdens are out of the way... We're not looking towards the health of the environment or towards the health of animals, but only to the health of human beings. I myself firmly believe that a vegetarian diet, while it may have its drawbacks, ultimately has more advantages than an omnivorous diet. However, many people have voice the complete opposite, and so we find ourselves debating today. According to the BBC, \"Vegetarians 'avoid more cancers.'\" Vegetarians got significantly fewer cases of stomach, bladder, and other common cancers. For example, vegetarians are only a third as likely to contract stomach cancer than a meat-eater is. N-Nitroso compounds in meat can damage cells' DNA and cooked meat often contains carcinogens, so obviously eating meat puts you at a higher risk of cancer (not to mention the saturated fats and hardly digestible proteins found in meat, asking to clog your arteries). Granted, vegetarian females are more likely to get cancer of the ovaries, but this is the *only* cancer that has a high occurrence in vegetarians. Thus, overall, vegetarianism guards against all cancers (except ovary and colon cancer. There was no noticeable difference in the amount of colon cancer cases.) (((Source 1))) A common belief about vegetarianism is that it lacks important nutrients like protein and calcium. However, this is simply not true. The amount of protein that a person needs can easily be obtained from bread, cereal, rice, pasta, tofu, beans, nuts, or any other grain or soy based food. As for calcium, vegetarians (unlike vegans) have the opportunity to drink milk, a major source of the stuff. Leafy greens also provide calcium for the body. So, not only does a vegetarian diet provide the nutrients needed, but it encourages the individual to use healthier sources (instead of that unhealthy meat discussed earlier). (((Source 2))) I have more arguments, but I'd rather not make my first speech too long-winded. I'll leave it up to my opponent to refute my points and post their own -- may the best debater win. :) 1) http://news.bbc.co.uk... 2) http://www.eatright.org...",

Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be \"mastered\" by anything \"All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be dominated by anything.\" (1 Corinthians 6:12) They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. (2 Peter 2:19). Drinking alcohol in excess is undeniably addictive. Scripture also forbids a Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or encourage them to sin against their conscience. \"But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol\"s temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble. (1 Corinthians 8:9-13). In light of these principles, it would be extremely difficult for any Christian to say he is drinking alcohol in excess to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31). Again, Scripture does not forbid Christians from drinking beer, wine, or any other drink containing alcohol. Alcohol is not, in and of itself, tainted by sin. It is drunkenness and addiction to alcohol that a Christian must absolutely refrain from. Alcohol, consumed in small quantities, is neither harmful nor addictive. In fact, some doctors advocate drinking small amounts of red wine for its health benefits, especially for the heart. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom. Drunkenness and addiction are sin. However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing offense and/or stumbling of others, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol. This does NOT, however, mean that the bible does not allow it.",

It can be dangerous with an all plant diet.https://breakingmuscle.com...http://time.com...EthicalIf it weren't for humans, cattle and all other domestic breed of animals would die. Being \"forced to breed\" is not a problem. In fact being bred and having the infant being taken away does no harm to the mother. Most domesticated animals are used to this type of environment and therefore causes no significant issue. This is all they know and therefore will not harm the animal. Many animal rights activists will tell an ugly story about abused animals being forceably bred and stripped of their offspring as if it harms them in some form. This is a lie.Milking cows does not harm the animal, it is something that needs to be done in order to release stress on the udder. If it were not done, the cows would eventually die. Milking machines do not significantly harm the animal, but I will agree that they are not the best way to milk a cow. They have been known to cause cuts and sores on the udder. However, it is not a cruel practice to milk a cow and thinking so is foolish and propaganda driven. Pro would like us to believe that by posting a few conspiracy driven, one-sided links that claim farm animals are mistreated, we should take this as fact that eating a vegan diet is greater than a diet that involves meat. So if we all just stopped eating meat, we would have a bunch of domesticated animals that would end up dying out. You cannot murder an animal. Murder is a legal term. Leftists would have us believe that you can murder an animal, yet an abortion is not a murder because it is legal to do it. Hypocricy.If us eating meat causes animals to be abused, as pro would like us to believe, then eating a strickly plant diet would cause plants to be abused as well. Chemicals and pesticides are continuously sprayed and pumped into plants and we consume these plants. We are consuming poison. How is this any different than consuming poison from animals?https://authoritynutrition.com...http://www.rd.com...Final ThoughtA mixed diet of plants and meat is the most healthy of any diet. It is unhealthy to eat all plant as it is also unhealthy to eat all meat. Veganism is not a healthy diet. The human body needs protein and plenty of it; something you won't get enough of from plants.Pro wants us to believe that all animals that are bred for consuming by humans are all abused and mistreated. This is just not true. There are plenty of farms that raise their cattle and other livestock as free range. This is the healthiest way to raise animals for human consumption. The meat is fresher, leaner and overall more beneficial for humans.",

It is drunkenness and addiction to alcohol that a Christian must absolutely refrain from. Alcohol, consumed in small quantities, is neither harmful nor addictive. In fact, some doctors advocate drinking small amounts of red wine for its health benefits, especially for the heart. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol is a matter of Christian freedom. Drunkenness and addiction are sin. However, due to the biblical concerns regarding alcohol and its effects, due to the easy temptation to consume alcohol in excess, and due to the possibility of causing offense and/or stumbling of others, it is often best for a Christian to abstain from drinking alcohol. This does NOT, however, mean that the bible does not allow it.",

            "premise": "\"This is true, however, it's just not easy, and I think we can both agree on that.\" Con Veganism is mostly difficult because there are insufficient vegan choices at restaurants and not that many vegans worldwide. The more vegans, the easier it would be to be vegan. \"Worldwide veganism would bring just as many cons as it would pros.\" Con Con has not proved this point. Pro has shown how worldwide veganism would help. \"But let's take a look at the cons: A radical change: Going vegan is a huge change\" Con The status quo is not self justifying. \"and can sometimes be even more complicated if you are not allowed to eat certain ingredients such as soy.\" Con In a previous round the discussion of relying too heavily upon soy was discussed. Over consumption of soy is different than the complete elimination of soy. Relying too heavily upon any ingredient will most likely lead to food allergies. The exception being water. Pro does not think you can get a food allergy from drinking too much water. Soy in moderation is healthier than meat in moderation. Soy has phytonutrients and fiber which meat doesn't have. \"\"Complete plant proteins are found in soy products, so if you're trying to moderate your intake of soy, you have to learn how to put together complementary foods to form complete vegetarian proteins,\" says Jackie Keller.\" Con Pro calls the entire complete vegetarian protein a large misunderstanding. Just eat a variety of vegan foods and enough protein and you will be fine. Your body can synthesize ten out of twenty of the amino acids. \"Myths abounded about the necessities of combining certain foods in order to obtain complete protein. In reality, protein deficiencies are uncommon in vegetarians who eat eggs and dairy products, according to the Harvard Women's Health Watch. Vegans, who eat no animal-based foods, can get enough protein by eating nuts, grains and seeds, which offer incomplete proteins that nevertheless meet your body\"s needs when consumed responsibly.\" [30] In summary, don't worry about complete proteins. \"Potential interference with existing medical conditions: If you have a condition such as osteoporosis or diabetes, it is critical to consult with your physician and a registered dietitian when starting and implementing a vegan eating plan, as a vegan diet may interfere with your condition.\" Con There is some question of whether or not the body can use calcium from milk. \"The galactose in milk may explain why milk consumption is associated with significantly higher risk of hip fractures, cancer, and premature death.\" [31]. Calcium can be found in leafy greens like collars and kale . Kale contains 9% calcium and only 33 calories per cup [32]. Soy milk also has a large amount of calcium. [33] As for diabetes. Meat and dairy consumption can cause diabetes and insulin resistance. Fiber and phytonutrients help with blood sugar spikes. \"Red-meat consumption is already linked to higher levels of colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke). Now researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) have added an increased risk of type 2 (adult onset) diabetes to that list. \" [34]. \"Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardiovascular health.\" [35]. Links 34 and 35 prove meat and dairy increase the risk of diabetes. Link 31 proves drinking milk increases chances for hip fractures. \"Difficulty when dining out: Not many restaurants offer true vegan choices and this can make dining out difficult. Mehta advises carrying vegan foods and snacks to make eating out easier when traveling long distances.\" Con True, this is why its imperative to ban meat, eggs, and dairy. Then, many more vegan choices would be offered in restaurants. \"Loss of essential vitamins and minerals: There is evidence to show vegan diets do not contain vitamin B12, an essential nutrient.\" Con Some vegan diets are healthier than others. There are supplements. B12 comes from bacteria. Bacteria can be found on raw fruits and vegetables. \"There has to be a balance of diet, exercise and a proper fitness regime.\" Con There is wisdom in these words. If you are sedentary, not matter what diet you are on you will not have ideal health. \"So, what is my point, you may ask? Well, I am certain a chicken would put another chicken's life before a human's. While you are thinking about the animals, we have to think about the humans as well...\" Con Pro has proven through scholarly peer reviewed journals that a vegan diet is healthier. Even if animals weren't sentient, a vegan diet would still be healthier, the environment would benefit, and land designated to feeding livestock could now feed hungry humans. Pro has once again refuted Con's claims. Save animals, humans' health, the environment, and feed the hungry by eating vegan. Meat, dairy, and eggs should be banned worldwide. Vote Pro.

            "conclusion": "The access to drinking water ought to be valued as a human right instead of as a commodity.",
            "premise": "*Sources should be cited inside the arguments, no notes to view sources. A glass is placed on a table containing one part water and one part air. A well-known proverb states that an optimist would say that the glass is half full, while a pessimist would say it is half empty. However, a realist would say that there is only so little water to be discussed because according to the Great Lakes Invitational Conference Association (GLICA), 1.1 billion people in the world have no access to any type of improved drinking source of water. It is because I agree with the realist in this situation that I must affirm today's resolution: Access to drinking water ought to be valued as a human right instead of as a commodity. The Value I will be upholding in today's debate is justice which is the quality of being fair and reasonable. Justice balances the rights of every individual. Justice should be valued above all other possible values because when debating human rights, we need to be both fair and reasonable. My value of justice is supported by the criteria of allowing equality of opportunity. In order to be just, we must be afforded the chance to accomplish the same exact things. By allowing every human to have the same opportunity to the most basic necessity to life, we allow a better chance to obtain true justice. Essentially, by allowing situations which would help equalize the opportunity in life of all people, we can allow for justice to take place. Contention 1 - not being given access to drinking water as a human right impedes an individual's ability to receive an education; thus, limiting the equality of opportunity which is not just. 1.We should not base the opportunity that those have to education solely off of how much water they are able to purchase. According to an article by the Water Project, lack of clean water has serious effects on student's academic performance and attendance rates. The lack of safe water can cause even the best students to lose momentum as they deal with stomach pains and diarrhea from disease and hunger. We know that access to clean, safe water changes lives. For example, after a well was installed for a village in Kenya, \"girls returned to school, women began small businesses, men were no longer too sick to work. Health returned and children grew up to be productive members of their community. Access to clean, safe water isn't an end, it's a means. If we provide water to those who cannot afford it, we allow the opportunity to education. From education, the children are able to work and provide for their families, and ultimately, survive. 2.If children and adults alike in impoverished countries have to spend 8 hours a day just to collect water, they are not able to receive an education, and therefore will not have the same opportunities as those who can access drinking water. Students miss class to go fetch water, or to care for sick parents or siblings. In many places HIV/AIDS has already caused a large percentage of children to become orphans, requiring students to drop out and find work to provide food and care for younger siblings. If teachers are sick, classes get cancelled for all students. Schools cannot run programs if they cannot provide water to students, faculty and their families. If schools in these countries cannot afford to buy water, just as the citizens cannot, they cannot provide the education sufficient to provide equality of opportunity. This is clearly not just, because those that have access to drinking water have a far better chance at education and are therefore awarded with more opportunities. Contention 2 - a lack of drinking water has a server impact on personal finances, limiting equality of opportunity and ultimately justice. 1.According to a document dated July 14, 2011 by Irene !hoa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, when weighing access to drinking water as a human right or a commodity, \"it is suggested that the inclusion of livestock be investigated\" as well. In areas such as Namibia, where livestock play a monstrous role in the income of much of the population, we must realize that if these people are unable to pay for water, their livestock can suffer dehydration, leading to death. When the livestock die, so do the chances the Namibians have to make the income they need. Since the dawn of time humans have used livestock to make a living. Making a living in the world is something that everyone must be able to do in order to survive. If water was valued as a human right, it would be provided to these people, who need it the most, and allow them the equality of opportunity to personal finances. 2.If the access to drinking water was valued as a commodity, we see a snowball effect where the lack of potable water leads to the lack of income. Because the people in Namibia cannot afford water, they cannot keep their livestock alive, and lack the ability to provide for themselves, and their family. If these people cannot provide for themselves and their families, it is evident that they will only contribute to the statistics of those 1.1 billion people that will die if access to drinking water is not valued as a human right. However, if water was truly valued as a human right, these people would be able to earn the income that would allow them to live, and give them the equal opportunities in matters of personal finance. Contention 3 - access to drinking water as a human right gives an individual the best equality of opportunity for health. 1.Water is essential to life. If anyone is unable to obtain potable water, or cannot afford to buy it, ultimately, they die. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), \"water makes up between 50% and 70% of an adults total body weight. Regular top-ups are required to balance the loss of water through urine and sweat.\" If we are unable to balance this loss of water, we suffer from dehydration. The British Dietetic Association advises that we should consume 2.5 liters a day to remain healthy. In countries where potable water is hard to come by, as is money, the population is that much more likely to die of dehydration. If water is not provided to people in these very situations, it will end up in dehydration genocide. Not only will this genocide be worse than the one conducted by Adolf Hitler, but it is easier to solve for. By valuing the access to drinking water as a human right, we are able to sustain life, giving the equal opportunity to health. 2.If the access to drinking water is valued as a commodity, all of those who cannot afford it will resort to unclean and unsafe water. When they do this they are willingly letting bacteria into their body. According to an article written by Ashley Seager in The Guardian, dirty water kills 5,000 children a day (that's 1,826,250 people a year!) across the planet. When one cannot pay for water in a region of the world where the access to drinking water is a commodity, they will search out even the smallest source of free water, no matter how dirty and contaminated it is. These 5,000 children a day are dying because in the act of collecting water, they take a few sips, desperate to grasp onto life. Naturally, the dirty water contains bacteria, and the children die of a multitude of diseases. However, the children don't die immediately; they die after they get the water back home, after the rest of their family has had some. Dying slowly by the multitude of diseases in the water is just as cruel, if not more, of a death as dehydration. If these people cannot afford water, they most certainly would not be able to afford medicine to make themselves healthy again. We can see that by valuing the access to drinking water as a human right, we achieve justice in that all humans will be able to get the potable water they need to survive. If we force them to buy water, that they cannot afford, we write the death sentences to entire countries. I now turn it over to con, and look forward to an educational debate.",

            "conclusion": "Sugary Drink Tax",
            "premise": "I see I can't make rebuttals until Round 3. Then here are my arguments: Reduction of ObesityAccording to the Obesity Action Coalition, in ages 2+, people get 52% of their added sugars through sugary drinks. So it stands to reason that a reduction in the consumption of these beverages will reduce obesity. And again according to the Obesity Action Coalition, a 10% increase in the price of a sugary drink will reduce its consumption by 10-12%. So a SDT will reduce obesity [1].More evidence comes from a study done by the University of Harvard, where they show a 1% tax on each ounce of a sugary beverage reduces consumption of said beverage by 20% [2]. So it stands to reason that these taxes will reduce consumption of sugary drinks, thus reducing obesity.And why is obesity so bad? Well, according to the CDC, obesity costs the nation nearly 150 billion in health care costs yearly. It also costs us nearly 6 billion in lost productivity each year [3]. My conclusion? SDTs will reduce obesity, which will then have a positive impact on the economy, as productivity increases and Americans have more spending money, further boosting the economy.Increased RevenuePhiladelphia needed cash. Why? They wanted to pay for universal preschool in the city. So they passed a small, 1.5 cent tax on each ounce of a sugary drink. And the revenue generated from this tax was massive. Philly is set to make 90 million dollars from the tax. Yes, 90 million. I did some basic math, and found that each person generated 57 dollars in taxes from this tax. If we were to apply this bill nationwide, the revenue would be over 20 billion dollars. Think of all the amazing things the government could fund with this tax. I just read this recently: Oklahoma, in facing a gigantic deficit due to the state's foolish management of funds and tax policy, has had to cut the school funding, meaning the kids only go to school for 4 days in a week. This tax would stop that. [4]Also, in Berkeley, California, a city you mentioned, implemented a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugary beverages. The tax was an enormous success, with consumption of sugary beverages plummeting. Even better, grocery stores, corner stores, and the like didn't lose revenue from the tax. Why? Consumers just switched to buying healthier beverages like milk, water, and natural fruit drinks. [5]So that's my argument. I know it is short, but I only really had two points.

            "premise": "== My case == My opponent and I seem to agree that there needs to be *some* drinking age, we just disagree about where to draw the line. I argue that the line should be drawn at 18 because that\"s when kids go to college, and a drinking age of 18 grants colleges more discretion to ensure that students are drinking in supervised and safe environments. In contrast, my opponent chooses the completely arbitrary age of 21. My opponent talks about drugs, but that\"s irrelevant to the debate. This isn\"t a debate about drug legalization. There\"s no \"responsible\" way to use heroin and no \"irresponsible\" way to use marijuana, so the analogy doesn\"t even apply. Learning moderation is unique to the alcohol context. My opponent loses by essentially conceding my Seaman evidence, which proves that college students *can* learn responsible drinking behavior in the right environment if the drinking age is lowered. McGill is in Canada, where the drinking age is 18; my opponent seems confused and thinks it\"s in the US. Furthermore, he says people can drink with parents at 18, but that\"s not a true legal drinking age of 21. He\"s basically conceding that people *do* need to learn responsible drinking behavior from older people, but disagrees that peers, RA\"s, and professors are a good group to learn from. The fact is that college students don\"t respect their parents\" views on alcohol: they think their parents are lame. They are only going to learn responsible behavior from peers and people they respect, in a \"normal\" drinking environment (not in their homes, under parental supervision). My opponent also concedes my Stanford example, but then says that parents can teach children. However, the Stanford structure wouldn\"t work under that framework. Parents do not live with their children in their dormitories, which is where they are going to consume alcohol. Only a structure that legalizes Stanford\"s only semi-legal regime would help to impart more responsible drinking behavior upon college students. I don\"t advocate merely lowering the drinking age, but also putting in place systems like those at Stanford and McGill that impart responsible drinking behavior. One hundred thirty college presidents agree with me because they want to adopt similar systems. Lastly, my opponent cold concedes the rape argument. He merely says that rape is caused by other factors, but I provided a *link* between a higher drinking age and rape: women have to pre-drink (which causes them to black out) and can only \"party\" at fraternities, which are high-risk for rape. My opponent provides no other plausible explanation for why rapes on college campuses in Canada are nearly two-thirds lower. Americans and Canadians are not so different that it can be explained by culture. Reducing rapes by two-thirds is the biggest impact in this debate and is why you should vote Pro. == Rebuttal == R1) Health My opponent concedes that three-fourths of underage students drink now. He also concedes that almost one-fifth of all alcohol drinks consumed in the US is by underage people. The question is *not* whether they will drink, but *how* they will drink. Right now, 90% of them binge drink. My intervention can only hope to ameliorate this. My opponent also concedes that only *heavy* drinking causes negative health effects. Light to moderate alcohol consumption actually has positive health effects, such as better memory in later life. [1] So the question is not whether young people will drink, but whether they will do it in a way that hurts their health, or doesn\"t. Only interventions that teach more responsible drinking can solve this problem, so this point goes to Pro. R2) Violence in bars By conceding my meta-study that lowering the drinking age does not increase violence or criminality among youth, my opponent loses this point. I also turn this point with my study showing that pre-gaming culture leads to more violence, so any intervention that reduces pre-gaming culture reduces violence. R3) Responsibility The US no longer *needs* 18-year-old soldiers. This isn\"t WWII anymore. But at age 18, we still allow people to die for their country, get married, and take on crushing debt that could take a lifetime to pay off. [2] If we trust 18-year-olds enough as adults to do *these* things, then we should also trust them to drink alcohol. We shouldn\"t infantilize them and pretend they are adults in some respects, but not in others. The age of 21 is arbitrary. There is no policy reason to choose this age over any other. On fairness grounds, you should vote Pro on this point alone. If you are old enough to die for your country, you are old enough to drink a beer. Arguments in favor of reducing teenage pregnancy would not justify raising the age of consent to 21. The current drinking age implicates basic principles of autonomy. R4) Traffic fatalities My opponent drops my studies proving that drunk driving fatalities were *already* falling prior to the adoption of the drinking age and that *other countries* saw similar drops, despite not changing their drinking age laws. So he can\"t hope to win this point. His evidence from Japan and Morocco is inconclusive. The Morocco statistic was for *all* vehicle fatalities, not just drunk driving fatalities. The Japan statistic was that only 10% of traffic fatalities in Japan were due to drunk driving. But that could simply mean that for some reason, Japan has a lot more *non*-alcohol-related road fatalities (compared to other countries). The number of drunk driving fatalities per thousand residents is a better statistic for cross-country comparison, but Pro doesn\"t provide this number. As further proof, 32% of all traffic fatalities in the US are caused by drunk driving. [2] Thus, even though our drinking age is one year *higher* than in Japan, we have a much larger percentage of drunk driving fatalities (compared to total vehicle fatalities) than Japan does. Either the *percentage* of fatalities due to drunk driving is a meaningless number, or the US-Japan comparison proves that a *lower* drinking age in Japan caused fewer alcohol-related fatalities. Furthermore, my opponent never answers my objection that there is no evidence that there are more drunk driving fatalities (per thousand residents) in Canada and Europe, which have much lower drinking ages. R5) Healthier This argument is no different than \"medically dangerous.\" Look to R1 for my response. R6) Trickle down There is reason to believe that alcohol won\"t trickle down to lower-age high school students: they lack the \"connections\" to older students to convince them to buy them alcohol. Con dismisses my argument as merely anecdotal, but it\"s not only based on my personal experience, but observing everyone at my high school: freshmen were not friends with seniors. Con doesn\"t even attempt to claim that his own high school experience is any different, so mine is the only proof offered in this debate. Furthermore, he *drops* my argument that high school students (unlike college students) have nowhere to drink. There\"s a reason that most high school drinking takes place at prom: it\"s the only night where kids are away from their parents. And while fake ID\"s are illegal, so is furnishing alcohol to a minor. If my opponent is suggesting that illegality is an effective deterrent, then 18-year-olds will be deterred from furnishing alcohol to minors (which is a rather serious offense, more serious currently than giving alcohol to someone *over* 18). R7) Drugs Con claims that his study didn\"t include marijuana, but it did. The comparison to Japan is rather ridiculous. Marijuana is just not a popular drug there, considering only 1.2% have tried it *ever* in their lives. In the US, 32.8% of high school seniors have tried marijuana. [3] These cross-country comparisons simply don\"t work. Con concedes my \"respect for the law\" argument, which is a turn: people try drugs at young ages because alcohol is illegal, and they try that and wonder what other illegal things might not be as bad as society claims. Lowering the drinking age would therefore decrease drug use. He also drops that his correlation is merely due to a risk-taking personality, that marijuana constitutes most of the drug use in the study and marijuana is less bad than alcohol, and that there is no evidence that drug use is more rampant among youth in Canada or Europe where the drinking age is lower. Thus, none of Con\"s points survive scrutiny, whereas I prove that lowering the drinking age will promote more responsible drinking behavior and *significantly* reduce rape. This outweighs any of Pro\"s speculative impacts, which do not bear up when looking to Canada or Europe. Vote Pro. [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com...",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his response. I must correct my opponent first of all, in that I did read his response. It was not specified in the first round as to how an average person is defined. In fact, the parameters he sets up are so strange that it becomes impossible to adapt them in any manner of coherency. I will illustrate the importance of this later. I will start my response by saying that my opponent's failure is not in his presentation of data (which I believe to be faulty anyhow), but in his very resolution. My opponent was simply wrong when he said that I am excluded from the realm of \"average healthy person\". In fact, I believe there are huge, blatant errors in his classification of an \"average\" person to begin with. What my opponent lists as exceptions in proper detail are the following: 1. Pregnant women 2. Diabetics 3. People on prescription medication 4. People who drive or operate heavy machinery. The percentage of pregnant women in the population is not negligible, but still a small percentage. However, my opponent's key argument about the \"Average\" person seems to conflict heavily with his resolution statement. A. My opponent's restriction on people who drive. http://wiki.answers.com... The number of people who drive in America is roughly 30 million, an extraordinarily conservative calculation based on the following facts derived from my source: 1. There are roughly 60 million registered cars 2. There are roughly 2 cars to each person This does not include cars which are functional and unregistered, or people who share cars/rent cars. As such, the most conservative would be 30 million out of 300 million or roughly 10% of the population. If my opponent is excluding drivers from his definition of an \"Average\" person, what will he restrict next? People who eat hamburgers? People who watch baseball? B. Another exception that my opponent lists are diabetics. There are currently 24 million diabetics in this country and not a single one of them is \"average\" according to my opponent. Diabetes is one of the most prevalent medical conditions today, affecting over 8% of all Americans. While this number may seem insignificant, please consider how many people in a room of 100 will suffer dire consequences from what my opponent proposes. C. And finally, a whopping 44% of Americans are taking at least one prescription medication, and 17% are taking at least three at once. http://www.medscape.com... A key factoid for any Pharmacy student or medical student in general is the knowledge that alcohol interacts negatively with most if not all prescription medication. The physiology is complicated to explain, but generally speaking, both alcohol and prescription medications are processed by the liver, and simultaneous processing can lead to disastrous results. Alcohol in moderate amounts may have a slightly positive effect on blood pressure if taken over time and regularly, but when combined with blood pressure medications they can have terrible side effects, amplifying the effects of blood pressure medications. Since most blood pressure medications work throughout the day, and since alcohol has a much shorter cycle, it can have unpredictable effects on people taking those medications. Cholesterol lowering drugs, statins, interact violently with alcohol, with many being completely contraindicated since it could lead to liver toxicity and death. http://askville.amazon.com... Both Cholesterol and Blood pressure medications make up the vast majority of prescription drugs in America. It is absurd not to categorize them as \"average\". How then, can my opponent continue to speak about beer being healthy for the average person, when he clearly has no idea what the average person is, and when he is heavily restricting massive amounts of people who for all intents and purposes make up the statistically average US citizen? In addition to those issues, my opponent also has poor justification for classifying me outside the realm of \"average\". It would be acceptable for him to say that my allergy to alcohol is rare, but it should not discount me from his population. It would be more extraordinary for a person to not have any allergies at all than to react badly to alcohol. There should be no question that I am both an average person and healthy, because I am. It just so happens that I have a sensitivity to alcohol. Though not exactly an allergy, my hypersensitivity to alcohol stems from the \"Asian Curse\", a lack of the enzyme Alcohol dehydrogenase that breaks ethanol down into acetic acid. The lack of this enzyme causes the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde to build up in larger concentrations for people like myself, leading to terrible side effects and exaggerated effects of alcohol consumption in shorter lengths of time. http://en.wikipedia.org... Half of the Asian population is categorized as having this sensitivity, thus, amongst my fellow Asians, I am average. Let us also not forget that China itself has 1/6 of the world's population, and I am not counting Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, etc. Simply put, my opponent's assertion that this particular sensitivity means I am not average, is unjustified and a bit absurd. In fact, his entire argument around designating an \"average\" person is absurd. Not only is he restricting a massive number of \"average\" Americans (Americans who would be greatly harmed by beer as opposed to milk) from his resolution, but he also inexplicably wishes the audience to believe that the presence of an ethic trait is enough to categorize a person as abnormal. Even setting this aside, my opponent (despite what he as said previously) made no mention in this debate as to what he meant by \"you\". When people say \"hey you!\" in a conversation between the two of us, I assume he is referring to me. Thus, since this word \"you\" is used both in the resolution and my opponent's extended resolution, why would I believe otherwise? I did not understand my opponent's overly complicated explanation as to what is \"average\" or not, but I consider myself a healthy and average person. What law states that the average person must react well to alcohol? As such, I must restate my argument: My opponent is addressing me in both resolutions. I would have much more health detriment from drinking beer than from drinking milk. Thus, the resolution is negated. I look forward to my opponent's response. Thank you.",

            "premise": "Burden of ProofDo I have the burden of proof? It seems like it should be shared? If the state is going to deprive young adults of their liberty they should present good reasons. Does the instigator, or the person who wants to change the status-quo always have the BOP? Or is it like calling \"shotgun\", the first person to mention it decides it?I don't really understand why BOP is often debated. While BOP may affect who the reader agrees with, it does not effect the quality of arguments (which is what is voted on). Claiming to not have the BOP is no excuse to make weaker arguments. 1. Not allowing 19 year olds to drink is logically inconsistent with other freedoms that are granted to young adults.It is helpful to compare the dangers of drinking to other responsibilities granted to 19 year olds. Comparing these parallel examples help determine whether drinking is a responsibility 19 year olds can handle. It is a logical argument. If A is more dangerous/at par with than B, and 19 year olds can handle A, then they can handle B. I didn't mean to overwhelm/sabotage my opponent. It probably seems overwhelming because there is no other responsibility at 21 to compare to drinking. All the other responsibilities are granted at 18. To have logically consistent beliefs, one would have to think that the age of some/all responsibilities (joining the army, owning a gun, smoking) should be changed to 21 ( therefore making 18-20 yos in the USA the oldest \"kids\" in the world), or claim that there is a reason that makes drinking more dangerous. My opponent claims that there is a reason that makes the choice to consume alcohol more dangerous than the many other comparable responsibilities mentioned in round 1. Further argumentation in this debate will show otherwise.2. The Law has been Ineffective at stopping drinkingMy opponent argues he argument can be made for murder. I proved that over 4 out of 5 underage students drink. The percentage of underagers who break this law is VERY HIGH. The percentage of people who break the murder law is VERY LOW. The latest homicide rate in the USA is 4.8 murders per 100,000 people or .000048% [1]. So, if no one committed duplicate murders, .000048% of people in the USA murdered people. So, about 82% of Americans break the underage drinking law, while .000048% break the murder law. How can you make the same argument for murder? My opponent argues that since overall drunk driving fatalities have decreased the past 10 years, the law has been effective. I assume that this was meant to object to my argument regarding drunk driving fatalities, so I will address it there.3. The law does not greatly effect drunk driving deathsThis is not a bare assertion. Drunk driving deaths have been decreasing at a constant rate since 1982 to present day. The law to change the drinking from 18 to 21 occur in 1984. If the law had a profound effect on overall drunk driving deaths, the drunk driving decrease should have accelerated around 1984,1985. However, it did not, the decrease remained constant. There is a natural rate of decrease. This is because of increased vehicle safety technology, life saving technology, alcohol awareness, that occurs with time. My opponent showed that overall drunk driving deaths decreased from 1999-2009. This is consistent with the natural decrease of drunk driving deaths. Also, since the law was past in 1984, the effects just after the law passed compared to before would present a better case. It is hard to believe that the effects of raising the drinking age are just occurring now.Some may argue that the fatalities of 19-20 year-olds would increase (This is an important statistic and may be why my opponent claimed I made a bare assertion. I thought I would let my opponent bring this argument up instead of making it myself) . This is probably true. A study shows that a drinking age of 21 leads to a 5% decrease in in 18-21 year-old drunk driving fatalities. However, this is also shows that a 21 yo drinking age results in an 8% increase in 21-23 yo old deaths [3]. Drinking experience is more important than drinking age. A higher drinking age just shifts deaths to higher ages. Dr. Mike A. Males of the University of California states\"The bottom line is that raising the drinking age to 21 did not improve a young person's odds of avoiding fatal alcohol mishap before age 25.\" [3]4. Punish the crime not the derivative of the crimeThis shows that the reason that under 21 yos cannot drink, should not solely be to prevent drunk driving. The chain of causation is too distant to ban alcohol usage for those under 21, solely to prevent drunk driving. This is especially true seeing as how drunk driving is not punished harshly. Prohibiting alcohol consumption is an overreaction to drunk driving crashes. For example, texting and driving is very dangerous. Some studies claim that it is more dangerous than drinking and driving [2]. Prohibiting those under 21 to own a cell phone with texting features is an overreaction. However, laws against texting while driving are acceptable. This shows that it is wrong to have a drinking age of 21 soley for the reason to prevent drunk driving as it is not the most appropriate action. 5. Many societal benefits for reducing the drinking ageNot just for this one incident. I was giving an example of how many lives are lost each year due to underage drinking off the roads. 1000 lives of 18-24 year olds are lost due to drinking off the roads. Also, 60% of deaths due to underage drinking are for incidents off the roads.[6] These lives are just as important to protect. The 21 drinking age may slightly decrease the amount of drinkers, however it increases the amount of heavy drinkers. As I showed in round one,compared to Canada, while less college students drink in the USA, more American students binge drink. Binge drinking is the cause of most problems ( alcohol poisoning, health damage)[5]. My opponent claims that \"There is an association between heavy drinking and physical brain damage.\" The 21 drinking age increases heavy drinking, which results in the majority of health problems.Having a drink is a good way to relax, make friends, and network( American employees cannot drink with their co-workers bosses, this is a big disadvantage especially in a business professional environment). Studies show that moderate drinkers are in general happier people[5]. If 19-20 yos are treated like adults, they will act more like adults. Police should not waste time and money enforcing this rule. There are better things they can do with this time. ConclusionThe 21 year old drinking age is a failed, absurd social experiment. The USA is the only modern democracy, and one of the only countries in the world to have a drinking age this high. many countries such as Spain, Greece and Italy teach there children to drink in moderation as early as preschool [3]. Both the Ukrain and South Korea have tried the 21 yo drinking age, concluded it did not work and abandoned it [3].I have shown that a 21 yo drinking age is logically inconsistent with other freedoms given to young adults, the law has been ineffective at stopping underage drinking, the law did not greatly affect drunk driving deaths, it is wrong to deprive responsible acting adults of their liberty to drink and their are many societal benefits of lowering the drinking age ( including decreasing the amount of binge drinking). The USA should lower the drinking age to 19. This should be an easy vote for Pro.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...[2] http://www.cnbc.com...[3] http://www2.potsdam.edu...[4] http://alcoholism.about.com...[5] http://www.masenka.be...[6] http://www.chooseresponsibility.org...",

In citing your sources they will be referenced as [Con #] Given that my arguments have been legitimated, your comment \"Since there are no proper sources we can ignore the statistics, for they were wrong anyways.\" can be disregarded. I understand that this is a bit unfair to you given that you decided to arrogantly brush off my arguments and supply your own. You will now have the chance to refute my Round 2 argument. I recommend you actually read it this time, because there is clear evidence in your rebuttal you did not. Problematic Citation and Source Material: I apologize for the mishap in my Round 2 source material; however you'll find that everything is properly cited and credible. However in your entire argument you fail to properly cite anything you said. I have no idea which comment corresponds to which source; if this were an academic setting you would be charged with plagiarism. Your source material is also very questionable and contradictory, and some are irrelevant to the debate entirely. Because you did not openly disclose which arguments come from which sources I have to spend the majority of my rebuttal debunking your sources. I ask that you re-read my Round 1 post. Source [Con 1] enforces my position quote \"The high level of meat and saturated fat consumption in the USA ... exceeds nutritional needs and contributes to high rates of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and some cancers.\" [Con 1] is describing SAD, in my position statement I clearly acknowledge that SAD is not relevant to the debate because over-consumption does not equal inherent unhealthiness. If over-consumption was a true indicator of inherent negative health affects the 8% of obese vegetarians you mention would show that over consuming vegetables causes the negative health effects associated with obesity. [Con 2] is problematic; the author is simply unqualified, her brief bio gives no indication of having a degree in anything, she is extremely biased and only provides one citation for her entire 15 point article. More importantly all of her points are contingent on the immorality of factory farming, which as I've stated in Round 2 does not divert from meat being inherently unhealthy or immoral because there are healthy and moral ways of raising cattle [2][5][6][Con 8]. The findings of [Con 3] can also be refuted, Point 4 Source [1] quote \"It is true that processed meat is associated with an increased risk of cancer, especially colon cancer ... Two review studies, one that looked at data from 35 studies and the other from 25 studies, found that the effect for unprocessed red meat was very weak for men and nonexistent for women. \" This implies it is the process, not the meat that causes cancer. [Con 4] is 42 pages long, I only read the first page and found that it, like [Con 1], was critical of SAD for its health effects. This does not prove meat is inherently bad, fish for example is low in fat and has positive health effects [3]. Also [Con 4] says Chimps eat monkeys, if sentience is such an issue then why don't chimps respect the sentience of monkeys? (I'll address this in more detail later). [Con 5] is from PETA an organization well known for its bias against eating meat. Like [Con 2] the arguments are almost entirely based on factory farming, which again is irrelevant in the face of free range farming [5][6][Con 8]. [Con 6] is PETA India, it has the same bias and credibility as [Con 2]. Point 4 for example says that meat is bad because if you under cook it then you could get bird flu. Ok, by this logic vegetables are bad because if you don't clean them you could get E. Coli. As I said in the beginning of Round 2 \"Like all food the health factor is not necessarily the food itself but how it is prepared and produced.\" [Con 7] is my personal favorite. By citing this source you show how truly desperate you are to grasp at straws. This source made me understand why you did not disclose them in your debate, as it has no scientific value whatsoever, it simply bullet points propaganda without any evidence. Let's read some of the findings of SupremeMasterTV.com. Eating meat causes \"Blue tongue disease\", what is this? Oh right it's a disease that only affects livestock and not humans [7]. The other diseases are food borne illnesses from improper cooking. In your rebuttal you state \"Studies have shown that an Ovo-Lacto Vegetarian diet is the most healthy diet of all.\" Meaning that those who drink milk and eat eggs along with vegetables have the best diet of all (this is not a vegan diet, in Round 1 you said you'd argue as a vegan). But Lo! [Con 7] says drinking milk is bad! It causes \"Breast, prostate and testicular cancer from hormones present in milk; Listeria and Crohn's disease; Hormones and saturated fat lead to osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes and heart disease; Linked to higher incidences of multiple sclerosis.\" Still think drinking milk is cool? [Con 8] is written by the same author as [Con 4] and as such contains the exact same arguments. Also I don't think you actually read this article because the author lays out a plan for rational meat eating in the section \"Toward Rational Meat Eating\" so yea ... you're helping me with this one. [Con 9] I admit this article does seem legitimate and has sources. However this argument doesn't help you in the way you might think, it focuses on factory farming and it acknowledges meat can be environmentally friendly \"Chicken is probably the best land animal to eat, certainly in terms of climate change impact. Fish have a low greenhouse gas impact but are being eaten in such large quantities that many are at risk of extinction.\" \"Even limiting one's meat consumption to chicken yields major environmental benefits--not to mention health and financial benefits.\" So eating chicken yields health benefits ... Interesting. [Con 10] was about jacana birds being influenced by human scientists to commit infanticide. I don't see how this proves anything more than humans encouraged behavior that only humans would consider immoral. If anything this goes to show killing animals is not an issue of morality. For the sake of science (as suppose to survival) humans encouraged these birds kill each others babies. Are these scientists immoral for encouraging nature? Eating Meat Can be Healthy: For the bulk of this section please read Round 2. This section is for counter arguments. Given that none of your statistics are properly cited they can be seen as fiction. You clearly dramatize the negative health effects of meat, if meat was so bad then why would doctors recommend it as part of a balanced diet [2][3][8]? Quoting Con \"Aquamarine animals can often cause toxins, for all those fish which are high in Omega 3 are also extremely high in mercury. Those which are not like Salmon may cause many other diseases, and may also create bowel issues.\" Ah yes, Harvard disagrees quote \"Environmental Protection Agency \" calculated that if 100,000 people ate farmed salmon twice a week for 70 years, the extra PCB intake could potentially cause 24 extra deaths from cancer\"but would prevent at least 7,000 deaths from heart disease. Second, levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish are very low, similar to levels in meats, dairy products, and eggs. Third, more than 90 percent of the PCBs and dioxins in the U.S. food supply come from such non-seafood sources, including meats, dairy, eggs, and vegetables.\" [3] Morality of Meat: Appeal to Nature In Round 2 I specifically acknowledge the possible flaw in this argument \"However just because an animal does something does not give us the right to copy them blindly. It is our advanced intelligence and our appeal to morality that sets us apart from the lesser animals.\" It\"s important to note humans are animals, and as such comparison to other animals is legitimate (it's kind of how biology and anthropology work). You yourself make this a moral underpinning in Round 1 \"\" it is wrong to kill [animals], as it is wrong to kill humans.\" But why? What makes them like us? You argue mammals are sentient like us, they feel emotion like we do, so they should be spared. You think that just because chimps can love each as humans can love each other this somehow negates the fact that chimps are equally enthusiastic about killing lesser yet still sentient primates like monkeys [Con 4], humans eat monkeys too ya know. Because we can feel love somehow all mammals are entitled to our good graces. Even if I agreed with your pan-mammalism philosophy fish and chicken aren't mammals what claim to familiarity do they have? When it comes to rape and infanticide there are obvious pro-human arguments against it, if your only argument against eating mammals is 'well you wouldn't eat a human!' then I'm afraid the moral connection falls flat.

            "premise": "Before I begin I didn't define milk. By milk I meant cow's milk. Milk \" a white liquid produced by a woman to feed her baby or by female animals to feed their young; especially : milk from cows or goats that is used as food by people : a white liquid produced by a plant\" [1] Merriam-webster Outline I. Prove animal sentience and ability to suffer. II. Prove suffering from milk production. III. Establish purchasing of milk causes suffering. IV. Milk in not needed for human survival. V. Prove animal cruelty VI. Prove endorsement VII. Rebuttal of Con's argument VIII. Links I. Prove animal sentience and ability to suffer. Suffer \" : to experience pain, illness, or injury : to experience something unpleasant (such as defeat, loss, or damage) : to become worse because of being badly affected by something \" merriam-webster.com [2] \"After 2,500 Studies, It's Time to Declare Animal Sentience Proven (Op-Ed)\" Marc Bekoff livescience.com [3] \"With a focus on vertebrates, this section presents a brief discussion of what constitutes good evidence of the capacity to experience pain. The discussion emphasizes the strength of the evidence that all mammals (including rodents) are able to experience pain; raises the possibility that fish may feel pain\" National Research Council (US) Committee on Recognition and Alleviation of Pain in Laboratory Animals. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2009. [4] As a cow is a mammal, mammals can feel pain, therefore cow can feel pain and thus the ability to suffer. II. Prove suffering from milk production. \"All forms of dairy farming involve forcibly impregnating cows. This involves a person inserting his arm far into the cow\"s rectum in order to position the uterus, and then forcing an instrument into her vagina. The restraining apparatus used is commonly called a \"rape rack.\"\" Humanemyth.org [5] \"Most cows used for dairy production are kept indoors, with some having access to outdoor concrete or dirt paddocks. They are often forced to stand on hard surfaces\"something their hooves are not designed for. This contributes to lameness, a condition where cows\" feet become inflamed, making it painful to walk. Additionally, cows in the dairy industry are forced to suffer through: Widespread Infections: Unnaturally high milk production leads to mastitis, a painful bacterial infection causing a cow\"s udder to swell. In 2007, 79% of farms that reported permanently removing cows from their herds did so because of mastitis.\" ASPCA.org [6] III. Establish purchasing of milk causes suffering. Some are of the train of thought \"the milk is already produced, so no harm is being done by purchasing the milk.\" Yet, purchasing the milk at the supermarket will eventually lead to suffering. The simplest explanation is if nobody bought any milk, demand would rapidly fall. Supply would follow suit. Less cows would be needed to met the supply, therefore less cows being bred into existence and finally less cruelty. The opposite is also true. If more people bought milk more demand would be created, more supply, more cows, and more cruelty. IV. Milk in not needed for human survival. A.Vitamin D \"People who live in areas receiving plenty of sunlight develop darker skin from excess melanin and need more sun exposure such as two hours or more to get their vitamin D. Those with lighter colored skin require less exposure, anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.\" examiner.com/ [7] \"Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis.\" ods.od.nih.gov [8] B. Calcium \"Collard greens, cooked1 cup357\" Reed Mangels, PhD, RD [9] That's 357mg of calcium in a cup of collards. \"Dairy milk has long established itself as a rich source of calcium, containing about 300 milligrams of calcium per 8-ounce serving. \" fitday.com [10] From above one can see that a vegan can meet his/her nutritional needs. Besides they are plenty of health vegans. Including Al Gore and Bill Clinton. huffingtonpost [11] V. Prove animal cruelty Animal cruelty which is distinct from suffering is now established since one does not need to drink milk to survive. \"Cruelty to animals, also called animal abuse or animal neglect, is the human infliction of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, for purposes other than self-defense or survival.\" wikipedia [12] VI. Prove endorsement At the supermarket you are in public. People can see you. If you pay by check or credit card you must sign. You are publicly signing for the purchase of the good. Since your purchase of milk will cause animal cruelty, when you sign for your purchase you are literally endorsing animal cruelty. Even if you pay cash you are still giving your approval and support publicly through non-verbal communication. VII. Rebuttal of Con's argument \"Hello, there!!! Today, I will be debating on the motion that purchasing milk from super markets doesn't endorse animal cruelty, instead it dissuades us from doing so. Now, if you go deeper, you will understand that purchasing meat from markets endorses this cruelty, not purchasing milk. \" Con Buying both milk and meat from the supermarket endorse animal cruelty. There is no way to know what product people would buy in lieu of milk. They could buy meat, but fruit is just as likely. Since meat production is very similar, its safe to say if purchasing milk endorses animal cruelty so does purchasing meat. Thank you for accepting this debate. I look forward to your argument. VIII.
