            "premise": "Hello, I am the first speaker for the house on the motion that \"The US should allow free trade with cuba\" I affirm that the US should allow free trade with Cuba. Definitions: US: The United states of america, Free Trade: Free trade is a system of trade policy that allows traders to act and transact without interference from government. According to the law of comparative advantage the policy permits trading partners mutual gains from trade of goods and services. (According to wikipedia) Now onto the debate... Point 1: The Popularity of Opening Relations is Huge A. The popularity of opening relations is so large that is really inconcievable that anyone would not want to open relations. R. We need to do a lot of work to fix Cuba and with popularity so high, we cannot go wrong. E. A poll by Washington Post and New York Times asked, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\u0153Do you think the United States should or should not re-establish diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba?\" The response was amazing. 2/3 of responders were in favor of opening relations. E. A similar poll was conducted by CNN in April of this year showed that upward of 70% of people saide we should open relations. Furthermore, this was up almost 10% from the same poll in 2002. R. Clearly, the population is becoming more and more relaxed about having relations with Cuba and are confident that bad things will not happen. So judge, I ask you, why not?! Point 2: The Dangerous Fidel Castro is No Longer in Power. A. Fidel Castro was the man who invaded Cuba from Mexico in 1959, took control of the government, and made the lives of Cubans and Americans miserable for many years. He was also the man who led the Cuban missile crisis that threatened our country. R. Now, you may say, well, why can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\u2122t this happen again. But judge, when one looks at it, Cuba\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\u2122s power is very limited at this point. Fidel Castro is gone and his brother Raul has taken over. Cuba is in the news so much less for dangerous activities. There was a scare about a plan with Russia a couple of years ago, but this was settled and gone within weeks. E. Judge, prominent organizations believe this too; this is not just me saying this to try and convince you. The proposal is supported by the US Tour Operators Association, the National Tour Association and human rights groups like the Washington Office on Latin America, according to the Cuban newspaper Trabajadores. E. Congressman also believe in it. U.S. congressman Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA) is confident that Washington\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\u2122s travel restrictions to Cuba on U.S. citizens will be lifted before the end of this year. He says that voters in the house are just ~25 votes short of a bill to lift the embargo and he said in a September article that he hoped to have this done by the end of 2009. Although this has not happened with more pressing on the table, it is clear it is close and with a little more convincing, it can be done. Conclusion: Judge, so many people, citizens, politicians and organizations alike, support making this move. I will explain more on this topic in the second speech, showing concrete reasons about why we should make the change beyond popularity. So for the reasons I have stated, the pro should clearly win this debate.",

In this case your affirmation would be I affirm that the U.S. should allow free trade with Cuba. Definitions and Explanation: Here is where you should define the words: free trade, and set up a strict standard for the what is free trade and what isn't. Make it clear where to draw the line between free trade and restricted trade. These lines should be clearly distinguishable. By which standards should this debate be judged? Should judges weight the economic benefits, the political benefits, or moral reasons for doing so? Are all three completely equal? Are there any other benefits other than those already suggested?

You should clearly show why the US should allow the free trade with Cuba. As the person who created the resolution, you have the burden of proof and thus must prove, (using your definitions and explanations) along with examples factual/logical information why the protests are justifiable. You should also give your opinion on other countries that the US does not trade with such as North Korea, Iran, etc.. Should the US trade with them too? Thanks and good luck on the debate!",

            "discussionTitle": "Trade in the goods ivory and rhinoceros horns should be legalized.",
            "conclusion": "Trade in the goods ivory and rhinoceros horns should be legalized.",
            "premise": "Thanks for posting this debate. In the following round I shall focus on mainly the ivory trade and not the rhinoceros horn trade. Firstly because convincing spectators that ivory trading should remain illegal will suffice to win me the debate and secondly because I'm not too interested in reading up on rhinoceroses. In the following I shall set out the fundamental problem of the ivory and rhinoceros horn trades and lay out ethical and practical considerations of the trade. As a consequence, I shall prove that a trade in ivory and rhino horns should remain illegal. The fundamental problem Let me begin by stating that I do not find anything inherently wrong with the handling of ivory and rhino horns. They are not harmful substances to either users of these products, nor are they indirectly harmful to other humans. In fact, if it were the case that humans could plant ivory seeds, harvest ivory tusks and sell them at market, then the ivory trade would operate like any other industry. The fundamental problem is that the goods in question must be obtained from other living creatures that are either killed or made less well off due to a demand for tusks and horns. It is from this standpoint that I shall argue against the legalisation of markets in these goods. Problems with a free market in ivory and tusks Let us take the assumption that we allow free entry into the horn and tusk market. That is, anyone can pick up arms, find an elephant or rhino and, kill it and remove their appendages. Such a market would be undesirable, not only from the point of view of the beast, but for man as well. Such a free market would incentivise unlimited exploitation of the resource in question as quickly as possible. That is, driven by the desire to make profits, entrepreneurs (read: poachers), will attempt to extract as much ivory and horn in the present and leave as little as possible for future time periods. This obviously implies that the number of elephants and rhinoceroses in the wild will dwindle dramatically. This has indeed been the case, with the African elephant population falling by almost two-thirds in the 1980s from 1.2 million to 450,000 [1]. There was little doubt at the time of the ban on the ivory trade that extinction of the African elephant was an inevitability, and no doubt remains that this is the case today. This of course, implies a problem for the ivory market itself. Such a market would mean that a sustainable marketable quantity of ivory could not possibly be maintained. In short, since the incentives faced by the ivory entrepreneur lead him to kill as many elephants as possible in as short a time frame as possible, the ivory trade itself will soon cease to exist. [2] As a result of its economic unviability, few would argue for free and unrestricted trade in tusk and horn. Ethical considerations: Animal Persons and Human Needs In the following I shall try to argue that the killing of creatures like elephants and rhinoceroses may be unethical, especially when done for human desires that may be considered trifling. These arguments will give weight to the case for criminalising ivory and tusk traders. But first, a quick detour. Consider the following scenario. Humans have discovered a race of extraterrestrials that have similar mental capacities and abilities to humans, as well as possessing consciousness, sentience, self-awareness, the ability to feel pleasure and pain, can think and feel and can communicate. Would such entities be deserving of the same rights as human beings. Philosophers and members of the public generally answer in the affirmative. [3] The primary reason for this is that these are the main conditions necessary for personhood. Those who do not extend these rights to non-human persons appear to be speciesists \u2013 that is, people who claim the rights of an entity are based on a non-relevant characteristic, in this case species membership. What does this have to do with elephants? The answer should be clear by now. If elephants possess the characteristics necessary to make them worthy of personhood, then they would appear to be candidates for rights equal to that of other persons. I strongly believe that this is the case. Elephants possess the largest brains of any land mammal. [4] As a consequence, elephants possess a mental capacity greater than most other animals. In addition to consciousness and the ability to feel pleasure and pain, elephants display a sense of self awareness. In a famous study, an \u2018x' was marked on the face of South Asian elephants and large mirrors were placed in front of them. One of the elephants managed to touch the mark with its trunk, while others were able to display a sense of familiarity with their own reflections [5]. They also display a sense of compassion, artistic ability, creativity, problem solving ability and social interaction. [6] The conclusion that follows from this is that the killing of an elephant should carry the same, or almost the same moral significance as the killing of a human person. The second prong in the argument against the legalisation of trade is the fact that tusk and horn products serve interests that might be considered fleeting or unnecessary. The main uses of ivory are ornamental \u2013 piano keys, billiard balls and other handcrafted objects. Contrary to popular beliefs, powdered rhinoceros horns are not an aphrodisiac, but may be used to treat fevers. They too can be sculpted into ornamental figures. Clearly, close substitutes to ivory and rhino horn exist. The fact that there exist substitutes to these products and the fact that the needs fulfilled by these goods are not urgent (i.e. they are not medicinal in nature, nor can they be eaten) gives weight to the case that trade in these goods should remain illegal. An analogy can be drawn here: dog- and cock-fighting inflicts pain on animals, the fact that it does so solely for human entertainment counts in favour of keeping such activities illegal. Free Range Elephants? One possible solution to the moral dilemma is to suggest another method of extracting ivory from elephants. One such solution is to capture and raise elephants on large fields, and extract their tusks when they reach maturity. We already have free range chickens, why not free range elephants? Two considerations count here: one ethical and one practical. Firstly, although an elephant may be kept in an enclosure, free of pain for most of its life, removing its tusks may not be ethically justified. An elephant values its tusks. It uses them to \"dig for water, salt, and roots; to debark trees to eat the bark; to dig into baobab trees to get at the pulp inside; and to move trees and branches when clearing a path. In addition, they are used for marking trees to establish territory, and occasionally as weapons.\" [7] This would appear to diminish the quality of life of an elephant and make it vulnerable, and since an elephant is more akin to a human than, say, a chicken, great consideration ought to be given its suffering. Another similar analogy might be useful. Suppose that humans could produce other humans in laboratories and raise them in warehouses. Would it be ethical to permit the removal of the organs of such people? Suppose these people had the intellect of an elephant or a human child. Would it still be ethical? I contend that it would not, and since after all, we do not permit the removal of organs from children that most consider my view plausible. If the analogy is apt, the removal of tusks from elephants is also wrong. The practical consideration is much more straightforward. Although an elephant may live between 50 and 70 years, its tusks do not grow back once removed. [8] It may take many, many years for a large tusk to develop in an elephant. As a result, elephant farming would not be a viable option for those interested in harvesting ivory. *References in the comments",

            "conclusion": "Did George W. Bush Play A Role in 9/11",
            "premise": "Suspected insider trading Some conspiracy theorists maintain that Just before 9/11 an \"extraordinary\" amount of put options were placed on United Airlines and American Airlines stocks and speculate that insiders may have known in advance of the coming events of 9/11 and placed their bets accordingly. An analysis into the possibility of insider trading on 9/11 concludes that: A measure of abnormal long put volume was also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of unusual option market activity in the days leading up to September 11 that is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks. \"Allen M. Poteshman, The Journal of Business On the days leading up to 9/11, two airlines saw a rise in their put to call ratio. These two airlines were United Airlines and American Airlines, the two airlines whose planes were hijacked on 9/11. Between September 6 and 7, the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw purchases of 4,744 \"put\" option contracts in UAL versus 396 call options.[citation needed] On September 10, more trading in Chicago saw the purchase of 4,516 put options in American Airlines, the other airline involved in the hijackings. This compares with a mere 748 call options in American purchased that day. No other airline companies saw anomalies in their put to call ratio in the days leading up to the attacks. American Airlines however, had just released a major warning about possible losses. Insurance companies saw anomalous trading activities as well. Citigroup Inc., which has estimated that its Travelers Insurance unit may pay $500 million in claims from the World Trade Center attack, had about 45 times the normal volume during three trading days before the attack for options that profit if the stock falls below $40. Citigroup shares fell $1.25 in late trading to $38.09. Morgan Stanley, which occupied 22 floors at the World Trade Center, experienced bigger-than-normal pre-attack trading of options that profit when stock prices fall. Other companies that were directly affected by the tragedy had similar jumps. Raytheon, a defense contractor, had an anomalously high number of call options trading on September 10. A Raytheon option that makes money if shares are more than $25 each had 232 options contracts traded on the day before the attacks, almost six times the total number of trades that had occurred before that day.[citation needed] The initial options were bought through at least two brokerage firms, including NFS, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, and TD Waterhouse. It was estimated that the trader or traders would have realized a five million dollar profit. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an insider trading investigation in which Osama bin Laden was a suspect after receiving information from at least one Wall Street Firm. The 9/11 Commission Report concluded that \"Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions.\"[69] The report further stated: Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options \" investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price \" surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 \" highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. These examples typify the evidence examined by the investigation. The SEC and the FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous. Air defense stand down theory A common claim among conspiracy theorists is that the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) issued a stand down order or deliberately scrambled fighters late to allow the hijacked airplanes to reach their targets without interference. According to this theory, NORAD had the capability of locating and intercepting planes on 9/11, and its failure to do so indicates a government conspiracy to allow the attacks to occur.[66] Conspiracy theorist Mark R. Elsis says: \"There is only one explanation for this ... Our Air Force was ordered to Stand Down on 9/11.\" One of the first actions taken by the hijackers on 9/11 was to turn off or disable each of the four aircraft's on board transponders. Without these transponder signals to identify the airplane's tail number, altitude, and speed, the hijacked airplanes would have been only blips among 4,500 other blips on NORAD\"s radar screens, making them very difficult to track. On 9/11, only 14 fighter jets were on alert in the contiguous 48 states. There was no automated method for the civilian air traffic controllers to alert NORAD. A passenger airline had not been hijacked in the U.S. since 1979.[74] \"They had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,\" says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Only one civilian plane\"a chartered Learjet 35 with golfer Payne Stewart and five others on board\"was intercepted by NORAD over North America in the decade prior to 9/11, which took one hour and 19 minutes. Rules in effect at that time, and on 9/11, barred supersonic flight on intercepts. Before 9/11, all other NORAD interceptions were limited to offshore Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ). \"Until 9/11 there was no domestic ADIZ,\" says FAA spokesman Bill Schumann. After 9/11, the FAA and NORAD increased cooperation. They set up hotlines between command centers while NORAD increased its fighter coverage and installed radar to watch airspace over the continent.[2] The longest warning NORAD received of the hijackings was some eight minutes for American Airlines Flight 11, the first flight hijacked. The FAA alerted NORAD to the hijacked Flight 175 at just about the same time it was crashing into the World Trade Center's South Tower. The FAA notified NORAD of the missing \" not hijacked \" Flight 77 three minutes before it struck the Pentagon. NORAD received no warning of the hijack of United Flight 93 until three minutes after it had crashed in Pennsylvania. Israeli agents See also: September 11 attacks advance-knowledge conspiracy theories: Israel It has been claimed that Israeli agents may have had foreknowledge of the attacks. Four hours after the attack, the FBI arrested five Israelis who had been filming the smoking skyline from the roof of a white van in the parking lot of an apartment building, for \"puzzling behavior\". The Israelis were videotaping the events, and one bystander said they acted in a suspicious manner: \"They were like happy, you know ... They didn't look shocked to me. I thought it was very strange.\" While The Forward, a New York Jewish news magazine, reported that the FBI concluded that two of the men were Israeli intelligence operatives, a spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in the United States said that they had not been involved in any intelligence operation in the United States. The FBI eventually concluded that the five Israelis had no foreknowledge of the attacks.",

Sadly, all too often pimps are portrayed in the media and politics as exploitative and violent men who traffic vulnerable young women into the country, get them addicted to crack cocaine, then force them to have sex with strangers in return for their fix of drugs, but the reality is that many of these urbane entrepreneurs not only refer valuable business to their prostitutes and allow them to keep much of the fee, but they also provide their girls with physical protection, often in poor weather conditions and at very unsocial hours. That's why I am arguing that pimps should have their own trade association to put their side of the story forward to the public. This body could introduce a code of conduct that members must comply with and have a professional-sounding name such as The National Association of Ethical Soliciting Agents (NAESA) to give it credibility.

            "conclusion": "The U.S. Should allow free trade with cuba",
            "premise": "===> I N T R O D U C T I O N <=== I appreciate my opponent's excellent opening argument. My opponent has made two contentions for why Free Trade with Cuba is beneficial for the US. ===> A R G U M E N T -- O F -- C O N T E N T I O N -- 1 <=== -->Because the population is in favor of it.<-- My opponent is attempting to make the claim that because the masses favor something, it should immediately be done by the congress. Using public opinion to base the decisions of the most powerful nation on the earth is absolutely ridiculous. \"Fewer than a third (Of Americans) can identify DNA as a key to heredity. Only about 10 percent know what radiation is. One adult American in five thinks the Sun revolves around the Earth\" Source:http://www.nytimes.com... Our government is a representational democracy. We choose educated elected leaders to make key foreign policy choices for us. Is my opponent seriously advocating otherwise? To allow public opinion to dictate government's decision is an incredibly dangerous precedent. Polls also can easily be misleading based on how the questions are phrased, the tone of which the questions for ask, etc. Furthermore not everyone chooses to answer polls because not everyone has the time nor cares enough to answer them. For these reasons polls are a terrible way of determining key foreign policy decisions. ===> A R G U M E N T -- O F -- C O N T E N T I O N -- 2 <=== \"Fidel Castro is no longer in power\" My opponent attempts to make the following argument \"Fidel Castro is gone and his brother Raul has taken over. Cuba is in the news so much less for dangerous activities. There was a scare about a plan with Russia a couple of years ago, but this was settled and gone within weeks.\" Such an argument could be re-written: \"Hitler is gone and his brother Schmitler has taken over. Germany is still in control by the Nazi party, but it isn't on our news as much for being dangerous. Nuclear warheads were set up in Cuba and pointed directly at the US. A nuclear war nearly erupted due to Cuba's part in Russia's plans. Although my opponent labels this as point two, he clearly has several contentions which I will outline and sub-sequentially rebut. -->Raul Castro is not as dangerous as Fidel Castro. \"Raul Castro was once known as an iron-fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro's orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. At the time of the revolution 50 years ago, Raul Castro did the dirty work backstage, disposing of soldiers loyal to U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and cracking the whip to keep wavering communist apparatchiks in line and passionate about the cause. As Fidel Castro's strongman and defence minister, he trained a rag-tag bunch of guerrillas into a feared army that fought \"anti-imperialist\" wars abroad, most notably in Angola where Cuban soldiers helped defeat South African troops. The strength of Raul Castro's ideology and his enforcement of it made ordinary Cubans wary of the now bespectacled, flabby-faced grandfather of eight.\" SOURCE: http://www.dailymail.co.uk... \"(Washington, DC) - Ra\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl Castro's government has locked up scores of people for exercising their fundamental freedoms and allowed scores more political prisoners arrested during Fidel Castro's rule to languish in detention, Human Rights Watch says in a report released today. Rather than dismantle Cuba's repressive machinery, Ra\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl Castro has kept it firmly in place and fully active, the report says. The 123-page report, \"New Castro, Same Cuba,\" shows how the Ra\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl Castro government has relied in particular on the Criminal Code offense of \"dangerousness,\" which allows authorities to imprison individuals before they have committed any crime, on the suspicion that they are likely to commit an offense in the future. This \"dangerousness\" provision is overtly political, defining as \"dangerous\" any behavior that contradicts Cuba's socialist norms. \" SOURCE: http://www.hrw.org... \"In a January 2009 campaign called \"Operation Victory,\" dozens of individuals in eastern Cuba\u2014most of them youth\u2014were charged with \"dangerousness\" for being unemployed. So was a man from Sancti Sp\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdritus who could not work because of health problems, and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in August 2008 for being unemployed. \" REPORT SOURCE: http://www.hrw.org... -->Cuba hasn't done anything terrible recently (thus not being in the news) \"Cuba's laws empower the state to criminalize virtually all forms of dissent. Article 62 of the Cuban constitution explicitly prohibits Cubans from exercising their basic rights against the \"ends of the socialist state.\" REPORT SOURCE: http://www.hrw.org... As can clearly be seen by the evidence for both Raul and Cuba, they continue to actively repress their citizens and prevent both by their actions (locking up dissidents) and by their laws(stated directly above). Cuba's blatant disrespect for basic human rights, wrongful imprisonment, and blatant disregard for the rights of their citizens warrants no lifting of the trade ban of a country which nearly brought our world to the brink of nuclear war. Eyewitness testimony: \"The rapid response brigade was waiting for us, carrying wooden bats and metal rods, as though they were ready to beat us. They insulted us, saying we were worms, the scum of society. They called my mother and me whores and sluts.\" Raul is no different than his brother and is a danger to the U.S. Simply because Cuba does not appear on our local news does not mean that they have been acting fairly towards their citizens. -->Random Organizations support this. My opponent has committed the following fallacies: Argument from Authority -- By saying that a few organizations approve of it, it must be the best for our country. Anecdotal - By only giving only a few organizations as proof, my opponent assumes that all organizations agree with this notion. Ad Populum - An appeal to the populous (popularity). Since it's popular, it must be the right thing to do. Hasty Generalization: committed when a person draws a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is not large enough. -->One Representative believes in it. My opponent makes the same fallacies as above. Perhaps my opponent has misread his own resolution. The U.S. should allow free trade with Cuba. Should is being the correct word. This argument is about what is right vs what is wrong, not a popularity contest. ===> C O N C L U S I O N <=== My opponent has yet to show any real benefits of allowing free trade with Cuba. Instead, he has merely tried to turn this debate in a popularity contest in which the number of people agreeing with his resolution somehow affirm it. This is not so. My opponent must show much more than vague assertions that Cuba and its ruler are somehow less dangerous if he expects to affirm his resolution. He carries the burden of proof, but as of yet has not shown any real benefits of free trade. Using polls and anecdotal evidence to somehow assert his resolution is weak and is not an affirmation of your resolution. Furthermore making vague assertions such that Cuba and its leader are less dangerous without any real proof or logical backing will also not affirm your resolution. For these reasons I have negated Pro's contentions. I await my opponents new contentions in R2. Thank you.",

A cap-and-trade system only punishes carbon emissions above a certain level, treating only certain kinds of emissions as \"bad\". A carbon tax, therefore, sends a strong message to polluters that all their emissions are harmful, that they should be phased out, and that they should invest in environmentally-friendly sources of energy. This dramatic message may be particularly important if we view global warming to be a serious crisis. Companies are even willing to pay a premium for the stability provided by this system[I1]\u00a0; the premium being the tax itself, and the lack of the potential for profit through the trading of carbon credits.

            "premise": "Round 1 was for acceptance, my opponent broke the code of conduct, so I ask for the point of conduct.Rebuttals\"countries compete with each other so much that it's a detriment to everyone.... they have to start cutting regulations and wages etc just to compete. perhaps for a country that is just starting to develop, or in the process of developing, they being on the receiving end will reap benefits of something they wouldn't have had otherwise. but for a countries that are already considered developed nations like the US, it leads to problems.\"My opponent believes that free trade is bad because of competition between countries and businesses. However, why would they have to cut wages or fire workers? There is a better way for businesses and countries to make a quick profit; lowering prices. This also benefits consumers because with lower prices they can buy things cheaper. A businessman would likely not cut his workforce when he can simply lower prices to gain a greater profit than his competator. Also, cutting regulations benefits the market more. Cutting them is not a bad thing because it helps businesses more easily to gain profit and help the people. Cutting regulations =/= cutting jobs and wages.As I said a small amount of regulations should be in place. Minimum wage and laws against child labor would be a perfect example. However, too much regulation destroys wealth for the entire society, not just what you consider to be wealthy. \"there might be some benefit to some people, with lower prices in goods.... but not for everyone, and over the long run, it brings everyone down.\"My opponent seems to live in a world where lower prices does not benefit anyone and as a direct cause wages and labor are cut. I have no idea what that means so I am just going to teach my own lesson in economics 101.Economics 101: The Effect of Low PricesWhen a business lowers prices in order to gain more profit than its competitor, people usually react by buying the cheaper items. This allows a business to gain more profit than its competitor and be more successful. If this continues, the owner of the business may increased the amount of jobs and expand his business in order to gain even more profit and possibly raise wages for his current workers. [1]Anyway, my opponent continues to boast that the Free Trade Act enacted by President Bill Clinton was bad and caused inflation. However, he has no sources to back him up. He may not be telling the truth. How are we so sure that boom was only due to the internet and not the Free Trade Act. Also, my opponent may remember that flat tax debate we did. In that debate I placed a link showing that the richer are getting richer, but the poor are getting poorer and at a faster rate. [2]Anyway, now to my own points on why the US should have free trade.Free Trade Allows A Country to Become More Competitive and InnovativeInnovation provides new technology that allows countries to produce more, cure more diseases, pollute less, improve education, and choose from a greater range of investment opportunites. This results in economic growth allowing for better-paying jobs, higher standards of living, and greater appreciation of benefits of living in a peaceful society. New technologies bring about change in the market which, as US history shows, benefits society as a whole. One of the reasons why economic recessions and depressions happen would be because of new technologies challening older methods of production. This makes some sectors suffer until they can adapt to the new changes which end the economic woes and benefit society as all sectors would be advanced in the current technology now. [3]Higher Standard of LivingFree trade does improve people's lives. In the 19th century, British economist David Ricardo showed that any nation that focuses on producing goods in which it has a comparative advantage will get get cheaper and sometimes better goods from other countries in return. As a result of free trade, nations around the world gain from producing more efficiently and consuming higher quality and services at lower prices. [3]Economic GrowthEconomic freedom is essential to economic growth and true measure of economic freedom is free trade. Of the 142 nations whose economies have been observed during a seven year period for a study, the nations with the most free trade had more economic growth that the nations with the least free trade. A growing economy increases the demand for goods and services. As demans increases, businesses start to expand and create more and better-paying jobs. [3]Stronger Institutions and InfrastructureFree trade also supports the strengthening and development of institutions that safeguard economic freedom and development. Facing new opportunities to sell and purchase goods and to open all sorts of trade-related businesses, individuals have a strong incentive to create mechanisms and institutions to seize other opportunities. Free trade also supports the construction of new and stronger infrastructure. With free trade more and better roads as well as ports and airfields would need to be built to support free trade. [3]PeaceFree trade fosters an enormous chain of economic activity, the benefits of which create a social desire to be at peace with neighbors and faraway nations in which trade is conducted and maybe conducted in the future. When someone sees all the benefits of free trade, they want peace to preserve it. The Middle East, in which civil wars and massive riots takes place, is one of the most restrictive places on free trade in the entire world. North Korea, a country plagued by starvation and poverty, also is very restrictive with free trade. South Korea on the other hand is propsering with more free trade.

            "conclusion": "free trade should be valued above protectionism",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for the challenge of debating her. Let me start with this basic point: no one is against trade. Trade has taken place since the beginning of human history. The only question is what RULES we put in place to manage trade. The issue of so-called \"free trade\" and, by extension, how one views the power of corporate America to shape our economic lives is, from my little vantage point, THE deep, systemic change question on the economic vision side. RESOLVED: Free trade should be valued above protectionism Now before I Get into today's debate I realise some definitions need Clarification. Free Trade : Free trade is a system of trade policy that allows traders to trade across national boundaries without interference from the respective governments. http://en.wikipedia.org... Protectionism : Protectionism is the economic policy of restraining trade between states through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, and a variety of other government regulations designed to discourage imports and prevent foreign take-over of domestic markets and companies.(I would like to note that the key difference in definitions is Two Words, RESTRICT and RESTRAINING) http://en.wikipedia.org... Now the highest value for today's round should be that of Societal Welfare. (Note: it is the same definition as my opponent) And the only Criterion that upholds this value is Maximizing Domestic standard of living. The relation will be proven later on in my case, but basically I'm going to show that When you maximize the Domestic standard of living that it leads to Societal Welfare, And that's why I'm urging a negative vote. BUT First lets go into \"What is a Resolution, Value and a Criterion?\" For those who are not familiar with the LD debate format. RESOLUTION-To basically Sum it up a Resolution is a Statement that you affirm or negate. It is the side you are trying to prove With you Value and Criterion pair VALUE-The basic overlying idea. \"It's kind of like a pair of tinted glasses, it's what you use to look at the round, and how you look at it.\" Hello Orange CRITERION-What measures your value, usually an action of some kind Now to My arguments 1-Infant Industry This argument maintains that in order to grow and compete in the future, new industries need temporary protection from foreign competition. A critical need, protectionism allows these industries to establish themselves in the key beginning stages shielded from foreign competition from established firms. Protection gives these industries and companies a chance to progress and develop a competitive advantage in the future. If this protection is not given, new industries will never develop in a country as they are killed off by mature foreign competitors before they are even given a chance to take root. Protection in the form of tariffs for competitors or tax credits for companies would allow the government to establish and grow industries which would benefit the public good such as technology, solar, and green industries which have the potential to create millions of jobs. For emerging countries, this form of infant industry protection would allow less developed countries to start their own industries which can eventually compete on the global market alongside industries from developed countries. Now Maximizing the domestic standard of living(Criterion) is applied here with the infant industries argument leading to a better society or Societal Welfare(Value). 2.Diversify the Economy This Argument maintains that in times of trouble(War, Natural Disasters, etc.) some Countries need important economic factors like(Agriculture and steel). In addition to being a vital industry, agriculture has important cultural significance. A country may want to maintain a domestic food supply for the sake of security as well as preserving agricultural interests and farmer's lifestyles. Agriculture also has a unique exposure to price fluctuations as environmental factors can have major impacts on prices. As vital interest, agricultural products are often shielded from foreign competition. In the European Union, for example, agricultural subsidies compose over 47 percent of the EU's budget. Another vital industry is heavy industry such as the production of steel and coal. In the event of war, it is vital for a country to have the ability to produce steel and other resources for military manufacturing. If a country did not protect this vital industry and other countries produced the steel needed, it would be at the whim of other countries in a matter of vital national security. Now on to My opponents Case. If the judge has observed the round in full you'll notice That I put down definitions of RESOLUTION,VALUE and CRITERION. My opponents Criterion is the same as the Resolution side she is affirming, In LD Debate this is not allowed. But I'm going to show you that even if it was allowed it wouldn't work. I'll show you that Free Trade is So Destructive to Societal Welfare that the two terms should never go together. Most industrialized governments have long held that laissez-faire capitalism creates social evils that harm its citizens. To protect those citizens, these governments have enacted laws that restrict what companies can and can not do in pursuit of profit. Examples are laws regarding: Child Labor Environmental Protection Laws Competition Anti trust Equal Opportunity Collective Bargaining Occupational Safety and Health The main goal of free trade is to maximize profits not welfare. There are two ways to maximize profit, either to increase sales or to cut costs. The easier one to do is cut costs because increased sales is ultimately dictated by the laws of supply and demand. The biggest cost to most multinationals and large corporations is salary pay or wages, so to cut that cost jobs are sent overseas(Outsourcing) to developing countries where real wages are much lower(Child Labor) and the price of doing business is adequately cheaper. In turn that deteriorates the number of existing jobs domestically. So You See Free Trade definently does not uphold Societal Welfare. It has lead to the creating of many laws Regarding the Free trade Monster. Now to Her Arguments Free Trade Enhances Competition + Free Trade is beneficial to the Economy Dumping-http://en.wikipedia.org...(pricing_policy) You See There is a Company tactic Called Dumping that is started by This Competition between Mature Foreign Companies and small domestic companies. I will Use an example of dumping, that uses simple Economics and Relates to drugs. 1.Drug Dealer A has a drug Cartel that goes around the entire US. But he wants to expand into someone's area. 2.Drug Dealer B has a small Drug Organization, based out of Dallas, Texas(One of the places Drug Dealer A wants to expand. 3.Drug Dealer A goes in a purposely lowers prices on his \"goods\". So then people turn to him a Not Drug Dealer B. 4.Drug Dealer A has now eliminated Drug Dealer B(B cannot make any profit) 5.Drug Dealer A has B eliminated, literally(JK!) As I've shown this Competition is bad, an eliminates most companies. How can this(Free Trade) be beneficial to the Economy when it eliminates Any Jobs and Businesses. How can this eliminate Monopolies when it's what starts them. This a key reason we need protectionism Free Trade decreases unemployment Outsourcing and Child labor This is why the has been a huge Job loss In America. It's Simple Really. Why Pay Americans this 8.25 and hour when you can pay a child nothing but bread and some water? This is what free trade creates. Free Trade is beneficial to the consumes Only If you want Cheap Products, made from Child labor, Environmental abuses and You loss of Job(It's everything I've proved) So I have Proved how free trade is disastrous for Societal Welfare.",

Trade is believed to have taken place throughout much of recorded human history. There is evidence of the exchange of obsidian and flint during the Stone Age. [1] Materials used for creating jewelry were traded with Egypt since 3000 BCE. [2][3] Long-range trade routes first appeared in the 3rd millennium BCE, when Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. [4][5][6]The reason I believe it is important to share the basics of trade is because what is occurring in these schools is no different from what has been occurring as a part of the human experience for the last 5,000 years. Trade created the opportunity for an exchange of ideas, cultures, traditions, and eventually became a vital factor in diplomacy. Without trade, the expansion and development of civilization would have most likely taken much longer considering that trade allowed for certain civilizations to acquire materials that would otherwise be unobtainable. Only by understanding the historical value and instilled tradition that humans have, in terms of trade, can we truly begin to understand why kids might be so prone to conducting trades amongst themselves. If anything, I would say that these children are doing nothing more than developing the skills that truly will be necessary later in life. This also brings me to my second argument...[1] http://www.ancient.eu.com... [2] http://www.ancient.eu.com...[3] http://www.historyofjewelry.net...[4] http://www.ancienttrenches.com...[5] http://www.penn.museum...[6] http://www.historyworld.net...II. These kids are doing nothing more than mimicking the adults and society they were born into.When originally accepting this debate, I did so understanding that this would provide a certain challenge because I have never lived in or attended school in England. While researching the trade laws for England, I noticed that they are incredibly similar to our own domestic trade laws in America. In terms of basic trade standards, whether it be services for goods or goods for money - there is no real difference, aside from taxation which is not relevant to my argument nor this resolution at hand. Ultimately, both England and the U.S. practice Capitalism - and that is what is truly relevant here. Capitalism is defined as: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market. [7]With this in mind, I would also like to point out that Humans are naturally prone to a herd mentality. [8] We learn by experience and observation, we follow the flow of the crowd, and we usually organize our system of morals and values according to the society we were raised in. Considering that England is a society where a free market exists, where capitalism is practiced [9], and where merchants are easily found all around the region - is it truly that difficult to see why children would be mimicking these actions while in school? With it being known that this practice is only an issue at a school where the practice is banned, I truly see no moral issues with children mimicking the actions of the society they will soon be living in as adults. If they are breaking the rules, then their punishment is just... I am simply stating the importance of understanding that these actions are nothing more than acts of mimicry originating from the society they were born into and live in. [7] http://www.merriam-webster.com...[8] http://psychcentral.com...[9] http://himedo.net...III. Unless a school specifically bans the practice, I see no reason why it shouldn't be allowed.The resolution asks if students should be allowed to sell food to other students for profit. In terms of legality, I see no issue with this. If there is a willing buyer, and a demand for a product - the merchant has every right in England to sell the buyer the goods. In terms of morality, which in itself is purely relative, it is up to both parties involved to come to terms with the transaction. Taking this into consideration, if a school bans the practice of students selling other students goods, then by all means the students should respect the rules. But this is not a debate about schools banning the practice, which would be a whole other topic, this is a debate asking if students should be allowed to. In terms of both legality and morality, I believe it is a action that should be allowed and left up to the parties involved to determine the parameters of the trade. IV. When it comes to trading food, students are intelligent enough to decide for themselves.Secondary schools in England usually educate students who range from the ages of 12 - 18. Children in England are legally required to attend secondary schools from the ages of 12 - 15. [10]This is a very important factor to consider when determining if secondary school students should be allowed to sell food for profits i.e. - take part in the practice of trade. If these students were unable to make intelligent decisions for themselves that is one thing, but to think that 12 - 18 year olds aren't capable of making such a decision is nothing more than an unfair assessment of their mental abilities. One example of this would be the average intelligence scores of black children in England. Between the ages of 12 - 18, the average score ranges from 92.5 to 87.2. [11] This is considered average intelligence by current IQ test standards [12] which most certainly includes the ability to make reasonable decisions. I would also consider the ability to discern between healthy and unhealthy foods as a mental ability achievable by those with average intelligence. The only argument I can see would be that students don't care about health and want only what tastes good or junk food - which is also a debate within itself that would be deserving of it's own topic and ultimately irrelevant here. [10] https://www.internations.org...[11] http://robertlindsay.wordpress.com...[12] http://psychology.about.com...Rebuttals I. \"... these children who are selling such items are being able to get away with selling their items for more than double what they paid.\"While one might argue that this is morally wrong, I stand by the fact that morals are ultimately relative and would be subject to the standards of both parties involved. This is the risk of trade, and under capitalism the seller has the right to sell the goods for a price that reasonably matches the demand. No-one is forcing these students to purchase the food, they are doing it willingly on their own accord. If both the buyer and seller have come to an agreement, it is implied that they are both satisfied with the parameters of the transaction. The only exclusion would be if it is a purchase made under duress, but this is not the case. II. \"I feel that these students who are selling these products are exploiting the other students quite badly, in which they know that they are. They are also breaking many rules of my school's code in which they are not respecting other students by exploiting them.\"Yes but the buyers are willing to purchase the goods without being forced, this fails to meet the standards of exploitation and disrespectful acts towards fellow students. ...In Conclusion, I thank my opponent and await his response.",

Schools are inspected by Ofsted, at least in the U.K., and it is true the reports describe the quality of teaching as a whole rather than focus on individual teachers, but this is because there is not a particular teaching style which is favoured [1] The fairest way is to ensure you receive a good education, and this is made possible by being taught in different ways which can challenge and inspire you, it's why you will usually have a new teacher every year. When an adult inspects the quality of teaching it allows students to continue learning. If students could grade their teacher after one year - the time when you will probably have a new teacher, their suggestions may not represent what the next students want. You say you are judged, however teachers don't give you homework in order to access your understanding (why you won't find a leader board in their closet). They mark your work, give corrections, and if you still don't understand it is your responsibility to seek help. If students could grade their teacher some students might choose to criticize their teacher instead of seeking help. Teachers do from my experience give their class anonymous feedback forms to fill in, which removes any need for students to grade teachers. sources: [1] http://www.clerktogovernors.co.uk...",

            "premise": "Operating at maximum productivity is one of the most important aspects of an efficient economy. The right resources and technology must be combined to produce the right amount of goods to be sold for the right price. Therefore all markets should strive for highest efficiency. In order to maximize efficiency in the international economy, countries need to utilize their comparative advantage. This means producing what you are best at making, compared to other countries. If Mary is the best carpenter and lawyer in the US, but makes more money being a lawyer, she should devote more of her time to law and pay someone for her carpentry needs. Mary has an absolute advantage in law and carpentry, but someone else has a comparative advantage in carpentry1. Comparatively it makes more sense for someone else to do the carpentry, and for Mary to be the lawyer. It is the same in the international economy. Countries can be more efficient and productive if they produce what they are best at based on their domestic resources and populations, and trade for other goods. This promotes efficiency and lower prices. Free trade enhances this. The Doha round that is currently being debated in the World Trade Organization would reduce trade barriers and promote free trade, economies of scale, and efficient production of goods. It is estimated that the Doha round would increase the global GDP by $150 billion alone just by promoting free trade2. Free trade leads to specialization and efficient production, which ultimately would increase the size of the global economy and the individual economies in it. 1\u00a0Library of Economics and Liberty, \"Comparative Advantage\", 2\u00a0Meltzer, Joshua (2011), \"The Future of Trade\", Foreign Policy Magazine,",

            "discussionTitle": "The United States should regulate trade.",
            "conclusion": "The United States should regulate trade.",
            "premise": "I'll get right into my arguments. 1. Free trade is bad for the economy because it allows trade deficits.Free trade allows the US to import more than it exports. To make up the difference, the US is forced to sell its assets and assume debt. Because the US allows trade deficits, foreign countries own over $30 trillion in US assets. [1] And as a result, the US net international investment position is -$5.445 trillion. [1] The US then has to pay interest on this debt, which is calculated as part of the federal deficit.The US debt to foreign countries, as well as the federal deficit, is bad for the economy. The Economic Strategy Institute estimated in 2001 that the trade deficit was shaving at least one percent per year off our economic growth. [2] Economist William Bahr estimates that our trade deficit since 1991 has made our economy 13% smaller than it otherwise would be. [3] Other economists have estimated that trade deficits have stunted GDP growth by up to 20%. [2] Trade deficits also hurt the economy by destroying jobs. For example, economists have shown that trade deficits with China cost the US 2.8 million jobs between 2001 and 2008. [4] And the situation only gets worse. Eventually, the US will exhaust its ability to sell assets and assume debt. The US will then be forced to pay foreign countries back, and it'll have to pay them back by working for free.Instead of a free trade policy, which allows these harmful trade deficits, the US should regulate imports and exports so that the value of imports is roughly equal to the value of exports.2. Free trade poses an existential threat to human survival because it encourages carbon emissions.97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing climate warming. [5] Climate change has already hurt agriculture, human health, ecosystems, water supplies, and many people's livelihoods. [6] If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, we'll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet inhabitable to humans. [7] Climate change thus poses an existential threat to human survival.Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage aren't reflected in the good's price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs \"externalities.\" Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.For example, wasted energy from transportation costs... Free trade encourages goods to be made in one place and used very far away. The transportation costs are not only a waste of energy but they also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, speeding up climate change. Free trade prices simply don't account for carbon emissions (especially the high quantity of emissions from transporting goods across international borders). Nor do free trade prices account for radioactive waste from nuclear power or pollution from pesticides, chemicals, and heavy metals. In fact, free trade not only permits environmental damage but encourages it, as a way to grab a cost advantage. Given the existential threat to human survival posed by climate warming, free trade poses a threat to human survival.To create prices that account for externalities, the US should tax and subsidize imports and exports to \"internalize\" social costs that escape the prices set by supply and demand. A small, uniform tariff for all countries would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Personally, I think the US needs to get serious about climate change and start taxing all imports produced in harmful ways, to discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources. These regulations are necessary not only to set accurate prices that reflect externalities but also to slow climate warming.3. Free trade unfairly redistributes wealth by making the rich richer and the poor poorer.The Stolper-Samuelson theorem says that people who draw most of their income from returns on capital gain from free trade, while people who get most of their income from labor are hurt by free trade. [8] Even though the majority of people in the US are workers, the US has more capital per person, and fewer workers per dollar capital, than the rest of the world. [9] So according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, the majority of people in the US get poorer as a result of free trade while the rich (those with the most capital) get richer.The Stolper-Samuelson theorem has proven correct. Income inequality in the US has grown sharply since the 1970s, when the US started implementing free trade policies. [9] US Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that wages for workers tracked productivity increases until the 1970s, after which wages have increased more slowly than productivity. [10] Some BLS figures about the wage gap have shown increases in wages at 8% while productivity has increased 80% since 1973. [10] These figures suggest that free trade has lowered the wages of US workers because of global competition with developing nations. At bottom, free trade redistributes wealth so that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. As a policy matter, not only is this degree of income inequality unfair and unjust, but it's also against American values such as equal opportunity.ConclusionIn the US, free trade has led to massive financial debt, income inequality, and poverty. Other countries also offer cautionary tales. In protectionist Latin America, per capita income in the 60s and 70s was growing at 3.1% per year, but after the continent embraced free trade in the 80s, per capita income dropped to 1.7%. [11] All the empirical evidence favors protectionist trade practices as an economic matter.But there's another (more important) reason to restrict trade: free trade promotes carbon emissions, waste of energy, and environmental damage. Given the threat to human survival posed by climate warming, and as a result of potential runaway climate change, the US should impose taxes on imports to encourage local production, discourage wasted energy from transportation, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.References:[1] http://www.bea.gov...[2] http://origin.www.uscc.gov...[3] http://www.huffingtonpost.com...[4] http://www.epi.org...[5] http://climate.nasa.gov...[6] http://www.ipcc.ch...[7] http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org...[8] http://en.wikipedia.org...[9] http://en.wikipedia.org...[10] http://www.bls.gov...[11] http://www.cepal.org...",

            "premise": "1) My opponent claims that Jewish insider trading is a normalcy and happens on a regular basis. This is true, but not in the amount of money we are discussing at this junction. Just before 9/11 there was an \"extraordinary\" amount of put options placed on United Airlines and American Airlines stocks. Authorities believed, and some continue to maintain, that trading insiders may have known in advance of the coming events of 9/11 and placed their bets accordingly. An analysis into the possibility of insider trading on 9/11 concludes that: A measure of abnormal long put volume was also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of unusual option market activity in the days leading up to September 11 that is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks.\u2014Allen M. Poteshman, The Journal of Business On the days leading up to 9/11, two airlines saw a rise in their put to call ratio. These two airlines were United Airlines and American Airlines, the two airlines whose planes were hijacked on 9/11. Between September 6 and 7, the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw purchases of 4,744 \"put\" option contracts in UAL versus 396 call options. On September 10, more trading in Chicago saw the purchase of 4,516 put options in American Airlines, the other airline involved in the hijackings. This compares with a mere 748 call options in American purchased that day. No other airline companies saw anomalies in their put to call ratio in the days leading up to the attacks. American Airlines however, had just released a major warning about possible losses. Insurance companies saw anomalous trading activities as well. Citigroup Inc., which has estimated that its Travelers Insurance unit may pay $500 million in claims from the World Trade Center attack, had about 45 times the normal volume during three trading days before the attack for options that profit if the stock falls below $40. Citigroup shares fell $1.25 in late trading to $38.09. Morgan Stanley, which occupied 22 floors at the World Trade Center, experienced bigger-than-normal pre-attack trading of options that profit when stock prices fall. Other companies that were directly affected by the tragedy had similar jumps. Raytheon, a defense contractor, had an anomalously high number of call options trading on September 10. A Raytheon option that makes money if shares are more than $25 each had 232 options contracts traded on the day before the attacks, almost six times the total number of trades that had occurred before that day. The initial options were bought through at least two brokerage firms, including NFS, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, and TD Waterhouse. It was estimated that the trader or traders would have realized a five million dollar profit. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an insider trading investigation in which Osama Bin Laden was a suspect after receiving information from at least one Wall Street Firm. 2) How can you possibly argue that Mossad agents, (spies) of Israel dancing and cheering at the towers crumbled a coincidence? They were also found to have over 4200 US dollars in cash, and maps of NYC (blue prints) in their van. It is literally impossible for the equivalent of American CIA operatives (Israeli Mossad agents) to be doing this at this exact time and date and it being coincidental. 3) That's exactly my point. This attack is good for Israel because Americans will be in the Middle East fighting \"terror with us\". What is the US doing now? Bombing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq etc. The average leader would express condolences, but his immediate response is it would be very good for Israel? 4) Your answer to my argument is that it requires further investigation. Because you have the burden of discrediting my points, you have by default conceded my argument in number 4. I will however follow up and say that I urge you to review this youtube video of the foxnews report on Amdocs and espionage in the United States. http://www.youtube.com... 5) How is the FBI finding a massive spy ring of Israeli nationals a coincidence? 6) We cannot let any government explain anything. Too much trust in government violates our personal sovereignty. We must question those that govern us. Buy relying on government to \"educate and take care of us\" we take another step toward tyranny.",

Brazil's president specifically said, it was the free trade and the continuing of exports flooding that caused Brazil to look towards protectionism policies. Once again I would like to point out President Rousseff said it was loose economic policies, which does not include subsidies, that has caused the turn towards protectionism policies. So in summary unrestricted free trade will continue to ruin smaller economies, and make them turn to alternative methods such as protectionism. 2. Your accusations said it was a liberal institution so we shouldn't use the study. That is ad hominum when you provide no facts to discredit the study, but only use rhetoric that they are a liberal institution. Your study says since the US GDP was growing is must have been NAFTA that created all these jobs. I will stand by that the United States loss a total of 1 million net jobs because of NAFTA. Onto the manufacturing jobs and capitalism, this will be covered in the poverty section 3. Concession was made here 4. 1st on Mexico: Mexico's poverty has been on rise recently, even when US and Mexico have continued to have a healthy trade. When 20 million of the Mexican people or 17% of the population can't afford food then you can see the fault in free trade. Free trade doesn't liberate the poor it liberates big corporations and hurts the poor. 2nd Peru: Peru loses 70% of its revenue to American farmers when it trades asparagus with the United States. Then out of the 30% only 5% goes back the farmers, sounds like the big corporations are once again winning, while the producers are suffering. 3rd will be the manufacturing and jobs: My opponent makes a big mistake with this argument because it insures that free trade will create poverty. In my first speech I talk about how free trade devastate developing countries, and my opponent built upon it on his last speech. He said capitalism is about profit; and countries who can not keep up with this capitalism cycle will lose. This proves that countries with bigger industries will continue to dominate the free market era, and will continue to flood the market just like the US is doing in Brazil. Bigger nations will always win in free trade while smaller countries will continue to be impoverished by free trade. 5. My opponent makes a costly concession here too. He concedes that Latin America has tried free trade, and they are now moving away from it. He doesn't contend my point about economic nationalism but attacks political hurdles, that have no relevance what so ever in the round. Latin America stands as the number one source of empirical evidence in this debate as why free trade should be rejected. In conclusion my opponent tries to hide behind economic theories, and avoid the facts that happened because of free trade. He failed to show the Latin America is moving away from free trade because it doesn't have the economic benefit that is suppose to come with free trade. He fails to comprehend and provide reasonable analysis on the Brazil example of what free trade actually does to the nation. Finally in the last speech he says capitalism is all about profit, which means developing nation will continue to suffer under the free trade era. I would like to thank my opponent also for a great debate.",

            "premise": "Thank you for your arguments. I will go on my rebuttals.FrameworkOkay, my opponent has not put any framework. BOP is shared equally, and the one who fills the BOP will be the winner.Organ Trading is a very serious matter. It is first of illegal, and also very bad for people. There is no reason to do this. My team will show you why we should not let these illegal doing things people have the not equivalent rights as us. Why should we make things equal for us who did nothing illegal or someone who did illegal things. Are we able to get the same rights? Our team is here to explain why we should not have equal rights.Rebuttals1. Okay, let's go with the Ashley Harris-Moore first. Why she got this effect? Becuase she did illegal things, which made harm to her family. It is not the governments fault that she did this illegal organ trading. It is her fault she did this. If no one did this illegal organ trading, then everyone can give healthcare to people around the world. It is depending to the parents choice, not the government. If this is the best they want to do to their child, this is the way they do it. Basically, it is their fault that they did illegal organ trading to defend themselves. This person had done this to defend herself however, she made a bad choice. Right now, our government side wants to help the citizens unless they ban this illegal organ trading. If that person did not do illegal organ trading, she could have got healthcare. This depended on this person's actions, not the government.2. Now let's go with Pro's second argument which was about system failure. Con tried to say, let's not deny healthcare to this illegal crime people, and legalize the purchase of organs. First of all, that will become more of a failure. It is illegal to do so. It will just make the citizens to more illegal acts. I think denying healthcare is better because it is not illegal, however, legalizing the purchase, is going to be hard to manage. Also, only the poor people will sell these organs to get money, when they harm their own body, and it is useless.ContentionsI will go to some more arguments, then finish this round.1. We should not do illegal things.This one is obvious. We should not do illegal things. Okay, as the resolution says, this organ trading, is illegal. The meaning of illegal is not allowed by law. That is why we should ban organ trading. However the problem is that the government cannot do this. That is why we need to make something happen to never do that again. This is one reason why need to deny healthcare for them. The second reason is that there is no reason to treat these illegal organ traders. They should not get the benefits we do. This is another reason we need to deny healthcare.ConclusionOur team believes that organ trading is very bad thing because it is illegal. As I said in the framework, Pro side had filled to explain why we should not get the equal rights as these people who did illegal things. Rebutted all of Con's mistakes also. Please Vote for Pro!Sourceshttp://www.merriam-webster.com...Thank you!",

            "premise": "With thanks to my opponent for his continued interest in this debate, I should like to respond as follows: My opponent wrote: \"The \"spivs\" you speak of are the guys who keep us out of the next Great Depression. If they don't have money, they won't invest, and the economy will bust, permanently. They need money so they can get our money back.\" Not all investment bankers are spivs, but many are. The way the markets and annual bonus systems are organised encourages traders to undertake deals that have the potential to make short-term profits but are not necissarilly beneficial to the long-term interests of their companies or, indeed, to the wider economy. A good example of this is short-selling, whereby a broker borrows shares he doesn't own and sells them later at a lower price, thus making a profit. It is, therefore, in his interest to talk the share price down and bankers often do this by spreading false rumours around the trading floors. This way, an unscrupulous trader (and in the world of de-regulated capitalism, ethical traders are, indeed, a rare commodity!) makes a profit from other peoples' misery. That's why the Fed have suspended the practice and why the FBI have been sent in to investigate a large number of suspected dodgy traders. The money they have gambled and lost in unwise trades was savers', pensioners' and investors'. Now they want the taxpayer to throw good money after bad. If Congress refuses to hand over the cash, banks might go belly-up, but their business dealings would be taken up by more scrupulous and reputable financial institutions. My opponent then continued: \"The United States doesn't have that much spare capital. The only way they can get it is by borrowing. The United States is considered the world's safest investment (Marketplace, NPR). We can easily get that money.\" In a sense this is both true and untrue. US Government Bonds, along with gold are, indeed, the safest investments in the world, especially since the credit crunch, which is why the USFG has a lot of liquidity. However, the cash received from sale of bonds has to be repaid, sooner or later, to the investor \u2013 they are not gifts to the US taxpayer from kind international benefactors! My opponent then detailed how the majority of tax is paid for by more prosperous people, but I wouldn't call them \"rich\"; just \"hardworking middle-class people\". His final point was that the markets need capital to invest in order to make money. True. However, there is a lot of money out there \u2013 the problem is, nobody knows exactly who has got how much and so are reluctant to lend it to the markets in case the investment bank concerned sinks, taking their money with it. That's why the only place these financial institutions are likely to get their money is from the taxpayer. My point is that the taxpayer shouldn't be expected to invest their money in institutions that the market considers are bad risks.",

            "conclusion": "Free Trade is better for American society than Protectionism",
            "premise": "I would like to thank the Con side for accepting this debate. Free Trade is better than protectionism for the following five reasons. 1. Free Trade is good for Americans Free Trade is good for Americans because consumers will benefit from producer surplus. This would be how Americans can consume at an overwhelming alarming rate. An example of this would be Walmart. Walmart can produce goods at a cheaper rate and consumers can purchase at a cheaper price[1]. Free Trade allows Americans to consume more at a cheaper price. [1]http://www.forbes.com... 2.Free Trade is good for the impoverished As I said in #1, Free Trade allows consumers to consume more because of the surplus. This is most beneficial to those who are poor. The poor can consume and won't have to worry about their finances as they would under protectionism. Free Trade according to the World Trade Organizations helps to reduce poverty. [2]http://www.wto.org... 3. Free Trade eliminates incompetent competitors For example, Free Trade allowed the Japanese to bring cars to America. The US auto manufacturers brought out the Pinto, Pacer, and Vega to compete but failed miserably. Americans should not have to purchase inferior products for the sake of incompetent producers. [3]http://www.nbcnews.com... 4.Free Trade encourages economic development With Free Trade, foreign companies and American companies can invest in each other's countries. This allows corporations to have an interest in the economic growth of other countries. 5. Free Trade leads to a more mutually satisfying foreign policy Countries are mutually invested in each other. Therefore countries are less likely to go to war with one another. Countries engaged in a Free Trade agreement will reconsider going to war because they will suffer economically as a result. Free Trade also prevents the United States from getting into trade wars with other countries in the vile exchange of tariffs and quotas.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should have a general policy of free trade.",
            "premise": "Free trade is riddled with huge problems, most of which are generally acknowledged even by free traders. As Paul Krugman, winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics, writes: \"it's hard to avoid the conclusion that growing U.S. trade with third world countries reduces the real wages of many and perhaps most workers in this country. And that reality makes the politics of trade very difficult.\" [1] I argue that free trade is not overall beneficial, and that its problems can be solved with pragmatic restrictions.Comparative advantageFree trade is fundamentally predicated on the false theory of comparative advantage: it is beneficial for the US to import some goods (including services) in order to free up our workforce to produce more-valuable goods instead. The logic seems intuitive, which explains its support by many. But I assure readers, there is a growing consensus among economists that comparative advantage and free trade is deeply flawed. I will attempt to explain why.SustainabilityA free trade policy falsely assumes that trade is sustainable. When the US buys goods from foreigners, it must give them something in return. There are only three things we can give in return: goods we produce today, yesterday, or tomorrow. When we end up using the 2nd and 3rd option, goods we produced yesterday and tomorrow, we produce a trade deficit. Even Pro admits free trade causes the trade deficit. See Pro\u2019s [3] and [4].As a result, foreigners now own 50% of all publicly traded Treasury securities, 25% of American corporate bonds, and roughly 12% of American corporate stock. Net foreign ownership of American assets is $3.5 trillion.The Economic Strategy Institute estimated in 2001 that the trade deficit was shaving at least one percent per year off our economic growth. Following in their footsteps, economist William Bahr has estimated that our trade deficit since 1991 has made our economy 13% smaller than it otherwise would be. [2] That\u2019s a hole in our economy bigger than the entire economy of Canada. Other economists have reached similar conclusions.6.5% of our federal budget goes to interest on this debt. According to the World Bank, if free trade continues, \u201cthe U.S. net international investment position \u2013 which compares the value of foreign-owned U.S. assets with the value of U.S.-owned foreign assets \u2013 will hit a staggering minus-69 percent of annual gross domestic product by 2025.\u201d [3] In plain English, free trade is unsustainable.Deficit trade also destroys jobs right now. It is estimated that every billion dollars of trade deficit costs Americans 9000 jobs. For example, the trade deficit with China from 2001 to 2008 cost the US 2.8 million jobs. [4] Keep in mind that, because Americans consume more than they produce, the debt will have to be paid for in the future. Foreigners already gave us their goods, which we bought on credit; they won\u2019t owe us anything later. In the future we will be required, in effect, to work without being paid.The trade deficit occurs because free trade makes no distinction between short-term or long-term efficiency. It treats short-term and long-term as completely arbitrary factors. Hence, free trade maximizes short-term living standard, but it comes at the expense of long-term prosperity. Again, free trade is simply unsustainable.The flip side of financial debt from imports is unsustainable exports. The U.S. exports a significant quantity of nonrenewable resources. Depleting nonrenewable resources, along with pollution and environmental damage, are factors that free trade completely ignores. This makes completely unregulated exports unsustainable as well.We conclude that free trade is unsustainable. This is a serious problem that is easily fixable. We achieve financial sustainability by controlling trade and fixing the exchange rate. The solution to unsustainable exports is to tax or otherwise restrict trade that depletes nonrenewable resources or emits pollution.ExternalitiesAn externality is the economic term for when a product\u2019s price does not reflect its true economic value. A classic negative externality is environmental damage, which reduces the economic value of natural resources without raising the price of the product that harmed them. The classic positive externality is technological spillover, where one company\u2019s inventing a product enables others to copy or build it, generating wealth that the original company does not capture. Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to positive or negative externalities, it will recommend bad policies.China\u2019s economy, for example, has grown less than it seems when one takes into account the massive pollution and destruction of its soil and air. Free trade not only permits pollution but encourages it, as a way to grab a cost advantage.The issue of externalities is a well-known problem, even to honest free traders. The solution is to end free trade, tax imports produced in a harmful way, and subsidize research and development of new technologies.Lower Prices?This is where we really see the problem of comparative advantage. Anyone who understands comparative advantage knows that free trade affects relative prices, not the price level. When a country opens to free trade, it is the relative price of imports that comes down; by necessity, the relative prices of its exports must go up. Pro's examples of lowered prices (like the Wal-Mart effect) have to be qualified to take into account the fact that the relative price of the goods the U.S. exports is higher than it would have been absent free trade. This means the prices of domestic goods will go up!Stolper-Samuelson Theorem and Income InequalityThe Stolper-Samuelson theorem [5] is the underlying mechanism of free-market economics. It says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant factor of production and lowers returns to the scarce one. In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Free trade thus hurts American workers. The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily tradeable and can be produced through cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who will either lose their job or be paid less. So while free trade may expand our economy overall, it destroys a huge number of American jobs as well as increasing the wage gap between blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Keep in mind, the majority of US workers are blue-collar workers. In the US, free trade literally redistributes wealth by making the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is unfair. In fact, in 2006 it was estimated that freer trade cost the average household earning the median income more than $2000. [6] For many households, that is more than their entire federal tax bill! Anyone against higher taxes and big government should bear that in mind when evaluating free trade.An Alternative to Free TradeI particularly like one proposed by Warren Buffet: the idea that exporters be given $1 certificates for every dollar of their exports, and that importers would then have to buy a certificate from them for every dollar of goods they imported. This would, of course, force America's trade into balance immediately, solving a major problem with free trade.Concluding RemarksFree trade creates win-lose situations. When imports replace goods produced in the US, consumers enjoy lower prices on impored goods -- but workers don't like the lost jobs. Given that consumers and workers are ultimately the same people, this means they lose more as workers than they gain as consumers. There is no theorem in economics that guarantees the gains of consumers outweighs the loss of workers.There are fatal flaws to free trade that are fixable. Many more problems exist that, because of space limitations, I will try to cover in future Rounds.

Free Trade does not regulate how countries are supposed to dictate their domestic policies. Free Trade-\"a system of trade between nations in which there are no special taxes placed on imports\" http://www.merriam-webster.com... \"Things such as Labor Unions, Environmental protection, minimum wage, child labor, health and safety standards causes prices of goods to go up. Since it would be cheaper to produce the same products in places that don't have these, free trade allows them to move to those countries and avoid those policies. \" Your mistaken. Many countries within the European Union and in the EEA have labor unions, environmental protection, wage floors, high health and high safety standards. The European Union has European Economic Area(EEA) which is Free Trade between EU member states and a few EFTA members states. Countries in the EU and EFTA have more of these \"social goods\" than the United States. They are engaged in Free Trade. http://www.efta.int... \"While Protectionism makes everyone play on the same field, and even encourages countries to adopt some of those polices to try to avoid tariffs, or quotas. \" Protectionism does not \"make everyone play on the same field\" as Con would have you believe. Let us revisit the Tariff Reform debate in early 20th century Britain. The debate for Tariff Reform was because most of the countries Great Britain traded with had tariffs. Great Britain was a free trader. So they wouldn't \"play on the same field.\" I would argue Protectionism can lead to tireless imperialism as well. As Joe Chamberlain, Cecil Rhodes, and others knew that for Protectionism to work effectively is to have more capital than other countries. http://www.jstor.org... \"\"While corporate profits soar, individual wages stagnate, held at least partly in check by the brave new fact of off shoring -- that millions of Americans' jobs can be performed at a fraction of the cost in developing nations near and far\"\" Protectionism is crony capitalism. Corporations are allowed to sap the American populace in uncompetitive markets. Corporations are allowed to reap more profits under Protectionism than under Free Trade. Murray Rothbard- Protectionism and the Destruction of Prosperity http://mises.org... Corporate profits are increasing because there is a higher rate of consumption(1). People a century ago did not have the cpaacity to consume as much as we do in today's time. (1)http://www.pbs.org... \"individual wages stagnate\" Wages are relative to industry. If your thinking about how Walmart and McDonald's. Think again, most employees only stay and work between five-six months at either. Employees who work for such a short period of time have a limited amount of productivity due to their lack of experience. \"When countries can make the same products at a lower price than America then those jobs move there causing unemployment. 2,273,392 jobs were outsourced in 2011\" The products tend to be inferior which is something the Con forgot. My opponent has also equated the American population of over 300 million to a feeble 2 million. The interests of the mass is worth more than the interest of the few. The majority should consume less so that 2 million can have jobs. More Americans should risk falling into poverty to consume American products(2). To compare the suffering of 2 million does not equate to the suffering of 300 million. What the Con doesn't say is that job losses are temporary, not permanent. People will usually be payed around the same wage they were previously employed at because of their productivity. For example, an automotive engineer will not be flipping burgers at McDonald's if his company outsourced his job. He will be able to find another engineering job at a different firm because he is a skilled worker. (2)http://www.huffingtonpost.com... \"Also trade deficit caused by free trade creates more unemployment. \" No, it doesn't(3). Foreign firms invest in the United States and employ Americans. Seventeen million Americans are employed because of Free Trade(4). (3)http://www.cato.org... (4)http://blog.heritage.org... \" Free Trade causes Trade Deficits.........U.S. Trade Deficits Grow More Than 440% with FTA Countries, but Decline 7% with Non-FTA Countries\" Of course, many countries are consuming more then they produce. The United States is one of the best examples of this phenomena. Trade deficits are not bad(5). Americans are consuming more Mexican goods. We are helping to employ more Mexicans while we reap the benefits of their hard labor. (5)http://www.radford.edu... \"Free Trade creates undesirable interdependency\" Interdependency is desirable , Free Trade agreements are consensual. \"The whole European Union would be effected eventually effecting the whole world. The economic downturn in one country quickly effects all other countries.\" This is inconsequential because it is inherently part of the economic cycle. Busts will happen inevitably in free market economies. Countries have recovered from them. The United States and the United Kingdom have had multiple booms and busts but are still some of the strongest economies in the world. \" Countries that were self-sufficient like the USSR or Japan\" The USSR are was a command economy. Of course unemployment would be low because they didn't even have a free market. The United States was far superior in economic development compared to the USSR(6). Japan during the Great Depression was involved in a war in Manchuria during the Great Depression . War stimulates the economy and create jobs. Post-World War 2 Japan was not self sufficient.

            "premise": "I don't think my opponent will show up to reply, but I'll continue my argument anyway. Free trade is when two countries/economies agree to soften or eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers. However, it could also refer to trade without interference. I maintain that such trade should be valued over protected trade. As I started to address in the last round, people within a specific area (for all intents and purposes I will say 'countries') can maximize efficiency of their resources and achieve the best potential net gain if they specialize in producing certain goods or products specifically. For example, if China had a lot of rice but no cattle, it would behoove them to invest in producing and exporting rice in particular, trading it to others who need it in exchange for cattle which is not readily available to them (or that would be less efficient for them to invest in). Putting tariffs or other barriers on trade goods discourages a country from exporting to you. As such, trade declines and this efficient method of production and maximizing gains becomes ineffective. Free trade allows companies a greater supply of raw materials at a lower price. By producing at lower costs, they can sell at lower costs thus allowing them to become more competitive in the global market. If other countries have lower prices, Americans will buy from them instead of American businesses thereby making America a less valuable and poorer nation. Now, my opponent by debating standards (rules of conduct) cannot make any new arguments in the final round. Therefore, he can only reply to the arguments I've already brought up. Considering I doubt he has any intention of replying to this debate anyway, I will conclude here and see what my opponent has to say (if anything) in response to the contentions that I've brought up thus far.

            "conclusion": "Free Trade",
            "premise": "Defense against Opponents attack:My opponent ignored the fact that I brought up that free trade destroyed jobs. They seem to think it was okay that they claimed free trade created 5 million jobs without any evidence to back it up. As I said, I couldn't find their source that 5 million jobs were created, and they didn't offer the source. I already provided sources that show free trade limits jobs, and here's one which shows that trade protectionism creates jobs.[1] When a government raises the prices of a good, or allows a good to be produced in America, it attracts certain firms to stay here and provides more jobs in that sector here in America.[1] In reality this would be good for the economy in a different way than free trade is. While free trade will lower prices and that could be good for the economy, I argue that it is worse for the economy because it would also lower wages and cause people to be unemployed as it destroys jobs, which I proved already before and my opponent provided no evidence of jobs being created through free trade, and only claimed they were created. What good is the lowered price for a product if no one can buy it still because they are unemployed and not getting any money? In addition, since unemployment would be higher, that is good for the employer since if the employees ask for a raise, they can be fired and replaced with people who are unemployed. Unemployment really only helps the employer. However, in protectionism, jobs are guarded and prevented from going over seas. While the price of products will probably go up, people will have jobs and money to pay for those products. And since more people will be employed, they can demand for a raise(and there is no one the employer can replace them with since unemployment would be down) to balance out the fact prices are up. When my opponent says we need to look at our economy first, that's an excuse to justify using other countries' slave, child labor, and under-paid workers. It's like saying you need to look out for yourself first to justify stealing from someone. Rebuttal to Opponents first contention: Standard of living does not go up in a society with free trade because more people lose jobs as I pointed out above, and because there are more unemployed people, employers are free to lay people off and hire someone else who is currently earning nothing(because they are unemployed) and who would be willing to work for the lower wage. So, it doesn't raise the standard of living at all. When we do trade when we have a comparative advantage, and the other party does as well, then that is a good thing, but trade has to be regulated in such a way where such circumstances arise. If the trade is getting rid of more jobs than it creates, which as I showed above that usually happens, then it is not good for us over all. I agree that specializing in certain products would be a good idea for certain nations, but again, it needs to be looked at through a protectionist's eye to ensure that the other nation isn't producing their goods immorally, and that it truly benefits both nations. One problem with specializing is that we need to make sure that we are specializing in the right fields. If we specialize in a product that doesn't need very many people to work to produce it, and we start trading for a product that needs more people to produce it and get rid of the industry of the latter product type, we've lost jobs over all and that is bad for the economy. In fact, that is what has been going on when I pointed that more jobs were lost than gained through free trade previously. Rebuttal to Contention 2:My opponent argues that free trade here is basically good because it fosters competition on a global scale. However, this can also happen under protectionism, it just happen at the same scale and it happens in a way more beneficial to the country. For example, if, let's say we didn't have any protectionist measures for our trade. Then let's say we have a company producing product A. Let's say this company employs 100,000 workers. They then go overseas to produce it more cheaply in another country and those 100,000 jobs are lost. Now, because this happened, America can no specialize in another product, but let's say this product B only needs 50,000 more people to produce it as efficiently, quickly, and as equal in quality as product A. We then just lost a net 50,000 jobs. Allowing Free Trade to run rampant can cause this to happen. If, however, we had a protectionist policy for product A that America is going to specialize in that product instead of Product B, we would gain more jobs. Instead, it would be the reverse. Instead of company A going over seas, company B will. We lose 50,000 jobs, but gain 100,000 jobs with a net growth of 50,000. This is why Free Trade is problematic, and we need the right kind of competition to where it provides more jobs for us than it destroys. Protectionism allows for this. So yes, if we were to make the market small, it would be a problem. I have no qualms with what my opponent said here, however, we need to make sure that the companies who are providing the most jobs in America do not get out-competed by other companies overseas otherwise it will destroy jobs in America. We should, instead, have those companies expand, and have the companies that need less people to produce the product, die out and get the product through trade. Why voters should vote for meI would implore voters to vote for con because:1) Free Trade does in fact destroy more jobs than it creates, and I proved this through my sources above. My opponent didn't provide a source, and only mentioned it but I could not find this source they claim existed.2) Protectionism would prevent us from trading with countries that use slave, child labor, or pay their workers poorly, which is immoral.3) Protectionism would allow us to keep companies that employ more people here and the product that needs more people to create it could be protected to continue to be created in America in order to provide more jobs. It can be used to allow products that don't need a lot of workers to go over seas for a net-gain of employment. Free trade could lead to the opposite happening where the product that needs less workers to continue being made in America while the product that needs more workers would go out of America. My point in number 1 proves that we have products that need more people to create go overseas for production and the ones that need less workers stay here, which is how we lost jobs.4) My opponent rarely provided actual sources, and the ones they did mention were not as reliable as the scientific studies I provided on this matter.ThanksI thank pro for accepting this debate and offering a challenging debate.

We trade with countries that use Slavery, child labor, and/or pay their workers measly wages There are over 45 million slaves in the world still today[2] and China and India are countries with some of the most slaves today[3]. In addition, they both use child labor in production of their goods as well[4] They are countries the US trades with substantially: from China we buy more than 30 billion dollars worth of goods every month[5] and 3 billion dollars worth of goods each month from India [6]. Much of this could have been created from slave labor and child labor, and because we are trading with them, it is essentially permitting them to use slave and child labor. I argue we should not trade with any countries that use abominable work practices such as slave and child labor. In addition, many of the countries we trade with don't even pay their workers enough to survive off of. Free Trade hurts the jobs we have at home. While conservative-leaning economists argue that, in theory, \"Imports mean lost jobs only if we pretend we can make here all the things we import, the same way and for the same price,\" the evidence in reality shows the contrary, and: \"Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in U.S. industries more exposed to import competition...but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize. \"The study shows that the affected industries and regions 'have been hit hard and have not recovered. Workers in these industries and regions don't go on to better jobs, or even similar jobs in different industries. Instead, they shuffle from low-paid job to low-paid job, never recovering the prosperity they had before Chinese competition hit. Many of them end up on welfare. This is very different from earlier decades, when workers who lost their jobs to import competition usually went into higher-productivity industries, to the benefit of almost everyone.'\" [6] There is evidence we have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs due to trade with Mexico and Korea as well and the promised jobs that were supposed to be created never happened[7] In another study conducted by Jeffrey D. Sachs and Howard J. Shatz of Harvard University , it was found that trade has contributed to over the past 15 years, a \"sharp decline of overall employment in manufacturing; the widening of the income inequality between high-skilled and low-skilled workers; and the especially sharp decline in employment in low skill manufacturing sectors\" [8] I believe for these two main reasons, a level of protectionism is necessary for our trade with other nations Sources: [1] https://www.walkfree.org...

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for her argument. However, I think that it is worth noting, that based on the provided definitions, she has not described a free trade system, but a system with open trade. As she stated, free trade is \" trade based on the unrestricted international exchange of goods\" and that protectionism is \"Government actions or Policies that restrict international trade.\" I would like to add a definition for \"restrict,\" from the princeton dictionary. Restrict - \"\u2022place limits on (extent or access)\" Restrict does not mean to prevent altogether, but merely to have limits or rules on. Therefore, protectionism includes government actions which put restrictions on international trade, while not flat out preventing it. That means that even in a protectionist market, we can still have playstations and nintendos (though I prefer computer games). Common restrictions are basic safety requirements, and proper labeling. In a free market, with no governmental protection, companies are free to send whatever products that they wish to sell. This includes (but is not limited to), toys with lead based paint (without informing the customers that the toys have such paint), foods that may have come in contact with nuts or other ingredients which people may be deathly allergic to (without informing the public of those risks), or even untested medical drugs that god only knows what the side-effects are. It is also worth while to note, that customers can only make decisions based upon information that they know, which is why another protectionist policy, requiring product info to be available (like nutrition charts for foods) actually helps people figure out what they really want, so that competition is more consumer driver (as it is suppose to be in theory). So, all in all, are there some bad protectionist policies? Of course. Does that mean that all of them are bad? Of course not (that would be a logical fallacy). Since there are some cases where free trades is not valued above protectionism, the resolution should be rejected. Thank you,",

            "premise": "Three points can be derived from the opposition\u2019s argument: 1. Free trade is the only way to sell surplus. 2. Without free trade, the importer country will put unreasonable tariff barrier. 3. 1973 oil crisis is caused by the absence of free trade The first two points can be dismissed as false, while the third point is just absurd. Allow us to elaborate. Free trade doesn't moves international trading; instead it is the two things called the demand and supply. So, any country that has a product surplus should not be worry, because as long as there is a demand in international market, the commodity can be sold. If the demand is low, irrespective of free trade, the sale will not be high. This leads to the second point, where the opposition placed tariff into a wrong logic. It is important to see, that it is not the cost that counts in trade, but the profit, in exchange to the value. Tariff is not the burden of supplier, instead the customers bears it. It is true that customer can get a cheaper price from free trade, but it is not true that the supplier could get a higher profit margin. It is also not true, that because there is tariff the exporter will get lower margin. The profit margin is relatively the same, irrespective of tariffs. The tariff barrier from the importer country will only take the import product at a same or slightly more expensive price from the local product. A slightly more expensive price will not cease sales, because of one reason, the demand is there. The importer country will not put unreasonable tariff, also for another reason, demand. The country should make sure that it is affordable enough for the customer, so the national demand can be fulfilled. At last, regarding the point of the 1973 oil crisis, we do not found the idea on how free trade will make Arab still sold oil to Israel's ally during the war. If the opposition could prove this, we, willingly, will promote free trade as a path to world peace (poorer countries excluded).",

            "premise": "first I wanna say both of your arguments are plagiarised and that it is completely wrong and unjustified, now that I've said that I will begin by first arguing \"your\" points then go over my own. In cobos argument he says that free trade harms developing countries industries however protectionism first creates misunderstandings of international trade and second encourages waste of resources corruption and sloth I. protectionism creates a misunderstanding of international trade. \"Another variation of the cheap labor theme is level playing field wail. If by level the playing field critics of free trade mean cost differences, then what are they really calling for is and abolition of international trade because trade of any kind only takes place because of cost differences.\" \"the Australian Economy, the case for free trade restated\" Brooke's news, April 30 2007 (btw that's a cited source) protectionism is in all terms just a way of leveling the playing field how ever like in my cited source with out competition their can not be any international trade if we were a developing country who raised all imported goods then there would be no international trade with in our country and how is a country's over all society benefited when no trade is going on with in the country? II. Protectionism encourages waste of resources corruption and sloth this is from the same article above no need to recite it. \"The aim of tariffs is to raise imports to sufficiently high level as to encourage the production of more expensive domestic substitutes. In short living standards are lowered because tariffs cause an irrational allocation of resources; instead of resources being directed to their most valued use they are directed into less valued lines of production causing a net loss of economic welfare.\" In other words protectionism lowers living standards and causes the loss of a good economy in my case I showed how free trade benefits the economy and that a sound economy benefits societal welfare wit his case he is harming the standard of living and harms the economy and that in no way benefits societal welfare. I would like to tie his second arguments into my previous arguments, fist with protectionism we end up wasting vital resources like steel and coal second Frederic bastiat once said when goods do not cross borders soldiers will his second argument is that in times of war a country will need steel and coal in my opinion war is a waste of these resources and it protectionism leads to violence between countries so with it, there is more of a chance for war which is absolutely not beneficial to a society. First for all you debaters out there it is absolutely legal to run part of the resolution as your value criterion. and second my criterion is free trade and im saying that it upholds societal welfare and that is why it should be valued above protectionism. im not running free trade should be valued above protectionism as my vc no im just proving it with my case. with his argument against my criterion he says that the main goal of free trade is to maximize profits but its the same with protectionism. Protectionism makes it so much easier for monopolies to exist in this country, and all countries free trade creates competition and this prevents monopolies. monopolies are bad. that's is in the most simplest terms I can put it. monopolies mean that a ceo/company can control one industry in a country, meaning that it can raise prices for lower quality products. he says that fee trade begins monopolies but its not what starts them its protectionism by protecting a company in this case a domestic company it takes away the choices of citizens of that country to varieties simply because they can not afford them of their are plain and simply not allowed this creates a monopoly with in the country. so let me use his analogy here drug dealer a is a Mexican company, drug dealer b bases his operation in Houston drug dealer a use to have to lower prices to compete with drug dealer b for costumers but with protectionism isn't allowed to sell in Houston drug dealer b no longer worrying about drug dealer a lowers the quality of his um products? and then raises prices BING BANG BOOM MONOPOLY btw your analogy is so not beneficial to society (drugs are bad) any way you see that's how a monopoly begins now he says that free trade takes away jobs but as I proved in my case 5.6 million people are employed in this country by firms from a different country meaning that with out free trade 5.6 million people would be out of work here in the united sates I also said that another 40% of the population work for an exporting firm protectionism would make the cost of importing items skyrocket and that will harm the economy. protectionism is not in any way beneficial to society and I have proven this with my case that is why you should vote for the affirmative you should also vote that my case had the most reliable resources because I have not plagiarised a single word and have cited all of my sources vote for the affirmative if you value the total well being of an entire society. :}",

            "conclusion": "The United States Should Promote Free Trade",
            "premise": "I would like to thank lannan13 for accepting this debate. I. Free Trade and the US ConstitutionWhile the 18th and 19th centuries were characterized by stricter tariffs and trade embargos than are seen today, the integration of the states helped to foster free trade. In this way, the government has a responsibility by the constitution to promote free trade for its people. For reasons that I will explain more in my next argument, it is important that the government do this also. \"Delegates from the states sent to Constitutional Convention in 1787 put high priority on solving these problems of interstate trade. That\u2019s why the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress \u201cto coin money\u201d and forbids the states from printing or coining money; it forbids the states from erecting trade barriers and authorizes Congress 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.'\" My opponent may try to mention that Congress has the right to create tariffs and trade embargos by that quote from the constituion, but it is not required to do so.[1]\"By allowing the market to broaden, the integration of state economies had immense benefits. A uniform money removed the inefficiency of bartering different monies and the uncertainty of currency fluctuations. Elimination of trade barriers allowed the division of labor to develop unimpeded, thereby greatly increasing productivity by an efficient allocation of factors of production.\" In other words, the integration of the states under the constitution helped to alleviate shortages, and this leads into my next argument.[1]II. Free Trade Satisfies DemandNo country has everything it needs to survive, and all states have or produce something that gains them export money, or a comparative advantage. This means that every country has a necessity for imports that is balanced by exports. This fulfilles consumer demand that would otherwise go unresolved. Imports and exports create more competition in each country's marketplace, and this lowers prices and increases efficiency, which means that free trade is a net benefit to consumers, and therefore to the economy as a whole. All of the implications of this simple idea add up to a remarkable economic plan. For example consider that free-trade oriented economics have GDP-per-capitas of over 10 times higher than countries that aren't: \"According to the Cato Institute\u2019s 2004 report on Economic Freedom of the World, which measures economic freedom in 123 countries, the per capita gross domestic product in the quintile of countries with the most restricted trading was only $1,883 in 2002. That year\u2019s per capita GDP in the quintile of countries with the freest trading regimes was $23,938.\"[2]\"Of the 142 nations whose economies have been observed during this seven-year period, those that opened their markets the most grew twice as fast as those that opened them the least.\"[3]Free trade develops industries that are very helpful to the economy and to consumers: \"The rule of law is the first and most important institution fostered by free trade. In order to enforce contracts, prevent merchandise robbery and damage, and protect ships and their crews, trading countries need to establish a framework of objective rules under which free trade will be conducted. At the same time, those countries need to have a law enforcement mechanism to apply those rules, such as a police force and an independent judicial system. The proper functioning of these two institutions encourages individuals to initiate businesses and to sell, buy, and seize to the maximum extent the economic opportunities of free trade. A third institution fostered by free trade is the banking and financial system, which gives individuals access to credit and a place to save and keep their earnings. At the same time, financial instruments, like checks and money wiring, lower the transaction costs associated with trade. Today, the Internet and other telecommunication technologies have significantly reduced the cost of trading worldwide. The result is that more and more people are able to reap the benefits of trading with any nation around the world.\"[3]Likewise, free trade promotes innovations in infrastructure: \"Free trade also promotes the improvement and expansion of infrastructure. The construction of ports, where ships and airplanes can arrive and safely unload and load merchandise, must expand to accommodate free trade. Hangars and other types of barns located at ports offer the opportunity to store merchandise temporarily. At the same time, free trade fosters the construction and preservation of roads for trucks and automobiles to transport merchandise safely to its final destination.\"[3]\"Only on a free market where production is determined by consumer preferences can those preferences be satisfied to the greatest extent.\"[1]That's about the extent of my introductory argument. I'll have a lot more to say in the next two rounds when rebuttals and defense come, but I feel that my essential argument has been offered.

However, the reason why children are so anti-homework is because they want to avoid being told off. They simply don't understand that it is for their benefit. By being given a grade they can see how well they are doing, and can know how much more effort is required to get the final grade they seek. If grades were simply abolished, no-one would take homework seriously. The solution is to give students the option to get their homework graded by putting a sticker inside their book, or to place their work in a separate pile. They deserve respect. The only subject where grades should be compulsory is Maths because grading is mathematical, and a maths teacher can get students excited about getting their homework graded. I think most children would want their homework graded if they knew it was for their benefit, if they got low grades they would be more likely to ask for help. I look forward to your response",

PatentsContrary to popular belief, IP hinders innovation rather than encourages it. Patents can increase the amount of revenue an inventor would receive for a given idea, but this greater incentive does not necessarily translate into more ideas. Patents also discourage innovation by causing patent-holders to waste much of their time suing people who violate their monopoly rather than inventing. Patents also discourage innovation by restricting the ability of people to improve on existing ideas. Look at the invention of the steam engine. James Watt thought of the idea in 1768, but production didn't really start until 1775, when his monopoly was secured until 1800. Production was slow during those 25 years, and exploded afterwards, and when a superior steam engine was developed, Watt spent most of the 1790s suing its inventor. [1] Because of Watt's monopoly, innovation stalled during those years, with fuel efficiency, for example, stagnating during Watt's patent, but increasing by a factor of five by 1835. [2] This delay of innovation had serious consequences, as the industrial revolution only took off in England after Watt's patent expired and the industry could thrive. But would Watt have had the incentive to invent the steam engine if patents didn't exist? Yes. He actually made most of his money after his patent expired. He was forced to constantly innovate to keep up with the competition, and, as a result, his steam engines were recognized as the best ones and thus the best-selling.What about pharmaceuticals? Don't we need patents for those? No. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry grew much faster in countries were patents were fewer and weaker. The unprotected German industry, for example, grew much faster than the protected British industry, which is the opposite of what you'd expect if IP laws actually encouraged innovation. [3] And when countries did introduce patents, they saw no significant increase in innovation. Switzerland and Italy both had thriving pharmaceutical industries without IP laws, until they were introduced in the late 1970s. [4] Contrary to what one would expect if IP laws actually worked, neither country saw an improvement in pharmaceutical innovation. [4]2. Insider TradingHaving information that others don\u2019t have and acting on it is how all money is made in the stock market. If everyone knew that a stock was going to go up, you wouldn\u2019t be able to make money buying that stock\u2014the only way you can make money with your information is if other people don\u2019t know it. (If a stock was going from $10 to $100, and you knew it, you could make a profit buying now and selling later. But if everyone knew this was going to happen, no one would sell you their stocks at $10.) And people acting on this information that others don\u2019t have is a good thing. Everyone can\u2019t have universal knowledge\u2014knowledge is spread out over millions of people. The way this knowledge is communicated is through prices. Stock prices communicate knowledge about the health of firms. The more accurate these prices are, the better. Say Firm X is fundamentally insolvent, and is heading toward bankruptcy eventually. It\u2019s better for the economy if this happens sooner rather than later, so resources stop being wasted by the inefficient firm. That\u2019s where stock prices come in\u2014if they\u2019re low enough, some person or other firm could buy a controlling interest cheap and sell off the assets. So, it\u2019s better for the economy if speculators drive Firm X\u2019s price lower.What\u2019s the moral and economic difference between this and \u201cinsider trading\u201d? Nothing. Inside traders act on information that others don\u2019t have, which is no more unfair than anyone else in the stock market acting on information others don\u2019t have. And their actions communicate vital information to the market, like the actions of any other successful traders. By acting on accurate information, inside traders make stock prices more accurately reflect a firm\u2019s true value, and let capital be allocated more efficiently. They also lower the volatility of stock prices\u2014they buy low, making the low price higher, and sell high, making the peak price lower. Pro states that if insider trading happens too much, outsiders will \u201close confidence in the system\u201d and stop investing, lowering the amount of capital available for corporations. But he fails to provide any facts or evidence to support this assertion. Furthermore, the \u201coutsiders\u201d who trade with insider traders were going to trade anyway\u2014the inside traders didn\u2019t force outsiders to buy or sell their stocks, they just bought stocks people wanted to sell or sold stocks people wanted to buy anyway.

They were going to sell anyway, but because of my extra demand, they got $10 per share instead of $9.75. 3. ExternalitiesPro claims that \u201ca truly free market would not prohibit a party from maximizing its profits.\u201d\u2014so firms would be allowed to hurt people by dumping dangerous waste, and such. Of course, this is a ridiculous description of the free market. In the free market, you can only do what you want with your own private property if you respect the property rights of others\u2014this is why the government, which initiates force against person and their property, is not part of the market. Maximizing profits is only part of the market if you do it while respecting the property rights of others. Firms dumping waste on other people\u2019s land are not part of the market.Pro also claims that companies would dump waste in common lands. But the free market easily solves this problem\u2014with private property. There are only common lands if the government intervenes and makes them so. In a free market, these lands would be someone\u2019s private property, preventing corporations from dumping their waste on it if they didn\u2019t own the land. While air couldn\u2019t be owned, air pollution that damages the air someone breathes, or the property they use, would be a property rights violation, and thus impermissible in a market.Other cases of removing government intervention:War:War spending is terrible for most Americans. Resources, labor, and money are diverted from creating more goods that consumers want to creating destruction and death halfway around the world. Imagine how much better off Americans would be if they had an extra few hundred billion dollars, because the money for war spending wasn\u2019t stolen from them by the government.Corporate Welfare:As with war spending, billions is diverted from hard working Americans to special interests. Agribusiness alone gets around $180 billion annually from the government. [5][1] Carnegie, A. (1905), James Watt. Doubleday, Page & Co.[2] Lord, J. (1923), Capital and Steam Power. London: P.S.

            "discussionTitle": "Free trade agreements are more harmful than helpful",
            "conclusion": "Free trade agreements are more harmful than helpful",
            "premise": "Thank you Pro! I will argue that free trade has multiple advantages over protectionism. C1: Mutually Beneficial All countries will have a comparative advantage in producing some goods \u2013 when it has the lowest opportunity cost, according to David Ricardo\u2019s economic theory [1]. Although nations such as the United States may have an absolute advantage in both the production of corn and aircraft compared to Ethiopia, the United States \u2013 which has a rich capital stock \u2013 will have a comparative advantage in aircraft. If the USA tried to be self-sufficient, it would incur high opportunity costs (foregoing the production of plenty of aircraft). The USA would be better off trading aircraft (its comparative advantage) for corn (Ethiopia\u2019s comparative advantage). The USA will be better off, and so will Ethiopia, both nations will experience gains of trade from the specialization of labor. Free trade maximizes efficiency, and therefore prosperity, by allowing the private sector to productively allocate resources to where they generate the highest returns. C2: A Capital Surplus or Trade Surplus A nation may import more than they export (depending on the value of receipts). However, a trade deficit is entirely offset by a capital surplus. This is because although a nation may have a negative current account (trade deficit), it will be offset by a positive financial account (capital surplus). Either way, a nation benefits economically. To put it another way, the Chinese may have a trade surplus with the United States, but this surplus of dollars will have to be put back entirely in the U.S. economy, either through the purchase of U.S. goods or the purchase of U.S. assets (public or private). Those dollars are useless in China, which uses the yuan. C3: Economic Benefits Free trade allows nations and innumerable firms to compete. This competition spurs higher quality and cost-cutting to attract sales. Trade benefits the economy in many ways, including: Lower costs of production Technological innovation Economic development First, trade helps to expand production. Free trade will allow producers to minimize the cost of inputs, leading to lower costs of production (and thus lower prices). Second, trade spurs technological innovation. Firms must invest in R&D and develop cutting-edge products to be competitive. By opening the borders to trade, firms adapt or are dislocated. Trade allows national economies to grow and evolve technologically. Third, trade is crucial for economic growth. The foundation for any healthy economy includes institutions such as rule of law, property rights, freedom of contract, and open markets [2]. Free trade is a critical ingredient in economic freedom, and higher economic freedom is strongly linked to higher economic growth. C4: Benefits Consumers There are multiple advantages to free trade, and I have detailed several of them. An important fact to consider is that trade benefits consumers. Free trade spurs competition which leads to quality improvements and cost-cutting. This benefits consumers, which is why trade has increased the average American\u2019s paycheck by $2,000 a year [3]. When consumers have more affordable goods, they have more disposable income. This allows aggregate demand to increase. Tariffs impose high prices on consumers, which weakens aggregate demand and the economy. C4: Job Creation Comparative advantage will produce dislocation, but this churning will make the economy more efficient and ultimately more prosperous (through lower opportunity costs). This happened when the personal computer replaced the typewriter, when petroleum replaced kerosene, and when the automobile replaced horse-drawn carriages. Trade achieves the same effect, through consumer choice and the free flow of resources. A dynamic, innovative economy requires free trade. Free trade produces jobs in several ways: International investment Lowering prices Export-supported jobs First, trade leads to international investment. Nations where we have a trade deficit \u2013 say China \u2013 use their dollars to invest in the United States, either through FDI, investing in financial markets, or buying exports. Second, imports help keep prices down for American consumers. The $2,000 that Americans have in their paycheck helps spur consumer demand, savings and investment here in the United States. It is effectively a \u201ctax cut\u201d that stimulates our economy and job creation. Lower prices in the form of inputs can augment national economies as well. One source indicates that 80% \u201cof global trade takes place across global supply chains and within multinational corporations\u201d. Lower tariffs will make American firms more competitive and efficient at producing goods and services [8]. Thus, lower tariffs could help local industries grow and expand. Third, exports sustain millions of jobs. In 2012, 14% of U.S. GDP was accounted for by exports. This is the equivalent of over 11 million jobs. These jobs also pay higher. [9] [10] C5: Promotes Peace and Democracy First, trade fosters peace. There are dual reasons for this phenomenon, including: Cultural integration Economic incentives Trade brings on onrush of products across national borders. The Japanese wield iPhones, while they drink Coca Cola and browse on their personal computers with Windows software. Simultaneously, Americans drive Toyotas and Hyundai cars as we embrace South Korean video games. Trade brings people closer together. There are economic incentives with trade that also promote peace. The United States imports significant quantities of footwear, consumer durables, and steel. The Japanese also import vast amounts of fossil fuels and food. Globalization and free trade has brought nations and people closer and increasingly interconnected, which sows the seeds of peace and prosperity. Empirical data also validates this claim; a negative correlation has been established between free trade and conflict [6]. Second, trade promotes democracy. Trade also promotes peace and democracy. As national economies develop, a civil society evolves and the population becomes increasingly politically and economically aware. This link has been shown in Chile, South Korea, the former Soviet Union (glasnost), and increasingly China. Conclusion Economists have broad agreement \u2013 free trade is beneficial and a net gain for society. In fact, \u201c87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade.\u201d [5] There is also a logical argument for free trade. By allowing products to flow across national borders, competition spurs higher quality and cost-cutting, while incentivizing innovation and creativity. Consumers benefit from lower prices, economies become more efficient and produce high-quality, productive jobs, while nations bond and yield the fruits of trade through peace and international integration.

            "conclusion": "The U.S. Grading System should be challenged",
            "premise": "The grading scale has absolutely nothing to do with how an individual learns; therefore it should not be challenged. It is evident that all students are not great test takers which influence the outcome of the test. The grading scale is a method used to analyze a person's comprehension of recently covered content on an exam by giving them a A, B or possibly plus or minus grades. This scale is effective because everyone is graded the same way with emphasis on quantity. Having a grading scale allows us to become competitive with self as well as with others. If we had a combined grade of effort and knowledge we still would not be able to identify if the student actually learned concept, subsequently grading a student on effort would allow the child to have a so called easy life since they only have to demonstrate little effort. The grading scale allows a plethora of opportunities to exceed or fail whereas the purposed grading scale adheres more to emotions than concept. For instance NCSU has a small group communication and we are graded on our social learning but in a traditional manner. With the current grading system anything can be graded but we need to continue to grade on actual performance instead of other factors that will eliminate the traditional letter grade format. We need to continue to complete with self since that will be the primary reason as to why we will eventually outperform others.",

            "conclusion": "Free trade should be valued above protectionism",
            "premise": "Uil Spring 2011 Neg \"When goods are not allowed to cross borders, soldiers will\"- Frederic Bastiat. A country can only produce as efficiently as its cultural values, reflected in its business ethics and labor laws, allow. In a country such as the United States, productivity is limited to the extent that it does not involve child labor, long labor hours, forced labor, or unsafe working conditions. So what happens if a country does not have the same standards as we do? Well, they might produce the goods more efficiently, in a manner of speaking. The problem is the efficiency your consumers gain comes at the expense of the cultural value your buying power once maintained. Here's an illustration: lets say that a Chinese child laborer, henforth known as a (ccl) works for $.10 an hour, whereas a U.S laborer, known as a (usl) in the same field earns $8.00 an hour. Assuming the product is of the same quality, you can afford to hire up to 80 ccls for every one usl. Your efficiency is seemingly increased ten fold. Furthermore, if you wish to hire only 50 ccls, you might be able to get away with inferior production processes. Now your efficient only because, compared to the consumer culture you are infiltrating, you are a criminal. That is the problem with free trade: the countries that benefit from it most are the ones we should least want to support with our consumer dollars. When we do, we displace our cultural values within our society, at least to the extent of that singular product or service, with those of the provisionary society. This is why I must negate resolved: Free trade should be valued above protectionism. The value for today's debate shall be Sovereignty, which is a government position that is independent from foreign control or intervention and has the power to regulate its own affairs. The criterion that shall be used in conjunction with Sovereignty is Unilateralism, which is A tendency of nations to conduct their foreign affairs individualistically, characterized by minimal consultation and involvement with other nations, even their allies. I offer the following definitions for clarity in today's round: Free Trade- - an economic concept referring to the selling of products between countries without tariffs or other trade barriers. From American Heritage. Protectionism- - the economic policy of promoting favored domestic industries through the use of high tariffs and other regulations to discourage imports. From wordiq.com Contention 1: Free trade is bad for a society; it denies basic human rights Chinese workers are denied the right to form unions, are often paid less than China's own very low minimum wage, and are denied overtime pay. But if free trade is bad for labor, then we should end it, not patch it up, as fundamental economic defects are too profound for a few labor agreements to fix. Free trade is not fair trade; it benefits strong nations at the expense of weaker ones, and rich interests at the expense of the rest of us. Available evidence shows that Africa's economy is experiencing increasing and serious deterioration in terms of trade, despite tremendous efforts deployed by its governments to reorganize and restructure their economies, often at a very high social cost. Trade liberalization has worked to undermine the comparative advantages that Africa might have had, aggravating their development problems and leading to the abuse of labor standards and human rights. Contention 2: Protectionism is the better alternative for a country, rather then Free Trade. Protectionism means a nation looks at its economy as one of its assets. A government will make industrial, production and trade policies designed to ensure the nation's economic success. This could allow a country to develop economically. Japan was a good example in the aftermath of World War Two. The term Made in Japan, was considered a bad thing to put on a product. Then they started making the best electronics, and cars. They quit being a big joke. In our country we have, at least in the past, considered it important that workers make a minimum wage, that children go to school instead of entering the workforce at an early age, and that prisoners, especially political prisoners not be forced to work for literally pennies a day, if they get paid at all. We buy a lot of products from countries that don't have such protections. We pay less for them, but we jeopardize our economy. We buy shirts, athletic clothing and shoes from countries that use child and prisoner labor and have no minimum wage. Corporations are there to make money, not to have a moral conscious. They go where they can maximize profits, no matter what the costs to their country. A protectionist policy would keep products out from countries that unduly exploits its labor, uses child labor or prisoner labor. While we would pay higher prices, we would also have the additional money to afford them. We would have a healthy economy based on a strong manufactoring base.",

Maybe you don't understand the point of this debate. 9/11 (September 11, 2001) was not an inside job(meaning the U.S. government is not responsible nor did they commit, take part in, have knowledge of). Rather the terrorists who are not members of our government committed these attacks (flew planes in to the world trade center, pentagon, and crashed a plane in Pennsylvania). The argument is: \"This attack was perpetrated by outside foes\" You agree with this. you said: <<...Whatever group formulated the plan, which was probably Al-Quaeda...>> -You haven't shown anything, but only agreed that terrorists committed the attacks on 9/11.

Some argue that the world's only superpower need not be tied down by the constraints of the multilateral system. They claim that US sovereignty is compromised by international rules, and that multilateral institutions limit rather than expand US influence. Almost none of the trade issues facing the US today are any easier to solve unilaterally, bilaterally or regionally. The reality is probably just the opposite. It is because I agree with the Director-General of the World Trade Organization Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi that I must stand resolved, and affirm that free trade should be valued above protectionism. I offer the following definitions for today's round: \u2022Free trade - Free trade is the unhindered flow of goods, services labor and capital between countries. It is carried out with very little or without government intervention measures that give domestic firms, households or factors of production an advantage over foreign ones. \u2022Should - used in auxiliary function to express obligation, propriety, or expediency. \u2022Protectionism - Government actions and policies that restrict or restrain international trade, often done with the intent of protecting local businesses and jobs from foreign competition. Typical methods of protectionism are import tariffs, quotas, subsidies or tax cuts to local businesses and direct state intervention. Stability is the highest value to look to in today's round. With rampant unrest in the Middle East and elsewhere, massive economic meltdowns, and weighty devastation of the environment causing mass concern for people around the world, stability, or the property of a body that causes it when disturbed from a condition of equilibrium or steady motion to develop forces or moments that restore the original condition, is something almost universally desired. The side which produces the greatest amount of stability should win today's round. The best criterion for determining stability in today's round is by Promoting the Free Trade Model. The free-trade model is very simple to understand: put simply, it states that countries export products that use their abundant and cheap resources, and import products that use their scarce resources. Contention I: Preserving the WTO Holds Significant Benefits The most important part of promoting the free trade model is that it keeps the World Trade Organization running. The World Trade Organization, herein referred to as the \"WTO\" was founded in 1995 to promote and regulate trade, and also to mitigate conflicts between its 183 member nations (out of 196 nations around the world, leaving just 13 nations). These are several significant benefits to keeping the World Trade Organization: A.Conflict Resolution Bryan Mercurio of the University of New South Wales writes that though a regional system \u2013 protectionism \u2013 has certain short term benefits, the long-term effects of a fragmented system, lesser growth, and less poverty reduction are too poignant to ignore. Mercurio also suggests that with a collapse of the WTO \u2013 which we know will happen without a free trade model around the world \u2013 large countries would prey on the weakness of smaller ones, and cause large-scale conflicts worldwide. This is because the WTO has strong mitigation powers that keep large countries in check. The ability of conflict resolution is reason enough to preserve the WTO, but there are others. B.Environmental Policy According to Phillipe Legrain, WTO advisor, the WTO allows governments to protect human, animal, and plant life so long as it is not disguised protectionism. Also, the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture allows for the development of non-trade concerns like food security and environmental protection. Further, by fostering trade, the WTO promotes economic growth, which Legrain claims is the generally good for the environment and leads to long-term development. Without these measures by the WTO, it is likely that environments would be devastated for the purposes of short-term sustainability, which would essentially be economic suicide for the countries of the world. Once again, we see that the WTO is necessary. C.Cooperation Mr. Panitchpakdi, from whom I draw my quote, states that the WTO's involvement in multilateral actions is key to fostering cooperation, which nations like the United States the United Kingdom desperately need. Terrorism, poverty, health, and greater global involvement are both economic and social concerns, and are next to impossible to solve unilaterally. Multilateral action through WTO-fostered cooperation is a better means to accomplish these problems. Without the WTO, it would be more difficult for nations to cooperate because they would be lacking a central mitigatory force, allowing for the rampant rule of mega-corporations in the global market. Unilateral action, resulting in inevitable failure, would ensue. This must be avoided for both economic and social reasons. Contention II: The Ideology of the Model Has Important Consequences Peter Yu of Michigan State University discusses in an article the implications of a new trade policy between the United States and China. Essentially, he states that implementing a coercive policy \u2013 convincing countries to do things by threatening trade sanctions \u2013 is poor policy, not only because it's anti-free trade, but also because it holds the threat of starting a global trade war. This small change in the grand scheme of the free trade model may seem insignificant, but it has the potential to erupt global war. Even putting the WTO aside, it is imperative that the world continue to rely on the free trade model to ensure stability and prevent the outbreak of mass war. Contention III: Protectionism Creates a Welfare State Empirical evidence shows that the flip side of trade liberalization is a social welfare state, says D. Rodrik of the International Economy Institute. Rodrik states that globalization, as he calls it, has two major effects. First, it erodes the desire for free trade, and leads to more protectionist policies. Also, it expands what is called external risk. Countries that participate in globalization \u2013 which is noneconomic \u2013 are more susceptible to external risk, and therefore demand and receive more shelter from the variability of the global markets; this in turn leads to the creation of countless new social welfare programs. As we well know, social welfare programs bankrupt the economy and have the potential of bringing about the next great depression. Once again, keeping the free trade model and limiting protectionism is better for stability, not only at the international level, but on the individual national level as well. For these reasons, I urge an affirmative ballot.",

            "premise": "D1. Rights of businesses According to your own logic, any person or business with means has the right to trade with terrorist organizations. Should this be allowed? No. Terrorist organizations want to destroy the United States. The United States government has the right to place embargo's on countries as Congress has the power to regulate commerce. An embargo is nothing more than a regulation on commerce. As for Venezuela, Cuba has a one party-communist system. Venezuela has a multi-party system (in fact, in 2006 36% of the vote was for Manuel Rosales). Hugo Chavez while criticized was elected in a democratic manner. The blockade is still the only leverage we hold over Cuba. If the United States can starve one dictatorship is that not better than starving no dictatorships? D2) Nationalized Economy This is not a transition period. It is an attempt to boost the dormant Cuban economy. The housing \"market\" (if you want to call it a market there is no real market) is still partly under government control as people can own only two houses at most, people have to go through the central bank in order to make a transaction, etc. And I pose this question to my opponent, there are hundreds of countries in the world. Only one has an embargo on Cuba, the United States, why can't Cuba trade with other countries \" to drive new cars\" the United States does get most of its cars from foreign countries? It is because of Cuba's governmental policy that Cuba's economy is so bad. Not the United States. D3) Castro But, they still have this policy of hating the United States and a Cuban-Iranian Alliance is already in the works. (1) It just is not fully implemented because Cuba really has nothing to offer Iran. Why should the USA allow Cuba to give the Iranians an incentive to become a permanent MILITARY alliance? A wise man once said \"always expect the worst, and you will never be disappointed.\" This applies to everyday life. Once the Castro's die whose to say that there will not be a Stalin of Cuba? Someone more oppressive could come into power. In the world of foreign affairs and international relations, ambassadors and presidents ALWAYS expect the worst outcome that way you can plan for this outcome. If you expect the world will be good, you WILL not plan for the bad because, in your mind, there is no bad. In foreign affairs, you must expect the worst. In this case, the worst case scenario is a second Cuban missile crisis, my question for my opponent is: because there is a possibility of ending a trade embargo with Cuba resulting in a second missile crisis should the leaders of the United States of America, whose sole purpose is to the people of the United States, end the embargo on Cuba when there is the rather large possibility of harm? D4) Negotiations Why should we negotiate at all? What is the United States incentive? R1) Out of date Embargo I will reiterate, \"always expect the worst, and you will never be disappointed.\" In other words, plan for the worst, and with Cuba, the United States definitely should. There IS an Iranian-Cuban alliance in the making, with an added American trade influx all this will do is increase Iran's incentive to want to create a permanent military alliance. R2) Benefit You say potential for friendship. I say potential for harm. Allowing Cuba to modernize their infrastructure, and modernize their military only increases Iran's incentive to want to create a permanent military alliance with Cuba. Expecting Pro's outcome is many times more dangerous than expecting Cons. R3) Ideas \"The Cuban internet is among the most tightly controlled in the world. A special permit is required to use the Internet and all e-mails are intricately monitored.\" (2) Cuba controls ALL radio broadcasts, all newspapers, the entire Internet and all entertainment. (2) How exactly is opening trade with Cuba going to change this? It will not. People in Cuba cannot access any sites which are pro capitalism, people in Cuba cannot access sites such as Twitter or Facebook. A majority of people cannot even legally use the Internet. Opening trade with Cuba does not change this. *Opening trade with Cuba == a large chance of harm coming to the United States *The Embargo has a reason to exist *The Cuban leaders are causing the Cuban people's economic hardship *Cuba is closely tied to Iran and anti-American countries The blockade on Cuba should stay in place.

            "conclusion": "Teachers should not be allowed to have philosophical questions graded",
            "premise": "I would like to thank PRO for instigating this debate. However, I would like to caution them against Shifting the Burden of Proof. It rests upon PRO to argue for the truth of the resolution. Moving forward. The resolution states that, \"Teachers should not be allowed to have philosophical questions graded.\" A better phrasing for this resolution is, \"Teachers should not be able to grade answers to philosophical questions.\"Being a college student, I could not disagree more with this statement, and I shall provide a few reasons why. The primary reason is that, in generally, these grades are given in relation to the support given for the answer provided by the student. This means that simple, one-word Yes-No answers are not going to be worth much. Multiple--choice questions (in the traditional A-B-C-D, True-False, or Matching) do not need any defense. In general, there is only one correct answer. Although, sometimes, more than one answer can be argued for, either due to ambiguity of the question, or information provided by the teacher counter to the \"correct' answer, or even teacher disagreement with the phrasing of the question. The reasons are innumerable, however, it should be obvious that with these questions, there is little to no variability. If \"A. Recognition\" is the answer to \"Multiple questions qualify as what form of memory?\" then it is the only answer. However, if this same teacher has a question \"Are our experiences related more to our genetics or our environment?\", the answers could be quiet varied, and even oppositional. This is a question that psychologists have been discussing for quite some time, and some argue that it is our nature that dictates our actions, while others argue it is our nurturing that dictates our actions. Psychology, as a subject, is more uncertain than certain. Subjects like math, science, and any of their variations are often quite certain. Subjects like language arts, psychology and theology are much less certain. It is primarily in these such classes, where uncertainty is much more prevelant than certainty, that teachers will add on a \"Why?\" or \"...and explain\" to the end of the free response questions that they ask, though sometimes the more certain subjects do this as well. In language arts classes, and some theology classes, textual evidence is almost a requirement to effectively answer the question. It is for this reason that it makes more sense for teachers to grade philosophical free response questions. Multiple choice questions, in any form, are almost always effectively answered. Barring the arguable questions and answers provided with and to them, multiple choice questions do not have much variability to the answers that can be correct, and the reasons as to why they are correct. Free response questions are much more complex. Even in classes which focus on statistical analysis, free response questions are graded based on effective answers. When you begin discussing the truly uncertain, like philosophical things (such things as whether or not we have souls, what makes men and woman act as they do, why race is or is not an issue, and other such questions), you necessarily enter a realm where support must be given, otherwise you have not effectively answered the question. All opinions can be supported, even those based upon bias and prejudice, and this is generally the thought process behind grading free response questions. When grades to free response questions are viewed through a lens of effectiveness analysis (meaning the teacher is grading the student based on their ability to answer effectively), then we understand why teachers actually should grade such questions. We can then understand why some students do not recieve high grades on questions that are based on opinion. Those open ended, free-response questions that teachers provide normally do have too many possible answers, and often times no \"correct\" answer. Being that multiple choice questions have the capacity to be guess-and-check or guess-and-pray, other forms of questioning must be utilized. These other, normally open-ended questions, can not be said to have a \"correct answer\". If the question, \"Who is the true hero of Faulkner's As I Lay Dying?\", then students' opinions will differ greatly. Now, if we assume that free response questions are given to test something other than recognition memory (as multiple choice questions do), and can not have correct answers. what are we left with? We are left with also assuming that teachers need to grade something outside of the correctness of the answer. This something else generally falls in the realm of support. Whether in essays, test free-response questions, or even every-day discussion, supporting an opinion with reasons and evidence leads to a more effective answer to a question than not supporting that opinion with reasons and evidence.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should have a general policy of free trade.",
            "premise": "Pro argues that a survey of \"83 responders\" in 2006 is evidence that free trade is agreed to by the majority. But Pro's sample is unrepresentative and outdated. In March 2012, Harvard economist Dani Rodrik writes that, in \"real surveys with representative samples,\" \"respondents favor trade restrictions by a two-to-one margin.\" [7]Pro sometimes argues against particular protections. But to the few arguments I made for protections, Pro offers no counter. Pro does not even mention my argument for balancing trade via Buffet's \"import certificates.\"Peace and Human RightsWar is waged regardless of trade policy, usually on ideological grounds. Britain has fought more wars than any other nation, sometimes openly with the aim of imposing free trade on reluctant nations (that's how Hong Kong became British). Post-WWII Japan has been blatantly protectionist, but has had a more peaceful foreign policy than free trading America. The U.S. is also the biggest terrorist target, regardless of its free trade policy.In The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein exposes free trade and its relation to human rights violation. Besides some obvious examples like South Africa and China, she provides the US-backed Pinochet regime in Chile: by the early 80s, the Milton Friedman-prescribed policies had led to a huge \u201ccrisis of corruption,\u201d \u201crapid de-industrialization, a tendfold increase in unemployment and an explosion of distinctly unstable shantytowns.\u201d The only way to keep free trade going was human rights abuse.Comparative AdvantagePro claims that \"progress of all types leads to displacements,\" and that \"lost jobs\" from free trade are simply the displacement of \"jobs to competitive industries.\"Pro's reasoning is dubious. Pro assumes workers can move easily between industries. If they can't, imports won't push a nation's economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage. Instead, imports will just kill off existing industries and leave nothing in its place. There are workers without the right skills or who don't live in the right place to move between industries -- those will be left unemployed.The problem is compounded because of relatively low minimum wage and hire-and-fire labor laws in the United States. As a result, we often see a decline not only in the quantity of jobs but in the quality of jobs. We see $28 an hour ex-autoworkers making $8 at a video rental store. Economist Robert Skidelsky argues that this is what happened in Russia: \"about one million scientists have moved into non-intellectual occupations since 1991.\" [8] In Moscow, there were physics PhD's who were driving taxis. The human cost is obvious, but there is an economic one as well: when skills that cost money to acquire (for example, physics) are never used again, the economy negates large investments in human capital.These losses put the whole economy at risk. As Yale economist and Nobel Laureate James Tobin famously put it, \"it takes a heap of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap.\" A Harberger triangle is the area in a supply and demand diagram that measures the loss of taxation (plainly, these are the benefits of free trade). An Okun gap is the loss in output and employment when the economy falls below potential. Tobin's point is that the benefits of free trade are small compared to the huge cost of not running our economy at full capacity due to imports and lost jobs.Trade DeficitsPro admits that trade deficits are bad. Pro also concedes the results of studies proving the possibility of a better U.S. economy if we end deficit trading. Pro insists trade deficits are not related to free trade, and completely ignores the fact that free trade allows deficit trading to happen in the first place. Let me go through the logic step-by-step: 1) Nations engage in trade2) One cannot get goods for free3) When the value of imports is not covered by the value of exports, nations must make up the difference by sellling their assets or assuming debt.4) Free trade allows trade deficits.The correct trade policy is to end free trade by pragmatically balancing trade. If the United States adopts a policy of free trade, then government allows deficit trading. Pro agrees the consequences of deficit trading are unacceptable. Pro understands that, when a nation exhausts its ability to sell assets and assume debt, it ends up poorer than it would have been if it had not had free trade to begin with. The U.S. prefers short-term consumption as opposed to long-term variety. Americans consume more than they produce, maximizing imports by assuming debt and selling assets. The evidence is not subtle, including a staggering net foreign ownership of $3.5 trillion in American assets and an ever-increasing debt.Pro claims the federal deficit is independent of trade deficit. No. When trade deficits produce debt, the U.S. pays interest on that debt, which is calculated as part of the federal deficit. Pro argues that our trade deficit is a savings problem in disguise. Pro misunderstands the hard economics, and assumes that the arithmetic relationship between trade deficits and saving rates is a causal one. In national income accounting, our savings are the excess of our production over our consumption. Trade deficits are the exact opposite, occurring when we consume more than we produce. We can see clearly that saving rates and trade deficits are exactly the same thing expressed in a different way. There is no causal relation between the two. The decision to eat a cookie does not cause the decision to not save the cookie -- it is the same decision. ExternalitiesFree trade cannot account for negative and positive externalities. Because environmental damage is not factored into equations, free trade encourages pollution when it offers a cost advantage. There are other externalities like technological spillover. Pro offers no response.CompetitionPro claims that non-competitive industries will be discontinued in favor of \"high-tech\" competitive industries. It turns out that airlines, which are Pro's single well-chosen example, is the only \"high-tech\" good the U.S. is a net exporter of. [9] The U.S. is a net importer of every other high-tech good, including spacecraft. This raises the question of where the jobs have gone? Pro does not give any evidence of new jobs or increased income from free trade. How can the U.S. cover the cost of imports? There are three options: increasing the price of exports, selling assets, or borrowing on credit. The first dramatically raises the price of domestic goods; the other two produce a trade deficit. Either way, consumers and workers lose. Income InequalityPro misunderstands the Stolper-Samuelson theorem and its results. It says that, as a result of free trade, people who draw most of their income from returns on capital (the rich) gain, while people who get most of their income from labor (the rest of us) lose. Because the U.S. has more capital per person, and fewer workers per dollar capital than the rest of the world, free trade tends to hurt American workers. For skilled jobs, foreign labor is just as expensive as American labor, so there is no impact on American wages. The occupations that suffer are those whose products are easily produced by cheap labor abroad. This includes most blue-collar jobs, which accounts for the majority of U.S. workers. This means that even if free trade performs in other respects (it doesn't), it would still leave most Americans with lower incomes. And even if it increased our economy overall (it doesn't), it would still unfairly increase poverty and income inequality.EvidencePro claims I have no evidence. Besides other examples like Chile, take Pro's example of Brazil: from 1987 to 2005, it was found that trade liberalization contributed to poverty and inequality in urban areas where the rich now live side-by-side with Third World squalor.

            "premise": "This debate is created purely to help me get ready for LD district. Thank you: UIL Spring 2011 Aff Free trade is efficient. Think about your own home. You could become self-sufficient and grow your own food and make your own furniture. But in most cases, you'll be better off spending the same amount of time working at whatever your best at, earning the money to buy these goods from experts at producing them, and having plenty left over for other goods. I ask you judge(s), \"would you make something when you could buy it cheaper from outside your home\"? The same applies to states. Alaska could spend lots of money on hothouses and grow oranges and banana's, and become self-sufficient. But it's far better for Alaska to specialize in oil, and use the wealth it gains to import oranges and bananas from Florida, which has the weather for it. What's true of state borders is just as true for international ones. It makes more sense for Americans to work in businesses in which they excel, and use this wealth to trade for goods in which other countries excel. Because of these reasons, today I must affirm the resolved: Free trade should be valued above protectionism. The standing value for today's debate is societal good, which is taking action for the good or advancement of a society as a whole. The criterion that shall be used in conjunction with societal good is the law of comparative advantage, which declares that every nation can improve its economic position by specialzing in the most efficient product lines available to them. I offer the following definitions for clarity in todays round: Free trade- an economic concept referring to the selling of products between countries without tariffs or other trade barriers. From American Heritage Protectionism- the economic policy of promoting favored domestic industries through the use of high tariffs and other regulations to discourage imports. From wordiq.com Contention 1: Free Trade promotes Peace and prosperity. Each person has a natural right to be free from arbitrary interference. Trade barriers disrupt voluntary and mutually beneficial activities. Protectionist policies reduce social harmony. Free trade breaks down barriers and the narrowness of provincialism, increases tolerance, and encourages friendly relations. Voluntary exchange counteracts nationalistic tendencies and replaces parochial attitudes with a global perspective. Trade requires one to understand the customs of the people he is trading with. Free trade is about peace. The removal of trade barriers would help the cause of universal peace and minimize conflicts around the world. When trade is free, consumers gain from the products of other countries and friendships and trust develop. Third world countries are helped through free trade. By removing our trade barriers, we can give private firms in third world nations easier access to our markets. If our government placed tariffs or trade barriers, then the countries would not be able to buy as much from us. Not only will the residents of these nations have the chance to develop new industries and expand their existing ones, their contract with peopke from free nations have the chance to develop new industries and expand their existing ones, their contract with people from free nations will promote the recognition of human rights and worker rights all over the world. Contention 2: Protectionism undermines prosperity. A: Protectionism weakens U.S industries Hiding behind trade barriers has not even proven to be good for the protected industries in the long run. Protected sectors tend to grow weaker and less competitive when shielded from competition. High trade barriers have not \"saved\" the domestic textile, apparel, footwear, and other low-end manufacturing secters from long-term decline and lost jobs. Higher domestic prices forced on consumers also dampen demand and promote substitutes, shrinking the domestic market. B: Protectionism ultimately leads to economic collapse. From a Washington Post article, Jan 28, 2009; Once an engine of global growth, trade is already set to decline by 2% in 2009, according to the World Bank. It could collapse all together if countries start shutting out one another's goods in a short-sighted effort to salvage domestic industries. The United States started one such trade war in 1930, when it enacted a tariff increase that prompted European retaliation-thus helping turn a bad recession into the Great Depression. Better to learn from this history than repeat it. Contention 3: Free Trade minimizes threats to World problems. A. Poverty is the main cause of destruction. Unfortunately, not every nation can afford to protect the enviroment in the ways that the United States does. According to John A. Charles at Cascade Policy Institute. \" A recent report by the World Trade Organization reinforces these points. The report concludes: One reason why enviromental protection is lagging in many countries is low incomes. Countries that live on the margin may simply not be able to afford to set aside resources for pollution abatements. If poverty is the core of the problem, economic growth will be part of the solution\". These countries don't have the money to protect the enviroment and they don't have the technology to know that they are destroying the enviroment. Not to mention the growing population of these countries is polluting large amounts of water and land because of human waste. B. Free Trade offers the superior solution to Poverty From Daniel Griswold at Cato Institute. \"How do we expect hundreds of millions of people to pull themselves out of poverty if we do not allow them access to global Markets? It is morally and economically incoherent to denounce global poverty and sweatshops one moment and to denounce imports from and foreign investment to the very same countries where the poor people actually live.\" We cannot continue to let countries limit trade like they do if we want any sort of future for ourselves and our children. From Douglas Irwin, Dartmouth College. \"Countries that restricted foreign trade and investment may have avoided foreign exploitation, but remained desperately poor nonetheless. Meanwhile, international trade created opportunities that in fact promoted development and reduced poverty. Many countries that encourage trade did not remain stuck producing just raw materials, but began exporting an increasing array of labor-intensive manufactured goods.\" If these countries opened their trade to all nations and allowed foreign exploitation, it would actually benefit these countries economically and allow them to stand up on their feet and start to contribute large quantities of money to environmental protection, which leads to my next point. C. Enviromental threats are best adressed through poverty reduction From Bjorn Lomborg, political science, University of Aarhus, Denmark. \"We have grown to believe that we are faced with an inescapable choice between higher economic welfare and a greener environment. But, Surprisingly\u2026environmental development ofter stems from economic development\u2014only when we get sufficiently rich can we afford the relative luxury of caring about the environment\" The priority of the rich is to secure their future and the main threat to their future is the destruction of the environment. This is why people with little economic worries would help the poor by allowing free trade.",

            "premise": "Comparative AdvantageCon quotes economist Krugman [Con's ref 1, C1] that trade reduces the wages of many in the U.S. So is Krugman opposed to free trade? Krugman says, \"So am I arguing for protectionism? No. Those who think that globalization is always and everywhere a bad thing are wrong. On the contrary, keeping world markets relatively open is crucial to the hopes of billions of people.\" [C1] Krugman is arguing that dislocations should be ameliorated by government. As a leftist, he argues that welfare should be given to displaced workers; right-wingers generally argue that aid should be given in retraining.Krugman said that \"perhaps most\" workers in the U.S. might have reduced wages. That cannot be squared with over 80% of workers being in industries not subject to foreign competition. Moreover, trade effects are transient. Consider those workers sewing underwear in North Carolina. Foreign competition puts competitive pressure on the business, driving he wages of underwear sewers down. What happens is that the economy reacts to move capital from labor intensive textile manufacturing to other areas. In North Carolina, pharmaceuticals and high tech were alternatives. Government attempts to support non-competitive textiles prolong the dislocation.Con claims that there is growing consensus among economists that the theory of comparative advantage is wrong. Really? I provided data that over 90% of economists agree the theory is correct. The 9% who do not agree are not a consensus, and there is no evidence their numbers are growing. Paul Krugman agrees with Milton Friedman the theory is valid.Free trade leads to displacements. Progress of all types leads to displacements. Computer printers have destroyed the market for typewriters, displacing all the workers who made typewriters. The remedy for the displacements by progress or by free trade is the same: shift jobs to competitive industries. Germany has a positive trade balance, and much of their positive balance is from manufactured goods. The Germans manufacture things that require high levels of worker skill.U.S. Trade DeficitsThe reasons that the U.S. runs chronic trade deficits include: A policy of unlimited immigration of unskilled labor with tight restrictions on skilled labor A basic education system that provides high school graduates who cannot read well or do mat A higher education system with students who spend on 14 hours a week studying [10. http://www.boston.com...] and in which useful professions are downplayed in favor of liberal arts A policy of not developing oil resources; despite having three times the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia [11. http://articles.mercola.com...], we choose to import rather than export An entitlement system so pervasive that for many people work is optional Government overspending that takes capital out of productive enterprise Protectionism solves none of these policy problems. These are policies that inevitably lower wages. High tariffs make matters worse by subsidizing inefficient production. Comparative advantage is always beneficial, but to yield strong positive trade balances government policies must favor a first-world economy, and they do not.Con points to the Federal budget deficits as a looming problem and attributes the problem to free trade. Not one penny of the Federal deficit is owed as payment for goods or services bought from outside the United States. The Federal deficit is due entirely to the Federal government spending more than it takes in, not buying foreign goods. The deficit is indeed a monstrous problem, but wild deficits are run independent of free trade policies. Con complains that half of the traded government debt is owned by foreigners. (The non-traded debt is basically money the government creates.) the government could refuse to let foreigners buy Treasuries, That would dramatically raise interest rates because all the money would have to be sucked out of the U.S. economy as government competes with private industry for the available capital.Con claims I agreed that free trade caused the deficits. I did not. In what Con references I cited the size of the trade deficit to the total economy. The Federal deficit is not a part of that equation.Con sites several studies that claim that the economy would have grown much faster if there were no trade deficits. The studies only assert that having deficits is bad, which is true. However, protectionism would make the economy worse than it now is rather than better. By illustration, if we all agree that tornadoes are bad, that does not endorse buying an expensive magic amulet to ward them off. Tornadoes would remain bad and we would be out still more money. That trade deficits are bad is an argument for fixing the list of policies that make the country less competitive. The Germans do it; we choose not to.Con argues that the US exports substantial quantities of non-renewable resources. He must be referring to out vast oil exports. No wait, we are importing oil. We export lots of timber. That's renewable. So what?No one likes pollution, not even Communists. Prosperity from trade provides the money to fight it.Con argues that if the price of imports go down, the price of exported goods must go up. If so, then if we import underwear then the price of airliners, a major export, must go up. That's not true because the airliner market is competitive just like the underwear market. We are better off because we can compete more profitably in the airliner market, not because the prices rise. In fact, prices for airliners drop because a competitive market forces innovation and efficiency, while protected industries languish. that's why Hindustani Motors did not prosper and Toyota did.Counter theoriesCon's later references [C5. C6] work from a wrong scenario. They assume that if cheap goods are allowed in domestic manufacturers must lower wages to compete. That makes the evil manufacturers richer, because they pay lower wages, but the larger number of worker suffer from lower wages. The error is that manufacturers do not continue in non-competitive industries, they abandon them in favor of competitive industries. Textiles are discontinued in favor of pharmaceuticals, or whatever. Data supporting the erroneous theory can be mined from industries in the process of being phased out. The textile industry does not die overnight in the face of foreign competition. Typically governments try to keep them alive with various tax subsidies and public expenditures. During that time the workers will have the lower wages. manufacturers will be on an upward trend as capital is moved to more profitable domestic or overseas operations. Our government should get ahead of the changes. America's future is not in sewing underwear. Anticipating the long term outcome, policies of education and taxation should be aimed at aiding transition. Or at least government could not fight it.Trade promotes peaceFree trade benefits both sides of the trading partnership. \"... in 1748, Baron de Montesquieu observed that 'Peace is the natural effect of trade. Two nations who differ with each other become reciprocally dependent; for if one has an interest in buying, the other has an interest in selling; and thus their union is founded on their mutual necessities.'\" [11. http://www.csmonitor.com...] Con offered no counter.EvidenceIt's easy to catalog examples of free trade working, as Friedman did. If the theory were wrong, then Hong Kong and Singapore should be failures, and China better off in Maoist trade isolation. Con avoids discussing the great and numerous examples. Academicians instead focus on the U.S. economy and try to make a case that the failures from wrong policies in education and government are somehow due to free trade.",

China may not need US trade, but it does value it and this gives a chance for American standards of liberty, democracy and human rights to be promoted within the country. US films, music, magazines and computer games are all popular in China, and these all spread a message of personal freedom and autonomy which undermines the authoritarian values of the regime. Personal interaction between American and Chinese citizens is also valuable in promoting democratic values and the concept of human rights, whether these are through business links, tourism or education (tens of thousands of Chinese students study at US universities each year). All of these contacts would be severely reduced if trade sanctions were put in place.",

            "conclusion": "Schools should give grades",
            "premise": "As this is the final speech, I will not be presenting any new arguments. I will only summarize the existing debate and argue for why I deserve to win. First, let me briefly refute Con's arguments from Round 4: 1. \"...the resemblance between schools and the workplace is a coincidence.\" More or less, I agree with you. While some schools may be entirely coincidental, I would still maintain that others (e.g. trade schools) do focus on preparing their students for the real world. 2. \"...you are contradicting yourself [on the purpose of grades]...\" Let me reconcile my two statements. While grades do mostly serve an administrative role, they also simultaneously function as a motivator for most students. After all, what driven student doesn't want an \"A\" on his resume? Yes, I did seem to contradict myself. Hopefully that clarified what I meant. 3. \"The essence of your argument is that grades are a motivator and that with grades, there would be no motivation for students to do any work at all.\" Con's summary is almost 100% correct. Con slightly misrepresented me because I didn't say students would have no motivation if grades were removed. To the contrary, I said that personal aspiration would still remain. Other than that, Con correctly paraphrased my arguments. Responding to Con's counterargument, \"There are lots of grade-free schools.... and none of them on record have ever experienced a 'Race to the Bottom' problem.\" First of all, that's a very bold claim. Can Con really prove that \"none of them\" have ever run into difficulty? Con would need to provide evidence for this claim which, fortunately for me, was not submitted. Secondly, judging by Con's sources, many - if not all - grade-free schools are private schools. As such, private schools charge more for tuition and have more control over their curriculum. They can afford to, well, experiment. The Sudbury Valley School that Con cited is not analogous. Not only does this school not having a grading system, but it also has \"no academic requirements, no curriculum, and no tests.\" Moreover, this school charges parents $8,200 a year for tuition! [1] How many parents nowadays can afford $8,200 each year, possibly per each student? Clearly, this is a extremely lenient school that caters to upper-class families. This is not a viable replacement for American education. This resolution would not affect these private schools, Rather, they would affect public schools. Trying to compare private and public schools for solutions is not that easy because of the differentiating variables between them. Abolishing all grading paradigms across the United States public school system would result in a \"Race to the Bottom\" because grades are the only items that make public schools respectable. Unlike private schools, public schools are reliant on taxpayer dollars and are thusly on shoestring budgets. Public schools cannot afford to experiment on their reputations. Even as I write, the public schools' reputations hang on an ever thinning thread. Therefore, abolishing all grading systems would severely damage public schools and, by extension, their dependent students. Without grades, student have no reasons to study hard at a worthless school. So, in conclusion, a few crystalizing questions: 1. Do grades harm students? Hardly! The majority of students either care deeply about their grades or are apathetic (i.e. they don't care and, therefore, aren't harmed). Only a handful would be self-conscious enough and, honestly, terrible enough to be harmed by grades. 2. Should learning be performance driven? Learning should be tailored to the real-world, unless we want to institutionalize the proverbial \"Ivory Tower.\" Since the real world is performance driven, it follows that education should be as well. 3. Should grades be abolished? No. Perhaps reformed, but not abolished. For all of these reasons, I deserve to win. Source: [1] http://blog.makewonder.com...",

Like you said these are skills that will never go anywhere and the person may also go anywhere in order to fulfill their role. However, as you have mentioned before these trade skills are also available past high school and into community colleges at, what seems, a much lower cost than any other four year university. Our debate focuses around the requirement of public schools to teach these trade skills but despite how important these skills may be there is still modern education that many students need. Due to the recently implemented Common Core for nationwide schools there are now set expectations for students to learn and even though it is about \"making the grade\" at times these skills are no doubt just as important for students as preparing our future labor forces. By implementing trade skill courses it will no doubt broaden many students horizons, but there is still other necessary education that students require that cannot also fit requiring trade skill classes. Perhaps instead of requiring trade skill classes let them continually be an option for all students to have and take if so desired. Leaving actual trade skill opportunities in the student's capable hands and having them take the responsibility of finding ways to learn of a new skill or even taking the two year community college degree as mentioned before. As the Common Core State Standards Initiative website states, through further implication of these math, englishes, and sciences, students will be able hoan their learning abilities and apply them to later requirements in life such as those trade skills that may take later in life.",

            "premise": "I appreciate Pro taking the time to respond on this important topic. Pro's heart is certainly in the right place, however I don't feel like Pro really addressed my points from round 2. Regardless, I will address Pro's points in round 3:Firstly, Fair Trade is trade farmers can count on. Fair Trade is committed to strengthening direct partnerships between buyers and producers.This sounds great, but what does it mean? If farmers want something to count on, they should consider the free market. A truly sustainable producer does not need socialist intervention as advocated by the FLO. In economics, prices are set by a supply/demand curve [1]. Producers are willing to produce more when prices are higher while consumers will purchase less at a higher prices. These two opposing forces meet at the market clearing price. Artificial distortions in this process are not only unnecessary but disruptive. If prices are artificially raised, there will a tendency toward surplus which has downward pressure on prices. That is one reason the FLO spends so much of it's resources on marketing the FLO label. One of the interesting points made in Adam Smith paper [2] is that Fair Trade movement arose from the coffee crisis of the 1990's. Governments tried to fix this market through the International Coffee Agreement. The result was over-production and a crash in prices. These partnerships provide an avenue for buyers to purchase quality products from people they trust, and offer a sustainable and reliable way for farmers, artisans and their families to improve their livelihoodI agree that one of the functions of the FLO is essentially a food broker. This is an important function for farmers. All producers rely on brokers, logistics and other sources for the sale of their products. However, the FLO masquerades itself as a charitable organization and tends to put great emphasis on it's labeling program. The fact that the FLO puts so much emphasis on marketing it's label and so little emphasis on real agricultural development is an indication that their primary concern is not with producers. ThatFair Trade also means sustainable local economies. Fair Trade gives farmers and artisans control of their own future. They can build their own businesses, rather than working for a middle man, and the profits stay in their communities and go back into their businesses.There is really nothing magical about the FLO. As I've shown, they are effectively a middle man, a food broker. In addition, the labeling program effectively makes them a sort of pseudo-brand of product. I've also shown that the FLO adds very little profit for producers while at the same time impacting a fraction of the farmers in the countries they focus on. In fact, the FLO injects additional fees into the equation by charging packers of products a fee for the Fair Trade label. The FLO uses most of this fee money for marketing.Fair Trade also means what you buy matters. By choosing Fair Trade products, you are not only accessing high quality products, you are making a difference in the lives of the people who grow the food you eat and the goods you use.Is that not true of products I purchase from non-Fair Trade farmers? I've seen no real proof that the Fair Trade farmers deserve special treatment. While the FLO claims that they ensure no child or slave labor is used for farming, do they really follow up on this? Am I to believe that all or most non-Fair Trade farmers do use slave and child labor? Closing, Fair Trade connects you with other cultures. Fair Trade products are unique to the places they come from and the people who make them. Farmers and artisans are involved in the entire process, and Fair Trade products reflect the people and cultures they come from.Again, is this not true of non-Fair Trade products? In the coffee market, which is FLO's largest segment, Fair Trade products only make up five percent of the market [2]. Am I not helping the other 95% of farmers when I buy non-Fair Trade coffee?I thank Pro for this enlightening debate. However, I feel that Pro's arguments generally rely more on heart, hope and faith. I have shown that Fair Trade has little real impact on producers. In addition, true sustainability and success for producers in poor countries will more likely come from free market trade.

The path for education is not a one size fits all path when it comes to interests. In my life I have learned that if you are not happy with a path you are on, you will not be as successful as doing something that do want to be doing. The saying holds true, \"if you find something you enjoy, then you will never work a day in your life\". The traditional education path may not be for everyone, and as a society we should introduce different options in an attempt to help those who don't have a means of being introduced to a trade that may bring them the enjoyment they arelooking for, which can help create a stronger economy for all of us. A person sucessfully working in a trade is more beneficial to society than a peron who is unemployed or underemployed in a career or a job that they are not truly happy in.

            "conclusion": "Free Trade",
            "premise": "The first objection I have to free trade is that we are trading with countries which use slavery and child labor. There are over 45 million slaves in the world still today[1] and China and India are countries with some of the most slaves today[2]. In addition, they both use child labor in production of their goods as well[3] They are countries we trade with substantially: from China we buy more than 30 billion dollars worth of goods every month[4] and 3 billion dollars worth of goods each month from India [5]. Much of this could have been created from slave labor and child labor, and because we are trading with them, it is essentially permitting them to use slave and child labor. I argue we should not trade with any countries that use abominable work practices such as slave and child labor. The second biggest problem with free trade is that it hurts the jobs in America. While conservative-leaning economists argue that, in theory, \"Imports mean lost jobs only if we pretend we can make here all the things we import, the same way and for the same price,\" the evidence in reality shows the contrary, and: \"Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in U.S. industries more exposed to import competition...but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize. \"The study shows that the affected industries and regions 'have been hit hard and have not recovered. Workers in these industries and regions don't go on to better jobs, or even similar jobs in different industries. Instead, they shuffle from low-paid job to low-paid job, never recovering the prosperity they had before Chinese competition hit. Many of them end up on welfare. This is very different from earlier decades, when workers who lost their jobs to import competition usually went into higher-productivity industries, to the benefit of almost everyone.'\" [6] There is evidence we have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs due to trade with Mexico and Korea as well and the promised jobs that were supposed to be created never happened[7] In another study conducted by Jeffrey D. Sachs and Howard J. Shatz of Harvard University , it was found that trade has contributed to over the past 15 years, a \"sharp decline of overall employment in manufacturing; the widening of the income inequality between high-skilled and low-skilled workers; and the especially sharp decline in employment in low skill manufacturing sectors\" [8] While there are some papers claiming there is no effect of free trade, or there is even a positive effect from free trade on our jobs, these all mostly rely on economic theory that has been proven through the above evidence I've listed, to be false. Thus, because free trade with countries that use slave and child labor essentially doesn't do anything to get them to stop using slave and child labor(the countries that use them would be more likely to cut down on those practices if countries stopped trading with them) and that free trade has a negative effect on our jobs at home, I consider free trade to be disadvantageous to America. The only positive outcome from free trade is cheaper products, but if people are out of a job, they can't even afford the cheaper products anyways, as they are earning no money.

The question I present for my opponent is why should the United States economically help a country, which has no vital strategic importance to the United States, and goes completely against the US's ideology (communist totalitarian government vs. Capitalist Republican government)? Cuba wants the United States to completely end our blockade but, in return they want to concede nothing. They will not relax their policy of oppressing their own people. So once again I ask, why should the United States end a blockade when doing so would result in strengthening an oppressive government? It is a matter of principle that we keep the blockade. It is the only leverage the United States holds to try and loosen the Cuban people from the yoke of this totalitarian regime. a. The Cuban economy is nationalized. The Cuban economy is nationalized. So by ending this blockade it would result in money flowing into the Central government allowing Cuba to pursue their communist agenda abroad and oppress their own people's civil liberties. This police state of Cuba controls the lives of 11 million people. Why should the US contribute to this oppression by opening trade with Cuba? C3. The Castros hate the United States. Ending a blockade would not solve this hate. \"Lifting the embargo won't normalize relations, but instead legitimize -- and wave the white flag to -- Fidel's 50-year fight against the Yanquis, further lionizing the dictator and encouraging the Latin American Left\" (1). They are not going to end their policy of hating the United States. Now let's take a step back. Cuba is very close to the Continental United States. If we open free trade relations with Cuba other countries, who hate the United States, will decide that since Cuba can help them and now has a more modern infrastructure to open a military alliance. Do you know what countries these include? China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. Iran would not hesitate to use the advantage that Cuba would bring to them militarily. They will send missiles to Cuba. Guess what country they'll be aimed at. The United States. It will be a repeat of the Cuban Missile crisis (the reason the . By opening trade with Cuba the United States allows Cuba to modernize their infrastructure, allow them to build a more powerful military, and give countries such as Iran an incentive to want to create a permanent military alliance with Cuba. Furthermore, with resources gained from the end of the blockade, Cuba would team up with \"rulers of nations like Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia to advance socialism and anti-Americanism in the Western Hemisphere.\" (1) How does this help the United States at all with their foreign policy? It does not. Giving in to \"evil\" only begets more evil. C4. The USA has tried to negotiate for the end of trade embargo in the past \"The U.S. has tried numerous times to broker a deal with the Castro regime to lift the embargo, but he has outright rejected any negotiations\" (2). The United States has tried to negotiate for the ending of the embargo. Guess what? Castro did not want negotiate.

The impression can also be that this is given without too much concern about corruption or indeed without moral judgement, since many of the people who administer aid may be seen as morally ambiguous collaborators within authoritarian regimes. This influences developing world expectations of the first world. As well as leading to a sense that there is some sort of right to aid, it can also distort values of openness, self-help and honesty. It encourages many people in recipient countries to consider migrating to the source of this wealth, since they assume that it must be a rich place where all can prosper. When the reality turns out differently, this can cause problems on all sides.",

(we saw a boom soon after that, due to the internet boom or trade or what is interesting to speculate). even if it was a boom for the corporations as it was... that don't mean it wasn't for everyone, or at least that it'd last. we are essentially making the US meet the with everyone else.... causing us to become a third world nation etc. ----- they put plants in mexico instead of the US, or even reestablish them there. the rust belt is an example... instead of hiring the masses of unemployed there, they hire out and off source jobs. maufacturing is biggest hit. example of what happens when you outsource etc. eg, bob makes ten dollars an hour, 120 per day. his boss cuts his job to five dollars an hour, 60 per day. his boss pockets twenty of that savings, and passes on the rest to everyone else. in this case boss got richer, and everyone else saved some,but bob lost out. but then what happens when 'everyone else' also eventually gets knocked down? all their jobs get cut or reduced or not starting out as high, whatever. eventually everyone will be working for nothing while the boss makes beans. it's important to note that trade with nations isn't always bad... asi said before, there's gaining natural resources that they ahve. also, perhaps for some businesses getting off the ground and can't function without out sourcing, that might be an okay situation. while i believe certain situations might warrant trade... and i speculate pro will only provide mere expamples where trade is good, i don't thyink we should extend trade to being free trade particularly not laissez faire trade.",

However forgive as it is fairly short: \" Alternatively, every man and woman in the street is forced to pay higher prices for their day to day living or as inputs into their own businesses. International equity policies thus can have a detrimental effect on problems of equity within a country.\" \"Food that is more expensive than it needs be affects those on the lowest income the most as they spend a greater proportion of their income on the bare essentials\" However through subsidies of domestic industries and trade barriers from foreign competitors it allows the local economy and industry to grow. While prices may rise it would be mostly temporary. Take for example when I explained Jamaica's debt crisis. The other reason other then debt that Jamaica's economy fails to develop or grow stems from the destruction of trade restrictions allowing far wealthier TNC's to settle in Jamaica and causing the country to become dependent on foreign exports. Even resources that the country has in great abundance such as banana's are not sold and are instead favoured over cheaper foreign banana's causing not only a dependence on foreign exports but a completely stunted banana industry. \"Rather than FREE TRADE being a negative force for third world countries, it is actually the restrictive trade practices of first world countries in relation to primary production that causes much of the harm. Developing countries are urged to lower tariffs and the like on manufactured goods, but the favour is often not reciprocated when it comes to the agricultural goods they have a comparative advantage in producing. (4)\" \"Tariffs and subsidies REWARD the inefficient and distort markets by creating price signals that are not there. This can be seen with first world agricultural producers bringing to market goods that have been grown based on incentives from their governments rather than from a pressing global need. (2)\" However this actually connects to my argument on Economic Equity. By allowing developing countries and LDC's to use tariffs and other trade restrictions it prevents outcompetition from foreign industries and allows domestic industries to grow. \"Providing certain industries with favoured treatment, whilst committing the populous to pay higher prices is the truly undemocratic feature of protectionist policies.\" What is similarly undemocratic would be the WTO's allowing countries to veto any bills their trade partner makes if it inhibits free trade . So in fact a country voting for it's own protectionist laws is more democratic as it is the peoples choice to do so. Sources: 1. http://www.tradingeconomics.com...... 2.

I am not concerned toward these trade skills taking up all modern education but what I am concerned for is the students themselves. Students can only learn so much at a time, especially teenagers, and then easily lose focus again. I battle through 6 classes each day in my high school, 4 being the essential math, english, science, and history, while the other 2 being elective. Yes, there are openings for 2 electives where possible trade skill requirements may belong, but after focusing so much on the essential math, english, science, and history I can imagine, not just myself, but others too must be mentally exhausted. Then putting the student through another important class such as their required trade skill may even be too much for the student. Seeing in the online Forbes article, \"Motivation Matters: 40% Of High School Students Chronically Disengaged From School\", that on average 40% of high school students lose all motivation facing such demanding classes. By requiring trade skill courses then it will only push that much more of a burden upon the student.

            "conclusion": "Free trade agreements are more harmful than helpful",
            "premise": "Ok, I\u2019ll rebut Pro\u2019s R2 arguments. R1: Free Trade Increases the Trade Deficit and Kills Jobs! We Have a Trade Surplus or a Capital Surplus First, the trade deficit is harmless, it is offset by a capital surplus. The flow of funds in international trade must be balanced. Exports + Factor Income (inflow) + Transfers (inflow) + Asset Sales (inflow) = Imports + Factor Income (outflow) + Transfers (outflow) + Asset Sales (outflow) The Mexican people aren\u2019t going to hide their Dollars under a blanket. They will either buy U.S. exports, purchase U.S. assets and channel capital into our economy, or save their Dollars and therefore infuse them into our financial system. Trade is not a zero-sum game \u2013 we all benefit! Jobs Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 jobs (labor) are an input. What the American people need is a productive economy. If we can achieve higher productivity while minimizing input costs such as labor \u2013 we all benefit from a more efficient and dynamic economy. First, NAFTA has helped America\u2019s economy. Scholars have found that, \u201c[Because of NAFTA] North American firms are not more efficient and productive.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office has found that NAFTA has overall benefited the United States, \u201cjobs lost in industries producing tradable goods are offset to a greater or lesser extent by jobs gained in construction and investment-goods industries because of the inflow of foreign investment that must accompany the trade deficit.\u201d [3] Second, even if Pro\u2019s claim was correct, it would be relatively insignificant portion of the job churn rate. Over the last 12 months up to April 2015, 60 million jobs were created while 57.2 million were destroyed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [4]\u2026 and this is only a single year. If we were to extent this to the length of NAFTA\u2019s lifespan, it would only have effected 1 in 1,200 jobs (0.00083%). This is more than offset by the savings from more affordable imports. Trade also strengthens American businesses. Over 55% of U.S. imports [9] are intermediate goods, so these imports are used to lower the cost of business for American supply chains. By expanding productive capacity, it allows U.S. businesses to engage in job creation and raise wages. R2: Free Trade Breeds Unfair Competition! Multiple Factors influence Trade Pro is assuming that since labor costs may be lower in developing countries, trade unambiguously harms U.S. workers. Businesses take into account many factors when it comes to trade, such as: Input costs (labor, energy, raw materials) Human capital (availability of skilled workers) Physical capital (cost of factories, tools, machinery) Government policies (bureaucracy, tax laws, debt levels) Pro says because we have higher labor costs, we will lose. America has a skilled workforce, abundant physical capital, among other advantages. American energy is also very affordable \u2013 energy is 4x more expensive in Germany and is a major reason firms are planting down roots in America [4]. The United States is the best place in the world for foreign investment [6], according to empirical data. We leverage affordable energy, a skilled workforce, abundant capital stock, and a relatively functioning government. Why would we throw this away? R3: Trade increases Inequality The impact on trade has been to benefit consumers and workers. The National Bureau of Economic Analysis found that NAFTA has led to higher wages \u2013 by 0.17% in the United States [5]. This form of higher earnings is the fruit from trade, allowing workers to produce goods where America has lower opportunity costs. This also doesn\u2019t include the fact that consumers save over $2,000 a year in reduced prices. Inequality itself is irrelevant. Trade leads to a more efficient and productive economy, which leads to job creation and broad prosperity, so it is a noble policy. R4: Trade has a Negative Impact on the Environment, Working Conditions The Environment One of the most important indicators of environmental quality is the level of economic development. Developing nations, such as India and China, have more pollution and dangerous emissions. Once nations become more prosperous though, the firms can invest in technology that cuts back on pollution. Trade helps nations develop economically, which is why some research has found that \u201cFreer international trade improves the environment.\u201d [8]. The scholars also found that trade has a minimal effect on the environment, because there are many more factors at play. America has many advantages that outweigh the potential costs of environmental safeguards. Working Conditions Forced labor and abuse is deplorable. It shouldn\u2019t be condoned, but it is. It isn\u2019t a consequence of trade. It is a consequence of corrupt and inept governments. Trade also generates innumerable opportunities for workers. The working conditions and pay may be low compared to our standard of living, but they are better than the status quo. As one economist noted, \u201cNot only are sweatshops better than current work alternatives, but they are also part of the process of development that ultimately raises living standards.\u201d [8] R5: Why Not Autarky? Pro is saying that free trade is harmful. Why then do we be completely self-sufficient (an economic autarky)? Ideologically speaking, \u201cfair trade\u201d will probably lead to more open trade over time. What has autarky \u2013 complete self-sufficiency \u2013 meant in reality? Cutting off international trade damages economic development, people\u2019s standards of living, and political environments. Some successful examples of autarky include: Afghanistan under the Taliban India (before 1991) North Korea Iran (to an extent since the inception of its nuclear program) Cutting off trade hasn\u2019t helped. Indeed, it has worsened the people\u2019s standards of living. We should thus take notes and embrace a policy of free trade. Conclusion Free trade is beneficial for all nations that partake. Nations and firms can specialize in their comparative advantage, and through trade can minimize opportunity costs. High-income states like the USA can produce capital-intensive goods such as aircraft, computer processors and vehicles. Low-income states such as Mexico can produce textiles and foodstuffs. Through trade we can acquire more wealth. Several advantages of free trade: Strengthens American businesses (more affordable inputs) Generates high-quality jobs (finance, advanced manufacturing, etc.) Increases economic efficiency and dynamism Lowers costs to consumers (about $2,000 a year) Improves socio-economic and environmental conditions in developing states Fosters peace and mutual respect Citations [1] http://www.bls.gov...

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for the debate. I must remind the audience that PRO had the BOP throughout the debate, and as noted in R1 any exception to his rule would mean the resolution is negated. It is fairly obvious that, as a whole, my opponent has failed to fulfill his BOP and prove that *all* goods should be allowed importation into the US. PRO ignores my entire rebuttal to the semantical argument: That his legality argument is weak and does not provide a card Blanche. Therefore, he concedes it as true. Meaning his argument\u2014that the resolution negates the argument\u2014is not valid. Therefore, every single point I made in round 2 is essentially dropped, meaning the resolution is negated and PRO automatically loses the debate. Therefore, his arguments pertaining to legality are refuted based upon his concessions of the argument. He then argues past laws are override by current laws. This is irrelevant. You did *not* say that the laws had to either be in action or existing today\u2014nor did you say they had to be functioning laws. As *laws* was not defined, it is open to interpretation. And, therefore, arguing that past laws are irrelevant does not work, as they were relevant in the past. And you never said this debate was about current law. As noted, the legality argument I made was dropped by my opponent, meaning he essentially concedes my opinions and loses the debate. PRO then goes on to claim that free trade is a straw man. No. His argument requires free trade. Allowing all imports would be a free trade system. By extensive evidence detailing how imports harm the USA is, by itself, enough to win the debate. I specifically noted how imports at all would harm the economy, and allowing all imports would be devastating. My opponent response, \u201cif all free trade is bad, then why have any at all?\u201d is very flimsy. Historical evidence\u2014contrary to the myth that prostitution was\u2014indicates that slavery was the world\u2019s oldest profession [1]. Slavery existed throughout most of human history, but almost universally was considered a \u2018bad\u2019 thing. Therefore, merely because something exists does not mean that it is good. PRO continues to make the red-herrings of both inflation and welfare. This debate is about neither of those things. Both exacerbate the issues of importation, but are not the cause of the issue. I honestly don\u2019t see how the argument that inflation makes imports *worse* really applies. The fact is, his premise presupposes that imports are a bad thing, meaning he essentially concedes the debate. And the effects of welfare\u2014as noted\u2014have been decreasing during the period globalization has been occurring, therefore the negative effects cannot be attributed to welfare. Really, my opponent ignores the well supported statistical analysis of free trade leading to 100s of thousands of job losses because he cannot directly respond to it. He offers no reason as to why welfare and inflation are the sole causes of the economic issues caused by free trade. Inflation may *increase* the problem, but it is not the problem. Soda may increase obesity rates, but it is not the problem. My opponent claims I dropped the peace argument. This is untrue when you think about it. I noted how free trade increases unemployment, which leads to many risk factors, including poverty, which increases crime rates. Therefore, in relation to the domestic USA, it likely *increases* violence. Second, many wars (e.g. ISIS) are being fought by religious zealots who are not incentivized by money. Therefore, it is arguable whether or not free trade is applicable to the modern world. And finally, I am not in opposition to *some* free trade\u2014as I noted early in the debate. I am opposed to *full* free trade. I have presented evidence that allowing *all* goods into the country would *harm* the US. Therefore, the resolution is negated, as *some* imports should be refused entry because of the deleterious economic impacts. Overall, I have proven how there are *some* exceptions, meaning the resolution has negated. I noted how, at least domestically, a free trade regime would *increase* violence and worsen the economic output of the US via job loss. Overall, PRO fails to offer convincing reasons as to why *all* goods should be allowed entry, whereas I provide multiple examples as to how his ideas would harm the US and examples of goods which should be restricted. Also, as noted, importing invasive species is NOT illegal under current law\u2014meaning there is at least one exception\u2014so I win the debate. I urge a CON vote. 1. http://www.prostitutionresearch.com...",

It makes no sense that I can fake my way through a class the whole semester by never understanding the material but passing all the exams. Our system has become too dependent on quantity and less on the quality of a student's work. Reading, writing, or math may never be a student's forte, but a willingness to try their hardest is what should truly count. Students should also be graded on their social and emotional learning. SEL skills include self-awareness, working in teams, decision making. These are both things that will propel a student forward in his/her success. If we show students that we are paying attention to these sorts of qualities, they are more prone to develop these skills. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"character is higher than intellect.\" We are teaching our students material that they may never be able to apply on the job. The skills and traits we instill in them would be much more beneficial from a long-term perspective.

It makes no sense that I can fake my way through a class the whole semester by never understanding the material but passing all the exams. Our system has become too dependent on quantity and less on the quality of a student's work. Reading, writing, or math may never be a student's forte, but a willingness to try their hardest is what should truly count. Students should also be graded on their social and emotional learning. SEL skills include self-awareness, working in teams, decision making. These are both things that will propel a student forward in his/her success. If we show students that we are paying attention to these sorts of qualities, they are more prone to develop these skills. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"character is higher than intellect.\" We are teaching our students material that they may never be able to apply on the job. The skills and traits we instill in them would be much more beneficial from a long-term perspective. It seems pathetic to think that we are evaluating our students by letter grades and not a better system that allows them to apply their work ethic in the next class.",

Many people claim that we cannot trade with a Communist nation. But think about where we get most of our exports: China. China is a Communist nation and is more dangerous than Cuba. China is a well-known violator of human rights and will one day pass America as the only world power. Why are we helping them with our trade? But before I get too off topic, let's go back to Cuba. An economic partnership with Cuba would greatly benefit both countries, especially if Cuba agreed to allow tourism. Americans are led to believe that Cuba is the enemy because they once were a nuclear threat. Well, WWII was started by Germany, but now Germany is one of our largest trading partners. I guess the real question is, why not lift the embargo?",

This will allow a firm basis for a flow of cash or goods into the developing country, largely independently of whether the developed country is doing well or badly economically at a given moment. This can be contrasted to the flow of aid. It tends to be less predictable, both because it is manipulated for political reasons and also because it can be quite ephemeral and so, if the developed country goes through a bad economic time, the aid budget makes an easy target for a reduction in spending.",

            "discussionTitle": "Free Trade",
            "conclusion": "Free Trade",
            "premise": "I will begin by attacking my opponents case. All my opponents arguments against me is that it is morally unjust to buy from these countries that use underpaid workers. They haven't brought up any other type of argument that actually uses facts. They can only prove that other countries use underpaid workers. They also have stated that free trade helps our economy. Our economy is very important for America's success and without a booming economy our job numbers go down and prices go up. Do we really want our economy to be lowered cause we stopped trading with other countries? Now I am not saying that these countries use of underpaid workers is good, but we have to look at our economy first. Free trade as I have stated before creates jobs and helps lower trade prices. My opponent argued that he could't find my chamber of commerce study online, but it's a credible source even if he can't find it himself. Now onto my first contention which is Higher Standard of Living The most compelling reason to support free trade is that society as a whole benefits from it. Free trade improves people's living standards because it allows them to consume higher quality goods at less expensive prices. In the 19th century, British economist David Ricardo showed that any nation that focuses on producing goods in which it has a comparative advantage will be able to get cheaper and better goods from other countries in return. As a result of the exchange, both trading parties gain from producing more efficiently and consuming higher quality goods and services at lower prices. Trade between nations is the same as trade between people. Consider what the quality of life would be if each person had to produce absolutely everything that he or she consumed, such as food, clothing, cars, or home repairs. Compare that picture with life as it is now as individuals dedicate themselves to working on just one thing--for example, insurance sales--to earn a salary with which they can freely purchase food, a car, a home, clothing, and anything else they wish at higher quality and lower prices than if they had done it themselves. It simply makes sense for each person to work at what he or she does best and to buy the rest. As a nation, the United States exports in order to purchase imports that other nations produce more skillfully and cheaply. Therefore, the fewer barriers erected against trade with other nations, the more access people will have to the best, least expensive goods and services in the world \"supermarket.\" Producers benefit as well. In the absence of trade barriers, producers face greater competition from foreign producers, and this increased competition gives them an incentive to improve the quality of their production while keeping prices low in order to compete. At the same time, free trade allows domestic producers to shop around the world for the least expensive inputs they can use for their production, which in turn allows them to keep their cost of production down without sacrificing quality. In the end, the results benefit both producers--who remain competitive and profitable--and consumers--who pay less for a good or a service than they would if trade barriers existed. America as a whole is better off with free trade; but with new technologies evolving continuously at home and abroad, open economies are constantly challenged to change the way they do business. In the process of adapting to change, some sectors suffer until they can adapt to the new changes and begin to benefit from them. For example, during the Industrial Revolution, workers in the agricultural sector had to adapt to the \"new industrial economy,\" competing with machines that could do the same work more efficiently. Eventually, the agricultural workers trained themselves to use machinery and seized the opportunity to be part of the new industrial economy. Today, America again faces major economic changes. The U.S. economy is moving from an industry-based to a knowledge-based model. For example, the U.S. textile industry gradually disappeared during the past two decades because it became increasingly less competitive vis-\"-vis the lower cost of labor in foreign countries. As a result, many U.S. textile factories shut down their operations. South Carolina was one of the states most affected by the shutdown of textile factories. South Carolinians, however, did not become permanently unemployed, because other industries moved to the state to take advantage of a trained labor force. In 2000, BMW leased a research facility at Clemson University's automotive research campus to train engineers to sustain BMW's growth. IBM and Microsoft each contributed to this project with the idea of creating high-paying jobs tied to knowledge. Through this project, BMW \"invested $2.5 billion at the plant, and now employs 4,700 people, with most production workers making $24 per hour.\"1 BMW's investment illustrates the process of adjustment in an economically open society. In order to remain competitive and benefit from the economic evolution brought about by the new knowledge-based technological change, South Carolina's workers trained themselves to seize the higher-paid job opportunities. The adjustment brought better-paying jobs and, with them, the possibility of raising the living standard of all those involved in the process of change. Contention #2: Competition Innovation is the basis of progress, and competition is the best incentive to innovate. The challenge of having others producing similar products or offering similar services motivates businesses to find new technologies and better ways to provide what they produce. The need to remain competitive forces businesses to strive constantly to innovate. As a result, new technologies are born. America is perhaps the world's best example of how competition fosters innovation. Although at times the United States has become somewhat protectionist, its economy has been built primarily on the principles of a free market, private enterprise, and competition. In such a competitive environment, new technologies, from computers to medicines to machinery, have helped the economy to become increasingly more productive per unit of labor and machinery employed in the production process. Since 1948, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, multifactor productivity--a ratio of output to combined inputs--in the U.S. private business sector has more than doubled.2 (See Chart 1.) Productivity has fostered economic growth and, by lowering production costs, has given ordinary Americans the opportunity to raise their standard of living. In the 1980s, personal computers were very expensive, few people owned them, and those they did own handled only word texts and a few calculations. Due to increased competition, by 2002, 65.9 percent of people living in the United States owned a personal computer that handled text, calculations, graphics, media, Internet access, and many other functions.3 In 1975, the airline industry carried about 200 million passengers; now, due to competition and lower costs, it carries almost 600 million passengers a year. In 1987, only 0.3 percent of Americans owned mobile phones. By 2002, 50 percent owned one. Similarly, in 1975, only 37.3 percent of people had a telephone mainline; now 64.6 percent have one. The percentage of people who own a television set soared from 48.6 percent in 1975 to 93.8 percent in 2001. These are just a few examples of the millions of products and services made available to increasing numbers of people, thanks to the opening of trade and to the freedom of the U.S. economy. America's ability to compete and innovate derives from its open markets and from the continual search for new markets through the expansion of free trade. Goods and services flowing across borders foster new ideas and allow U.S. producers to learn about the market through the failure and success of traded products. As they learn more, they are able to innovate to remain competitive. Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith had observed this simple truth already in 1776, when he wrote in The Wealth of Nations: When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour...for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occasion for.... As by means of water-carriage [at the time, a means to expand trade] a more extensive market is opened to every sort of industry than what the land-carriage alone can afford.... [As a result,] industry of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself....4 Smith was even more of a visionary than Ricardo, for he understood that labor specialization is something that constantly changes and that gaining a comparative advantage requires open borders and the ability to adapt to continuous change. It was free trade that continuously challenged local merchants to improve their products and therefore fostered innovation. Consumers benefited as well because, in an attempt to capture a greater share of the market, producers offered consumers the best possible products in the world at the lowest possible prices. Protectionist policies have the opposite effect. They give advantages to a very small group of producers that do not want to compete. Tens of millions of consumers, as well as smaller producers buying goods and services from the protected few, bear the cost of such protection by paying higher prices for lower-quality products. It's for these reasons that I strongly urge you to vote pro in today's debate",

            "premise": "I will begin by attacking my opponents case. First I will begin by stating that one of the sources used by my opponent is fairly biased. EndSlaveryNow was a website used and it is obviously biased too make all their evidence sound like free trade is bad because of child slavery. So that entire contention falls just because of this biased source. Now to their 2nd argument which is that free trade hurts the jobs in america, but according to the US Chamber of Commerce, the increased trade brought about by the agreement has created 5 million jobs in America alone. This evidence shows that free trade is creating jobs unlike my opponent wants you too think. So onto my 1st contention which is that free trade gives us access to lower priced goods. Free trade increases access to higher-quality, lower-priced goods. Cheaper imports, particularly from countries such as China and Mexico, have eased inflationary pressure in the United States.1 Prices are held down by more than 2 percent for every 1 percent share in the market by imports from low-income countries like China. This piece of evidence states that we are getting better goods for lower prices because of free trade. Free Trade is helping the U.S. get these goods for a much lower price then normal because there is no tariffs or taxes on the trade which helps the u.s substantially. Now to my 2nd contention which is that it boosts the economy. After my last pieces of evidence that stated that free trade has created jobs and that it gives the U.S. goods for less; it is obvious that free trade helps our economy significantly. Free trade means more growth. At least half of US imports are not consumer goods; they are inputs for US-based producers, according to economists from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Freeing trade reduces imported-input costs, thus reducing businesses\" production costs and promoting economic growth. Businesses' aren't having to pay as much to produce goods because of free trade. Free trade is giving the U.S. a great boost in it's economy because of the reasons I have stated in this contention. Now to my third contention which is that free trade improves efficiency and innovation. Over time, free trade works with other market processes to shift workers and resources to more productive uses, allowing more efficient industries to thrive. The result is higher wages, investment in such things as infrastructure, and a more dynamic economy that continues to create new jobs and opportunities. According to the Washington Post the U.S. has seen an increase of about .96% to American wages. The efficiency and innovation being shown by free trade is substantial. Free trade is something that we must keep so these wages will keep going higher and so efficiency and innovation can continue to be improved. So it is for these reasons that I strongly stand in firm affirmation for free trade. Sources: https://www.mercatus.org...",

It is time for America to retrieve this stolen information and delete it out of China\"s database. And it is for this reason that my partner and I stand firmly Resolved: The US government should implement the hack back system Before we go any further though, we must define a few key terms in Observation 1. Definitions 1.People\"s Republic of China - a communist nation that covers a vast territory in eastern Asia; the most populous country in the world 2.Hack - use of a computer to gain unauthorized access to data in a system 3.Significant - in a sufficiently great or important way as to be worthy of attention. 4.Reform - make changes in 5.

America should be allowed to keep trade and military secrets as well the information of those who work for the United States government private and secret. If a country violates our privacy, we have every right to trace that hack, retrieve the information, delete it, and possibly find the person responsible.

Since then, a new report has drawn direct connections between China\"s People\"s Liberation Army and a hacking operation of U.S. allies in the South China Sea. The Wall Street Journal reported today about a hacker named Ge Xing: Through accounts allegedly tied to Mr. Ge, the report draws a direct link between his unit, People\"s Liberation Army Unit 78020, a military intelligence arm based in China\"s southwest, and a hacker collective known as Naikon that security researchers say has successfully penetrated key computer networks in countries competing with China for control over the South China Sea. MPX: China is backing hackers who break into the US database and steal valuable information and secrets. Inherency: The Chinese government is building an online cyber army http://fortune.com... Last week, it was revealed that Chinese hackers launched a massive cyber attack on the U.S. government, affecting 4 million current and former federal employees. The blackmail potential of such information, and the harm to U.S. national security, should be obvious. And the connection with China should not be surprising since the U.S. has been fighting this war for some time. A senior Chinese government official even stated recently that the country is assembling an \"online army,\" which means that the cyber war between the U.S. and China is bound to heat up. MPX: China is currently building a cyber army to attack the US database and steal information Observation 4: Harms Harm: China is stealing valuable trade secrets http://time.com... Five Chinese military hackers employed by the Chinese government were accused yesterday of infiltrating American companies and stealing trade secrets. By charging the men with economic espionage and identity theft, among other crimes, the Department of Justice has set the stage for a tense standoff with the Chinese government. MPX: Chinese backed hackers are stealing secret American trade information which we will bring up upon request by the negative team but included solar power technology, nuclear power technology, inside information on US business strategy, etc. but not only has this hurt the US government, but it is hurting US businesses as we will see in the impact MPX: US businesses are harmed by the state backed Chinese hackers http://time.com... The apparent victims of the hacking are American titans: U.S. Steel, the nation\"s oldest and biggest steel manufacturer and the lovechild of tycoons Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan; Alcoa, the world\"s third-largest aluminum maker; Westinghouse Electrical Company, one of the world\"s leading nuclear power developers; SolarWorld AG a leading solar technology company ; and the United Steelworkers, among America\"s most iconic labor unions. Harm 2: Chinese state backed hacker steals sensitive defense information http://freebeacon.com... A Chinese businessman pleaded guilty this week to conspiracy to hack computer networks of U.S. defense contractors and obtain sensitive data on military aircraft that was passed on to China. The plea deal includes an admission by Su of conspiring with two people in China from October 2008 to March 2014 who broke into U.S. computer networks at Boeing and other defense companies. The hackers stole large amounts of military information that was supplied to China, according to court documents and a statement by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California. The operation first gained access to some 630,000 Boeing computer files on the C-17 military transport aircraft technology in early 2009. The C-17 is the U.S. military\"s main cargo aircraft. The data included details on the aircraft\"s onboard computer. Other stolen files included data on the F-22 and F-35 aircraft, the military\"s most advanced radar-evading stealth fighter jets. The F-22 data included details of an unspecified \"training component\" on the stealth jet used to launch missiles. MPX: Not only are the Chinese taking away our trade and business secrets, they are stealing our military secrets and plans and America does not make any efforts to regain or delete those documents. Observation 6: Solvency Solvency: America is capable of implementing the hack back system https://fcw.com... America has the big stick in cyberspace. But does it matter, if the rest of the world believes we won't use it? There's an awful lot the U.S. could do, and it might need to launch a cyber strike or two to get adversaries off its back. \"We need to have people believe if they hack us there will be punishment,\" Lewis said. \"We have the capability ... people don't think we'll do it.\" Today, we saw the damage that China is causing America through their thievery of our secrets, military tactics, etc. I leave you with this quote from Michelle van Cleave which perfectly sums up China in the cyber world. \"The Chinese have a sophisticated network of tens of thousands human spies and computer hackers targeting American military and technological secrets, what they can\"t acquire legally through trade, or creatively through mergers and acquisitions, they are prepared to steal.\" It\"s time to combat their thievery by hacking back our information and for all these reasons, an affirmative ballot is not only warranted, but needed.",

That is, some of the sources, or the sources where my opponent's sources came from, may have been either made by government funded researchers to purposely aid in covering up the true facts. My sources are directly from the manufacters of the steel used in the buildings, the manufactors of the airplanes, expert demolition crew members, and eyewitnesses. The manufactors of the steel said that their beams were tested to take in excess of the peak temperatures of the fires inside the world trade center buildings. Boeing says that the pictures and videos of the second WTC plane did not fit the appearence of their airplanes. Expert demolition crews say that a controlled demolition would look very similar, and a few things can be done to completely destroy, or keep something in tact. Also, consider this: Since the 1993 bombings of the WTC, there has been bomb sniffing dogs patroling the buildings every night. A few months before, parts of the buildings were closed off inside for construction. The areas of construction changed for those few months. And a couple months before the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center, the bomb sniffing dogs mysteriously stopped, not doing a single patrol. Also, the four planes involved all have a documented landing on the days of the attacks with a no incident report for each one. Also, some of the supposed planes in the attack were big planes, but with a small amount of passangers. When airlines have a low amount of passangers, they will not fit them in a plane that is meant to take double the capacity of the plane. They would compensate and make them smaller.",

            "conclusion": "Free trade agreements are more harmful than helpful",
            "premise": "To conclude, I'd just like to restate my main points:Lost jobs and deficitFree trade agreements like NAFTA and TPP cause devastating damage to the American middle class. Through deficits with Mexico alone we've lost nearly 700,000 high-skilled manufacturing jobs, and that number rises to 2.7 million when looking at the U.S.-China free trade agreement. It is important to keep in mind that these are net jobs lost, meaning that all jobs gained are taken into account as well. Either way you look at it, free trade agreements have a negative impact on the manufacturing sector, causing companies to outsource millions of decent paying American jobs. Impact on the middle classFree trade has lead to the decline of U.S. wages and an increase in income inequality. The massive outsourcing of jobs we've seen under these agreements and the freedom they have given to the biggest companies allows them to continue growing in power, seemingly endlessly. During the past few decades, we've seen the middle class dissapear, and free trade has been a huge contributor. \"Most economists now acknowledge that...trade is responsible for about 40% of the explainable share of increased income inequality.\" [1] Restricited consumer freedomWhile the increase in importing and overall wider availability of goods is a benefit of free trade, this does not negate some of the very harmful terms present in many of our free trade agreements. Under them, consumer freedom has actually been reduced. Free trade threatens the availablity of less expensive, generic medications [3]Free trade lowers the safety standards of imported food products [4]Free trade limits the authority of local governments to restrict permits to extraction and export of liquid nature gas to partner countries, which could lead to an increase in fracking [6]Products with \"fair trade,\" \"animal-friendly,\" and \"GMO-free\" labels are considered trade barriers under free trade and restrict the freedom of the consumer [7]\"Buy local\" policies are outlawed under the TPP and additionally restrict the freedom of the consumer [8]Government officials can be SUED if they attempt to prefer local products over imports [9]Disregard for the environment and worker safety - unfair competetionEnvironmental policies in many free trade agreements are seen as \"trade barriers,\" which means the United States has in essence allowed foreign countries to compete with them on a level in which they've been allowed to use sweat shop workers and environmentally dangerous practices to advance their industry. \"Neither CAFTA nor the FTAA require member countries to adopt internationally recognized standards for environmental protection. Nor does either agreement ensure that member countries don\u2019t lower or waive their existing environmental laws in an effort to attract investment. What\u2019s more, rules in CAFTA and the FTAA would actually prohibit member countries from enacting many new environmental regulations, allowing those regulations to be challenged as 'barriers to trade.'\" [10] In essence, this would allow foreign countries to not play by the same rules we do, breeding unfair competition and encouraging even more companies to outsource jobs to foreign industries.AutarkyI'd like to clarify that in no way am I promoting economic isolation in the form of extreme protectionism, but rather, I'm pointing out the blatant flaws in free trade that negatively impact the American middle class and our environment. Like all things, we must find a middle ground, and I believe that free trade is as much of an extreme as autarky, and we must effectively regulate it in order to give everyone a good deal. So to conclude, free trade is a raw deal for the majority of Americans. Either through a decline in wages, outsourcing of jobs, the steady dissapearance of the middle class, or the restriction placed on the consumer under these agreements, I don't believe that the benifits of free trade outweigh the costs placed on the average American worker. Again I'd like to thank con for the debate, and I'll allow him to make his closing statements as well. http://pastebin.com...",

However, since the style of my case, clearly Lincoln-Douglas in form and function, was apparently ignored, I will unfortunately have to resort to simple straight refutation. Let's get to my opponent's arguments, shall we? Con said: \"The Monroe Doctrine (authored by one of our founding fathers, who probably knew much more than any of us), advises America against participating in any entangling alliances. The WTO and any other multiculturalist, international organization that tie down American sovereignty and ingenuity are bad for our country and should be strictly eschewed.\" 1) http://en.wikipedia.org... - the Monroe Doctrine was primarily to keep Britain and other foreign nations from colonizing in the Americas. The US has consistently involved itself in organizations that make it international. For example, the US founded NATO, which is one of the biggest treaty organizations in the world. This keeps both the United States and these other nations from harm. 2) Remaining within the WTO is beneficial! Primarily, we get trade resolution with places like China, where the US can get cheap labor and some of the most excellent assembling nations in the world. Without the WTO's involvement, it would be much more difficult for the US to do this. 3) Extend all of the arguments within my first and second contentions that talk about the significant benefits of the WTO for the world, that my opponent didn't even address; why would you vote con when my opponent blatantly disregards the biggest reasons for voting Pro, which is the text of my arguments. Con then said: \"My opponent also postulates that \"protectionism\" leads to a welfare state. Are you serious? (For one thing, my opponent, as a Barack Obama supporter, shouldn't have any problem with creating a welfare state) The whole concept of free trade is intended to equalize the global playing field, which is truly a welfare/socialist economy.\" 1) First and foremost, bringing my political leanings into a nonpolitical debate was uncalled for and very uncouth. If my opponent could refrain from making such a grave mistake next round, I'd thoroughly appreciate it. Thanks. 2) Equating free trade with socialism and then welfare is a huge stretch within itself, but I'll break it down further. The goal of free trade is NOT to equalize the global playing field. It's simply to allow trade and commerce to run its course without countries folding in on themselves or starting trade wars. I don't see how this equalizes the playing field. Further, free trade is FAR from a socialist idea. The fact that free trade is one of the most heavily-promoted issues by conservatives and reactionaries alike is evidence enough to disprove that ignorant statement. 3) Extend my evidence within my third contention from D. Rodrik. Finally, because my opponent gave no arguments as to why the con side of the resolution - that is, that free trade should NOT be valued above protectionism - pro wins by default. Vote Pro.",

            "premise": "i am an advocate of \"fair trade\" not free trade.... or at least \"managed trade\", not laissez faire trade. the primary flaw with free trade is the idea of the \"race to the bottom\". countries compete with each other so much that it's a detriment to everyone.... they have to start cutting regulations and wages etc just to compete. perhaps for a country that is just starting to develop, or in the process of developing, they being on the receiving end will reap benefits of something they wouldn't have had otherwise. but for a countries that are already considered developed nations like the US, it leads to problems. this is especially true if you consider that for most effective purposes, we have an infinite labor pool. you can always find a schmuck to take less when he's in poverty, as the world has tons of, the idea of putting our labor somewhere else. for example. mitt romney talked about cutting out labor's union stronghold, saying that it costs two thousand dollars more per car here than other places. he's talking about cutting out pay and benefits, then, just to increase profits. we might agree that the unions get and had too much (eg before the bail out when they didn't have to take as many concessions), but that don't mean there's things being cut, the point of race to the bottom. there might be some benefit to some people, with lower prices in goods.... but not for everyone, and over the long run, it brings everyone down. like that motto.... \"out of a job yet? keeping buying foreign\". wages jobs etc fall. also, if you look at the share of the middle classes income compared to the richer etc, over time, it not only stalled but started to decrease. especially if you look at it after inflation. what could have caused this? perhaps the free trade act that bill clinton enacted in 1995. (we saw a boom soon after that, due to the internet boom or trade or what is interesting to speculate). even if it was a boom for the corporations as it was... that don't mean it wasn't for everyone, or at least that it'd last. we are essentially making the US meet the with everyone else.... causing us to become a third world nation etc. ---------- we can all agree unnecessary regulations should be cut. if the regulations are \"necessary\" then cutting them will be problematic. i tend to think most of our regulations are there for a reason, though. what reason do you have to think otherwise other than your mere assertions? we cut environmental regulations, people die, things get ruined... we cut safety regulations, people die, get seriously hurt etc, we cut financial regualtions, people abuse the process... we cut labor regulations, people get abused, like children or whatever. on and on. perhaps we can agree that there might be a side effect that is good with free trade that unnecessary reglations being cut could be a good thing. also, the employers might not have to cut labor with free trade, but they do. they put plants in mexico instead of the US, or even reestablish them there. the rust belt is an example... instead of hiring the masses of unemployed there, they hire out and off source jobs. as to the price argument.. i'm not sure how you're tying this to free trade. a person cannot just \"lower prices\", they have to have the ability to. infering what you might meant... free trade might cause lower prices... but that only benefits some people, while hurting others. i mean, the guy who lost his job or had his wages cut might benefit when the tires he used to make or makes for a lot less are now cheaper... but that doesn't mean he's better for it. there's only a set pool of money and resources, at elast as an initial supposition. eg, bob makes ten dollars an hour, 120 per day. his boss cuts his job to five dollars an hour, 60 per day. his boss pockets twenty of that savings, and passes on the rest to everyone else. in this case boss got richer, and everyone else saved some,but bob lost out. but then what happens when 'everyone else' also eventually gets knocked down? all their jobs get cut or reduced or not starting out as high, whatever. eventually everyone will be working for nothing while the boss makes beans. i didn't say the free trade act caused inflation... i said it caused our wages to decline. look the rust belt, it collapsed. loook at shoes or all the products that were once made here now being made there. as that site from heritage you quoted said, manufacturing jobs are lost. it didn't say how that's good. sure it might mean some lower prices, but as is with Bob, it's not all around victory. even if the poor get richer at a faster rate than the rich... that only means there's upward mohility. that means you can go from nothing to something significant realtively quick. but, that doesn't mean much as far as free trade. instead of getting to something more significant, you get to less when you're poor. i don't know how you can make such a blanket assertion that technology makes everything okay. it may be true that GM starts to use robots instead of workers to comepete with others... but that only means GM made more money. some might be passed on to the general population... but when they ahve to take a cut of the profit, the balance means more goes to teh rich and the supply side, less to the demand side, the side that stimulates the economy and is more important. innovation still occurrs without free trade. windows the operating system and compuaters woudl have been madea nd sold regardless of if we had free trade.",

            "premise": "-----Rebuttals-----R1 was for acceptance, not arguments. Conduct?\"Race to the bottom argument\"Nations that have higher wages can still beat low wage nations when the higher wage nation has other comparative advantages such as higher productivity or higher quality products. [1] [3] And, the US is at the top of the world when it comes to productivity. [5] So, our comparative advantage would allow the US to better produce skill intensive goods and sell them around the world, increasing wealth for us and therefore increasing prosperity.Regulations can be simplifyed and streamlined, to make America more competitive. And this would make the US more competitive, and as I said earlier, other comparative advantages such as higher productivity would make the US win.R1 was for acceptance, NOT arguments. I will rebut her other arguments.Inflation was not boosted because of NAFTA, and that didn't cause slow economic growth in middle class households. Low economic gains were caused by high income inequality, itself derived from low top income tax rates. Free trade would increase the wealth of the middle class, thus helping my side of this debate.About the rust belt, it simply makes resources become efficiently allocated where a nation has the greatest comparative advantage, in this case Mexico. However, the Midwest has a different niche (comparative advantage) when it comes to trade. No longer is the Midwest most efficient at producing automobiles. Now, the Midwest produces other, higher tech automobiles and products such as lithium car batteries, which is the same as what free trade would cause \u2014 specialization.As I said earlier, with free trade lower wealth nations would specialize in producing low skilled labor intensive products such as socks and pants, clothing. Higher skilled nations such as the US would specialize and sell skill intensive products such as aircraft. And we would exchange and trade goods and we would both mutually gain.C1: Improves Lives of CitizensMy opponent basically says the free trade harms the poor. This is not exactly true. Free trade helps the poor. Free trade mostly increases competition in sectors where low wage countries can compete in, such as food and clothing. Since poor people have a much higher propensity to consume products such as food and clothing, free trade which minimizes prices among the poor gives the poor higher purchasing power. [1] Also, nations that have engaged in free trade witness increased wealth among the poor. For example, in Indonesia, in 1975 malnourishment among children was greater than 50%. Now, it is about 1/3rd of children. [8]Empirical evidence has found that free trade has added about $2,000 to the annual income of the average US family because of cheaper products. [2]Furthermore, free trade has had more beneficial effects. For instance, economist Catherine Mann predicts a new surge of technology employment in the US because of the explosion of international trade. [4] Free trade causes businesses to lower prices universally. Lower prices increases purchasing power, which helps consumers purchase more goods and further help the economy.C2: We are ConnectedCitizens of the world are vastly connected with others in means of trade. For example, the elimination of tariffs would reduce the prices of steel, which would reduce the prices of computers in another industry, and the spread is all connected. Other industries, perhaps a doctor's office, would have lower costs because the steel used in products such as the computers they bought, and the cheaper steel for the doctor's products, would be cheaper. These fractions of dollars really add up. So, trade liberalization would reduce prices in mostly (if not all) fields. So, free trade would increase wealth and reduce costs. C3: Comparative AdvantageFree trade increases competition among businesses with no borders. Thus, individuals and businesses must specialize in what they produce. By specializing in different tasks, more goods are produced, further lowering prices. Countries can do the same. By specializing in a few particular industries, a nation utilizes its resources and are reallocated in areas where America is more efficient at producing. This is why America tends to export skill-intensive goods such as films, biotechnology goods, capital goods, and industrial products. [6]We do not need to worry about low-wage countries competing us out of jobs. For example, although we may be better at making socks than workers in Bangladesh, we will not export socks, because we have a comparative advantage in producing higher tech goods instead.So, we would sell skill intensive goods, and import low skill goods. [7] And, since skill intensive goods create greater wealth, American workers would enjoy greater wages. So, the reallocation of resources in which America is efficient, would make US workers save money on labor intensive goods, and make workers more prosperous in skill intensive goods where the US has a comparative advantage. C4: PeaceNations that engage in free trade are more akin to peace, for obvious reasons. The nations are interdependent, and rely on another for specialized goods. So, they avoid war to get the goods they need and enjoy mutual prosperity. So, free trade increases peace and reduces the likelihood of war. [9]C5: Economic GrowthIn free trade the workers would gain from producing more efficiently and consuming higher quality and services at lower prices. Empirical evidence points out that nations that engage in free trade enjoy greater economic growth. [10] And in a stronger economy, demand is increased. Increased demand leads to more jobs, expanding businesses, and a continuum of economic growth, as business size and capacity, as well as local purchasing power and jobs all increase, resulting in broad prosperity.C6: Other Natural Benefits of Free TradeSpecialization and free trade allow the U.S. to become more competitive and innovative. Innovation constantly provides new technologies that allow Americans to produce more, improve our health and the environment, improve education, and have greater investment opportunities. The resulting economic growth generates better-paying jobs, higher standards of living, and a greater appreciation of the benefits of living in a peaceful society. [10] Thus, free trade has many external benefits.Conclusion:Free trade moves resources into areas we are not efficient and moves them to areas that the US has advantages in and greater efficiency. Specialization makes resources become more efficient and reduces costs. Lower prices put more money in the economy, and therefore grows the economy. Specialization increases working wages, cuts poverty rates, and increases peace. Comparative advantage maximizes the number of jobs, increases productivity, lowers costs of goods, and increases peace, and all the benefits of innovation and competition by making efficiency a central cornerstone of the economy, and the natural market. Comparative advantage helps skilled American workers, and makes us utilize resources efficiently, helping the whole economy. Thus, we need free trade for broad American prosperity.Sources: [1] Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

            "premise": "\"It is very important for you to know that free trade leads to better roads, better health and better lives\" -- Rosario Castellon. I think that Rosario Castellon is exactly right free trade does lead to a better road. Resolved: Free trade should be valued above protectionism. And yes it should before I begin this debate I would like to offer the following definitions. Free Trade: trade based on the unrestricted international exchange of goods Protectionism: Government actions or Policies that restrict international trade. All as defined by Merriam Webster's dictionary My value for this debate is societal welfare or the total well being of an entire society. My value criterion for this debate is free trade and I will prove that free trade upholds the well being of our society with three points first Free trade enhances competition, second competition is good for the economy, and third having a good economy promotes societal welfare. Free Trade Enhances Competition Free Trade brings competition to a global scale it brings companies that might not have competed with each other together to create products that are beneficial to us the consumers. Ok let's think for a minute, we have only one company in the United States that has a known gaming system and that's Microsoft with the Xbox, now with out free trade this would be the only gaming system creating a monopoly, they could raise prices to larger amounts for lower quality products but because we have free trade we have competition between Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo each creates a well known product by having this by having free trade we enhance competition, so that there aren't monopolies. We create this competition with Free Trade which in turn is better for the consumer and the economy. Free trade is beneficial to the Economy. The one thing that just about every American has on their mind is the economy. Some things that come to my mind when I think of the economy are unemployment and the prices of products that I need. Free Trade enhances competition, and Free trade is beneficial to the economy first it decreases unemployment and second it is beneficial to consumers. Free trade decreases unemployment. According to Professor Andrew Bernard of Dartmouth College , \"about 40% of American workers work for firms that export. These exporting firms are vital for American jobs, especially at a time of slowing job creation. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The falling dollar makes American goods more desirable abroad, creating more jobs for Americans. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd And foreign firms have headquarters here, employing 5.3 million American workers.\" May 2009. According to Organization for international investment this year currently foreign companies have 5.6 million people employed. This is jobs that are being created and with out free trade we wouldn't have more and more foreign companies are employing Americans to work for them and for good pensions and wages. Free Trade is beneficial for the consumers. In contention one I gave an example of how free trade is beneficial, it helps make prices lower and gives us the consumer's better products. According to the bureau of labor statistics a free trade economy pays 4.9% less than a protectionist economy. Doesn't that say it all right there that free trade lowers prices so there for it's beneficial to society. But not only does it bring lower prices but better products as well. Its common sense that if you have varieties of the same product that a consumer is going to choose the product that is the cheapest but best product so with a free trade economy companies can not afford to make bad products where if there wasn't those varieties and there wasn't that competition then companies wouldn't be as innovative. And that wouldn't be beneficial to the economy free trade is in the best interest of the economy and what's in the best interest of the economy should be in the best interest of society. Free trade upholds societal welfare. Societal welfare is the well being of society as a whole. It is common knowledge that the economy affects the welfare of society. When unemployment goes up people stop buying products and more people apply for social programs, like food stamps, and unemployment. So since I have proven that free trade is beneficial to the economy then isn't beneficial to society, doesn't it uphold societal welfare. Even according to the American Heritage Foundation free trade promotes a higher standard of living. Meaning that it does promote society as a whole and if it promotes societal welfare than it should be valued and you must vote for the affirmative. In my case I have proven that free trade enhances competition which prevents monopolies and creates better products that free trade is beneficial to the economy by lowering unemployment, and being beneficial to consumers, and that free trade upholds societal welfare by promoting a higher standard of living. Free trade does lead to a better road and I have proven this so vote for the affirmative Resolved: Free trade should be valued above protectionism.",
