            "premise": "I thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate, and I wish Pro good luck! 1. Proven Medical Benefits There are many who say that there are many proven medical benefits to smoking or otherwise ingesting marijuana. First off, I would like to ask my opponent to cite a source saying, and proving, the medical benefits of medical marijuana. I have a source that says the following, \"There is plenty of evidence to show that marijuana can help people cope with a variety of diseases,\" Of course it can help people cope with diseases. If I took cocaine, the same effect would happen, in fact I might forget that I even had a disease. Being able to help people cope is no reason to legalize marijuana for medical use. The same source goes on to say, \"That said, medical marijuana is not right for every patient. Nor is it even the first drug of choice,\". Not even the first choice. Medical marijuana would not replace current medical practices, it would only supplement them. The legalization of medical marijuana is bad for many reasons, which brings me to my next point. http://www.post-gazette.com... 2. Ill Effects of Ingesting Marijuana The Office of Drug Control Policy says the following, \"Marijuana use is associated with dependence, respiratory and mental illness, poor motor performance, and impaired cognitive and immune system functioning, among other negative effects. Marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and schizophrenia. Other research has shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. Marijuana smoke, in fact, contains 50\u201070 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke,\" This goes to show why any use of marijuana, even for medical uses, is a bad thing for the health of any users. If marijuana for medical purposes was legalized, it would harm many more people than it would help. Is forgetting about your pain through smoking a joint worth it if you can get schizophrenia from smoking it? Or any other medical complication? No, its not worth it, and that is why medical marijuana should not be a legal option. http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov... In conclusion, I have yet to see a source that legitimately proves the benefits of medical marijuana. Not only is there a lack of health benefits from ingesting it, but there are serious medical issues that could result from ingesting the drug. For the reasons stated above, medical marijuana should not be a legal option, and I urge the voters to vote Con!",

            "premise": "\"If you have ever seen a drug commercial on TV they say that about just about everything, while they are listing off the long list of side effects. Morphine is a drug often prescribed as an anesthetic or painkiller, yet it has worse side effects than marijuana and is more addictive and is an opiate.\" --- Yes, many drugs on t.v. list a long list of side effects, but one must take into account that those warnings are for legal purposes so that no one can sue the drug company for getting nauseous when taking the drug. Marijuana has a much greater statistic of harming a person taking it than if one was to take another legal drug. Also, morphine is an addictive drug, but we are not arguing the merits of morphine. I ask that my opponent drop this point, as there are many drugs that are perscribed that are not as addictive as marijuana or opiates. \"There are proven benefits with less problems. [4] [5] It helps with cancer and is less devastating to health than chemo. [6]\" -In source 4, the author never lists the benefits, and in source 5 the person asking the question suggested the benefits of marijuana, marijuana was not suggested. In the same source, the person answering the question said that it was highly controversial. In source 6, it was a nice story, but what about lond term side effects? My second source says that there are long term side effects to this addictive drug, and whos to say that the kid will not grow up an addict? There are many cases in which a child is given a drug that he or she quickly becomes addicted to. http://www.break.com... \"Which is why people taking it shouldn't be allowed to drive or do certain tasks that require high levels of motor skills, just like some other drugs.\" -Same thing with drinking alcoholand then driving. Thats illegal, but people do it none the less. Legalizing marijuana would allow people to do things while under the influence of THC, and that puts the rest of us at risk. \"There are other ways to ingest marijuana rather than just smoking it.\" -Yes, I know. But that was listed as a method in my source, and I support it still. Any way one ingests marijuna is bad. \"For consistency, if we were going to make marijuana illegal for medical purposes shouldn't opiates such as morphine and oxycodone and codeine also be illegal even as prescriptions?\" -Totally agree with you on this one, but this debate is about marijuna, not opiates. In conclusion, I believe that medical marijuana should not be a legal option for all the reasons stated above and in my previous speech, and thus I urge te voters to vote CON! \"",

            "premise": "this is a debate on the promotion of marijuana for medicinal usage. claims of marijuana's medical benefits are dangerously misleading in a way that mirrors classic cigarette ads in which doctors would speak of the health benefits of cigarettes. we now all know how silly this claim is because all smoke is harmful no matter what kind of smoke it is. all you have to do to prove this is blow pot smoke directly into a white napkin and if done right, you will see brown residue left behind. its time to stop this cliche lie that smoking is not bad for you. if you want to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes, fine but dont mislead people into thinking that it will help their illness, when it will only hurt them, that is just wrong. medical marijuana has taken the place of snake oil remedies that scam artists used to sell on the street by falsely advertising it as a cure all. im not denying that the chemicals in marijuana such as THC may have benefits, but selling the actual plant its self to be smoked is absurd. no other medicinal drug is smoked for obvious reasons, which shows us how much of a joke medical marijuana is. people who want smoked medical marijuana are a discredit to people who actually need the benefits of the the drug. these people would be more than happy to take the plant in pill or liquid form, but the ones who refuse to take it in pill form are just looking to get high and want the cool factor of the smoke. some people who think they need the drug for medicinal purposes are actually just abusing it, because someone might also believe that a few shots of alcohol in the morning also makes them feel better, but we aren't calling alcohol an alternative medicine. another problem with smoked medical marijuana is that others can inhale the 2nd hand smoke which is unhealthy and may involuntarily impair them. no other medicinal drug has this problem, and tricking people into believing that smoked marijuana will help them is just as bad as making the same claim for alcohol or tobacco. also, i understand that you can cook with/ eat marijuana which is better for you but when you sell the plant its self, theres no way to stop people from smoking it. it also allows them to grow it, which wouldnt benefit society with tax revenue. especially because you can literally grow marijuana in a closet and no one would ever know if you bought the weed youre smoking or if you grew it. in conclusion, if you want to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes, thats one thing but dont call it a medicine.",

That being said, every problem that marijuana helps to treat already has multiple LEGAL treatments that are more effective. Take glaucoma for example. Medical marijuana, when it was legal, was primarily used to treat this. However, glaucoma is now treated by latanoprost, bimatoprost, timolol, and epinephrine, just to name a few. Furthermore, scientists have suceeded in synthetically producing the ingredients in the marijuana plant that give it its medicinal properties. I would think that using this would be highly preferable to unnecessarily altering your brain chemistry. Unless, of course, the patient is using marijuana primarily to get high.",

            "premise": "IntroductionI would like to begin by thanking my opponent for proffering this debate to me. It is a controversial topic and shall be an interesting one.ArgumentsFacts: Here is a list of things medical marijuana is used for: 1. AIDS treatment 2. Glaucoma 3. Nausea and vomiting 4. Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy 5. Pain caused by certain physiological disorders 6. Treatment of multiple sclerosis 7. Symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease 8. Appetite stimulant for malnutrition 9. Treatment of epilepsy 10. Migraine headaches Why it should not be used: However, according to webmd.com, \"cannabinoids in marijuana can weaken the immune system\", \"long-term use of marijuana can make lung problems worse\", \"marijuana might make seizure disorders worse in some people [(in other people it might help to control seizures)]\", and \"it might slow the central nervous system too much when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery (WEBMD).\" Here are some other common side effects of using marijuana for medicinal purposes: Drowsiness, dry mouth, giddiness, hunger, insomnia, red eyes, respiratory issues, short-term memory loss, and uneasiness or anxiety (Southwest Medical Evaluation Center).As you can see, it can be used to help people, but the effects are not always the same. For some people, medical marijuana can cure seizures, while it may make the disorder worse for other people. Currently, marijuana has not been fully tested, which means it should not be used. Unstable drugs should not be used in people. One could argue that it is human experimentation, which is not legal. Doctors are not always aware of the side effects medicinal marijuana could have on people. It is different depending on the person.ConclusionIn conclusion, medical marijuana is dangerous and has more bad side effects than good. This is why I do not support it. I hope my opponent can see that there are better ways to cure things than with cannabis. I patiently await my opponent's rebuttals.Works Cited\"MARIJUANA: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions and Warnings - WebMD.\" WebMD. WebMD.

            "premise": "Let me start by apologizing for not being clear in round 2. The evidence was for the argument that other drugs existed to replace Marijana, not the argument that it caused major negative side effects. My evidence for that argument was placed in my third round response, and restated below. http://www.sfgate.com... My opponent also tried to invalidate the same source restated above by saying that it was from a clueless police officer in San Francisco. This was an article published by a reporter from a respected newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, not some police officer blogging. Now, even if my sources are so ridiculous, how about we take a closer look at some of his? His source from the AVVO (stated below) states that emergency room visits could increase due to loss of motor skills and judgement. It also says, and I quote, \"Public safety will suffer, and the quality of life in our communities will deteriorate.\" His source from MedicalMarijuana.procon.org (also stated below) also states, and again I quote, \"There is no possibility of approval of any plant as a medicine to treat any illness, now or ever because the chemicals in whole plants (to say nothing of smoked plants which are composed of many, many more chemicals) could be approved as a medicine. Plants are unstable mixtures of different chemicals which cannot be used directly to provide a 'dose' of a specific chemical to be used as a medical treatment.\" My opponent may notice that he can no longer refute these arguments, as they come from his own sources. Either he must invalidate his own sources, and therefore many of his own arguments, or he must accept my arguments as fact. Marijuana is a major hazard to public safety and health. http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org... http://nakedlaw.avvo.com... My opponent mentions in passing that I ignore the fact that it is treatment for the terminally ill. This is patently ridiculous, as I addressed that in all three of the previous rounds by stating that Prozac worked equally well in that regard. Finally, back to Cartels. My opponent seems to think that this is a minor argument, but it is not. Removing Marijuana as a source of income for them would only force them to resort to other, possibly more dangerous means. Also, my opponent states that his argument does not legalize all Marjuana, only medical Marijuana, so crime would, in fact, stay approximately the same. One of these arguments or the other must logically be accepted as fact. Does he solve for all Marijuana, thereby rendering the Cartels more dangerous, or does he not, thereby causing no change in crime? My opponent is being incredibly illogical, and hiding behind weak arguments that my sources are not valid. I have now used his sources to back up the same arguments, and shown how my sources are also valid. Legalizing Marijuana, medical or otherwise, would be catastrophic for the entire country. I ask for a Con vote to ensure that this ludicrous and dangerous course of action never happens.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent\u2019s response. However, I would like to note he has failed to oblige by the first round acceptance rule. The evidence for my case will be mainly in my rebuttals; if not solely done there. The effectiveness of marijuana\u2014a hoax? My opponent makes a two pronged attack: first, medical marijuana has few, if any, benefits; and second marijuana\u2019s smoke aspect makes the drugs costs outweigh the (in his argument) small benefits. I will refute these accordingly. a) Marijuana has few benefits \u2013 status: false This argument is simply false. There is mounting evidence to the contrary, that medical marijuana has a plethora of benefits. Even though the NIDA and other organizations have attempted to block medical marijuana research, it still seems to get published. A 2010 study by the University of California, using methodology that meets the standards of the FDA, has found marijuana should be a first line treatment for those with neuropathy illness. What is also interesting is a plethora of other studies replicate these findings, and the AMA (which my opponent noted in 1987 opposed medical marijuana) is actively considering removing it as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and may possibly change their opinion on the issue. Yes, that\u2019s how much evidence has occurred since 1987 proving my opponents assumption quite weak [1]. Further, research by German scholars has obtained similar results as the University of California study. Since 2005, 37 studies with strong methodologies (that usually exceeds FDA standards) have strongly supported the medical marijuana benefit theory [2]. 37 studies showing success is actually much more than most of our drugs; indeed, most FDA approved drugs have far fewer studies and trials supporting their benefits. It seems as though the failure to accept these studies is likely ideological. Further, other studies from Californian professors have been set up by the University of California Medicinal Cannabis Research center overwhelmingly support the conclusion that medical marijuana has large benefits. Starting out asking whether or not marijuana is helpful, their research now is more on the side of how large are these benefits. Although they welcome dissenting opinion, the research strongly indicates marijuana is a strong pain killer, cancer fighter, and is capable of healing many diseases we never would have expected when the Center was created. The Center noted in a brief presented in front of the California legislature, they presented multiple studies, but one that jumped out to me was marijuana\u2019s effectiveness as a pain killer: 46% of the respondents in the study reported marijuana to reduce their pain by 30%. There is also growing evidence that marijuana helps cure cancer and other diseases [3]. Let\u2019s look into history as well. Ancient China is known for using medical marijuana in its medical practices, and many other ancient countries (India, and the Middle East) were also known for using hemp for medical purposes. Recent studies claim medical marijuana relieves pain, this should be of no surprise; Chinese doctors reported their patients to have painless surgery when using cannabis medicines. Also on a side note: the Iliad references cannabis usage. There is undeniable proof that marijuana is a pain killer, and a cure or many diseases, based on historical texts [4]. My opponent cites a colleague who is healing cancer without marijuana. And that\u2019s great, but irrelevant. I am not saying you need medical marijuana to heal cancer, for example: I would not use it because I am asthmatic. There are many other reasons. But marijuana can speed the process. It\u2019s like saying Advil is not helpful because I got rid of a headache without it. Well, yes, you did, but that does not mean Advil would have been helpful in the process. Needing a substance (or the ability to use it for certain parts of the population) is irrelevant to its effectiveness. b) The smoke outweighs the benefits \u2013 status: false The smoke is obviously not good for you, but its harms are likely exaggerated. The only harm that the Institute of Medicine 1999 report could identify was the loss of psychomotor performance, which means the patients should merely avoid motor equipment [5]. Further, animal studies find the amount of THC needed to be a fatal dose is almost impossible to consume, making the chance for overdose unlikely. It has also been noted when taking the prescribed dosages of marijuana; the chance of getting lung cancer is actually slightly lower because marijuana kills cancerous cells, which includes lung cancer cells. Most diseases marijuana supposedly causes (though it is unproven) have more evidence that it cures them, not exacerbates the problem [6]. Indeed, the marijuana \u2013 cancer link is deteriorating in the science, and evidence is starting to show marijuana has no linkage to cancer [7]. And I reiterate: with no evidence that marijuana causes cancer, and evidence showing it cures it, there is little reason to think my opponent\u2019s argument is correct. CONCLUSION: My opponent offers a thesis that marijuana has few benefits and the smoking aspect does more harm than good. Although smoking likely has some health hazards (especially for asthmatics and pregnant women), the hazards aren\u2019t large enough to disqualify marijuana as a medicine. Other pain killers harm other organs, so even if it is proven marijuana smoke is deadly in the long run it does not mean marijuana as a medicine is bad. If we were to say \u201cmarijuana hurts people, ban it\u201d then almost every prescription medication would need to be banned. Those medicines benefits outweigh their harms; I have proven the same applies to medical marijuana. Due to the fact robust research proves my side [1][2][3][5][6], I urge a vote for pro. 1. http://norml.org... 2. http://www.cannabis-med.org... 3. http://www.cmcr.ucsd.edu... 4. http://druglibrary.org... 5.

            "premise": "My opponent provides no source for the bold claim that up to forty percent of persons with BP disorder cannot tolerate standard treatment medications, or any suggestion of logic or evidence that cannaboids would be an exception. Even if my opponent's doubtful claims are true, the minimal impact of medical marijuana is easily negated by the 400+ toxins found in the substance. Additionally, THC has never been used as a controlled substance in the study of BP disorder, directly contradicting my opponents assumption that cannaboids could be used to combat the disease. Furthermore, marijuana has been proven to heighten the risk and intensity of the depressive states of bipolar disorder. My opponent's second main point is completely irrelevant. Unnecessary and harmful freedoms are not handed out to the terminally ill simply to ensure that they have a pleasant trip out of life. Doing such sets an unneeded and negative precedent to the rest of society. Honestly, \"happiness\" isn't an idea that falls under the umbrella of medicine, and the Affirmative plan draws no line if happiness was an acceptable use for medical marijuana. If I had a bad day at work, would I be justified in using harmful drugs as an escapism? The use of medical marijuana as a means to achieve happiness by escaping from life's problems is neither a just reason for assuming that societal harms achieved by legalizing marijuana, nor does it even fall under the concept of medical marijuana in the first place. In my opponent's final main point, he affirms that marijuana could be used as a method of pain relief. While this may be true, my opponent makes no claim or provides any evidence to suggest that medical marijuana would be a preferable option to pain relief medications already available, including Marinol. He asserts that experts could control the use of the drug, completely ignoring the already controlled substances already on the market. My opponent's claim that the legalization of medical marijuana would encourage research of the substance is irrelevant as the research of cannaboids is not prohibited by the negation of the resolution. What we must see is that current treatment options are far superior to the suggested use of medical marijuana, and any minuscule benefits are far outweighed by the harms of making marijuana easily available. Per the New York Times: \"In this environment, it was worrisome to read a first-person report in The Times on June 12, that the writer, a 31-year-old marathon runner, found it \"shockingly easy\" to obtain marijuana in San Francisco. Although she was in peak health, she sought medical marijuana on the grounds that she suffered a migraine headache every month or so. After her own health plan turned her down, she got a recommendation from a clinic doctor who never asked to see her medical records. His say-so was enough to get her an identification card from the city's health department, along with cards for two friends she had designated as \"primary caregivers\" so that they could pick up her marijuana if she felt too ill to fetch it herself. That laissez-faire transaction sounds like an easy target for anyone seeking to denigrate the whole program.\" It's obvious that the legalization of medical marijuana has been abused on a widespread basis. Taking the action suggested by Pro provides little to no benefit to those actually sick, while simultaneously harming society as a whole. Note that my opponent has failed to refute any portion of my case, and as of now it remains untouched. REQUEST: My opponent needs to provide evidence that says that a large portion of BP patients cannot tolerate Marinol but CAN tolerate natural cannaboids. He also must prove that marijuana would be a preferable option of pain relief when compared to current approved medications.

            "premise": "I want to thank Naraniro for this debate. First you say \"Marijuana addiction is rare\" That's true and 6%-10% of people become addicted to it. However you can't get high on it because of the lack of THC. So getting addicted to medical marijuana is extremely unlikely. Also Marijuana doesn't kill you unlike alcohol. They found in a study it takes about 20,000 to 40,000 times what most people use at once to kill you. Alcohol only takes about 10 times more then most use at once. Aside from that marijuana is used by doctors to treat seizures, crohn's disease, Nausea from chemo patients, and many many more things. In fact there was one story about a child who had almost 200 seizures a day. Nothing the doctors gave him worked except medicinal marijuana. Would you have that kid and thousand like him still go through there major medical issues just because you personally don't think they should they should be allowed to. As for the rest of your argument it's based on the false notion that medical marijuana is addictive which it isn't I'll leave links at the end of this argument. Maybe next time you will do a five second Google search because if you did you would know medical marijuana isn't addictive. Also link your source for your numbers.

            "conclusion": "Medical Marijuana",
            "premise": "I would like to thank 16kadams for proposing such an interesting topic to debate today. We agree on all definitions so let's now move onto the case. C1: Medical Marijuana has been medically proven to have numerous benefits. If need be, I could potentially use all my space going on about the medical benefits of marijuana and how marijuana can benefit us however I'll provide three different benefits today. Sub-Point A: Alzheimer's Disease (Thanks Danielle!) Lisa M. Eubanks, PhD, Staff Scientist at the Scripps Research Institute and the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology notes, \"THC and its analogues may provide an improved therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease [by] simultaneously treating both the symptoms and progression of Alzheimer's disease\" [1] Since the characterization of the Cannabis sativa produced cannabinoid, tetrahydrocannabinol in the 1960s, this natural product has been widely explored as an antiemetic, anticonvulsive, anti-inflammatory, and analdebilitating disease are critical as Alzheimer's disease afflicts over 20 million people worldwide, with the number of diagnosed cases continuing to rise at an exponential rate [2]. These studies have demonstrated the ability of cannabinoids to provide neuroprotection against amyloid peptide toxicity. [3] Thus we see that medical marijuana provides plausible assistance with a prevalent disease, Alzheimer's Disease. Sub-Point B- HIV/AIDS Numerous studies have shown that medical marijuana has benefited AIDS. While I urge the readers to do some research on their own, I'll summarize some of the results of experimentation. \u201cThe study, conducted at San Francisco General Hospital from 2003 to 2005 and published Monday in the journal Neurology, involved 50 patients suffering from HIV-related foot pain known as peripheral neuropathy. There are no drugs specifically approved to treat that kind of pain. Three times daily for nearly a week, the patients smoked marijuana cigarettes machine-rolled at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the only legal source for the drug recognized by the federal government. Half the patients received marijuana, while the other 25 received placebo cigarettes that lacked the drug's active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Scientists said the study was the first one published that used a comparison group, which is generally considered the gold standard for scientific research. Thirteen patients who received marijuana told doctors their pain eased by at least a third after smoking pot, while only six of those smoking placebos said likewise. The marijuana smokers reported an average pain reduction of 34 percent, double the drop reported by the placebo smokers as measured with a widely accepted pain scale.\u201d [4] Investigators at Columbia University published clinical trial data in 2007 showing that HIV/AIDS patients who inhaled cannabis four times daily experienced substantial increases in food intake with little evidence of discomfort and no impairment of cognitive performance. They concluded that smoked marijuana has a clear medical benefit in HIV-positive patients. [5] In another study in 2008, researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that marijuana significantly reduces HIV-related neuropathic pain when added to a patient's already-prescribed pain management regimen and may be an \"effective option for pain relief\" in those whose pain is not controlled with current medications. Mood disturbance, physical disability, and quality of life all improved significantly during study treatment. [6]Medical Marijuana also has numerous ways to help treat HIV/AIDS, yet another epidemic in today's society. Sub-Point C: Cancer According to a 2007 study at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, cannabidiol (CBD) may stop breast cancer from spreading throughout the body. [7] A study by Complutense University of Madrid found the chemicals in marijuana promotes the death of brain cancer cells by essentially helping them feed upon themselves in a process called autophagy. The research team discovered that cannabinoids such as THC had anticancer effects in mice with human brain cancer cells and in people with brain tumors. When mice with the human brain cancer cells received the THC, the tumor shrank. Usingelectron microscopes to analyze brain tissue taken both before and after a 26- to 30-day THC treatment regimen, the researchers found that THC eliminated cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact. [8] Cannabis has been found to help cancer patients with pain and nausea, and recent research indicates it has tumor-reducing and anti-carcinogenic properties properties as well. It has proven highly effective at controlling the nausea associated with chemotherapy, and its appetite-stimulation properties help combat wasting. Cannabis can also help control the pain associated with some cancers, as well as that resulting from radiation and chemotherapy treatment. [9]Finally, we can come to the conclusion that Medical Marijuana can help cure cancer. When we look back, I have provided three benefits for three prevalent diseases: Alzheimer's Disease, HIV/AIDS, as well as cancer. I could go on and on discussing mental disorder benefits as well as Glaucoma, but I don't want to bore the readers and I urge them to do some of their own research. C2: The government should not decide whether medical marijuana should be illegal or not, let the competent doctors decide. This whole issue comes down to simply whether or not medical marijuana should be prescribed by doctors. The federal government should not have its say in determining whether or not the doctors can prescribe the marijuana or not. We should allow the experienced doctors to determine whether or not a patient should receive marijuana, not the federal government. Thus, when we look onto the doctor's opinions we see doctors believe it should be prescribed. According to the Wall Street Journal's Health Blog: The American College of Physicians, 124,000 members strong, has issued a 13-page position paper asking the federal government to drop marijuana from its classification as a substance considered to have no medicinal value and a high chance of abuse . . . \"They've said essentially that the federal government has it all wrong,\" Bruce Mirken, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, [says]. [10] Along with this association, numerous doctors and individuals believe that medical marijuana should be prescribed. At the point at which the competent individuals and the ones who spend their whole entire lives working in the field of medicine believe it should be prescribed, why would the federal government have any say? I can provide more sources and more examples but I think when you look at what I have provided throughout all the sources (most from doctors) you can come to the conclusion that doctors believe it is a necessity and obligatory to legalize medical marijuana. Conclusion: Medical marijuana has been empirically proven to benefit diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS. Many doctors want to legalize marijuana and the experienced doctors should decide whether medical marijuana should be legal or not, not a governing body. Let the decision rest upon the individuals who spend their lives working in the field of medicine, not those who do not have enough knowledge on the topic. By letting this occur, we see many doctors are in favor of legalizing medical marijuana and it would have enormous positive impacts on today's society and well-being. For these reasons, I urge a PRO vote. See http://www.debate.org... sources.",

Diseases like cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy, and many other mental disorders are all well treated with marijuana. Marijuana is capable of killing pain and helps rise your metabolism. It has been proved that marijuana is better than pain killers. Marijuana has been legalized in 18 states, and in most of them marijuana is less costly than many medical prescriptions that treat pain. Marijuana has been legal during the 1930s-1940s, and later on this medical treatment has been becoming more limited (1).Here is what doctors say about medicinal marijuana:1. 69% of doctors say it can help with specific illnesses.2. 67% it should be an opportunity for many patients.3. 56% agree making it legal throughout the world.4. 50% of doctors agree it should be legal in their state.5. 52% call for making new laws on medical marijuana in their state (2).[1]: http://www.teenink.com...[2]: http://www.medscape.com...",

            "premise": "IntroductionI would like to begin by thanking my opponent for his argument. I personally believe his case was weak. I intend to prove that in my rebuttals below. I hope the judges consider all of this information when choosing the winner. RebuttalsMy opponent begins by stating what medical marijuana can be used for, as I did. He quoted webmd.com, which said \"cannabinoids in marijuana can weaken the immune system.\" The key word here is 'can'. It does not necessarily mean it will. Next, the source says, \"long-term use of marijuana can make lung problems worse.\" Again, there is a key word that must be acknowledged: 'long-term'. Not all patients will take medical cannabis for the long-term. I do not believe this to be a sufficient argument against medical marijuana. Also, my opponent has chosen to ignore the fact that marijuana does not need to be smoked. It can be consumed by drinking, eating, injecting, et cetera. I hope my opponent acknowledges this and addresses this in his rebuttals. He also states potential side effects medical marijuana may cause. They are, according to his source, \"[d]rowsiness, dry mouth, giddiness, hunger, insomnia, red eyes, respiratory issues, short-term memory loss, and uneasiness or anxiety.\" These side effects, when you truly think about it, are minor. I urge my opponent, the viewers, and the judges to compare the potential side effects of medical marijuana to its potential and highl likely benefits. My opponent states, \"[a]s you can see, it can be used to help people, but the effects are not always the same. For some people, medical marijuana can cure seizures, while it may make the disorder worse for other people. Currently, marijuana has not been fully tested, which means it should not be used. Unstable drugs should not be used in people. One could argue that it is human experimentation, which is not legal. Doctors are not always aware of the side effects medicinal marijuana could have on people. It is different depending on the person.\" This statement and, really, my opponent's entire argument is not sufficient. I urge the viewers and judges to carefully consider this. My opponent makes arguments that are proven false by mine. I would like to point out an aspect of this debate he ignored fully. I said and sourced, \"[m]arijuana has two main components: THC and CBD. CBD (cannabidiol) will reduce brain activity and will lower the occurances of seizures.THC is what causes one to be high. Breeding marijuana to have low THC and high CBD will be effective. This, along with other genetic modifications, will make marijuana a safe treatment. \" My opponent fully ignored this statement. He has ignored the fact that marijuana can be bred to have certain traits. He is arguing about traditional marijuana while I am arguing about marijuana in general, whether it is traditional or bred. This one fact refutes his entire argument. I hope he and the judges acknowledge that. There is another aspect my opponent has chosen to ignore. I made the following statement: \"One can easily be addicted to pills, tablets, serums, and other forms of medications, but medical marijuana is rarely a substance that is addicted to. I do not deny that marijuana, when used in a large amount, is damaging, but you are aware that medical marijuana overdoses and addictions are virtually unheard of, yes?\" This means that traditional medicine may not be the best choice. This means that marijuana is a very, very safe alternative drug to treat certain conditions and diseases. This has been fully ignored by my opponent. I want him to address this in his refutations. My opponent states, \"[i]n conclusion, medical marijuana is dangerous and has more bad side effects than good. This is why I do not support it. I hope my opponent can see that there are better ways to cure things than with cannabis.\" My opponent, again, ignored key aspects of my argument. For certain conditions, there are no successful treatments yet. Now, I adore science and I know a lot about it, so I do know that safer treatments will be found in the future. However, for now, marijuana is the safest alternative to addictive pills and tablets. ConclusionIn my opponent's rebuttals, I hope to see a sufficient defense of his arguments as well as relevant, factual refutations of my argument, which I do not believe he or anyone else can do. I do wish him good luck, but he will have to work hard in order to win this debate. Jamccartney is a very close friend of mine and I know him very well. He is a determined, intelligent individual. However, I do not believe he has shown this in this debate. I hope this changes. BibliographyI have no sources for this particular round. I believe my sources already are more reliable than my opponent's and I want the judges to consider this. Sources are not required here. Common sense and logic is one of the many weapons in my arsenal. I have facts - solid facts, which I have presented efficiently - that prove marijuana for medical purposes is beneficial. I do not require sources now.",

            "premise": "\"The illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world.\" - Carl SaganAlthough there exist many benefits associated with the legalization of marijuana, including economic, moral, civil, and societal advantages, in this round I will attempt to build my case solely by focusing on only two primary contentions; namely, 1) the medical benefits of marijuana, and 2) the level safety associated with using marijuana. Ultimately, the criteria of a good medication is one that can provide a worthwhile medicinal benefit without resulting in any unreasonable side-effects; I believe marijuana fulfills this criteria, and should therefore be legalized for medicinal use.The Medicinal Benefits of Marijuana:The legalization of medical marijuana would undoubtedly result in the relief of millions of suffering people who seek to find an escape from their significantly numerous ailments; in fact, various authoritative studies have consistently confirmed that Marijuana treats and prevents glaucoma, epileptic seizures, cancer, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, muscle tension, muscle spasm, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, chronic pain, and various other medical problems [1] [2]. Marijuana has also surprisingly been observed to help consumers increase their lung capacity, as well as provide them relief from the symptoms that accompany treatment of hepatitis C [3]. These studies have been performed, reported, and confirmed by non-partisan medical organizations and universities [4]. For example, Business Insider has reported on the following findings related to the medical benefits associated with marijuana use:Cancer: \"One chemical found in marijuana, called cannabidiol, prevents cancer from spreading, researchers at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco reported in 2007. Cannabidiol stops cancer by turning of a gene called Id-1, the study, published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, found. Cancer cells make more copies of this gene than non-cancerous cells, and it helps them spread through the body. The researchers studied breast cancer cells in the lab that had high expression levels of Id-1 and treated them with cannabidiol. After treatment the cells had decreased Id-1 expression and were less aggressive spreaders [5].\"Alzheimer's: \"Marijuana may be able to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, a study led by Kim Janda of the Scripps Research Institute suggests. The 2006 study, published in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics found that THC, the active chemical in marijuana, slows the formation of amyloid plaques by blocking the enzyme in the brain that makes them. These plaques are what kill brain cells and cause Alzheimers [6].\"Multiple Sclerosis:\"Marijuana may ease painful symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis, a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in May suggests. Jody Corey-Bloom studied 30 multiple sclerosis patients with painful contractions in their muscles. These patients didn't respond to other treatments, but after smoking marijuana for a few days they were in less pain [7].\"Arthritis: \"Marijuana alleviates pain, reduces inflammation, and promotes sleep, which may help relieve pain and discomfort for people with rheumatoid arthritis, researchers announced in 2011. Researchers from rheumatology units at several hospitals gave their patients, sativex, a cannabinoid-based pain-relieving medicine. After a two week period, people on Sativex had a significant reduction in pain and improved sleep quality compared to placebo users [8].\"Of course, this isn't to say that there are no negative side-effects of Marijuana -- there are; however, the negative properties of cannabis pale in comparison to its positive ones. In any case, it's no secret that the vast majority of legal medications possess at least one or many negative side-effects themselves.Therefore, despite the potential downfalls of marijuana, I submit that its abundant positive properties make it a justified candidate for legalization, especially considering the fact that many other legal medications possess similar or even worse side-effects [9].Marijuana Compared to Alcohol and Tobacco:One of the most perplexing realities surrounding the illegalization of medicinal marijuana is the fact that many other legal substances and are much more dangerous, particularly alcohol and tobacco; for example, http://www.saferchoice.org... provides the following comparisons between alcohol and marijuana:1) People die from alcohol overdoses; there has never been a fatal marijuana overdose2) Alcohol use damages the brain; marijuana use does not3) Alcohol use is linked to cancer; marijuana use is not4) Alcohol is more addictive than marijuana5) Alcohol use contributes to aggressive and violent behavior; marijuana use does not6) Alcohol use contributes to the likelihood of domestic abuse and sexual assault; marijuana use does notFurthermore, the following comparisons can be drawn between marijuana and tobacco:1) Over 400,000 people die every year from tobacco; no one has ever died directly from the use of marijuana [10]2) Tobacco causes cancer; marijuana does not [11]3) Marijuana is not as harmful to the lungs as tobacco smoke [12]Therefore, considering the fact that alcohol and tobacco are legal for recreational use, I submit that marijuana should certainly be legal for medicinal use, especially considering the fact that alcohol and tobacco are significantly more dangerous.________________________________________________________________________________________________[1] http://health.howstuffworks.com...[2] http://www.businessinsider.com...[3] Ibid.[4] Ibid.[5] Ibid.[6] Ibid.[7] Ibid[8] Ibid.[9] http://www.opposingviews.com...[10] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...[11] Ibid.[12] Ibid.",

Secondly, I would like to begin with stating my arguments and reasons. Because this is not the round for rebuttals, I will not talk about Pro's main argument until round 3. Arguments Facts about medical marijuana: Medical marijuana can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting, treating HIV/AIDS, and reducing muscle pain (Wikipedia). It can also prevent epilepsy. However, it works \"by binding to specific sites in the brain and on the nerves (WEBMD).\" All chemicals that bind to the brain are dangerous. Here are it's uses: Improving appetite for people with AIDS Glaucoma Multiple Sclerosis Why it should not be used: According to webmd.com, \"cannabinoids in marijuana can weaken the immune system\", \"long-term use of marijuana can make lung problems worse\", \"marijuana might make seizure disorders worse in some people [(in other people it might help to control seizures)]\", and \"it might slow the central nervous system too much when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery (WEBMD).\" Here are some other common side effects of using marijuana for medicinal purposes: Drowsiness, dry mouth, giddiness, hunger, insomnia, red eyes, respiratory issues, short-term memory loss, and uneasiness or anxiety (Southwest Medical Evaluation Center). As you can see, it can be used to help people, but the effects are not always the same. For some people, medical marijuana can cure seizures, while it may make the disorder worse for other people. Currently, marijuana has not been fully tested, which means it should not be used. Unstable drugs should not be used in people. One could argue that it is human experimentation, which is not legal. Other treatments: Anyone who knows as much as I do about biology knows that there are plenty of other ways to cure illnesses. I am sure Pro is aware of this as well. For certain diseases, such as diabetes, people need insulin. Getting insulin used to be difficult. Now, however, we genetically altered a certain bacteria to generate it. Using that knowledge, one can assume that there are other cures to epilepsy, glaucoma, and sclerosis. Conclusion In this round, I have stated the pros and cons to medical marijuana. As Pro, as well as the viewers can see, there are more downsides to it that upsides. The list of cons is longer and the alternative cures are obvious. Here is my conclusion: Using marijuana for medicinal use is unnecessary and should not be done. I patiently await Pro's rebuttals. Thank you. MLA Citations \"Medical Cannabis.\" Wikipedia.

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's). I will begin by presenting all my points and their subset points for legalization. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose (if you don't however, I will assume you either acknowledge/agree with my point or cannot refute it). I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. If you do not understand anything I say, simply ask and I will clarify, no need to be rude.My Points1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization.a) Marijuana is not addictive.b) It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuanac) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true.d) The logic of the gateway theory is fundamentally flawed and therefore it cannot be truee) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. calmness, changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user (although it would be anyway).f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreasedg) Assuming it is true that marijuana's psychoactive potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged.2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization.a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the countryb)The medical benefits (known and to be known) of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for manyc) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, reducing drugged driving)d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.e) Gang violence and crime revolving around marijuana will be greatly decreased.f) Legalization's resulting industry would create jobs and generally benefit the national economy.g) Marijuana education would be healthy for both youth and adults (because now the only education is lies unless you dig deeper).3.Marijuana Prohibition altogether is a colossal failure.a)The whole purpose of cannabis prohibition is to prevent use nationwide, yet, cannabis use is still very prevalent.b)Because of point a, the adverse societal effects of marijuana (however minuscule) are in effect despite it's prohibition, ergo prohibition is purposeless.c)marijuana prohibition is exactly the same as the 20's alcohol prohibition save for the failure to end it.4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for the nation.a) Proof of the government's failure to do this is how a constitutional amendment was needed to sign alcohol prohibition into law (and is now being used to prohibit marijuana). This means that the views/values this nation was built on differ from those that allow/support prohibition.",

            "premise": "====== Rebuttal ====== [QUOTE] 1) Beneficial in health. As noted by my own opponent, medical marijuana can help alleviate symptoms of pain, discomfort, and lack of appetite caused by many common disease, including AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, etc. This can go uncontested, as my opponent has already agreed that medical marijuana has these properties. Of course, there are even more benefits of marijuana, such as a prevention of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and its progression. (1)(2) A legalization of medical marijuana would aid those who are in pain from said diseases and symptoms. [/QUOTE] The main chemical used in \"medical marijuana\" that helps to manage disease is Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC. While THC can be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases, the parts of the cannabis plant used to make \"medical marijuana\" contain only 3% THC. In order to intake this measly amount of THC, the patient must also assume the numerous harms of taking marijuana itself, including the intake over 400 hazardous chemicals and numerous psychological and physiological hazards. Not only that but the few good things that marijuana brings to the medical industry have already been isolated and incorporated into a FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug called Marinol. Marinol preserves the benefits of THC while lessening or eliminating the harms brought about by Marijuana consumption. Medical professionals have noticed the notable effects of certain narcotics in the suppression of pain. Does that mean that they legalize opium or heroin? Obviously no because pharmacists can isolate the positive effects of pain suppression and reduce the rather negative effects of extreme addiction and potential for homicidal rage. Why, then, legalize medical marijuana, when the aforementioned pharmaceutical drugs are superior in every regard to marijuana? [QUOTE] 2) Reduce number of those in prison. The current amount of arrests of marijuana-related crimes totals over 700,000 thousand a year, and that was back in 2005! (3) Of these, a whopping 88% were just for simple possession, while the rest were only for sale or manufacture. (3) These inmates who have done nothing morally wrong or reprehensible are now spending years and years in prison, just for possessing or growing marijuana. 3) Help cut our spending. We currently spend more than 15.5 billion dollars a year on marijuana arrests. (4) If legalized and taxed, not only would we eliminate that spending, but we would also have a major source of revenue that would help pull us out of this recession, as marijuana is our best cash crop, pulling in $35 billion dollars per year. (5)(6) [/QUOTE] Instead of sending those people to prison, we could just make them pay a citation and the citation would depend on how much marijuana the person possesses. This would also help the recession while keeping marijuana illegal. [QUOTE] 4) Little to no side effects. Marijuana causes a very small amount of, if at all, side effects, which are negligible at best. (7)(8) 5) It doesn't make any sense to render it illegal. And that's the crux of the matter, isn't it? It is not overly harmful, if at all, and it doesn't have any second-hand smoke effects. There is simply no logical/moral reason to keep it illegal. No one should have a right to tell you what you can and cannot ingest. You don't violate the rights of others in any way, shape or form, so why should it be illegal? There is not convincing argument as to why. [/QUOTE] This is obviously false. Depending on the user Marijuana usually causes the user to become hungry, lazy, paranoid, etc... Marijuana could cause obesity from hunger and that's if the user can get food. If the user can't get food in time, they will die of starvation. Marijuana could cause people to be lazy and therefore if marijuana was legal, The recession would actually be worse. Marijuana could cause people to be paranoid and lose trust in others causing them to go insane and crime rate may possibly go up and thus, this would do harm to others. ======= Arguments ======= 1)People say that marijuana can make the user \"happy.\" Unnecessary and harmful freedoms are not handed out to the terminally ill simply to ensure that they have a pleasant trip out of life. Doing such sets an unneeded and negative precedent to the rest of society. Honestly, \"happiness\" isn't an idea that falls under the umbrella of medicine, and the Affirmative plan draws no line if happiness was an acceptable use for medical marijuana. If I had a bad day at work, would I be justified in using harmful drugs as an escapism? The use of medical marijuana as a means to achieve happiness by escaping from life's problems is neither a just reason for assuming that societal harms achieved by legalizing marijuana, nor does it even fall under the concept of medical marijuana in the first place. 2)What we must see is that current treatment options are far superior to the suggested use of medical marijuana, and any minuscule benefits are far outweighed by the harms of making marijuana easily available. 3)It's obvious that the legalization of medical marijuana has been abused on a widespread basis. Taking the action suggested by Pro provides little to no benefit to those actually sick, while simultaneously harming society as a whole. 4) Marinol is a better alternative to medical marijuana. ===== Sources ===== http://www.homedrugtestingkit.com... http://www.drugs.com... http://www.justice.gov...",

            "premise": "First of all I would like to thank my opponent for responding. My opponent chastised me for mentioning other drugs when the debate is on marijuana, but I was merely pointing out the inconsistencies in our drug laws. Furthermore, he goes on to cite the smoking baby, and since he is addicted to regular cigarettes and not marijuana that too would not be relevant to the debate at hand. \"Yes, many drugs on t.v. list a long list of side effects, but one must take into account that those warnings are for legal purposes so that no one can sue the drug company for getting nauseous when taking the drug.\" Yes, and the same such warnings may apply to marijuana for legal reasons, that does not prove that it is so much worse for you. \"Same thing with drinking alcohol and then driving. Thats illegal, but people do it none the less. Legalizing marijuana would allow people to do things while under the influence of THC, and that puts the rest of us at risk.\" Yes, exactly, that just reinforces what I was saying that you responded to. Any time we discuss drugs we must weigh the benefits against the risks. There are some in the medical community who promote marijuana as an effective treatment option. [1] You mention how marijuana is not for everyone, and it is not the first choice. That may be true, however, that does not mean it is not a choice at all. It works for some people where other drugs have failed. If you are concerned with the risk of abuse, dispensaries can have the same oversight as any pharmacy. [2] According to many experts, if a lethal dose of marijuana exists it is almost impossible to attain, as opposed to other drugs which can be quite easy to Overdose on even accidentally. [3] Thanks again to my opponent and I would look forward to his conclusion. 1 http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org... 2 http://www.lansingstatejournal.com... 3 http://www.druglibrary.org...",

            "premise": "\"It should be noted that while marijuana does have side effects and a potential for harm, almost every drug does as well. The only sources that my opponent has nonchalantly thrown out that are actually against marijuana don't even discuss medical use.\"So you concede at last that it does have side effects. And I concede that other medicines have side effects. But not as bad as marijuana. Side effects for marijuana:1. Deppressionthis is indefinatly linked to marijuana2. Smoking marijuana poses some risks. As hard as it may be for some of you to believe, no matter how much you want to believe it, marijuana isn't all good. Smoking anything physically hurts your body. Anything that burns gives off carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide kills brain cells.3. Gives lung cancer like tobacco. And is that used mediccally?4. Gives mouth cancer like tobacco. 5. As proved above causes anxiety6. Fear7. Shrinks brain. GO her if you don't belive me: http://www.webmd.com...So yes other medicines may have side effects, none this severe ost of the time. \"So yes apparently the FDA did issue a blanket statement disregarding all medicinal values of medical marijuana. This does not by any means mean it should be illegal.\"We are not arguing the legality of the drug. \"This does not by any means mean it should be illegal. In fact many medical institutions have been negatively stigmatizing the FDA for making such lavish claims.\"Cool ou brought in a doctor, the FDA is full of them. Their full of researchers too. Their job it to regulate medicines and have proof when needed to ban them. They have provided a lot of proof. So yes one doctor is mad, but a whoe team of scientists, doctors, and reasearchers agree with me. (I think I messpelled it lol). Here is the FDA on medical marijuana when asked the question in a sepere time:\"Marijuana is listed in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the most restrictive schedule. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which administers the CSA, continues to support that placement and FDA concurred because marijuana met the three criteria for placement in Schedule I under 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(1) (e.g., marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision). Furthermore, there is currently sound evidence that smoked marijuana is harmful. A past evaluation by several Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA), concluded that no sound scientific studies supported medical use of marijuana for treatment in the United States, and no animal or human data supported the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use.\" So they prove my abuse hery as well. So goverment +doctors+scientists=con med marijuana. \"There is really no solidification of this contention as he agrees so this has successfully been shot down because marijuana never causes Schizophrenia. Con then goes on to helplessly try to justify this by bringing up some \"Pro marijuana legilizaation dude\" (nobody knows what legilizaation is) and states how he believes it is true. This is bad conduct because there is no explanation, no source, and no credibility.\" So he is the source...duh. Also accusing people of bad conduct when they havdone nothing wrong means you are the person with bad conduct. As I said, it is POSSIBLY linked to Schizophrenia. But as a patient would you really wanna take that chance? And by the way you are incorect, there is a source listed under it. \"As far as the testicular cancer issue goes, I have significantly shot this down yet again and Con just spews out another source but I have proven that this is just another confusion of correlation and causation so we shall move on now. \" I said POSSIBLY linked I belive somewhere. And once again, as a patient do you really want to take this chance? Also as a doctor is it does cause this and your patient comes back with testicular cancer, and this time with a lawyer do you really wan't to take this chance? So it is all about how much you value your life. \"He states that there is a possibility for one to be aggressive but there is no evidence that this has caused aggression but there is some relation.\" You just concede that there was relation. And my goverment sources said that it DOES cause aggression. \"This rebuttal is going to be rather brief for I have already shot it down and he simply restated the same thing. \" Yes I did repeat, I proved that it is bad for the immune system, the thing aids effects. So why worsen the desiese? I will provide another quote on that: Donald P. Tashkin, MD, in his 2001 article \"Effects of Smoked Marijuana on the Lung and Its Immune Defenses: Implications for Medicinal Use in HIV-Infected Patients,\" published in the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics, stated: \"Frequent marijuana use can cause airway injury, lung inflammation and impaired pulmonary defense against infection. The major potential pulmonary consequences of habitual marijuana use of particular relevance to patients with AIDS is superimposed pulmonary infection, which could be life threatening in the seriously immonocompromised patient.In view of the immonosuppressive effect of THC, the possibility that regular marijuana use could enhance progression of HIV infection itself needs to be considered, although this possibility remains unexplored to date.\" \"I am begginning to run out of space but first off addiction can simply be solved with less prescription and I have already proven that it is not addictive and it is never considered addictive anymore.\" DO you understand medicine? As a son of a doctor I do. If you have a sickness you need a certian amount o the medicine, to much is bad, to little is bad too. So you contradict yourself. If it is a medicine then lowering the perscription would hurt the patient. Also under the drug laws passed undenixon it is addictive. Also the experts I quoted prove my point, it is addictive. \"Con fails to justify any alternatives whatsoever and just posts links\" I named them the first time. \"Con fails to justify how Marijuana should be illegal\" we still are not arguing the legality. \"With his logic many drugs should be illegal and he never really refutes the benefits but rather spews out sources.\" I refuted the first time and you didn't even defend your arguments. I added on to mine to defend them. And since in debate dropsare concessions you conceded most of my rebutals and your rebuttals are just critisism. Talk about conduct. And since you said that we need to post arguments then actually quote your video. Conclusion: I am bad at debate so I may heve sucked, but this last round I destroed his rebutals and his obnoxious remarks. (sorry I need to use spell check but I do not). Also your sources are flawed as they are doctors that are not even specialists. My rebuttals are linked to profesionals and groups linked to the subject. Also carl sagan is a pro legalization advocate, biassed. VOTE CON! please. thanks for the debate =)",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana Should Be Legal For Medicinal Purposes",
            "premise": "My opponent raises various criticisms against my arguments, particularly concerning the medical benefits of the substance; he also presents contentions against the relativity of my alcohol/tobacco argument; therefore, I shall attempt address all such arguments herein.Alcohol and Tobacco:As my opponent rightly states, using the dangerous effects of alcohol and tobacco alone to advocate the medical legality of a particular substance is certainly insufficient to make my case; however, the point I am trying to make is that given marijuana's medical advantages, it should be a legal medical substance, especially considering that alcohol and tobacco are legal for recreational use.Obviously if my opponent effectively demonstrates that marijuana possesses no legitimate medical benefits, then his point is valid; however, seeing as how my position advocates the medically advantageous nature of marijuana, my argument should stand to be considered.Medical Benefits of Marijuana:Cancer:Here my opponent asserts that my original source took medical information out of context; however, I believe such a claim is simply incorrect. The medical article from which my source asserts the beneficial effects of marijuana on cancer states that \"CBD [cannabidiol] represents the first nontoxic exogenous agent that can significantly decrease Id-1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cells leading to the down-regulation of tumor aggressiveness [1].\"Given such information, it's perfectly accurate to claim that marijuana, which contains cannabidiol, provides beneficial effects for individuals suffering from cancer; moreover, contrary to what my opponent claims, CBD is indeed found in marijuana; in fact, it constitutes about 40% of its extracts [2].Moreover, as I've stated before, marijuana doesn't just help with breast cancer; rather, THC (a primary chemical found in marijuana) also helps destroy brain cancer cells [3], and research has provided immensely compelling evidence of marijuana's ability to reduce up to 50% of tumor growth in common lung cancer, as well as prevent the spread of the cancer significantly [4]. All of these studies have been conducted and confirmed by esteemed and authoritative universities, including Harvard, UCLA, and the University in Madrid, Spain.Not only does this information provide convincing evidence of marijuana's ability to prevent and treat cancer, but also puts my opponent's assertion that marijuana only serves as an anesthetic in serious doubt.Alzheimer's:Here my opponent again claims at marijuana is only an anesthetic, and asserts that the substance has no beneficial effects on individuals suffering from Alzheimer's; however, contrary my opponent's claims, marijuana has been found to inhibit amyloid plaque (a primary pathological marker) much more effectively than other currently medically approved substances. In fact, a study conducted by Scripps Research Institute and published in the Journal of Molecular Pharmaceutics states that THC is a \"considerably superior inhibitor of [amyloid plaque] aggregation [5].\"This information again refutes my opponent's claim that marijuana is only an anesthetic, as well as effectively demonstrates that individuals suffering from Alzheimer's do in fact experience medically beneficial effect as a result of using marijuana.My opponent also raises contentions concerning the fact that marijuana results in increased heart rate, as well as the fact that it contains up to 50-70% more carcinogens than tobacco; however, what my opponent has failed to mention is that no one has ever been reported to have died directly from marijuana use [6]; as such, my opponent has failed to establish that these side-effects present any real potential danger for users of the substance. Moreover, in 2006, a research team from UCLA found that marijuana did not exhibit any apparent risk of raising the chance of lung cancer in users [7].Multiple Sclerosis:Here my opponent contends that for individuals suffering from Multiple Sclerosis, marijuana doesn't actually treat the disease itself; but rather, one of its symptoms (spastic movement). Unfortunately, I don't see how this is a valid point when arguing against the position that marijuana should be legalized as a medical substance. Is my opponent asserting that medications which treat symptoms should not be legal for medical use? Surely he doesn't believe that there are no such things as medications which seek to treat the symptoms of diseases, rather than the diseases themselves.My opponent also raises further contentions concerning the \"cognitive effects\" which may result from marijuana use; however, as I've already stated my previous rounds, the evidence is not at all conclusive that there is any correlation between marijuana use and negative cognitive side-effects.Arthritis:Again, how is the fact that marijuana can't heal every single aspect of an ailment a valid argument against it being legalized as medical substance? Simply because marijuana works as a pain-killer in the case of arthritis (not as an end-all solution) is no reason to say that it shouldn't be legalized for medicinal use, especially considering the positive effects which have been reported as a result of marijuana use from people suffering from arthritis [8].Negative Side-Effects Associated With Marijuana:Carcinogens:As I've stated before, there are many ways to consume marijuana which do not include smoking it; therefore, this argument is moot. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier in this round, a research team from UCLA was unable to identify any apparent risk of increased chances of lung cancer in people who used marijuana.Immune-System Deficiency:My opponent again raises the contention that marijuana presents risks to an individual's immune system; however, I have already addressed this claim in the previous round. Allow me to quote myself:\"Just as heart disease, the claim that marijuana use results in immune system deficiency is unsupported by any conclusive evidence. A review by Dr. Leo Hollister states that 'the evidence [on immune suppression] has been contradictory and is more supportive of some degree of immunosuppression only when one considers in vitro studies. These have been seriously flawed by the very high concentrations of drug used to produce immunosuppression. The closer that experimental studies have been to actual clinical situations, the less compelling has been the evidence.'\"I also provided an interesting quote from norml.org last round on this matter. I encourage my opponent to read it again.Impaired Cognitive Functions:Many legal medications result in impaired cognitive functions, especially in various types of sleeping medications. As a report on pubmed.org states, \"iatrogenically induced cognitive deficits are common with pharmacological therapy [9].\"Unsafe Production:Unsafe production is the result of lacking regulation. With marijuana fully legalized as a medical substance and regulated by the food and drug administration, such a problem would no longer present a problem; therefore, I submit that my opponent's point is moot.I am not saying marijuana has no side-effects at all -- most medications do. But the benefits of marijuana far outweigh its faults.Given this information, I encourage voters to vote in favor of the resolution.________________________________________________________________________________________________[1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...[2] http://en.wikipedia.org...[3] http://www.medicalnewstoday.com...[4] http://www.sciencedaily.com...[5] http://www.scripps.edu...[6] http://www.webmd.com...[7] http://www.webmd.com...[8] http://www.huffingtonpost.com...[9] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...",

First of all my opponent points to where his source says \"medical marijuana is not right for every patient.\" If you have ever seen a drug commercial on TV they say that about just about everything, while they are listing off the long list of side effects. Morphine is a drug often prescribed as an anesthetic or painkiller, yet it has worse side effects than marijuana and is more addictive and is an opiate. [1] [2] [3] There are proven benefits with less problems. [4] [5] It helps with cancer and is less devastating to health than chemo. [6] \" Marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory.\" Which is why people taking it shouldn't be allowed to drive or do certain tasks that require high levels of motor skills, just like some other drugs. \"Studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and schizophrenia.\" This is also true of many antidepressants when prescribed to teenagers. Other research has shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. Marijuana smoke, in fact, contains 50\u201070 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke\" There are other ways to ingest marijuana rather than just smoking it. For consistency, if we were going to make marijuana illegal for medical purposes shouldn't opiates such as morphine and oxycodone and codeine also be illegal even as prescriptions?

Having yet another option that a doctor may, but need not necessarily prescribe or utilize, only adds more options for the medical system to serve patients.

Then he state that herion smokers started to increase which is actual a fasle statement. since 1983 to 2010 their was a study of herion addicts in the neatherlands. Their obsveration actually said it decreased about 30 percent due to a heroin-assisted treatment that was a trial now required for herion addicts. Since they havent had to worry about looking for people with marijuana since legale. There goverment was actually able to put more time and money towrds rehabltion towards other drugs. One more thing that people are more likely to get marijuana that is laest with something other than pot. Than would probaly have a chance of getting addict to harder drugs due to withdraws of the laest marijuana. prohibition of marijuana For cons theory as a flaw to it thought. Even if people due illegeale drugs for the sake of it. If marijuana was legal the police force can actually put in more time in stoping these other harder more danguose drugs that are being sold on the street. i sated majruiana isnt a gate way drug ethier but con didnt understand what i was trying to say about \"the link between hard drugs would be broken\". What the meaning of that was since dealers sold drugs other than just marijuana. Then they be able to sell to an imprasable clinet. due to the fact that the person has mostly brought pot from him before. So in the person mind he was able to have a sence of trust which is actually false not understanding his money is just profit. So if legaling marjuana people can just go to a store and buy it in a safer place unlike the streets. When i stated link between harder drugs would be broken, i ment that people wont know as many dealers due to the fact they can just go to stores and buy marijuana. instread of haveing a chance of getting sold a harder drug from the same dealer. http://en.wikipedia.org...medical marijuana con stated that he personaly hasnt heard of anyone ever over doesing on over the counter nusea drugs. I just want to state that over 100 million peoples lives are taken away with just over doesing on Tylenol, Paracetamol. This is just one over the counter drug that killls people each day. Now i want to state like all these over the counter drugs marjiuana can be prescribed in does too. So if a patient takes marijuana that can help the rest of their lives they dont have to have strong type of cannibis. Actually they are most likely able to get mids. What is not even a fourth as strong as eating cookies or brownies. Another thing is not one person in the world has every died from smoking just marijuana. http://www.natap.org...For taxtion of marijuana con states that people can just grow their marijuana in their house as easy as growing fruits and vegtables. As i satted before thought not every person is able to due this due to time and other things on their schedual. A majiorty of the peole are going to go to stores to buy their mariuana. In genral the econmoy is going to make a bigger net profit than lost from taxting marijuana. conclusionCon has stated that marijuana should stay illegale. The reason he state this is frist people doing drugs for the sake of doing drugs. honestly people do do drugs that are legal too. So i fmarijuana was lega the goverment would be able to worry more sbout dealers selling harder drugs. Even be able to put more time and money in rehabiltion towards those people doing harder drugs like the neatherlands. That goes the same for orginzed crimes too. the police foruce would be able to fouces more on these bigger dealers with the harder drugs. For the taxtion of marijuana he beilves that most people are just going to figure a way to beat the system in taxing marijuana. As i stated before not everyone has the time or the place to even grow marijuana. that menas the nation will make a profit in taxting marijuana. Marijuana it self has a compund (T.H.C). that can honestly help prevent alot of deiases and even cancer. Thi slittle canibbis can be very befincal too this nation if the goverment ever legalelized it.",

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's). I will begin by presenting all my points and their subset points for legalization. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose (if you don't however, I will assume you either acknowledge/agree with my point or cannot refute it). I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. If you do not understand anything I say, simply ask and I will clarify, no need to be rude.My Points1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization.a) Marijuana is not addictive.b) It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuanac) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true.d) The logic of the gateway theory is fundamentally flawed and therefore it cannot be truee) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. calmness, changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user (although it would be anyway).f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreasedg) Assuming it is true that marijuana's psychoactive potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged.2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization.a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the countryb)The medical benefits (known and to be known) of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for manyc) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, reducing drugged driving)d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.e)Cannabis integration would benefit our culture and uphold our rights as a nation under the constitution.f ) Gang violence and crime revolving around marijuana will be greatly decreased.g) Legalization's resulting industry would create jobs and generally benefit the national economy.h) Marijuana education would be healthy for both youth and adults (because now the only education is lies unless you dig deeper).3.Marijuana Prohibition altogether is a colossal failure.a)The whole purpose of cannabis prohibition is to prevent use nationwide, yet, cannabis use is still very prevalent.b)Because of point a, the adverse societal effects of marijuana (however minuscule) are in effect despite it's prohibition, ergo prohibition is purposeless.c)marijuana prohibition is exactly the same as the 20's alcohol prohibition save for the failure to end it.4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for the nation.a) Proof of the government's failure to do this is how a constitutional amendment was needed to sign alcohol prohibition into law (and is now being used to prohibit marijuana). This means that the views/values this nation was built on differ from those that allow/support prohibition.",

            "discussionTitle": "Resolved: The Federal Government can legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp",
            "conclusion": "Resolved: The Federal Government can legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for taking this debate. I will begin this round by clarifying the resolution, as my opponent has attempted to restate it in his favor. The resolution clearly states that the Federal Government (US Federal Government) can (not should) legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp. The and/or part of the resolution is stated as such because the DEA has lumped both together under their prohibition of marijuana (http://www.usdoj.gov...). The DEA does not recognize industrialized hemp, which uses a non-euphoric strain of cannabis with less than 1% THC, the psychoactive substance in marijuana (http://naihc.org...), as a separately scheduled substance. The and/or is also presented because the two, medical marijuana and industrialized hemp, can be dealt with separately through the DEA and FDA. The PAC's that advocate legalization of industrialized hemp are concerned with the hemp industry, and the advocates of medical marijuana are concerned with it's use as a medicine. There are PAC's (political action committees) lobbying for both, but they are generally treated as separate issues with benefits for different individuals throughout society (patients vs. farmers). Therefore, my resolution stands as originally stated. To respond to my opponents first three contentions would be to deviate from my own resolution. My premise for this debate does not advocate the legalization of medical marijuana, rather my resolution is regarding the power the US Federal Government possesses to legalize either medical marijuana, industrialized hemp, or both. My opponent claims that it is the duty of the government to serve and protect it's citizens, and implies that it is the duty of the government to protect it's citizens from harming their own health. This is not a valid contention against the power of the Federal Government to legalize medical marijuana because the government has legalized harmful substances in the past (alcohol, cigarettes, the medical use of morphine, morphinol, and other opiates, the medical use of amphetamines, methamphetamines, etc., etc., etc.). (http://www.usdoj.gov...). Even cocaine and powdered opium are Schedule II drugs, which means they have an accepted medical use and can be prescribed by a doctor. My opponent claims that marijuana has a high potential for abuse. I contend that nearly any medicine has the potential for abuse, and I will define drug abuse as taking a psychoactive drug or performance enhancing drug for a non-therapeutic or non-medical effect. Indeed alcohol has a much higher potential for abuse, it is a drug, and does not have nearly the accepted medical use as marijuana. (http://en.wikipedia.org...)(I could not find a source for the medical use of alcohol)(http://en.wikipedia.org...). Though I will not argue the issue of high potential for abuse, I will argue his contention that medical marijuana has an \"enormous lack of accepted safety for use of the drug\". Rescheduling requires that it be accepted for medical use, and I will list what a few medical agencies say about the issue: \"The American Academy of Family Physicians [supports] the use of marijuana ... under medical supervision and control for specific medical indications.\" Reference: 1996-1997 AAFP Reference Manual - Selected Policies on Health Issues \"The American Medical Student Association strongly urges the United States Government ... to meet the treatment needs of currently ill Americans by restoring the Compassionate IND program for medical marijuana, and ... reschedul[ing] marijuana to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, and ... end[ing] the medical prohibition against marijuana.\" Reference: AMSA House of Delegates Resolution #12 : adopted March 1993 \"The American Nurses Association will: ... Support the right of patients to have safe access to therapeutic marijuana/cannabis under appropriate prescriber supervision. Support the ability of health care providers to discuss and/or recommend the medicinal use of marijuana without the threat of intimidation or penalization. Support legislation to remove criminal penalties including arrest and imprisonment for bona fide patients and prescribers of therapeutic marijuana/cannabis. \" Reference: ANA Resolution: June 2003 American Preventive Medical Association \"Marijuana should be available for appropriate medicinal purposes, when such use is in accordance with state law, and that physicians who recommend and prescribe marijuana for medicinal purposes in states where such use is legal, should not be censured, harassed, prosecuted or otherwise penalized by the federal government.\" Reference: \"Medicinal Use of Marijuana\" policy statement: December 8, 1997 Belgian Ministry of Health \"[R]esearch has shown that cannabis can be of medicinal use. ... This is an area where public health must prevail.\" Reference: Statement of the Health Ministry, as quoted in Expatica.com (Brussels), September 4, 2003. British Medical Association \"Present evidence indicates that [cannabinoids] are remarkably safe drugs, with a side-effects profile superior to many drugs used for the same indications. ... [The BMA] will urge the government to consider changing the Misuse of Drugs Act to allow the prescription of cannabinoids to patients with certain conditions causing distress that are not adequately controlled by existing treatments.\" Reference: BMA report: \"Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis:\" November 1997 So not only is marijuana widely accepted in the medical community as medically beneficial, the side effects are far less harmful than those of other drugs, including many Schedule II drugs like cocaine, morphine, and methamphetamines. Multiple petitions for rescheduling marijuana have been submitted by reform advocates over the last 30 years. Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule II would protect patients and physicians from current Federal Laws that undermine state medical marijuana laws. Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule II would legalize marijuana because Federal prohibition of marijuana falls under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (please see R1 for argument and sources). House Resolution 5843, titled the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008, would express support for \"a very small number of individuals\" suffering from chronic pain or illness to smoke marijuana with impunity. If HR 5843 were passed, the House would support marijuana smokers possessing up to 100 grams -- about 3\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd ounces -- of cannabis without being arrested. It would also give its blessing to the \"nonprofit transfer\" of up to an ounce of marijuana. The resolution would not address laws forbidding growing, importing or exporting marijuana, or selling it for profit. The resolution also would not speak to state laws regarding marijuana use.(http://www.cnn.com...) Legalization is the process of removing a legal prohibition against something which is currently not legal. Legalization is a process often applied to what are now regarded as victimless crimes, such as the consumption of illegal drugs. It should be contrasted with decriminalization, which removes criminal charges from an action, but leaves intact associated laws and regulations.(http://en.wikipedia.org...) Because the US Federal Government has the power- in various forms, ie. House bills, rescheduling, or a Supreme Court ruling against the constitutionality of drug prohibition- to \"eliminate Federal penalties prohibiting the possession and use of marijuana\" as stated in House Res. 5843, and legalization is the process of removing a legal prohibition against something which is currently not legal, I affirm that the US Federal Government CAN legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp.

I will begin my rebuttals now.Rebuttals\"I believe my opponent is aware that marijuana is a drug not commonly connected with overdoses.\"I am aware.\"I do not believe he has ever heard of an overdose of medical marijuana or addiction to it because neither have I or most people on this Earth.\"That is right, I have not.My opponent then gave a long quote about how the FDA approves medical marijuana but not recreational marijuana. It is true that they do this, however it does not mean medical marijuana is safe. It simply means medical marijuana is the only known method of treating the certain disease or disorder.\"One can easily be addicted to pills, tablets, serums, and other forms of medications, but medical marijuana is rarely a substance that is addicted to. I do not deny that marijuana, when used in a large amount, is damaging, but you are aware that medical marijuana overdoses and addictions are virtually unheard of, yes?\"I am aware, yes, however, as I stated in my previous argument, I said nil about addictions. I have been talking about the dangerous side effects of medical marijuana. My opponent seems to be aware of these side effects when he said \"I do not deny that marijuana, when used in a large amount, is damaging.\"\"Marijuana, when abused and overused, will be termination instead of salvation.\"I concur.\"I argue, however, that medical marijuana can be salvation for victims of epilepsy and other such conditions when used properly.\"Is my opponent aware that it doesn't always work and that it had more unfortunate side effects than relief?\"However, marijuana can be bred to have a low percentage of chemicals that cause you to be high and a high percentage of chemicals that affect the desired parts of the body in question. Marijuana has two main components: THC and CBD.\"I am aware of this, however it is still not the point I am getting at. I am not talking about the dangers of recreational marijuana, I am speaking of the undeniable side effects of medical marijuana, even when bred a certain way.\"He quoted webmd.com, which said \"cannabinoids in marijuana can weaken the immune system.\" The key word here is 'can'. It does not necessarily mean it will.\"Indeed, however the percentage makes it more of a 'will' than a 'can'.\"Next, the source says, \"long-term use of marijuana can make lung problems worse.\" Again, there is a key word that must be acknowledged: 'long-term'. Not all patients will take medical cannabis for the long-term.\"Not all will take it long-term, but most will. Things like epilepsy take a long time to cure.\"Also, my opponent has chosen to ignore the fact that marijuana does not need to be smoked.\"I have not denied this, but have expressed and accepted it clearly. \"He also states potential side effects medical marijuana may cause. They are, according to his source, \"[d]rowsiness, dry mouth, giddiness, hunger, insomnia, red eyes, respiratory issues, short-term memory loss, and uneasiness or anxiety.\" These side effects, when you truly think about it, are minor.\"Minor? Since when are respiratory issues, hunger, and giddiness minor problems? My opponent quoted my statement: \"As you can see, it can be used to help people, but ... is different depending on the person.\" He then said this: \"This statement and, really, my opponent's entire argument is not sufficient. I urge the viewers and judges to carefully consider this.\"How is my statement not sufficient? I am clearly stating the undeniable dangers of medical marijuana use.\"My opponent makes arguments that are proven false by mine. I would like to point out an aspect of this debate he ignored fully. I said and sourced, \"[m]arijuana has two main components: THC and CBD. CBD (cannabidiol) will reduce brain activity and will lower the occurances of seizures.THC is what causes one to be high. Breeding marijuana to have low THC and high CBD will be effective. This, along with other genetic modifications, will make marijuana a safe treatment. \" My opponent fully ignored this statement.\"Um... Why would I not 'ignore this statemtent' when it was not yet time for rebuttals? I was simply following my opponent's rules. I have already refuted this anyway, so there is no reason to do it again.\"There is another aspect my opponent has chosen to ignore. I made the following statement: \"One can easily be addicted to pills, tablets, serums...\"Again, it was not time for rebuttals.\"This means that traditional medicine may not be the best choice. This means that marijuana is a very, very safe alternative drug to treat certain conditions and diseases. This has been fully ignored by my opponent. I want him to address this in his refutations.\"I did not ignore it, I simply did not wish to break the rules. Secondly, the only reason we do not use the traditional medicine is because we have not discovered it. Instead, we are using a dangerous alternative. We should focus out research on finding safer alternatives.\"My opponent, again, ignored key aspects of my argument. For certain conditions, there are no successful treatments yet. Now, I adore science and I know a lot about it, so I do know that safer treatments will be found in the future. However, for now, marijuana is the safest alternative to addictive pills and tablets.\"Yes, it is the safest, but not safe. It has serious problems.ConclusionIn conclusion, I have refuted all of my opponent's arguments and have proven them incorrect. I patently await my opponent's final rebuttals.",

Some people say Marijuana is to dangerous, but alcohol is more unsafe then the drug. You may also point out that I called it a drug, but tobacco is also a drug. Marijuana, even if it is not used medically, can be beneficial. Some people say it kills to many brain cells, but what their not thinking about is that when any brain cell dies, a new one is created. Which new brain cells are stronger than old ones, therefore making Marijuana healthy for the brain, if smoked safely. That does not mean I am saying you can smoke it anywhere you want. It still should stick with normal smoking laws. Another point is people try to complain that people can overdose on Marijuana, but you can do that with any drug or alcohol. Besides, Marijuana affect would have you pass out before you could even try to overdose. Prescription drugs kill about 100,000 people in the world each year. Off the top of your head, do you know how many deaths are caused by using Marijuana, either medicinally or recreationally? \"There are no deaths from Cannabis use. Anywhere. You can't find one,\" said Dr. Lester Grinspoon, professor emeritus at Harvard Medical School. Believe it: In 10,000 years of known use of cannabis, there's never been a single death attributed to Marijuana. Marijuana is smoked by some people to ease Arthritis pain in the muscles. Thought, this does not mean they should trade their medication for Marijuana. Marijuana is just a a pain remover. Going back to the prescription drugs; Prescription drugs, while legal, are experimental, dangerous and often toxic. Prescription drugs continue to kill hundreds of thousands Americans each year; meanwhile, Marijuana has never been the direct contributor to a single death. Overall I think the should legalize Marijuanna because of it medical help and because it will end many wars America is having!!",

The DEA has business trying to inform people about their work- they are the drug enforcement agency- the executives that arrest people for using marijuana for any reason, including medical reasons. Their propaganda flies in the face of modern science and the conclusions of the general scientific community. Marijuana has an incredibly small toxicity, as evidenced by the number of deaths from marijuana overdose per year, which is zero (1). The DEA uses faulty reasoning when it says that marijuana is addictive (2). It cites 15 year old studies to find that marijuana is addictive while ignoring the plethora of studies that find the opposite (3). It is common knowledge that marijuana increases the appetite of the user in a phenomenon known as the \"munchies\". Marijuana also has a positive effect on nausea. Both of these are huge problems with patients after a round of chemotherapy radiation. The counter to this is that other drugs also work on nausea and they work better. This is the equivalent of saying we should criminalize Advil because Tylenol works better. It also ignores the fact that a person may as well do marijuana. Who does the congress think it is? Where does it get off telling people what they cannot have even if it doesn't have medical benefits. If it has even an ounce of medical benefit, why not allow people to do it? If my doctor thinks that meth is a good way to cure something, why does the government get to say that that's an illegal treatment? Doctors know more about drugs than congressmen. Doctors should be able to prescribe literally anything, the least of which is marijuana. The bottom line is that marijuana is not addictive and not toxic. It can help patients getting through a sickness, so it should be allowed. I look forward to my opponent's response. Sources: (1)http://drugwarfacts.org... number 6. (2)http://www.justice.gov...

It increases the risk of cancer in people drastically\"- dthmstr254 Ok first i would like to point out that there is countless studies that prove tobacco more cancer causing than marijuana. but i would also like you to be more specific. Are you trying to say that marijuana is more likely to give you foot cancer or lung cancer? On another note, medical marijuana does not have to be smoked which ultimately takes away any \"risks\" with lungs. \"B. Marijuana is a known hallucinogen. It causes people to believe that they are actually in a different situation. However, unlike some drugs that can cause hallucinations (such as Kedamine, which is used in chronic pain sufferers to induce a coma, essentially rebooting the brain to relieve the pain), Marijuana's medical use is on an outpatient basis. Despite the warnings that show up for the FDA, people use the drug while driving or doing other things in life. This would mean that people are hallucinating while driving a car. I don't know about you, but I don't want to have a second go at avoiding a person w ho slams on reverse on a 40 MPH road (it turned out he was high on, guess what... Marijuana).\" -dthmstr254 These claims are rare and eroneous. Yes marijuana is a hallucinogen, but thats exactly why some people use it for chronic pain. As an example: Vicodin, Oxycotten, Hydrocodone, and Percoset are all legal drugs used to reduce pain. These also to an extent are bad to drive with. People drive under the influence of them as well also ignoring the FDA. These people are just as likely to \"slam on reverse on a 40 MPH road\". So you are saying that medical marijuana should stay illegal because theres a chance someone will get behind the wheel when they cant handle it? If that is the case we should most certainly ban all prescription pain-killers. I obviously dont believe that but i think i got my point across. I would like to review my main points before i close up: A.Any cancer causing effects can be avoided because you dont have to smoke marijuana as it can be vaporized, eaten or simpily taken in a pill.

            "premise": "I would like to thank 16kadams for his response and somewhat abstract rebuttal. Now let's move on to my final rebuttal and conclusion. R1: Terrible Health DefectsThis seems to be what my opponent's case essentially revolves around. It should be noted that while marijuana does have side effects and a potential for harm, almost every drug does as well. The only sources that my opponent has nonchalantly thrown out that are actually against marijuana don't even discuss medical use. The credible sources that he provides actually advocate for medical marijuana which my opponent does not even realize. My opponent fails to establish why morphine or novocaine should be legal in that case as well. As I stated earlier, numerous medical programs recognize marijuana as relatively safe for medical use. Let's go in depth and see what they say. According to an approved statement from the US Department of Justice in 1988, \"Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal effects. But marijuana is not such a substance. There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented cannabis-induced fatality. In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal response as a result of drug-related toxicity.\" [1] From January 1997 to June 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported zero deaths caused by the primary use of marijuana. Through that time period, 279 deaths were reported where marijuana was a possible \"concomitant\" drug used in conjunction with other drugs at the time of death. In contrast, common FDA-approved drugs which are often prescribed in lieu of marijuana (such as anti-emetics and anti-psychotics), were the primary cause of 10,008 deaths. [2]R2: FDA Statement??So yes apparently the FDA did issue a blanket statement disregarding all medicinal values of medical marijuana. This does not by any means mean it should be illegal. In fact many medical institutions have been negatively stigmatizing the FDA for making such lavish claims. To help prove the ridiculousness of this claim, I refer to Stephen Sidney, MD, Associate Director for Clinical Research for Kaiser Permanente. The FDA's pronouncement tells us little about medical marijuana, but it says much about how politics appears to be trumping science at the agency we all depend on to protect our health....The federal government has not only refused to fund medical marijuana research, it has put in place a set of legal and bureaucratic obstacles that have kept the flow of even privately funded medical marijuana studies to a trickle. So with one hand, our government tells us 'there's no data,' while with the other hand it works to ensure there will never be enough data. So why did the FDA issue this questionable document, containing no new information whatever, at this particular moment? The only apparent explanation is politics.... Science, it appears, took a back seat. For the FDA to do its job as protector of our nation's health, it must be free from commercial or political pressure. When politics trumps science at the FDA, we are all in danger.\" [3] Let's now have a look at to what NY Times had to say about this: \"The Bush administration's habit of politicizing its scientific agencies was on display again this week when the Food and Drug Administration, for no compelling reason, unexpectedly issued a brief, poorly documented statement disputing the therapeutic value of marijuana. The statement was described as a response to numerous inquiries from Capitol Hill, but its likely intent was to buttress a crackdown on people who smoke marijuana for medical purposes and to counteract state efforts to legalize the practice. Ordinarily, when the F.D.A. addresses a thorny issue, it convenes a panel of experts who wade through the latest evidence and then render an opinion as to whether a substance is safe and effective to use. This time the agency simply issued a skimpy one-page statement asserting that 'no sound scientific studies' supported the medical use of marijuana..\" [4] Thus it is not at all a valid scientifical standpoint but rather a whimsical attempt by politicians to attack the marijuana user party. R3: Schizophrenia and Testicular CancerThere is really no solidification of this contention as he agrees so this has successfully been shot down because marijuana never causes Schizophrenia. Con then goes on to helplessly try to justify this by bringing up some \"Pro marijuana legilizaation dude\" (nobody knows what legilizaation is) and states how he believes it is true. This is bad conduct because there is no explanation, no source, and no credibility. I think it is clear to the readers and will move on. As far as the testicular cancer issue goes, I have significantly shot this down yet again and Con just spews out another source but I have proven that this is just another confusion of correlation and causation so we shall move on now. R4: Withdrawal and AggressionHe states that there is a possibility for one to be aggressive but there is no evidence that this has caused aggression but there is some relation. It is generally considered that marijuana has soothed and calmed people, not made them aggressive. \"When the system is hyper-aroused, as in today\u2019s lifestyle, marijuana calms. The significance of this fact cannot be ignored. It explains the increased creativity reported as a part of the marijuana experience, because when both sides of brain processes are heightened, both types of brain activity are greater. The left brain notices more, while the right brain receives more. This is the unification of logic and intuition. The term \u201cexpansion of consciousness\u201d is explained physiologically as a \u201cshifting of brain emphasis from one-sidedness to balance\u201d (Sugarmena and Tarter, 1978), which fits precisely with the feeling called \u201chigh.\" [5] Here's another statement: \"At low doses, most marijuana users report a sense of calm, well-being and relaxation\u2014the exact opposite of anxiety. Recent scientific investigation reveals that in addition to a sense of calm, low doses of marijuana produce a loss of temporal awareness (time), slight mental confusion, a slowing of the thought processes, impairment of short-term memory and sometimes an awareness of attaining special insights or knowledge.\" [6] We can not come to the conclusion that it will increase aggression but perhaps if you smoke extensively it will. Even so, many other drugs cause far more aggression and they should be illegal as well. R5: AIDS/HIVThis rebuttal is going to be rather brief for I have already shot it down and he simply restated the same thing. I urge readers to refer back to my last rebuttal. He states there is a possibility of T-cells to fight off infections but there is simply no definite cause while I have provided that there is a definite benefit on HIV/AIDSR6: Alzheimer'sThis ongoing project is only working towards achieving tangible results but has not even came close. With his evidence we can not come to any conclusions but only a rather possibility of there being side-effects, no definite harm here and can be completely disregarded. NO WARRANT!R7: Addiction and AlternativesI am begginning to run out of space but first off addiction can simply be solved with less prescription and I have already proven that it is not addictive and it is never considered addictive anymore. It is a myth that has been disproven time after time. Con fails to justify any alternatives whatsoever and just posts links..this is not debate but a link competition. Conclusion: Con fails to justify how Marijuana should be illegal (arguments), uses unreliable sources such as his Dad (sources), and spells things terribly such as 'rubuttal' and 'legilizaation' (spelling). With his logic many drugs should be illegal and he never really refutes the benefits but rather spews out sources. To end this I refer to Carl Sagan's video and vote PRO. http://www.youtube.com...",

It may also reduce side effects of other drugs used in its treatment, such as Lithium, Carbamazepine (Tegretol) or Valproate (Depakote). Moreover, 30-40% of patients with bipolar disorder are not consistently helped by or CANNOT tolerate standard medications. Marijuana helps terminally ill people to have a better life because smoked marijuana can give rapid relief from great suffering to some patients, quickly improving such patients' comfort and mental outlook. The terminally ill can still maintain their human dignity and suffer less. Legalized marijuana would provide patients with a quality drug to help their pain. This would make the usage of drug controllable, ingredients would be well known and experts would determine the appropriate healing quantity. Legalization for medical purposes is also necessary to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to invest in further research of marijuana's healing properties.",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana Should Be Legal For Medicinal Purposes",
            "premise": "It appears this debate has become principally focused on the medical benefits of marijuana as opposed to its potential dangers; therefore, whether or not I am able to sustain the resolution of this debate will depend primarily on my ability to demonstrate that marijuana's medicinal advantages outweigh it's downfalls.Sustaining the Medicinal Advantages of Marijuana:Cancer:I have provided various authoritative research studies, all of which confirm marijuana's ability to prevent and/or treat a number of cancers, including breast, brain, and lung cancer [1] [2] [3]. As my sources state, such studies have been conducted by respected universities and esteemed researchers.Multiple Sclerosis:I have effectively demonstrated through authoritative research that marijuana helps individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis by decreasing spastic movement and pain [4]. Alzheimer's:I have provided evidence that marijuana has been found to inhibit amyloid plaque (a primary pathological marker) much more effectively than other currently medically approved substances, thereby providing significant help for people suffering from Alzheimer's [5].Arthritis:By presenting authoritative research, I have demonstrated that marijuana possesses the ability to help arthritis sufferers with their pain [6].Chronic Pain:I have provided strong evidence that marijuana helps with pain in general, most importantly chronic pain [7].Other Benefits:I have provided research demonstrating that marijuana helps prevent and/or treat glaucoma, epileptic seizures, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, muscle tension, muscle spasm, insomnia, and inflammatory bowel disease [8] [9].Addressing the Potential Dangers of Marijuana:Cancer:The only kind of cancer my opponent cites as a potential danger of marijuana is related to marijuana smoke. I've stated numerous times that such a point is moot, seeing as how marijuana need not be consumed through smoking. My opponent states that I have dropped this point, but I have done no such thing; rather, I have provided strong evidence to counter my opponent's claims.Heart Disease:As far as I could find, the source my opponent has provided says nothing of marijuana, only cocain. My opponent also states that my source link does not lead to the information I've provided, which is true; I'm not entirely sure what happened to my link and I apologize for the inconvenience -- the information can be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.... Again, my source states that \"a large cohort study showed no association of marijuana use with cardiovascular disease hospitalization or mortality,\" thereby refuting my opponent's claim. Immune System Deficiency:Again, the assertion that marijuana poses threats to the immune system is simply not supported by the evidence. Dr. Leo E. Hollister, Professor of Psychiatry and Pharmacology at the University of Texas Medical School has reported in a research study published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs that:\"The evidence [on immune suppression] has been contradictory and is more supportive of some degree of immunosuppression only when one considers in vitro studies. These have been seriously flawed by the very high concentrations of drug used to produce immunosuppression. The closer that experimental studies have been to actual clinical situations, the less compelling has been the evidence [10].\"Birth Defects:My opponent criticizes my source for being biased, despite the fact that he has continually used heritage.org as a source (a website whose express purpose is to propagate conservative thinking).My source quotes information reported from the National Academy of Sciences, which states that no evidential links between marijuana and birth defects have been found [11]. Although norml.org seek to legalize marijuana, it uses unbiased, peer-reviewed sources and research to accomplish its purposes.Psychological Side-Effects:Although I've conceded to the argument that paranoia is a potential side-effect of marijuana, I uphold my position that there is currently no conclusive evidence demonstrating a link between marijuana use and schizophrenia. As Associate Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa's Dr. Jason Schiffman states in an article published in Psychiatric Research, \"the onset of schizotypal symptoms generally precedes the onset of cannabis use. The findings do not support a causal link between cannabis use and schizotypal traits [12].\"Carcinogens:Again, this is only a problem assuming one consumes marijuana through smoking. There a many ways to consume marijuana which do not include smoking, and therefore this point is moot.Problems with Crime:Any prescription drug faces problems with crime. Is my opponent asserting that a beneficial substance should be withheld from suffering individuals simply because criminals would do the same thing with it that they do with nearly all other prescription drugs?Conclusion:Marijuana is not a miracle drug. It does not heal everything, nor does it come without some undesirable side-effects; however, the simple fact of the matter is that most medications in general exhibit the same limited capabilities. The case I have attempted to make in this debate is that marijuana is just as suitable a medication as many other legal medicinal substances, and it therefore deserves to be considered as a serious candidate for medical legalization.I believe I have provided compelling, peer-reviewed scientific evidence of marijuana's ability to treat numerous conditions while only presenting minor or otherwise reasonable side-effects; for this, I encourage the voters to vote Pro.I further apologize for the relatively brief nature of this post (then again, perhaps you are thanking me for it :P). Seeing as how I am preparing to celebrate the new year, I have tried to keep this short; however, I believe I have managed to sufficiently communicate my case, both in this post and previous ones.I would like to thank my opponent for his contributions to this debate. I greatly appreciate his arguments, and extend my utmost sincere gratitude to him for helping to make this an enlightening and intellectually stimulating debate.Lastly, I would like to wish both my opponent, the readers, and the voters a happy new year!________________________________________________________________________________________________[1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's) . I will begin by presenting a few main statements and their subset points if they apply. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose. I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. My Arguments 1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization. a) Marijuana is not addictive. b)Marijuana is physically impossible to overdose on c) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true. d) The Gateway theory is fundamentally flawed e) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. causing aggressiveness or other adverse changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user. f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreased g) assuming it is true that marijuana's potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged. 2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization. a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the country b)The medical benefits of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for many c) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, stopping drugged driving) d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. e)Cannabis integration would benefit our culture and uphold our rights as a nation under the constitution. 3. Even if marijuana was a harmful substance it is clearly no more harmful than legal substances (i.e. alcohol, tobacco) which have been perfectly integrated into society and are tolerated. Therefore, it should be treated no differently. 4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for all.",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana\\Cannabis should be legalised for both medical and recreational purposes in the U.S.",
            "premise": "I thank Wush for this debate. == Definitions == Cannabis\\ Marijuana: Cannabis, also known as marijuana, marihuana, among many other names, refers to any number of preparations of the Cannabis plant intended for use as a psychoactive drug. [1] Recreational: A pastime, diversion, exercise, or other resource affording relaxation and enjoyment. [2] Medical: Curative; medicinal; therapeutic. [3] Legalised: To make legal [4] U.S.: http://en.wikipedia.org... == PRO Arguments == --- Harm of Marijuana --- There has so far been no deaths recorded that directly result from the use of Marijuana, and there has been no recoded deaths in the U.S., and when stacked up against other products, Marijuana is relatively harmless [5]. Indeed, unlike many other substances, it is extremely hard to die from the use of Marijuana. As noted on the below article: \"A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.\" [5] We can therefore conclude that it is extremely hard to technically kill oneself solely through the use of Marijuana. Also, Marijuana does not have any detrimental long term effects on a person health and mortality. As noted in two studies [6], the users of Marijuana were far less likely to have shorter life spans. The only noted possible health effect of Marijuana is a increase in heart attacks 1 hour after smoking Marijuana. This is however an extremely rare risk, given that it only occurs in .2% of all heart attacks [6], of which would have to occur within the first hour of Marijuana consumption, an extremely rare risk indeed. However, if one was concerned with the increase in heart attacks, there would be substances with a far greater plausibility of increasing the risk of heart attacks in the long term, such as Fast Foods [7]. We can conclude from this Marijuana is a therefore a substance which, while it has risks, is safe. One must consider that while Marijuana has negative effects, every product has risks and negative effects. --- Benefits of Marijuana --- While we know the are very few extremely low chance risks involved with the use of Marijuana, there are many benefits to it use, most, if not all, of which are medical. There is a list as long as my arm of illnesses treated by Medical Marijuana [8], but some illnesses include various cancer (Testicular, Prostate, Skin), forms of Hepatitis, Diabetes related illnesses and dependence illnesses. It is also used to stop the build-up of Alzheimers Disease [9], reduces the growth of breast cancer cells [10] and stimulating appetite in HIV\\AIDS patients [11]. It is clear there are a large number of medical benefits from the use of Medical Marijuana. --- Individual Choice --- Currently, the use of Marijuana is a victimless crime, that is to say, no one is harmed in the consumption of Marijuana other than the consumer, who has willingly consumed the Marijuana by choice. Even should there be mounds of evidence suggesting Marijuana is extremely harmful to consume, it is still the personal choice of the individual to consume it and suffer any negative effects. There is no need for the government to impose themselves in people's lives unless they are preventing them from harming another person directly, which is why people would obviously not be allowed smoke Marijuana and drive a car, or operate machinery. --- Benefits of Legalisation --- As it stands, the US government spends a huge amount of money to suppress the use of Marijuana. It is estimated that the US could gain $14,878,200,000+ by legalising and taxing the sale of Marijuana [12]. It is clear that the US economy would benefit from the legalisation of Marijuana through the creation of jobs. The War on Marijuana is also ineffective, as most of the arrests (89%) are possession of Marijuana, not distribution [12]. Furthermore, it would reduce the amount of funding available for criminal gangs, as drugs trading is a huge source of income for them. This would reduce criminal activity and have a benefit to society. --- Conclusion --- From my argument we can conclude that Marijuana has very few real risks associated with its use, and has multiple uses as a treatment. Furthermore, the use of Marijuana is one which only carries risks for the user once used on private property, and furthermore, it is uneconomical to attempt to enforce a prohibition of Marijuana. Seeing as Marijuana has medical benefits, it should to be legalised for medical purposes. Furthermore, as it is a victimless crime and has few risks, it should be legalised for recreational usage.

            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for his rebuttal. REBUTTALS TO REBUTTALS ------------ 1) //The main chemical used in \"medical marijuana\" that helps to manage disease is Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC. While THC can be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases, the parts of the cannabis plant used to make \"medical marijuana\" contain only 3% THC. In order to intake this measly amount of THC, the patient must also assume the numerous harms of taking marijuana itself, including the intake over 400 hazardous chemicals and numerous psychological and physiological hazards.// And that is the user's choice. None of these other 'hazardous' chemicals have ever been proved to be harmful whatsoever. I ask my opponent to source his claims to relevant studies. 2) //Not only that but the few good things that marijuana brings to the medical industry have already been isolated and incorporated into a FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug called Marinol. Marinol preserves the benefits of THC while lessening or eliminating the harms brought about by Marijuana consumption.// There are some very serious problems with my opponent's arguments. (S)He has refused to show how studies contradict his statement. In 1980, when Marinol was released, there were six State-sponsored studies running alongside the distribution of the drug. All of the studies had conclusive evidence, namely the thousands of patients who participated in the studies, that naturally grown marijuana was safer, and more effective than Marinol. (1) One study had a subject accuse his/her doctor of trying to poison him. This patient was one of the experimental trials for Marinol, not marijuana. Might I also add that tobacco and alcohol, while infinitely more harmful to the user than marijuana, are still legal? Why should marijuana be illegal, when it actually provides benefits to the user? 3) //Medical professionals have noticed the notable effects of certain narcotics in the suppression of pain. Does that mean that they legalize opium or heroin? No, they don't. However, as noted in my fifth and sixth arguments, which you tried to hide away, I noted that it was the user's choice, and that the government should have no say in what you can and cannot consume. If you want to eat very greasy food, go right ahead. If you want to smoke marijuana or inject yourself with heroin, go ahead. And if you want to consume rat poison for breakfast, who am I to stop you? 4) //Obviously no because pharmacists can isolate the positive effects of pain suppression and reduce the rather negative effects of extreme addiction and potential for homicidal rage.// Your point? Opium and heroin ought to be legal for the simple reason that it is not the government's role to tell you what to consume. If it is harmful, then the consequences are upon you, and you alone. 5) //Instead of sending those people to prison, we could just make them pay a citation and the citation would depend on how much marijuana the person possesses. This would also help the recession while keeping marijuana illegal.// This wouldn't be a proper replacement for marijuana at all. The criminals would only get harder to catch, and the citations wouldn't be as nearly as good a revenue as it would should marijuana be legalized and taxed. 6) //This is obviously false. Depending on the user Marijuana usually causes the user to become hungry, lazy, paranoid, etc...// Cite sources. Marijuana -may- cause the user to have those symptoms. Anyways, just because marijuana makes you hungry, lazy, or paranoid, this makes the drug so bad it needs to be illegal? That's just inane. And stupid. 7) //Marijuana could cause obesity from hunger and that's if the user can get food. If the user can't get food in time, they will die of starvation.// So, because marijuana may cause someone to be hungry, they will automatically become obese. This assumes that the user smokes marijuana 24/7, and becomes hungry while using it. And then you randomly say, '..IF the user can get food.' What does that even mean? That smoking marijuana will cause you to either become obese, or suddenly become unable to purchase food? That's just foolish. What's with the last statement, anyways? If ANYONE can't consume edible food within a certain amount of time, they will die. That's just common sense, and applies to everything, really. 8) //Marijuana could cause people to be lazy and therefore if marijuana was legal, The recession would actually be worse.// Let's put your argument into a syllogism. P1: Marijuana may make you lazy (not evidenced). P2: If someone consumes marijuana, they WILL be lazy. (False.) Conclusion: Consuming marijuana will make the recession worse. (Non-sequitur, and just a point blank wtf.) Obviously, I need not say anything else. 9) //Marijuana could cause people to be paranoid and lose trust in others// Okay.. //causing them to go insane// Losing trust makes you go insane. What? //and crime rate may possibly go up and Going insane ups the crime rate. Why? //thus, this would do harm to others.// More crime= More harm to others. Somehow. All of this argument is a big non-sequitur chain of fail. Voters, take note that my opponent dropped contention 6. REBUTTALS TO ARGUMENT ------------------------------- 1) //People say that marijuana can make the user \"happy.\" Unnecessary and harmful freedoms are not handed out to the terminally ill simply to ensure that they have a pleasant trip out of life. Doing such sets an unneeded and negative precedent to the rest of society. Not negative. Even if it is, it is the user's choice to use said drug. //Honestly, \"happiness\" isn't an idea that falls under the umbrella of medicine,// Have you ever heard of an anti-depressant? //and the Affirmative plan draws no line if happiness was an acceptable use for medical marijuana. If I had a bad day at work, would I be justified in using harmful drugs as an escapism?// Of course! If you have the facts available to you on what the drug does, then you can consume it no matter what! The government ought not control what you ingest.// //The use of medical marijuana as a means to achieve happiness by escaping from life's problems is neither a just reason for assuming that societal harms achieved by legalizing marijuana, This argument doesn't even make sense. It's missing lots and lots of words to make it work. //nor does it even fall under the concept of medical marijuana in the first place.// The use you are describing is called an anti-depressant. Marijuana is an anti-depressant. Look at that, it does fall under the concept of medical marijuana. 2) //What we must see is that current treatment options are far superior to the suggested use of medical marijuana, and any minuscule benefits are far outweighed by the harms of making marijuana easily available.// Disproved that one a while ago. Anyways, legalizing marijuana will lower crime rates. 3) //It's obvious that the legalization of medical marijuana has been abused on a widespread basis. // How? //Taking the action suggested by Pro provides little to no benefit to those actually sick,/ Yes, it does. Multiple studies demonstrating that it does. //while simultaneously harming society as a whole.// How? Show me. It is beneficial in health, helps the economy, and lowers crime rate. 4) //Marinol is a better alternative to medical marijuana.// I call bullsh!t.(1)(2) Thanks to my opponent, and now I turn the debate over to him.

            "premise": "I believe that medical marijuana should be legal. Marijuana is customarily known as a street drug, but in recent years it has gained its credibility as a medication to treat chronic pain and sooth side effects of chemotherapy for cancer. Already 72% of doctors support medical marijuana. Cancer patients had positive feedback when they tried medical marijuana. They said things like \"It made me feel like I had an appetite for the first time in probably six months\". For the people who benefit from medical marijuana should not be criminalized. Current remedies for pain like Vicodin and Percocet are far more addictive and dangerous. In states where medical marijuana is legalized, doctors have seen a decline in opioid abuse. Making sure people actually need marijuana for medical use and are using it solely for that is where there is a valuable argument. Regulations and government involvement would need to be necessary as with any drug. This also opens up a new industry that could be profitable. There are many ways to consume marijuana than to just smoke it, which is safer to for your lungs. It is unfair to compare the legalization of the medical and recreational use of marijuana, it is a different debate as a whole. The legalization of medical marijuana could steer away from the abuse of opioids and give patients a new way of treatment that has been proven to be effective. It could also change the perception of the drug from a street drug to a medication.",

            "premise": "Your definition will probably say something like 'marijuana for medical purposes.' Then you would say 'medical' and digress on that. Throughout this debate I will show you that medical marijuana is bad and that there ARE alternatives. It is addictive. In the long term it can be addictive, the effects may take a while. It is estimated that 9 percent of people who use marijuana will become dependent on it. The number goes up to about 1 in 6 in those who start using young (in their teens) and to 25-50 percent among daily users. (1) So it can be addictive. It is talking about only dependency too, you can also be addicted to it socially. According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old. (1) Marijuana addiction is also linked to a withdrawal syndrome similar to that of nicotine withdrawal, which can make it hard to quit. People trying to quit report irritability, sleeping difficulties, craving, and anxiety. They also show increased aggression on psychological tests, peaking approximately 1 week after they last used the drug. (1) So that last part leads to my next argument, mental damage. Research has shown that marijuana's negative effects on attention, memory, and learning can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off (Schweinsburg et al. 2008). (1) That is not it, as I said above it causes withdrawal. This withdrawal causes all those things listed above, and that could lead to life in death situations. You may be quick to point out it says it peaks about one week later. Since marijuana gives you the munchies which make you hungry you would have to use it every day. So after one week you would be getting agitated, aggressive, sleep problems, anxiety, etc. Every day! I will make this more clear. If you do it this Monday, then you will be like this on Tuesday, if you do this on Tuesday then a week later on that Tuesday you will be like this also, and the cycle repeats. More psychology: someone who smokes marijuana daily may be functioning at a reduced intellectual level most or all of the time. Not surprisingly, evidence suggests that, compared with their non smoking peers, students who smoke marijuana tend to get lower grades and are more likely to drop out of high school (1) So it affects your learning too! Because marijuana impairs judgment and motor coordination and slows reaction time, an intoxicated person has an increased chance of being involved in and being responsible for an accident (O'Malley and Johnston 2007; Richer and Bergeron 2009). (1) SO now driving is a problem when using marijuana. Research has shown that some babies born to women who used marijuana during their pregnancies display altered responses to visual stimuli, increased tremulousness, and a high-pitched cry, which could indicate problems with neurological development. (1) Now pregnancy is affected! A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Some of these studies have shown age at first use to be an important risk factor, where early use is a marker of increased vulnerability to later problems. However, at this time, it is not clear whether marijuana use causes mental problems, exacerbates them, or reflects an attempt to self-medicate symptoms already in existence.(2) Yes that says all of those terrible diseases. Time for other facts about marijuana: Marijuana increases heart rate by 20-100 percent shortly after smoking; this effect can last up to 3 hours. In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.5 This may be due to increased heart rate as well as the effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmia's. This risk may be greater in aging populations or in those with cardiac vulnerabilities. (2) Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time. (2) Now medical marijuana cannot be used medically says the FDA. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a statement saying there are no scientific studies to support the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Also it is considered a poisonous plant.

            "conclusion": "Medical as well as recreational marijuana should be legal in all US states",
            "premise": "The matter of legalizing medical marijuana is an important issue for several reasons. From the data observed in the link below [1] there are currently 23 states with laws legalizing marijuana, some still more restrictive than others. This of course is a significant step in the right direction. However, I believe that all states should follow the examples of Alaska, Colorado, Washington and Oregon to legalize not only cannabis for medicinal usage but also for recreational consumption. I will list my reasons further below. Before doing so I would like to specifically define the meanings of marijuana itself and respectively medical and recreational cannabis to avoid any confusions or misunderstandings. Marijuana is defined as \"a commonly used illegal drug made from dried leaves of the hemp plant\" and \"a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared.\" Marijuana goes by many other names such as cannabis, hemp, weed etc. [2] Medical marijuana is defined as the usage of marijuana for medical or medicinal purposes. [3] [4] Recreational marijuana is defined as any other recreational drug which is described as \"a drug (as cocaine, marijuana, or methamphetamine) used without medical justification for its psychoactive effects often in the belief that occasional use of such a substance is not habit-forming or addictive.\" [6] I acknowledge the many different types of marijuana that exists for different purposes, most, I understand, are hybrids made for different specific medical needs. However I do not know enough on the subject of them, their effects and upsides as well as downsides. I would therefore appreciate if this debate could be exclusively on the matters of the aforementioned descriptions of cannabis, medical and recreational. Now I will present my arguments as to why I believe medical and recreational marijuana should be legalized in all US states.R32;R32;First of all I would like to point out that there is no scientific background with evidence as to exactly why marijuana was classified as a Schedule I drug in the first place. The definition of a Schedule 1 drug from the Drug Enforcement Administration itself clearly states, that \"Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\"[6] This definition leaves no room for doubt that no Schedule 1 drug has any medical use. However it has been a known fact for centuries that cannabis has been used for medical purposes with positive effects. This can easily be found true when looking at many different sources. Here I have merely linked one. [7]R32;The National Institute on Drug Abuse also states that there are medical benefits from marijuana. [8] R32;There can be many reasons as to why marijuana was classified the way it was and still has not been re-classified but that is a completely different debate. Here are links with possible explanations that no matter what do not justify why it was classified so harshly. [9] [10] R32;All in all, there can be no doubts that this classification of marijuana is deeply illogical and misleading. Second, I would like to stress that America would merit tremendously from the economic profits caused by legalizing marijuana. It can be no surprise to any logical thinking creature that America spends enormous sums of money on dealing with and prohibiting crime related to illegal marijuana sales and consumptions. All of this money would of course not be spent if marijuana was legalized. In stead I propose that all states start off like Oregon, Alaska, Washington and Colorado by legalizing recreational marijuana as well. These states all have different laws that specifically suits them and I believe this is a good way to start. R32;R32;The legalization of medical as well as recreational marijuana would be the only solution to properly profit economically from the marijuana businesses that are currently not legal. This is because these businesses will probably still exist if only medicinal marijuana was legalized. [11] [12] Third and last I believe, as mentioned, that marijuana should be legalised for recreational use. This is because I believe in every individual\"s right to care for him or herself\"s own health and decide what is best. Especially when it comes to smoking tobacco or marijuana for pleasure. I am aware of the fact that marijuana has other effects than regular tobacco smoking. However tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death here in America and I do not see how it in any aspect is justifiable, that tobacco smoking has no legal restrictions when a harmless plant such as cannabis is classified as a schedule 1 drug and illegal in most states. [13] I believe that cannabis should be legalized for medical and recreational use. Of course all sale should be done by an approved salesperson to ensure and uphold a certain safety. This will still leave room for illegal sales but not in the same measure as it is now. I am not trying to say that tobacco smoking should be classified as a schedule 1 drug as well. I am saying that the laws making marijuana illegal are so illogical that I am astonished this can happen in a well educated country in the 21st century. http://www.governing.com... https://www.vocabulary.com... http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com... https://www.leafly.com... http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://www.dea.gov... http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com... https://www.drugabuse.gov... http://www.ibtimes.com... http://www.drugwarrant.com... http://www.dailydot.com... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... http://www.cdc.gov...",

My father, who is a physician says that there are prescription medicine that people should use other then marijuana, because they have less side effects that harm you. One of these side effects is it effects the immune system. Donald P. Tashkin, MD, in his 2001 article \"Effects of Smoked Marijuana on the Lung and Its Immune Defenses: Implications for Medicinal Use in HIV-Infected Patients, published in the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics, stated: \"Frequent marijuana use can cause airway injury, lung inflammation and impaired pulmonary defense against infection. The major potential pulmonary consequences of habitual marijuana use of particular relevance to patients with AIDS is superimposed pulmonary infection, which could be life threatening in the seriously immonocompromised patient.\" There are more studies to prove the point. You also say that it has medical benefits and is non toxic.There are 400 chemicals in marijuana. most of them are toxic in a medicine perspective. Compared to other drugs your right, marijuana isn't very addicting, but it still is addictive, well not compared to crack. Long term marijuana use is addictive. About 9% of people get a dependency when using marijuana. It also makes a withdrawal syndrome ,similar to nicotine, making it harder to quit. It also makes people more aggressive. Also, the FDA sys their are now studies that have significant proof that medical marijuana has benefits. FDA spokesperson Susan Bro said the agency issued its statement in response to inquiries from the public and Congress. \"For the FDA, there has not been enough clinical data demonstrating that either the drug is effective or safe in treating chronic, painful conditions,\" Bro said.

            "premise": "\"1) Legalization of medical marijuana is a 'back door' for consumption of recreational marijuana, 2) Marijuana is a highly dangerous and addictive substance 3) Marijuana is dangerous\" Alright to start off, thank you Con for the response. But for the above argument, this is very incorrect. Marijuna is not very dangerous, there has been no known deaths directly tied to the consumption or use of Marijuna. Also Marijuna is not addictive. I have personally smoked marijuna, and I have never felt any of these \"side effects\" The only reason users feel a feeling paranoia is because they are afraid they are going to get caught and get in HUGE trouble, which is wrong, if the government is okay with the legalization of weed, then why does it carry such a high punishment for the use, and LEGAL distribution. Now I understand this if it is illegal, but most of the time, you go to jail longer for selling weed than killing someone. \" Marijuana is addictive. Marijuana is as addictive as alcohol[3]. Here are a few statistics proving the similarities: \"One study looked at 2,446 young adults between the ages of 14-24, and followed them for a period of 4 years. Approximately 10% met the criteria for marijuana addiction. 17% experienced withdrawal when they stopped using, 14% had difficulty controlling their use, and 13% continued to use even though they had health problems due to their marijuana use.\" 2nd Argument: for the above argument, again I have smoked weed, and sadly I to have Drank. And non of these were addictive to me. And also Marijuna doe snot raise the heart beat, it actually slows it down and makes you calm, it also doesn't kill braincells, it actually promotes cell growth, and it is used for medical use I was diagnosed with chronic migraines at the age of ten, after I tried weed, my headaches went away for quite a while, but as soon as I stopped, they came back. This concludes my rebuttals and contentions. Thank you. ALSO SORRY FOR NOT RESPONDING QUICKLY, I DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME IN CLASSES.",

I have shown you that because there are so many other available medications, however, there is no reason to want to use medical marijuana unless the patient does have some desire to get high. Heroin is a painkiller. Does that mean that we should administer heroin to patients that are in pain? NO, because there are so many other treatments out there that don't alter your brain chemistry. \"Lets look at a common cold, you can use Vick's or dayquil and many others but sometimes peoples chemistry doesn't work well with that drug and they could be allergic to it. Wouldn't you rather have another alternate out there for example marijuana, that you can take and it could help you out.\" As I have already stated, there are many drugs out there that can be used and the chances that someone is allergic to ALL of those is infinitesimally small.

My opponent claims that people can still obtain drugs albeit illegally, but I contend that rate would be much less than right if it was not legal. If it was a normal prescription drug, then people could easily smuggle it or fordoctors into prescribing it for them. Furthermore, they wouldn't need to hide and buy itfrom drug dealers, they could walk into a pharmacy and buy it for a lot cheaper price. http://abcnews.go.com... Tihs is the source showing pain can be beneficial. He talks marijuana alleviating sufferring, but the truth is many people could simply use it to alleviate their \"daily problems.\" For example, you could get a headache and just go to the pharmacy and get some marijuana. The resolution debates using marijuana for anything related to th medical field, and pharmacies that sell marijuana are related to the medical field. Smoke \"The most obvious harmful effect that I can see from medical marijuana is the damage done to one's lungs when smoking the drug. This is of course a fair concern however, one can ingest marijuana in a number of different ways, which do not significantly damage the lungs.\" OK, marijuana is ILLEGAL because it damages the lungs ALOT. This is why tobacco and nicotine are not illegal. Furthermore, marijuana increases the possiblity of alzheimers and strokes, mood swings, seizures, and depression. To say it only damages the lungs is ridiculous. Source:http://en.wikipedia.org...(drug) He talks about the vaporizer and other forms of ingesting marijuana that don't damage the lungs, however, marijuana does ALOT more than damage the lungs, as I have stated above, he never addresses the other side effects that are found in the marijuana plant's properties itself. He talks about marijuana relieving cancer and aids. All marijuana does is temporarily relieve sufferring and make you feel great, and then it sends you into a state of depression, also found in my above source. Cancer and Aids patients die alot, so marijuana doesn't actually help them. Furthermore, if you give it to a weak cancer patient who is in alot of pain but can still live it could weaken them in the long run, the same with aids. And once again, pain is GOOD sometimes because it relieves stress and signals to the body that something needs to be done. conclusion: He makes a bunch of \"no sources\" arguments which I can't understand considering he FORFEITED a round which I thought he would never even post to.",

A majority of marijuana users find themselves abusing it more than using it as a prescription. It is nearly impossible to keep it only for clients, so why make the job harder for the police departments and try to arrest anyone who carries marijuana. Marijuana is not a serious drug and does not make anyone become violent, yet this generation acts as though it is a crime to enjoy your own free time and relaxing to a natural plant that grows from this earth. What one person is doing to de-stress should not bother anyone else. Although it is rare to hear about someone using medical marijuana for it's main purpose (easing of pain/illness). In 2010, researchers at Harvard Medical School suggested that that some of the drug's benefits may actually be from reduced anxiety, which would improve the smoker's mood. Although some may say that medical marijuana does more harm than it does good, there is plenty of evidence to counteract this. In addition to Medical Marijuana helping to prevent seizures, it can also help to stop cancer cells from spreading. According to an article written by Kevin Loria and Jennifer Welsh, \"Cannabinoids like the active ingredients in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as THC), control seizures by binding to the brain cells responsible for controlling excitability and regulating relaxation.\" Loria and Welsh go on to claim that \"CBD may also help prevent cancer from spreading, researchers at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco reported in 2007.\"",

Health BenefitsAlzheimer's Disease - Forget the burnout jokes you've heard about effects of smoking marijuana on the brain. Scripps Research Institute found the active ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, inhibits the formation amyloid plaque, a primary pathological marker. The report, published in 2006 in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics,said THC is a \"considerably superior inhibitor of (amyloid plaque) aggregation\" to several currently approved drugs for treating the disease.Brain Cancer - Researchers from Compultense University in Madrid, Spain have found THC promotes the death of brain cancer cells (http://www.medicalnewstoday.com...) by a process called autophagy. Autophagy essentially causes the cancerous cells to eat itself. Seems that would be a health benefit of medical marijuana that should be investigated further, no?Head and Neck Cancer - The journal Cancer Prevention Research published a study in 2009 that observed 434 subjects with incidents of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) from 9 medical facilities. While the results were far from conclusive, the evidence indicated patients with 10-20 years of marijuana use was associated with the \"significantly reduced\" (http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org...) risk of HNSCC. Lung Cancer and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)- Researchers at Harvard University (http://www.sciencedaily.com...) found THC to reduce tumor growth in common lung cancer by 50% and significantly reduce the ability of the cancer to spread. In 2006 a UCLA researcher found smoking marijuana did not appear to increase the risk of lung cancer or head-and-neck malignancies even among heavy users. However, the study indicated the more tobacco a person smoked, the greater the risk of developing cancer of the lung and head and neck. Note: I am by no means saying the ingestion of combustible smoke of any kind is not without risks, I am merely trying to present information about research conducted and the results that show promising results of the potential health benefits of medical marijuana which warrant further investigation. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - More commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease is a fatal neurodegnerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem and motor cortex. Clinical trials have indicated that cannabinoids in mice can delay ALS progression. This supports anecdotal reports from ALS sufferers who found the health benefits, of medical marijuana helpful in relieving certain disease symptoms such as pain, appetite loss and depression. http://norml.org...Chronic Pain - Chronic pain is a broad category that includes, but is not limited to, arthritis, migraines, back pain, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, phantom limb pain, scoliosis, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis and HIV, The University of California at Davis (http://www.thirdage.com...) studied the efficacy of inhaled cannabis patients with central or peripheral nerve-related pain in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Results indicated that low levels of THC was equally effective as high levels in resolving pain indicating you don't have to smoke your brains out for the analgesic effects of THC.2. ScienceThe University of California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research has done several studies into the efficacy of marijuana for neuropathic use - especially in pain reduction. They have been done using FDA standardized clinical trials with randomized, placebo-controlled procedures. These studies have clearly shown the positive effects of using marijuana as a pain reliever and medicine for patients with such chronic conditions as HIV, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, spinal cord injury, and sleep disorders. http://www.cmcr.ucsd.edu...A recent review in Germany showed that since 2005, there have been 37 controlled studies assessing the safety and efficacy of marijuana (and its compounds). These involved far more subjects than the average study seeking FDA approval for a prescription drug. http://www.cannabis-med.org...Many opponents of medical marijuana claim that there is \"little evidence\" and call for \"more research, more science.\" These are the more reasonable of the detractors for the medicinal use of marijuana, of course. Yet these reasonable arguments against marijuana as a medicine are pretty hollow given the vast amount of research that's already been done with much more on the way.Proponents of medical marijuana often ignore the research as well. Despite the common claims to the contrary, there is evidence that marijuana also has negative side effects. Most of these center on the physical effects of smoking it as well as proven cognitive negatives. Admittedly, the effects are no worse (and generally better) than the side effects associated with many prescription drugs and accepted non-prescription drugs such as alcohol or tobacco. http://www.newscientist.com...Most of the arguments for or against the use of medical marijuana seem to center on social rather than science-based concerns. This is rightly so, in some cases, as there are deep social issues involved with marijuana's use (or prohibition). Many communities have benefited from the introduction of medical marijuana, however. http://cannacentral.com... negative impacts of marijuana, socially, are nearly always associated with its prohibition rather than its allowance.3. Marijuana legalization could save US taxpayers money.Marijuana prohibition currently costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year to enforce, and it accomplishes little or nothing beneficial in terms of economic benefits. On the contrary, legalizing marijuana would not only save taxpayers billions of dollars a year in unnecessary costs, but it would also jumpstart the economy to the tune of $100 billion a year or more, say some economists.In an open letter written to the President, Congress, State Governors, and State Legislators, more than 550 economists, including several nobel laureates, draw attention to a report authored by Professor Jeffrey A. Miron that highlights the potential economic benefits of marijuana decriminalization. Entitled The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition, the report states that legalizing, taxing, and regulating marijuana would do wonders to reduce inflated budgets and generate new revenue streams.\"[R]eplacing prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation [...] would save $7.7 billion per year in state and federal expenditures on prohibition enforcement and produce tax revenues of at least $2.4 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like most consumer goods,\" say the economists. \"If, however, marijuana were taxed similarly to alcohol or tobacco, it might generate as much as $6.2 billion annually.\"As many as 60 million Americans are already estimated to be spending upwards of $110 billion a year on marijuana, the vast majority of which ends up in the hands of organized crime units. If marijuana was legalized, honest citizens could grow and sell it instead, which would inject new life into the flailing economy, and redirect billions of dollars in cash flow from criminals to legitimate growers. \"At a minimum, this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to taxpayers, foregone tax revenues, and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition,\" add the economists. http://www.huffingtonpost.com...http://www.prweb.com...",

            "conclusion": "Medical Marijuana Should Not Be Legalized.",
            "premise": "Firstly, I am not arguing that medical marijuana should never be legalized. I am arguing that it should not be legalized yet.Argument 1: Safety Concerns.Many studies have indicated that marijuana has no safety issues and some even claim it is healthy. Not every study agrees though. Some indicate major health concerns regarding marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, a major component of marijuana.) A study in the Journal of Immunology shows that THC in marijuana can promote tumor growth (1: Medscape). According to the study, the components of THC and marijuana smoke can harm the bodies anti-tumor response.Most studies that claim marijuana can slow down tumor growth involved the injection of THC (not marijuana, just the THC chemical.) Not only is medical marijuana not injected, but marijuana wasn't involved in the studies claiming THC slows tumors. The people responsible for the study even made clear that smoking cannabis will not fight cancer, \"It absolutely isn't the case that men might be able to fight prostate cancer by smoking cannabis...\"(2: Reuters). My first listed study, that showed marijuana can increase tumor growth, used actual marijuana. It also studied the smoking of marijuana instead of just injecting it. Another study showed that the use of marijuana can most definitely increase the risk of Lung Cancer (with a 97% confidence interval.) Every joint smoked a day can increase the chance of lung cancer by 8% (3: European Respiratory Journal.) While some studies show no connection between smoking cannabis and getting lung cancer, others show that every 3 joints a day increases the risk by the equivalent of 20 cigarettes a day (4: BBC News.) Other studies indicate an increase in the risk of Schizophrenia. How many studies? Schizophrenia.com cites over 30 (5: Schizophrenia.) Others even link Cannabis to Anxiety and Panic Attacks (6: Anxiety Public Hub) and another shows that, after the first hour, the risk of heart attack increases five fold (7: National Institute of Drug Abuse.) For every study that shows no connection between marijuana and health problems, there is another study that says otherwise. With the lack of solid consensus, it would be wrong to say marijuana is, without a doubt, safe. Many studies indicate some harsh side effect of using marijuana, and without a definite answer regarding the health concerns of the drug, it would be gravely irresponsible and dangerous to legalize the product for medical use. Until we know for sure what the full effect of smoking marijuana is, we shouldn't legalize the product.Many high-end studies show the side effects as being more grave than smoking plain cigarettes. We can't say for sure that marijuana is vastly dangerous, but it's the fact that we can't say for sure that makes legalizing medical use of the drug such a terrible and irresponsible move. But what if another manner of usage was applied? The injection of marijuana can cause Intravenous marijuana Syndrome (8: NCBI.) Injecting marijuana has been known to kill test mice (9: Guardian.) The injection of a chemical like THC is highly dangerous.There are too many studies linking marijuana and THC to serious health issues to conclude it's safe enough to legalize. The lack of definite Information means that marijuana for medical use should still remain illegal. Of course many medical drugs come with health concerns, few as major as what many studies link to marijuana. Although claiming that medical marijuana should be legal because many unhealthy drugs are legal would apply faulty logic, assuming that those bad drugs should be legal as well. 1: http://www.medscape.com...2: http://www.reuters.com...3: http://erj.ersjournals.com...4: http://news.bbc.co.uk...5: http://www.schizophrenia.com...6: http://www.panicattacks.com.au...7: http://www.drugabuse.gov...8: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...9: http://www.theguardian.com...2: Rate of Addictionmarijuana is, in fact, addictive. It has been suggested that as much as 30% of marijuana users can develop an addiction, while 9% will develop a severe addiction (10: Psychology Today.) Those numbers are far higher than the average rate of addiction for other drugs. This argument rests on the premise that no medical drug with a high chance of addiction should ever be legal.10: http://www.psychologytoday.com...3: Poor Prescription MethodThe method of prescription in the US is dirt poor. Adam Tod Brown, an author at Cracked.com, wrote an article describing how easy it is to get medical marijuana in California (11: Cracked.) The ease of getting medical marijuana is too great. This isn't a black market issue either. The largest problem regarding the ease of obtaining the drug is on the prescription side of legalization.Most people can obtain a prescription without needing a serious condition (like cancer), or even having a slightly above-average condition at all. Half of all prescription usages aren't regarding any form of cancer but are instead for small conditions that would hardly get a person normal medication (12: NORML.)The method of obtaining a prescription for the drug is dangerously flawed. Until major reform takes place, medical marijuana should remain illegal. The method of obtaining the drug promotes black markets and illegal usage. The flawed process also promotes illegally obtaining the drug. The process makes illegally obtaining the drug (which, without taxes, and regulations, is much cheaper) easier than when medical marijuana was illegal. 11: http://www.cracked.com...12: http://www.mapinc.org...Conclusion: Because of the vastly lacking sum of information regarding the safety of marijuana and THC, the large sum of surveys that indicate gravely negative side effects, the rate of addiction, and the terribly flawed method of obtaining a prescription, it would be irresponsible to make medical marijuana legal.Until these major issues are fixed, medical marijuana should remain illegal.",

Six of these studies sponsored by U.S. states in the 1970s and 1980s, demonstrate that smoking marijuana reduces nausea and reduces pain for many patients, especially those facing cancer chemotherapy and glaucoma. Plus thousands of patients and their families and doctors have experienced and witnessed the medical benefits of marijuana.

Too many people are suffering from these diseases and if marijuana can help them, we should legalize it so they can get better.",

            "premise": "IntroductionI would like to begin by thanking jamccartney for choosing to debate this topic with me once again. In our last debate ( http://www.debate.org... ) there were external factors that caused it to not be a very sophisticated debate. I was on vacation. The motel had horrible internet. Now after that debate has been completed, and our opinions have strengthened and we have matured, we can debate this again. I thank jamccartney again for accepting. Main Argument As you know, I am a supporter of marijuana usage for medical purposes. My opponent is not. Even after the last debate, I still do not understand how he can oppose it. My opinions have strengthened since then and I hope to persuade my opponent, the viewers, and the judges that my stance is the correct one.I will begin by defining what marijuana is. According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, marijuana is \"[t]he cannabis plant\" or \"[a] preparation made from the dried flower clusters and leaves of the cannabis plant, usually smoked or eaten to induce euphoria.\" We will utilize both definitions in this debate. Why is this? Well, medical marijuana comes in all shapes and forms. It can be smoked, injected, eaten, or otherwise consumed by drinking or other methods. Marijuana can be used to successfully treat the following things: \"1. Treatment for symptoms of AIDS 2. Glaucoma 3. Neuropathy (diseases affecting the nerves or nerve cells) Ex. epilepsy 4. Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy 5. Pain caused by structural or psycho-physiological disorders 6. Muscular spasticity and limb pain (multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury) 7. Symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Tourette\u2019s syndrome 8. Appetite stimulant for diseases of malnutrition (cachexia or starvation) 9. Nausea and vomiting (general) 10. Migraine headaches\" Now, I believe my opponent is aware that marijuana is a drug not commonly connected with overdoses. I do not believe he has ever heard of an overdose of medical marijuana or addiction to it because neither have I or most people on this Earth. If he believes it is unsafe, he is not aware of the facts. My source says, \"[t]he Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approved smoked cannabis for medical reasons. Although some aruge that this is a political decision, rather than a medical or scientific decision based on research and analysi, the FDA has approved two drugs, Marinol and Cesamet, for therapeutic uses in the U.S. These drugs contain active ingredients that are present in botanical marijuana but come in the form of a pill. Nonetheless, that the FDA has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease seems rather short-sighted.\" One can easily be addicted to pills, tablets, serums, and other forms of medications, but medical marijuana is rarely a substance that is addicted to. I do not deny that marijuana, when used in a large amount, is damaging, but you are aware that medical marijuana overdoses and addictions are virtually unheard of, yes? In my previous debate about this topic, I said, \"[h]owever, medical marijuana is the only known medicine today that can successfully diagnose epilepsy. [M]odern epilepsy medicines often fail and cannabis is often the better choice. It is virtually unheard of that there is a thing such as a marijuana overdose. It does not simply occur. However, overdoses can easily occur when taking pills, tablets, or serums.\" Marijuana, when abused and overused, will be termination instead of salvation. I argue, however, that medical marijuana can be salvation for victims of epilepsy and other such conditions when used properly. Marijuana, like other plants, of course, can be bred in order to have certain traits. Recreational marijuana makes you high and has no health benefits for the user. However, marijuana can be bred to have a low percentage of chemicals that cause you to be high and a high percentage of chemicals that affect the desired parts of the body in question. Marijuana has two main components: THC and CBD. CBD (cannabidiol) will reduce brain activity and will lower the occurances of seizures.THC is what causes one to be high. Breeding marijuana to have low THC and high CBD will be effective. This, along with other genetic modifications, will make marijuana a safe treatment. I believe I have made my point. I did rush this argument a little for I did not have much time, but I believe my argument is sufficient. I now close my argument and allow my opponent to commence his statements.

Im not saying that marijuana is a good thing in this world, but it helps cure the ill. there is some types of marijuana that are good and some types that are bad. Marijuana has been around for centuries and helped cured lots of people through that period of time.Cancer kills people so why stop that? Medical marijuana can help with alot of types of cancer. There was over 658,000 arrest alone for having the usage of marijuana, that would cost the court a lot of time and money, so why spend more money when the united states is already in debt. There is a lot of people in this world that should use medical marijuana for their sickness/illness. Marijuana is a lot safer than alcohol. that not to say that it is completely risk free, it much less addictive and does not cause nearly as much physical damage. Some people do become psychologically dependent on marijuana, and it doesn't mean that its a cure for substance abuse problems. But, from a harm reduction standpoint, it can help. Marijuana can be used to treat and prevent the eye disease known as \"\"glaucoma\"\" which increases pressure in the eye, damaging the eyeball, causing loss of vision. Some people would agree with my claim, and some people wouldnt. For example people would say that more people get arrested, then get treated with marijuana on glaucoma. It helps with cancer, so why stop, Do you want people to die?",

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's) . I will begin by presenting a few main statements and their subset points if they apply. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose (if you don't however, I will assume you either acknowledge my point or cannot refute it). I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. If you do not understand anything I say, simply ask and I will clarify, no need to be rude. My Arguments 1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization. a) Marijuana is not addictive. b)Marijuana is physically impossible to overdose on c) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true. d) The Gateway theory is fundamentally flawed e) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. causing aggressiveness or other adverse changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user. f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreased g) assuming it is true that marijuana's potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged. 2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization. a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the country b)The medical benefits of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for many c) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, stopping drugged driving) d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. e)Cannabis integration would benefit our culture and uphold our rights as a nation under the constitution.f ) Violent crime revolving around marijuana will cease. 3.Marijuana Prohibition altogether is a colossal failure. a)The whole purpose of prohibition is to prevent use nationwide, yet, marijuana use is still very prevalent.b)Because of point a, the adverse societal effects of marijuana (however miniscule) are in effect despite of prohibition, therefore prohibition is purposeless. c)It is exactly the same as the 20's alcohol prohibition save for the failure to end it. 4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for all.a) Proof of the government's failure to do this is how a constitutional amendment was needed to sign alcohol prohibition into law (and is now beng used to prohibit marijuana). This proves that the views this nation was built on differ from those that allow/support prohibition.",

I'm just going to go down and address Pro's arguments one by one, while also bringing up some more factual evidence and rhetoric. \"But for the above argument, this is very incorrect. Marijuna is not very dangerous, there has been no known deaths directly tied to the consumption or use of Marijuna. I would like to begin with the fact that Pro has brought up no sources explaining how marijuana is not dangerous. He basically said that 'because there have been no known deaths directly tied to the consumption or use of marijuana, it's not dangerous.' In the United Kingdom, more than 30,000 people could die of cannabis smoking yearly.[1] There are a few more reasons on why Marijuana is dangerous, that this quote will explain below.\" People who smoke marijuana often have the same respiratory problems as cigarette smokers. [...] Marijuana contains some of the same, and sometimes even more, of the cancer-causing chemicals found in cigarette smoke. [...] Marijuana may also cause testicular cancer. Marijuana also may affect mental health. Studies show that early use may increase the risk of developing psychosis [...] Also, rates of marijuana use are often higher in people with symptoms of depression or anxiety.\"[2][3]Also Marijuna is not addictive.No evidence to back up this point besides Pro's personal experiences which are definitely not universal. You as the voters should side with the person with more evidence and statistics to back up his/her points. The only reason users feel a feeling paranoia is because they are afraid they are going to get caught and get in HUGE trouble, which is wrong, if the government is okay with the legalization of weed, then why does it carry such a high punishment for the use, and LEGAL distribution. This entire point really contradicts itself - first, the Pro says that we need to legalize it medically, and then he goes on to say that the 'government is okay with it'. Please clarify in your next speech.Argument 2)(I don't have enough room to restate his entire point, please refer back to his 'Argument 2'.) First of all, I have brought up statistics on how marijuana is addicting, while Pro continues to assume that his experience is universal. Plus, all those responses have NO warrants- I have provided actually studies, while Pro just cites his personal experience, and brings facts into the debate round that have no citations.Finally, Pro has brought up no advantages of legalizing medical marijuana.At the end of today's debate round, I would urge a vote for the debater with more credibility and facts.1. http://www.dailymail.co.uk... 2. http://www.drugs.com...3. http://www.drugs.com...",

            "premise": "Medical Marijuana is the future of medicine. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance meaning it has the greatest potential for abuse with no medical value, according to the FDA. While the FDA doesn\"t consider marijuana a medicine, 76 percent of doctors approve of medical marijuana use to help diagnose over 25 different conditions. Medical Marijuana is already legalized in 24 out of the 50 states in the US and the number is currently growing. For example, in Colorado, a state where Medical Marijuana is legalized, 1 in every 30 people are Medical Marijuana patients meaning they have a Medical Marijuana card allowing them to purchase their medicine from dispensaries. These are just a few numbers to prove the increase of Medical Marijuana use in America. Almost thirty percent of people suffer from pain or pain related symptoms every day. Physicians that can prescribe medical marijuana have found that they have prescribed about 1,826 fewer doses of drugs, such as opioids. As this topic grows and affects American culture, we have to decide what the right choice will be to help cure our loved ones. Medical Marijuana is also a short-term cure for cancer and is used for patients with autism. The family\"s that have to go through these problems would do and try anything to help the pain and suffering of their loved ones. Doctor\"s and families rely on Medical Marijuana to help alleviate pain, so why does the FDA want to stop the sales and distribution of Medical Marijuana?",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The Federal Government can legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp",
            "premise": "I negate that The Federal Government can legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp and do so for the following three reasons. 1. marijuana impairs human functionality. 2.marijuana contains dangerous carcinogens. 3. marijuana has negative effects on the human reproductive system. Resolutional analysis- 1.Interpret the resolution as the government legalizing medical marijuana and industrial hemp, because my opponent lumps their purpose and legal issues together in his contentions. for the pro to win, they must show that the USFG can legalize BOTH marijuana and industrialized hemp. The resolution states that \"The Federal Government can legalize medical marijuana and/or industrialized hemp\" however, the government cannot legalize marijuana because it is bound by the governmental legitimacy to protect and serve its citizens. for the remainder of the round i will negate this resolution through asserting that marijuana is bad for the health of united states citizens. lets get cookin (no pun intented) Contention 1- marijuana impairs human functuality marijuana impairs human functuality in countless ways, perhaps the most notable is its adverse effects on the user's short term memory. according to the national institute on drug abuse,damage to short-term memory occurs because THC alters the way in which information is processed by the hippocampus, a brain area responsible for memory formation. http://www.nida.nih.gov... additionally, according to the division of drug and alcohol abuse \"Studies of marijuana's mental effects show that the drug can alter sense of time, and reduce ability to do things which require concentration, swift reactions, and coordination, such as driving a car or operating machinery. \" http://www.well.com... What's more is that marijuana can be psychologically detrimental to those who use. according to the DDAA http://www.well.com... of marijuana may become psychologically dependent. They may have a hard time limiting their use, they may need more of the drug to get the same effect, and they may develop problems with their jobs and personal relationships. The drug can become the most important aspect of their lives. legalizing medical marijuana would be unethical because of the long term effects on short term memory, and the psychology of those it is precribe to. Furthermore, is it not the role of pharmacutical drugs to make the user more competent than they were before? shouldn't drugs increase the overall health and well being of an individual, rather than diminish them? Contention 2-Marijuana contains carcinogens research has shown marijuana cigarettes contain more tar and higher levels of certain cancer-causing chemicals than tobacco cigarettes. according to the American Cancer Society in 2000\"DNA mutations have been found in respiratory system cells of marijuana users and several case reports have found an unexpectedly high number of marijuana users among patients with cancers of the head and neck region, including the mouth, tongue, throat, and larynx.\" \"The study looked at the relationship between marijuana use and head and neck cancers in 173 patients diagnosed with those diseases who were compared with 176 cancer-free patients.\" The average user in this study had two to three times the risk of non-users. Additionally, in her book Marijuana as medicine, PHD janet elizabeth joy warns that \"several marijuana users are at greater risk for mouth, larnyx, pharnyx, lungs, and esophogaus cancers, than the average cigarette smoker.\"http://books.google.com... Again I stress the role of pharmacuetical drugs in the Medical World. if common drugs such as zoloft or aderall had more known cancer causing agents than the average pack of cigarettes, do you really think they would be in the medical field today? this is why we see million dollar lawsuits against pharmacutical companies and the private companies developing drugs with hidden side effects. however, these side effects aren't hidden, they're well known and ridden within the drug that my opponent proposes to impose on the medical industry today. Contention 3-marijuana has negative effects on the human reproductive system. according to the DDAA, \"Some research studies suggest that the use of marijuana during pregnancy may result in premature babies and in low birth weights. Studies of men and women may have a temporary loss of fertility. These findings suggest that marijuana may be especially harmful during adolescence, a period of rapid physical and sexual development.\" addtionally according to AAFP marijuana Reduces testicular size Lower testosterone levels Decreased libido Menstrual abnormalities Impotence Change in sperm morphology/motility Infertility Gynecomastia Abnormal ova Fetal exposure Prolonged childbirth Reduced fertility in offspring should i go on? ON TO THE PRO my opponents first arg can be summed up in this statement halfway through his contention \"The Federal Government can legalize marijuana by removing it from the list of Schedule 1 drugs pursuant to findings in various medical journals, studies, and reports showing it's benefits for medical use.\" However if you look to his definition of Schedule 1 Drugs, it states that \"Schedule I drugs are classified as having a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.\" as i stated in my first contention, marijuana has a high potential for abuse, and has an ENORMOUS lack of accepted saftey for use of the drug. look to all three of my contentions to see why medical marijuana cannot be accepted as a \"safe drug\". to his contention 2 he uses the example of the prohibition act to justify legalizing marijuana. however, when was the last time that your doctor prescribed you gin and juice for that cough you had? thankfully, unless your doctor is snoop dog, that hasn't happened yet. my opponent tries to assert that medical marijuana should be legalized because the government can override state prohibitionary laws. first, this isn't true in any way, for the constitution states in the tenth amendment The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. No where in the constitution is it declared that the the states have ratified marijuaa use, so the USFG can in no way adopt this system because those rights are reserved to the states.

            "conclusion": "Medical Marijuana is, on balance, an effective medicine",
            "premise": "My opponent believes that I am not addressing his argument that marijuana is an effective medicine. I believe marijuana is an addictive drug and the claims that sometimes it is effective in reducing pain, nausea and vomiting are overstated and outweighed by its negative side effects (e.g., addictive property, cannabis-associated respiratory diseases, reduced cognitive processes, synaptic plasticity that weakens neuronal connections, increased use by teens who will believe it is OK to use even if not sick, etc.); whereas other drugs approved by the DEA and the FDA are much more effective and non-addictive, which is why there are approved as an effective medicine and pot is not. I also believe that a majority of the people who claim they need pot for medical reasons just want to get stoned legally! \"Crunching the numbers; why I say almost all medical marijuana patients are faking it.\"Posted on November 15, 2012 http://edgogek.com...http://www.guardian.co.uk...http://www.cracked.com...My opponent also believes that legislative results are not relevant, a Red Herring, an Argumentum ad populum. But, he is overlooking the fact that legislators make their decisions based on their review of all the available medical evidence supporting the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. They decide whether that positive medical evidence is sufficient to outweigh all the negative aspects of marijuana, e.g., a six-fold increase in the incidence of schizophrenia, leukemia in children born from marijuana smoking mothers and damage to the growing fetus; addictive property, cannabis-associated respiratory disease, reduced cognitive processes, etc.My opponent\"s claim that drug legalization results are irrelevant is a deductive fallacy. The only way medical marijuana can be used in any state or country legally is when the legislators agree with the alleged medical curative powers of that drug. Since most states (59%) and countries (74%) do not agree that marijuana has sufficient medicinal positive effects that outweigh the negative effects, they make it illegal, a pure and simple fact. Therefore, to say legalization is irrelevant is Reductio ad absurdum.He calls my use of drug legalization a \"Red Herring.\" He obviously has no clue as to how to use that term correctly. The expression is mainly used to assert that the argument provided by an individual is not relevant to the issue being discussed. Again, the legislators review all available evidence as to the curative powers of a drug and its side-effects and decide whether that drug should be made legal, if they do not agree that drug is made illegal or not approved. So, it is totally relevant and is not a red herring.My opponent then calls my proof an Argumentum ad populum, which it is not. Now, if I had said that pot is bad because my 10 doctor friends said so or \"that smoking is a healthy pastime, since millions do it, or that Angelina Jolie is the best-looking woman in the world because she is regularly voted as such\", then I would be making an argumentum ad populum. http://en.wikipedia.org...However, the popular vote in the polls he cites is definitely Argumentum ad populum. Depending on how the polling question is phrased and the segments (e.g. young, old, pot users versus non-pot users) of the population polled, the results can vary. For example, if you phrase the question \"Medical marijuana is very affective at stopping people going through chemotherapy from feeling nauseous and vomiting; do you think doctors should be allowed to prescribe it to help these poor sick suffering folks?\" Many will say yes. But if you phrase the question, \"Marijuana is a very addictive drug that is mind altering and has negative side-effects, but, it does help some cancer victims, as do many other safer drugs with minimal negative side-effects, do you think marijuana should be prescribe or the safer non-addictive drugs?\" You will get very different results. Then my opponent states that regardless of any bias, I deserve to lose this debate because I have not posted one relevant argument except \"marijuana is bad.\" What! Is my opponent not reading the con medical marijuana studies done by doctors and scientists that I have presented? Or, does he just not fully understand all the authoritative medical support I have presented because he is a teenager - 16 years-old, or does he just reject those con studies because they do not agree with his preconceived biased notions? Or, is my opponent just one of many teenagers that are not mature enough to understand and is already convinced because of all the argumenta ad populum that are tossed out by pathetic groups like Norml. Then my opponent brings up Marinol and claims it is less effective. Really, there are hundreds of studies and comments on this by hundreds of doctors. As usually, some are pro and some are con; but, most are pro other drugs and con medical marijuana. http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org...But, the most conclusive proof and the only one that counts in America is the research done by the US DEA - Drug Enforcement Administration and the FDA - Food and Drug Administration.\"Unlike smoked marijuana -- which contains more than 400 different chemicals, including most of the hazardous chemicals found in tobacco smoke -- Marinol has been studied and approved by the medical community and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the nation's watchdog over unsafe and harmful food and drug products.\" Secondly, the harmful chemicals and carcinogens that are byproducts of smoking create entirely new health problems. There are four-times the levels of tar in a marijuana cigarette, for example, than in a tobacco cigarette.\"Conclusion: I have presented a plethora of facts and references to studies done by doctors and scientists to nullify my opponent's weak argument that marijuana has a positive medical use. Marijuana is a very dangerous addictive drug that needs to be banned in America. There are no positive medical uses of marijuana that outweigh all its negative aspects, especially when there are much more effective and safer drugs that have been approved by the DEA and FDA, e.g., Marinol. And, the only red herrings and argumenta ad populum being thrown around are the unsupported statements and articles cited as proof by my pot smoking teenage opponent who hasn't attained the maturity necessary to even debate this subject. Stating that my opponent is too immature to debate this subject is not an ad holmium attack, just a fact; he is too young and immature being 16 years-of-age. The founding fathers of America were smart enough when drafting the US Constitution to include the minimum ages to hold offices in the House of Representatives (25), Senate (30) and President (35). They knew that only mature adults could be trusted to run the county, not teenagers or kids. They knew that important legislative decisions should not be left to teenagers. Because of our founding fathers' insightfulness, important decisions about our laws are made by mature adults, not teenagers. Maturity is critical to ensuring that correct decisions are made for America, especially when it concerns deciding if very addictive drugs with many adverse side-effects, like marijuana should be made legal for medicinal purposes. Unfortunately, too many states are caving into the popular sentiments of mainly pot-heads and pot-head organizations that are spreading lies about marijuana being a safe drug, instead of listening",

            "premise": "Jeffrey Miron is senior lecturer and director of undergraduate studies in the economics department at Harvard University. He is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of \"Libertarianism, from A to Z.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Following the liberal footsteps of Colorado and Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia passed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this month. Florida's medical marijuana law failed, but only because as a constitutional amendment it needed 60% support; 58% voted in favor of it. In 2016, another five to 10 states will likely consider legalization -- possibly Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. It's not surprising. Opinion polls show that marijuana legalization now commands majority support across the country. Do these developments mean that full legalization is inevitable? Jeffrey Miron Jeffrey Miron Not necessarily, but one would hope so. Marijuana legalization is a policy no-brainer. Any society that professes to value liberty should leave adults free to consume marijuana. Moreover, the evidence from states and countries that have decriminalized or medicalized marijuana suggests that policy plays a modest role in limiting use. And while marijuana can harm the user or others when consumed inappropriately, the same applies to many legal goods such as alcohol, tobacco, excessive eating or driving a car. Recent evidence from Colorado confirms that marijuana's legal status has minimal impact on marijuana use or the harms allegedly caused by use. Since commercialization of medical marijuana in 2009, and since legalization in 2012, marijuana use, crime, traffic accidents, education and health outcomes have all followed their pre-existing trends rather than increasing or decreasing after policy liberalized. Ricki Lake: Pot can treat cancer in kids Investors betting on marijuana in U.S. This is your body on weed The strong claims made by legalization critics are not borne out in the data. Likewise, some strong claims by legalization advocates -- e.g., that marijuana tourism would be a major boom to the economy -- have also not materialized. The main impact of Colorado's legalization has been that marijuana users can now purchase and use with less worry about harsh legal ramifications. Yet despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured. Federal law still prohibits marijuana, and existing jurisprudence (Gonzales v. Raich 2005) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition. So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president. That person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law. Whether that will happen is hard to forecast. If more states legalize marijuana and public opinion continues its support, Washington may hesitate to push back. But federal prohibition creates problems even if enforcement is nominal: Marijuana business cannot easily use standard financial institutions and transactions technologies such as credit cards; physicians may still hesitate to prescribe marijuana; and medical researchers will still face difficulty in studying marijuana. To realize the full potential of legalization, therefore, federal law must change. The best approach is to remove marijuana from the list of drugs regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the federal law that governs prohibition. Standard regulatory and tax policies would still apply to legalized marijuana, and states would probably adopt marijuana-specific regulations similar to those for alcohol (e.g., minimum purchase ages). State and federal governments might also impose \"sin taxes,\" as for alcohol. But otherwise marijuana would be just another commodity, as it was before the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. A more cautious approach would have Congress reschedule marijuana under the CSA. Currently, marijuana is in Schedule I, which is reserved for drugs such as heroin and LSD that, according to the CSA, have \"a high potential for abuse ... no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States ... [and] a lack of accepted safety for use.\" Hardly anyone believes these conditions apply to marijuana. If marijuana were in Schedule II, which states it as \"a high potential for abuse ... [but a] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" doctors could legally prescribe it under federal law, as with other Schedule II drugs such as cocaine, methadone and morphine. Given the broad range of conditions for which marijuana may be useful, including muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, nausea from cancer chemotherapy, poor appetite and weight loss caused by chronic illness such as HIV, chronic pain, stress, seizure disorders and Crohn's disease, doctors would have wide reign to prescribe, making marijuana all but legal as occurs under the broadest state medical marijuana laws, such as California and Colorado. Medical science would also face fewer regulatory hurdles to marijuana research. This \"medicalization\" approach, while perhaps politically more feasible than full legalization, has serious drawbacks. Federal authorities such as the Drug Enforcement Administration could interfere with marijuana prescribing -- as sometimes occurs with opiate prescribing. Taxing medical marijuana may be harder than taxing recreational marijuana. And the medical approach risks a charge of hypocrisy, since it is backdoor legalization. But medicalization is still better than full prohibition, since it eliminates the black market. For 77 years, the United States has outlawed marijuana, with tragic repercussions and unintended consequences. The public and their state governments are on track to rectify this terrible policy. Here's hoping Congress catches up. Shut up Gabe",

I appreciate your quick response and I await your future rebuttals. Now, however, it is time for me to expand on my argument and to make some rebuttals. I will then write a conclusion paragraph. I greatly appreciate your patience. Rebuttals & New Arguments I will make rebuttals and new arguments in this section. I would like to begin by talking about your first paragraph, which was titled \"Facts about medical marijuana.\" The paragraph is short, but I would like to point out the things we disagree on. You listed facts that are undeniable. However, it is the question of how you interpret these facts. I interpret them in a different way than you do. Also, there are some facts you did not list. Marijuana can be used in order to treat epileptic seizures and other similar conditions. Glaucoma and Multiple Sclerosis are only the tip of the iceberg. You also wrote, \"it works by binding to specific sites in the brain and on the nerves... all chemicals that bind to the brain are dangerous...\" I must agree with you that the facts are undeniable. However, I do disagree with one aspect of that specific post. Chemicals that bind to the brain can be dangerous, but - as I stated before - medical marijuana, when taken in moderation and with caution, can be beneficial for those who desperately need it. In the previous argument, I referred to it as the \"last hope\" for some people. Addiction can be an issue, but with the proper legislation enacted and regulations put in place, I don't believe there will be too many issues with the usage of marijuana for medical purposes. Also, marijuana does not always need to be smoked.Previous cases - such as the ones in CNN's two Weed documentaries - have utilized cannabis mixed into food or as a drinkable oil. In your second paragraph (titled \"Why it should not be used\"), you wrote undeniable facts about medical marijuana. Again, it is the question of how you interpret these facts. It specifically says that \"long-term use of marijuana can make lung problems worse.\" The key word is \"long-term\". Also, as I have stated before, marijuana when taken in moderation and with caution can and most likely will be beneficial for the patient. In your paragraph titled \"Other treatments\", there are both truths and unfounded opinions present. You wrote \"...there are plenty of other ways to cure illnesses.\" For illnesses related to anything other than the brain, that is mostly true. However, medical marijuana is the only known medicine today that can successfully diagnose epilepsy. As I have stated before, modern epilepsy medicines often fail and cannabis is often the better choice. It is virtually unheard of that there is a thing such as a marijuana overdose. It does not simply occur. However, overdoses can easily occur when taking pills, tablets, or serums. You should definately watch the two CNN Weed documentaries. Before I watched them, I had no opinion of medical marijuana. After I watched them, I changed. I decided that medical marijuana should be legal, but only when it is regulated. You say that there are other cures for these diseases. Tell me, what are they? Are they necessarily safer than cannabis? I say they are not. You referred to \"alternative cures.\" For many illnesses, there are NO alternative cures. Until we can find safer, more reliable medicine, cannabis must be utilized. You have a thorough knowledge of the facts, yet you misinterpret them. I hope I have convinced you. Also, I did not write at my fullest capacity. It is late and I had to rush this argument. Please forgive me. If you require more arguments from me, I will post them in the comment section. As you can see, I have not cited my sources. That is because:1. I do not need sources at the moment. I am using logic and common sense. 2. It is 11:50 PM. Once the debate is over and the voting period begins, I urge the voters to give my opponent the \"reliable sources\" points. He deserves the credit. I await your response patiently.",

            "conclusion": "Legalization of Marijuana",
            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's). I will begin by presenting all my points and their subset points for legalization. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose (if you don't however, I will assume you either acknowledge/agree with my point or cannot refute it). I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. If you do not understand anything I say, simply ask and I will clarify, no need to be rude. My Points 1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization. a) Marijuana is not addictive. b)Marijuana is physically impossible to overdose on c) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true. d) The logic of the gateway theory is fundamentally flawed and therefore it cannot be true e) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. calmness, changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user (although it would be anyway). f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreased g) Assuming it is true that marijuana's psychoactive potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged. 2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization. a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the country b)The medical benefits (known and to be known) of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for many c) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, reducing drugged driving) d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming cannabis for medical or recreational purposes. e)Cannabis integration would benefit our culture and uphold our rights as a nation under the constitution.f ) Gang violence and crime revolving around marijuana will be greatly decreased.g) Legalization's resulting industry would create jobs and generally benefit the national economy.h) Marijuana education would be healthy for both youth and adults (because now the only education is lies unless you dig deeper). 3.Marijuana Prohibition altogether is a colossal failure. a)The whole purpose of cannabis prohibition is to prevent use nationwide, yet, cannabis use is still very prevalent.b)Because of point a, the adverse societal effects of marijuana (however minuscule) are in effect despite it's prohibition, ergo prohibition is purposeless. c)marijuana prohibition is exactly the same as the 20's alcohol prohibition save for the failure to end it. 4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for the nation.a) Proof of the government's failure to do this is how a constitutional amendment was needed to sign alcohol prohibition into law (and is now being used to prohibit marijuana). This proves that the views/values this nation was built on differ from those that allow/support prohibition.",

            "conclusion": "Legalization of marijuana",
            "premise": "The legalization of marijuana has been debated for years now. However, one big factor about this argument is that we live in a democracy. How is something considered \"illegal\" if the government is for the people/ by the people? The definition of a democracy is: Noun 1. A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. On the site http://civilliberty.about.com... the 7 reasons why marijuana is illegal are listed like so: 1. It is perceived as an addictive. 2. It has \"no accepted medical use\". 3. It has been historically linked with narcotics, such as heroin. 4. It is associated with unfashionable lifestyles. 5. It was once associated with oppressed ethnic groups. 6. Inertia is a powerful force in public policy. 7. Advocates for marijuana legalization rarely present an appealing case. All of these reasons may be true, but they are solely opinions, as well. If someone wants to put this substance into their body, they should be able to without the governemnt controlling their intake. Approximately 8,400 state prison inmates were serving time for marijuana possession (any amount), and fewer than half of them were first time offenders. These people can receive one year in prison to ten years in prison, plus they are required to pay a fine typically. The sentence depends on whether it was a misdemeanor or felony possession. For drugs? You will sentence someone and take part of thier life away for drugs? In my opinion, that is ridiculous. The drugs will continue to be sold, used, and abused whether you fine and sentence the users and dealers or not. However, based on the foundation of our governemnt, the United States of America is a free country. Therefore, why aren't we allowed to take drugs? Because it harms our body? Really? Well, \"the American Medical Association argued against marijuana prohibition in the 1930s, citing its therapeutic potential. But the bureau made its case that marijuana was \"dangerous for the mind and the body,\" and the federal government outlawed its use in 1937. It wasn't until the 1970s that a campaign began to restore marijuana's therapeutic reputation, and in 1996 California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal purposes. Psychiatrist Tod Mikuriya, a founding father in the medical marijuana movement, claimed that cannabis has none of the adverse side effects of opiates. 'In fact,' he said, 'it really enhances both quality of life and rehabilitation.'\" Typical people fighting against marijuana have never used the drug. Therefore, their opinion is irreleveant. There is no proof that users become \"a fiend with savage or 'caveman' tendencies. His sex desires are aroused, and some of the most horrible crimes result.\" If people were walking around being cannibals, we'd have a problem. But guess what? They aren't. According to NIDA's 2011 Monitoring the Future study, about 7.2 percent of 8th graders, 17.6 percent of 10th graders, and 22.6 percent of 12th graders had used marijuana in the month before the survey. In fact, marijuana use declined from the late 1990s through 2007, with a decrease in past-year use of more than 20 percent in all three grades combined from 2000 to 2007. Unfortunately, this trend appears to be reversing. Since 2006, annual, monthly, and daily marijuana use increased among 10th and 12th graders. In 2011, 6.6 percent of 12th graders reported using marijuana daily, compared to 5.0 percent in 2006. Are all these kids reckless and exhibiting such canibal-like behavior? No. Marijuana should be legal for the simple reason that we live in a free country, and if someone chooses to intake a drug, they should be able to without the governemnt making decisions for them. Alcohol is legal. Sex is legal. Cigarettes are legal. Why aren't drugs? This is a free country. Your opinions do not matter because if a percentage of the population disagrees, then it should be legal anyway. FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE. The rest of the population that is against the usage can just not use it. Why jeopardize everyone else's lives and decisions? The government should not be this involved in our lives. We decide things for ourselves. This is not a dictatorship. This is a democracy. If you like being controlled by the governemnt, by all means, move to Libya!

Because this round can be utilized mainly for conclusions, it is what I will use it for. However, I have a few last rebuttals to give. I would also like to go over why I think the judges should choose a Con-vote.Throughout this debate, both my opponent and I have given sufficient, viable arguments to our sides. However, I believe my points weigh out his. Looking at my list of medical marijuana symptoms, I believe medical marijuana generally makes conditions worse. Because of this, my opponent cannot simply deny the dangers. Looking at his arguments, he has not, however he seems to not understand the pensiveness of the side effects. I will go over this again in my rebuttals.Rebuttals\"Perhaps I utilized the wrong terminology. The point I was trying to make was that the side effects are nothing in comparison to the benefits.\"If one were to look at my list of side effects, they would see that the side effects overwhelm the benefits.\"I acknowledge the potential, yet very unlikely, dangers of medical marijuana. However, it is currently the safest drug to treat epilepsy and other such conditions and diseases.\"Unlikely? The dangers are very likely. I do not know how my opponent can possibly deny this.\"No, my opponent has not refuted this. Marijuana can be bred, not only to have low THC and high CBD, but also to have reduced or eliminated side effects. It is a matter of genetics.\"I did refute it, actually. Here is the quote to prove it: \"I am speaking of the undeniable side effects of medical marijuana, even when bred a certain way.\" In that statement, I said that breeding has not done much to the side effects. Furthermore, have we ever bred it to have no side effects? No, we have not.\"While we research and try to find cures and deny individuals to use medical marijuana, people are dying. I do not deny that safer alternatives can and will be found in the future, but for now, marijuana is the safest treatment for certain conditions and illnesses. While we wait for that perfect treatment to be discovered, and people are not utilizing the positive effects of medical marijuana, death is occurring because of this.\"Let's think about the scenarios for a moment:1. A person dies from epilepsy.or 2. A person dies from drowsiness, dry mouth, giddiness, hunger, insomnia, red eyes, respiratory issues, short-term memory loss, and uneasiness or anxiety.Hmm...

            "premise": "Folks like me believe that much stricter controls and enforcement are needed. We believe that prohibition is the only answer. China, through prohibition, eliminated it opium addiction problem in 1956. And, China does not allow marijuana for recreational or medical reasons, because they know all illegal drugs are bad for their country. Of course, they also used training programs to educate everyone as to the evils of the drug and put the addicted in hospitals for treatment, and then gave them jobs. But, those who would not stop were thrown in jail for long periods, and if that did not work, they were executed, which should be what happens in the USA. But, the death penalty would be reserved for only the hardened drug dealers and those who robbed and murdered others to get more drugs. The rest can rot in jail or be cured of their marijuana addiction in jail.You will have a very hard time convincing the Bible-Belt States that marijuana should be legalized for medical purposes; and the Congress members from those states will not vote for its legalization at the Federal level despite having a former drug addicted President. Anyway, if you want to believe you won this debate that is fine with me. In my debate over legalizing where I took the con position, I lost. But, 4 out 5 of the voters were both Pro Legalization and Pro Medical Marijuana. So, if 80% of the people that read these blogs at this site who vote are Pro Legalization of Marijuana, any person taking the Con position will lose. I am not sure that debating at this site proves anything. I will say that the majority of people in America are against legalizing marijuana for recreation and medicinal purposes based on the number of states that have passed legislation. Only 18 and DC have passed Medical Marijuana and two recreational (Washington and Colorado) out of 50 states and DC or 51. 21 our 50 states and DC is 21/51 or 41% - so based on legalization results \" I won! And, if you throw in the 5 US territories where marijuana is illegal, then you have 21/55 or only 38% - so I won again! Marijuana is illegal in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Mariana Islands. Based on legislative results, I have won this debate hands down. Let's look at countries where marijuana is illegal: Albania, Austria, Bolivia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominica, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Malta, Montenegro, Nepal, New Zealand, North Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Syria, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Vietnam. I had to add South Korea, where it is illegal.http://en.wikipedia.org...I did an analysis of the 82 countries noted above and classified into Legal and Illegal, which includes a few that allow it specifically for medical purposes, and I did not include the USA or Australia, where it is mostly illegal. My analysis revealed that 61 countries (61/82) or 74% prohibit marijuana for any reason. So, I have won the argument based on countries. You lose!So the people running these countries were smart enough to know that Marijuana should never be legalized for any reason, including for medical purposes. What do they know that you apparently don't get?I do expect the voting at this site to be in your favor, because most if not all the voters will be Pro POT for both recreational and medical purposes. But, in the World View, and based on the how many states has legalized it for medical purposes in the USA, I am a clear winner in this debate.I just wish you would take the time to read all the authoritative medical studies done on the addictive harmful effects of marijuana, and how it has no valid reason to be used medically. It is not clear to me how you could still hold your ill-informed and ridiculous position that it should be legalized for medical purposes. \"BIOLOGY & MEDICINE - 'Medical' Marijuana Is A Dangerous Fraud\" http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com...Here are other articles that totally prove my point - you need to read and face those facts that present the truth, not the junk that you are using as proof!http://www.justthinktwice.com...https://www.ncjrs.gov...http://teens.webmd.com...",

Marijuana can be bred, not only to have low THC and high CBD, but also to have reduced or eliminated side effects. It is a matter of genetics. Genetics experts can make the necessary modifications for marijuana to be 100% safe. Marijuana right now, actually, is close to 100% safe when used safely and carefully. \"I did not ignore it, I simply did not wish to break the rules.

As far as allowing people to grow marijuana and sell it as medical marijuana, no way! \"MARIJUANA SMOKING AS MEDICINE: A CRUEL HOAX\" \"Damaging effects in man caused by prolonged exposure to marijuana smoking have been reported in two recent International Symposia; they include emphysema-like symptoms, cancer of the lung, mouth and tongue, prolonged impairment of memory and of psychomotor performance resulting in train or car accidents, a six-fold increase in the incidence of schizophrenia, leukemia in children born from marijuana smoking mothers and damage to the growing fetus. However, if smoked marijuana had unique therapeutic properties, these forgoing undesired effects could be overlooked. Prominent cancer specialists such as Dr. R. J. Gralla of Sloane-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center, Dr. D. S. Ettinger of Johns Hopkins Medical School, Dr. George Hyman of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Dr. John Laszlo, Vice President for Research of the American Cancer Society have concluded that the crude drug marijuana taken by inhalation has only limited effectiveness in the treatment of vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and documented negative effects on pulmonary, cardiovascular and immunity systems. The American Cancer Society stated in 1989 that the results of clinical investigations were insufficient to warrant the decontrol of marijuana smoking for medical use. the American Medical Association and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expressed a similar opinion.\" http://druglibrary.org... \"The medical marijuana hoax\" \"I also believe that a panel of Doctors should decide what limited medical reasons would be allowed where the pharmacological active pure THC ingredient would be allowed. Right now there are too many reasons that a doctor could use to prescribe the drug. For example, the legislative wording in Massachusetts and vague, subjective, and vulnerable to serious abuse, e.g., used for physical and emotional aliments from menstrual cramps to server shyness.\" http://www.jenniferbraceras.com... I think the sole reason for allowing its use would be patients undergoing chemo that can\"t handle the chemo. And, there are many more drugs to fix that. I have a close friend that has gone through chemo 3 times now, without smoking one joint to help him through. So, yes I have no problem with the government or any state passing legislation that allows drug companies to manufacture the pure THC ingredient under FDA guidelines and regulation. As far as allowing people to grow marijuana and sell it as medical marijuana, no way!",

For the purposes of this debate, medical marijuana will stand as Marijuana used to help manage, suppress, or reverse symptoms from medical disorders, such as (but not necessarily limited to) those mentioned by my opponent. The main chemical used in \"medical marijuana\" that helps to manage disease is Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC. While THC can be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases, the parts of the cannabis plant used to make 'medical marijuana\" contain only three percent THC. In order to intake this measly amount of THC, the patient must also assume the numerous harms of in taking marijuana itself, including the intake over 400 hazardous chemicals and numerous psychological and physiological hazards. But wait: the (few) good things that marijuana brings to the medical industry have already been isolated and incorporated into a FDA-approved pharmaceutical drug called Marinol. Marinol preserves the benefits of THC while lessening or eliminating the harms brought about by Marijuana consumption. If the harms can be lessened, why legalize a destructive alternative that is in all cases inferior and will be abused? Medical professionals have noticed the notable effects of certain narcotics in the suppression of pain. Does that mean that they legalize opium or heroin? Of course not, because pharmacists can isolate the positive effects of pain suppression and reduce the rather negative effects of extreme addiction and potential for homicidal rage. Why, then, legalize medical marijuana, when the aforementioned pharmaceutical drugs are superior in every regard to marijuana? The affirmative plan holds no greater utility, and accordingly, it is your duty to vote Con. Criteria: For Pro to win, he must prove that \"medical marijuana\" has some sort of benefit that is not matched by currently-approved THC-utilizing drugs, and must further prove that these said benefits outweigh the benefits that the FDA-approved drugs hold over marijuana.

Marijuana is still a drug and bringing it around minors is irresponsible in the first place. In order for marijuana legalization to work the people must start to take full responsibility for there actions. One major reason why marijuana is not legal yet is the dumb stoner stereotypes. See drug testing can still be done even if marijuana's legal. An employer should be able to test for whatever they want. Now lets stick to the topic of marijuana. Could you imagine the amount of jobs the marijuana industry could create? Coffee shops that supply and employ those 18 and older. A significant tax revenue from each of those coffee shops could help save many economically struggling cities. Look what the medical marijuana industry has done to California.

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S.",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I would like to begin by defining a couple of terms. If my opponent disagrees with my definitions, then he/she can suggest and justify alternative definitions, however terminology should be agreed upon within the first half of the debate. I will not use dictionary definitions; let us just keep it simple. Possession means owning something. Use means smoking/inhaling/eating/vaporizing/etc. marijuan. Recreational marijuana means that adults ABOVE THE AGE OF 21 YEARS OLD are allowed to purchase up to SEVEN GRAMS of marijuana for any reason, with no medical conditions required. Legalized means that we remove the penalties from marijuana activities and that we regulate marijuana in dispensaries at which consumers of age can purchase it. The U.S. refers to all fifty states of the United States of America; the resolution seeks to essentially overturn the national ban on cannabis. The framework for this round should be net benefits. Unless my opponent is able to demonstrate that the costs of legalizing marijuana in the U.S. overwhelmingly outweigh the benefits, the Pro should win the round. Contention 1: Economic Benefits. Legalizing pot allows the United States to allow a wealth of economic benefits in the form of tax revenue and also in the form of liberating costly prisoners from incarceration. We have already seen examples of collecting revenue. According to the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), between January 2014 and October 2014, Colorado accrued 40 million dollars of tax revenue by legalizing marijuana and allowing 21+ citizens to purchase it. Suppose that we extrapolated legalization to the whole country. According to the Huffington Post, this would result in $8.7 billion per year in the form of state and federal taxes. Taxing any good or service allows the economy to grow, because it provides money that is uesd for other programs. In the case of marijuana legalization, these programs translate to education, health care, and drug addiction treatment, valuable impacts in our society. Furthermore, legalizing marijuana prevents costs that are associated with incarcerating individuals. According to the DPA, approximately 750 thousand citizens are arrested for an infraction of marijuana law each year. Furthermore, the cost of incarceration is $47,000 per prisoner per year. This translates to 7 to 10 billion dollars per year that are wasted on locking up stoners (rather than rapists or murderers). Clearly, not only does legalizing marijuana create money; keeping it illegal costs money. This 35 billion dollars could be used to reduce the national deficit, solve other crimes, or perhaps reduce taxes on American citizens. Contention 2: Legalizing marijuana reduces crime. Legalizing marijuana prevents police officers from wasting their time arresting harmless stoners, when they could be spending these efforts and resources fighting actually dangerous crimes, such as murder, theft, or rape. According to RollingStone Magazine, marijuana arrests are no longer real \"police work\"; law enforcement would rather spend their time tackling other crimes such as murder and rape. This argument is intuitive rather than logical; less time wasted on activity X (stopping pot smoke) leads to more time available for activity Y (stopping murder). LearnLiberty echoes this message: \"legalizing marijuana frees up resources to solve other crimes\". The impact is clear: a reduction in violent crimes that hurt American citizens, if the U.S. is smart enough to legalize pot. Contention 3: Legalizing marijuana reduces or eliminates racial discrimination in law enforcement. It should be clear to the layperson that most marijuana arrests are against racial minorities, particularly blacks. A black individual is no more likely to use pot than a white person but, in Washington D.C., is over 8 times more likely to be arrested for it. This is what one could refer to as a Jim Crowe system; blacks suffer from mass incarceration much more than whites do, but they do not commit any more wrongdoings than whites. In order to provide for an American system of equality of opportunity and justice without regard to skin color, marijuana should be legalized. This will prevent irrationally suspicious police officers from locking up \"dangerous blacks\" (who, in truth, are not the least bit dangerous; they are just minding their own business); this racist enforcement is unethical, discriminatory, and clearly non-beneficial. Contention 4: Regulated marijuana is healthier marijuana. When alcohol was prohibited (i.e. before the 1920's), this led to an extensive black market whereby Americans still found ways to produce, purchase, and enjoy alcoholic beverages such as rum and beer. The same phenomenon occurs with marijuana. Even if marijuana is perceived to be dangerous, keeping it illegal does not deter its use. In fact, the criminal nature of cannabis provides a compelling reason for drug cartels to enter the country and sell cannabis, with no regard to whether the weed is tainted with dangerous chemicals like PCP. Since the illegality of marijuana fails to have any deterrent effect, legalizing pot will allow the government to closely control and regulate it. This allows for high-quality marijuana, meaning that consumers will enjoy marijuana that has no dangerous chemicals in it and that achieves standards of safety and health. This makes it a safer option. The influx of drug cartels is associated with the trade of weapons and also with violence, coercion, and sometimes murder. It is easier for a teenager to obtain a joint than it is for him to obtain a can of beer. Since Americans smoke pot regardless of whether or not it is legal, we should legalize it so that citizens purchase it from trusted, regulated dispensaries rather than untrustworthy, sketchy black-market dealers. Contention 5: Americans have freedom of choice. An American citizen should be able to do whatever she want, so long as her actions do not infringe upon the rights of others. Even if skeptics were successfully able to argue that smoking pot is harmful (which I would disagree with), Americans can choose to engage in harmful activities, as long as the others in society do not feel the effects of these choices. People are allowed to eat candy, drink beer, watch TV all day, and smoke cigarettes. Why should we limit the behavior of an individual simply due to archaic notions without any substantial evidence? Marijuana is used for a wide variety of medicinal and leisure purposes, and its effects have been described as uplifting, stress-relieving, and relaxing. To keep marijuana illegal is at variance with the pursuit of happiness that Thomas Jefferson had in mind when America was established as an independent nation. If individuals want to smoke pot, they should be able to do so, particularly in the privacy of their own homes. For many citizens, occasional marijuana use improves the quality of their lives and has medicinal benefits. Some who need it for medical use are too impoverished to afford to obtain a medical recommendation from their doctors, making their medicinal options severely limited. Keeping marijuana illegal is an invasion of privacy. In short, to legalize pot is to provide Americans with the freedoms of choice and discretion and the liberty that they deserve. I have posted evidence below that substantiates my claim. In short, the legalization of marijuana leads to benefits that address the economy, other crimes, racism, national safety, and the freedom of choice. These are all significant benefits that contribute to my proposed framework of \"net benefits\". A reason why keeping marijuana illegal is disadvantageous is equivalent to a reason why making marijuana legal is advantageous. Too many dollars are wasted in prohibition. Too many lives are locked up in prohibition. To many blacks and Hispanics are unfairly arrested in prohibition. Too many drug cartels enter the U.S. in prohibition. Finally, too many freedoms and basic liberties are violated in prohibition. For these reasons, the possession, use, and sale of recreational marijuana should be legalized in the U.S. Please vote Pro.

            "conclusion": "Medical Marijuana",
            "premise": "I would like to thank 16kadams for his impressively swift response. Now let's move on to the rebuttal. R1: Terrible Health DefectsMy opponent makes a rather presumptuous claim by immediately stating that it has \"terrible health defects\" with only one source to back it up, an anti-drug website (primarily to inform children). The first problem with this is that it states \"may be hazardous\" so we already know that there is no definite harm. Smoking is also not the only way of consuming marijuana. Also, what the source is implying is that smoking marijuana to an extent will cause harm, not medically or with care. My opponent must also believe all kinds of drugs should be illegal for medical use because of side-effects such as morphine, levitra, novocaine, and other painkillers. Marijuana would be prescribed safely as it is a non-addictive drug. The U.S. Department of Justice as well as the FDA have both confirmed that marijuana has not killed anybody and is not fatalistic or even as close to as harmful as most toxic drugs. [1,2] My opponent has not justified his contention and a slight possibility of damage can easily be avoided with proper medical care. Even tobacco is far more dangerous than marijuana. R2: FDA statement My opponent provides no source so we can not even say that this statement is true. Also, as I stated earlier the FDA also stated that marijuana is safe even in recreational purposes. When he provides a source we can further deplore into the contention's validity or invalidity. R3: Schizophrenia Here Con merely confuses causation and correlation. As his source states, \u201cOne explanation may be that the two factors are coincidental, not causal: perhaps people who have a genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia also happen to especially enjoy marijuana.\u201d The article also later states \u201cBut when the researchers controlled for other factors known to influence schizophrenia risk, including gender, education and socioeconomic status, the association between disease onset and marijuana disappeared.\u201d[3] So interestingly enough Con's single source blatantly contradicts his statement proving its falsehood. Thus we can come to the conclusion that this contention is completely invalid. R4: Testicular Cancer Not only does this claim disregard the entire female population but when it gets right down to it, there is no definite link. Again Con commits the fallacy of causation and correlation. The number of cases has increased simply because the population increased, not because more people began smoking marijuana. There is no definite evidence in this claim. Perhaps if one smokes marijuana to a certain extent this is slightly possible but there is no definite harm and no definite way in which we can derive that this problem is potent and will occur in the medical field. R5: Withdrawal The first flaw in the contention is that all of his evidence only refers to marijuana smokers living at home, not in the hospital or supervised by a doctor. Also the evidence collected was done by observers, not the person who is actually experiencing the results. Yet again, Con fails to prove how this is a definite harm but is rather a mere side effect, one that many far more harmful drugs have. R6: AIDS Yet again my opponent fails to read through his entire source, a common mistake by debaters. The source as a cumulative review states, \u201cThe profile of cannabinoid drug effects suggest that they are promising for treating wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Nausea, appetite loss, pain, and anxiety are all afflictions of wasting, and all can be mitigated by marijuana. Although some medications are more effective than marijuana for these problems, they are not equally effective in all patients.\u201d [4] It establishes that AIDS/HIV as a matter of fact is benefited by medical marijuana, an indisputable fact accepted by any medicine program who reads the evidence and weighs the impacts. Thus my opponent has no direct refutation and rather promotes my case. R7: Alzheimer's Disease There is no direct refutation. Con's evidence this time completely supports my case. It is apparent that he obviously has not even read his statement. Let's comparse the contention. \u201c\"If it is possible to make drugs that act only on CR2 [one of two main types of cannabinoid receptor in the brain]... they might mimic the positive effects of cannabinoids without the damaging ones of marijuana.\u201d So the contention is stating that there may be something that can replace marijuana and it actually accepts that there are numerous positive benefits of marijuana, but let's move on to see how whimsical this argument is. He quotes \u201cHowever, this is a fairly new field of research and producing such selective drugs is not an easy task. There is also no evidence yet that cannabinoid-based drugs can slow the decline in human Alzheimer's patients.\u201d Thus his evidence says that replacing it is not easy and is not reliable. Obviously his proposal is completely contradictory. Finally it says there is no evidence that these drugs he is advocating for can slow the decline. Yet again his source proves his new proposal unreliable and is not valid. There yet again is no direct refutation so the judge must assume that marijuana can benefit Alzheimer's as his case even indicated. R8: Marijuana being addictive?? My opponent yet again goes on to discuss marijuana for recreational use, not medical use. These are two completely different things. It is an ancient belief that marijuana is addictive. Not only does his evidence provide no definite link, I'll provide multiple sources proving that it is not addictive but rather compulsory however almost anything can become compulsory. I suppose food, water, love and debating are bad as well. With that in mind, let's look at some evidence. According to Psychology Today (where some of Con's evidence derives from) marijuana is not an addictive drug for most people. [5] According to a longitudinal study of young adults who had first been surveyed in high school also found a high \"discontinuation rate\" for marijuana. While 77% had used the drug, 74% of those had not used in the past year and 84% had not used in the past month. Of course, even people who continue using marijuana for several years or more are not necessarily \"addicted\" to it. Many regular users - including many daily users - consume marijuana in a way that does not interfere with other life activities, and may in some cases enhance them. [6,7] There has been no scientific evidence that marijuana is an addictive for it is a presumptuous myth and should be disregarded. R9: Alternatives First off Con provides 0 evidence going through every benefit of marijuana and replacing it with another drug. Even if perhaps he were to go through virtually everything, that still wouldn't discard the legal validity of medical marijuana. As long as it has benefits (which my opponent fails to address) then it should not be illegal and it should not be a crime to use it for medical purposes. My opponent thinks that he can justify how medical marijuana is invalid. While I think it is perfectly fine for him to get inspiration from his dad this does not stand in a debate and voters should already by now have determined that Con's claims are not supported and are rather lavish. Conclusion: My opponent fails to read his evidence and has no direct refutation towards any of my arguments but rather states that the FDA does not approve (no source). So because my opponent can not support almost any of his claims, is arguing against recreational purposes rather than medical, commits logical fallacies time and time again, fails to read his sources that work towards my case, and disregards a majority of my case I strongly urge a PRO vote.For sources see the sources debate.

As noted by my own opponent, medical marijuana can help alleviate symptoms of pain, discomfort, and lack of appetite caused by many common disease, including AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, etc. This can go uncontested, as my opponent has already agreed that medical marijuana has these properties. Of course, there are even more benefits of marijuana, such as a prevention of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and its progression. (1)(2) A legalization of medical marijuana would aid those who are in pain from said diseases and symptoms. 2) Reduce number of those in prison. The current amount of arrests of marijuana-related crimes totals over 700,000 thousand a year, and that was back in 2005! (3) Of these, a whopping 88% were just for simple possession, while the rest were only for sale or manufacture. (3) These inmates who have done nothing morally wrong or reprehensible are now spending years and years in prison, just for possessing or growing marijuana. 3) Help cut our spending. We currently spend more than 15.5 billion dollars a year on marijuana arrests. (4) If legalized and taxed, not only would we eliminate that spending, but we would also have a major source of revenue that would help pull us out of this recession, as marijuana is our best cash crop, pulling in $35 billion dollars per year. (5)(6) 4) Little to no side effects. Marijuana causes a very small amount of, if at all, side effects, which are negligible at best. (7)(8) 5) It doesn't make any sense to render it illegal. And that's the crux of the matter, isn't it? It is not overly harmful, if at all, and it doesn't have any second-hand smoke effects. There is simply no logical/moral reason to keep it illegal. No one should have a right to tell you what you can and cannot ingest. You don't violate the rights of others in any way, shape or form, so why should it be illegal? There is not convincing argument as to why. 6) User's choice. The consumer is not forced to buy, smoke, or use marijuana in any way. It has no negative repercussions to anyone aside to the consumer. Marijuana does not make you do anything. If you choose to purchase and smoke marijuana, it is your choice, and the government should not prevent you from ingesting what you will, be it alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana. I thank my opponent for this debate, and look forward to his next round. SOURCES http://www.scientificfactsofpot.com... (1)(8) http://tinyurl.com... (2) http://www.nowpublic.com...

            "conclusion": "Marijuana Should Be Legal For Medicinal Purposes",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his refutations and I thank the voters for reading. Heart Disease- The article my opponent links and quotes in refutation does not lead to a source where the content of his quotation can views. Whereas the Heritage foundation clearly shows that heart disease comes with prolonged exposure to marijuana. Furthermore even the American Heart Foundation[19] backs this claim with even more evidence on the matter. [19] http://www.heart.org... To claim marijuana has no effect on the heart is the height of irresponsibility. Immune System Deficiency- I would like to point out the my opponents cited source for his immune system argument, Norml.org, is a source with the express purpose of legalizing marijuana. Furthermore he doesn't he link to the article he links to the site's homepage; whereas I have offered several qualified academic sources to suggest that long-term marijuana usage harms the body's T-Cells, especially in the lungs where blood is oxygenated. It wasn't Dr. Nahas that I cited to show the effects of marijuana on the immune system, it was a collaborative study headed by Dr. Nora Volkow, NIDA director. The study explicitly stated that[20] \"marijuana smoke does irritate the lungs and increases the likelihood of other respiratory problems through exposure to carcinogens and other toxins. Repeated exposure to marijuana smoke can lead to daily cough and excess phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illnesses, and a greater risk of lung infections. Marijuana also affects the immune system\" [20] http://www.drugabuse.gov... Birth Defects- Again my opponent cites the marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML; this evidence is biased and should not be preferred against the evidence the Con provides. Furthermore pregnant women should not partake of any manner of smoke related products. Marijuana can cause significant harm to a fetus just as cigarettes or alcohol can. From Otis Prenancy, \"Marijuana contains about 400 different chemicals, and some marijuana cigarettes may contain other drugs or pesticides ... one study reported an increased risk for heart defects among babies prenatally exposed to marijuana.[21]\" [21] http://www.otispregnancy.org... Finally I would like to point out to the voters that in my opponent's very own refutations he compares marijuana to the likes of alcohol and cocaine; I cannot stress this enough, but these are not medicine. Saying that marijuana is safer than cocaine is not a reason to use it in medicine. For recreational use, people should be able to do whatever they want; but in medical usage we shouldn't allow something because it's safer than cocaine. Schizophrenia and Paranois- I will group these two arguments; I will at this point respond the issue of empirically accountability civilly, but with urgency; My opponent has consistently make harsh empirical claims throughout this debate and linked to either an article from an unreputable or outright biased sourse; the refutation here comes from ProCon.org, and doesn't even link to a specific study. This is not an academic source and shouldn't be accepted on the basis of the preponderance of evidence against my prior cited sources which do indeed show a direct casual link between marijuana usage and psychosis of the brain[13] \"This showed that the effects on individual brain regions were subtle, but brain waves across the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were completely disrupted. These two brain areas are vital for memory and decision-making, so the rats were no longer able to accurately navigate a maze. Both areas are also involved in schizophrenia.\" Cancer- This refutation is wholly unacceptable. I offer legitimate evidence to warrant the arguments on marijuana's link to cancer, and my opponent simply claims that this was not what he found in his research. This argument is a drop from my opponent and should be directly extended. Anesthetic- By the preponderance of evidence my cited evidence shows that marijuana is indeed an anesthetic. Furthermore in my attacks of the Pro case I show by explicitly citing my opponent own sources that marijuana is only ever used in some regards to anesthesia; it numbs the body's pain which while it does relax the patient does nothing to treat their condition Look directly to my refutations of my opponent's arguments in the prior round. I cite Dr. Mbakwe saying, [16]\"...other medications, like methotrexate, treat the autoimmune disease at the root of the problem, and in turn can control pain and inflammation in combination with pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ... On the other hand, while marijuana may help with pain symptoms, it does nothing for the disease progression or organ damage\" be mindful that this evidence was provided by Pro, not me; it is legitimate ans shows that marijuana has not medical benefit beyond anesthesia. Addictive- My opponent sources don't lead to the cited article, they lead to the main webpages of NIDA and Psychology Today; there is not empircal or unbiased study to follow in order to solidify my opponent's claims. Furthermore, a simply search of the NIDA website validifies my claim of addictiveness[22]. It states, \"Long-term marijuana use can lead to addiction; that is, people have difficulty controlling their drug use and cannot stop even though it interferes with many aspects of their lives.[22]\" and \" ...marijuana accounted for 4.5 million of the estimated 7.1 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs.1 In 2009, approximately 18 percent of people aged 12 and older entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse...[22]\" [22] http://www.drugabuse.gov... quite frankly I'm not sure what my opponent is attempting to cite. Gateway Drug-. NORML.org is again being utilized here. This evidence is biased and should be rejected. Aside from that my original argumen concerning marijuana as a gateway drugs referred to it as such because made a gateway for other drugs to come into the country[2]; it has opened a gateway for drug trafficking and crime to prosper and run rampant. This argument concerning crime was never addressed Now at the end of this rebuttal three things remain clear; - Marijuana is not a sustainable treatment for any manner of disease. The only function it serves in the medical community is an anesthetic one; even my opponent's evidence points to this truth. Any vote for the Pro would be irresponsible and place patients in harms way where there are plenty of alternatives to marijuana usage - Pro's refutation (as well as advocacy, which we'll get to in the next speech) concern themselves with marijuana on a recreational level. Not a medical level. All of the negative impacts I have provided, both through my constructive as well as my rebuttals have been met with responses of marijuana's relative safeness compared to such recreational drugs as alcohol as cocaine. Comparative safety to the likes of cocaine does not warrant usage in medicine. - The significant amount of harms associated with medical marijuana do not warrant it's sole usage as an anesthetic . I show such impacts as psychosis, immune system deficiency and heart disease which my opponent only meets with weak rebuttals from biased sources. These impacts must be acknowledged and we must be mindful of them; denying them for the sake of argumentation is irresponsible and could put lives at risk if voted on. I urge the voters to consider these issues; marijuana may be viable as a recreational drug, but should not be used in medicine where patients entrust their lives expecting to be taken care of. There are reasonable alternatives to marijuana. Vote Con!",

            "conclusion": "Medical Marijuana is, on balance, an effective medicine",
            "premise": "1. Drug legalization Again, these issues are irrelevant. We are not debating drug legalization, we\u2019re not even debating the legalization of medical marijuana, and we are arguing whether or not medical marijuana is an effective medicine. Although the points he makes about opium are highly debatable, the points are indeed irrelevant. Looking at the resolution, the red herring of this argument is obvious. It should have no bearing on the voters. 2. Majorities I don\u2019t know where my opponent is going with this. He writes the point as if it\u2019s a rebuttal, when I have never even mentioned a pol l or country laws. Regardless, he seems to have not looked into the new polls on legalization. Last time I checked, 51% of Americans supported pro-marijuana policies (the number was higher for medical purposes) and only 44% opposed it. Regardless, this point is also irrelevant. What the majority thinks is irrelevant to something\u2019s effectiveness. Also, it is subject to the argumentum ad populum fallacy. This point, too, should be disregarded. 3. Biased votes Regardless of any bias, you deserve to lose this debate because you have not posted one relevant argument except \u201cmarijuana is bad\u201d, you have not even contested (other than a few personal stories) my effectiveness argument! Even a drug czar would admit you are losing this debate \u2013 or, at least, in this situation. Also, only about 50% of the members support drug legalization (amongst the active members, the amount it likely slightly higher, maybe 55 or 60%.) My opponent also assumes every person who is \u201cpro drug\u201d will vote against him. Many voters on this site are reasonable and can give objective votes on debates. And, this too is irrelevant to the argument. Even if there is voter bias, how does this prove medical marijuana is bad? 4. It\u2019s bad for you I have not doubted this. Marijuana is not a harmless drug, but it\u2019s not very harmful either. Yes, marijuana often leads to throat problems and, for some parts of the population, lung problems. As I have argued throughout the debate, using credible sources, the amount of damage marijuana causes is highly over stated by government agencies. Marijuana has unproven links to cancer and often helps treat the diseases it supposedly causes, so it may have a net-zero when used medically (recreational use likely will have no such counterbalancing effect \u2013 marijuana usage recreationally is unhealthy). The vast amount of new research supports medical marijuana. My opponent cites one study done by the government. First, it claims there is no proof smoked marijuana is of any benefit, especially for cancer. This claim is empirically untrue. As I stated in round one, there have been more clinical trials proving medical marijuana as a safe medicine than almose every FDA approved drug, but the issue is so politicized the FDA has been forced to ignore these findings. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the NIDA has blocked research (which some organizations trying to research the issue have claimed). The 1999 Institute of medicine report noted many benefits of marijuana, but still claimed it was not a \u201cmodern\u201d medicine. In their 2000 report, they were able to put more light on even newer research. This report noted, \u201cConsiderable clinical evidence indicates that marijuana could yield a variety of useful medicines, especially for nausea, vomiting, and appetite stimulation. THC, in the form of Marinol (dronabinol), has already been used for more than a decade to treat these symptoms in cancer patients and for several years in AIDS patients as well. But other cannabinoids, or combinations of cannabinoids, may prove to be more effective than THC alone. If so, any pharmaceuticals that result from such discoveries could benefit people with AIDS as well as those living with cancer.\u201d[1] With so many studies, and prestigious medical associations providing robust research on the topic, I am appalled by the government cherry picking the evidence, ignoring these reports, and they claiming there is no evidence. Sadly, they are the ones with no evidence. Marinol, which my opponent talked about, is much less effective than marijuana, as my quote stated. It takes hours to work, due to its oral route as a pill, and is much weaker than marijuana. Marijuana, being smoked, is more potent (but more potent =/= worse) and is much more effective. Extra strength Tylenol is more potent, but more effective, so is my opponent points this out he might as well ban most medicines with high dosages. The vast preponderance of evidence supports my position; I don\u2019t see how my opponents op-eds somehow refute strong research. The IOM 2000 report notes every report published three years before theirs by medical organizations shows evidence is strongly on the side of marijuana\u2019s effectiveness. Again, my opponent has provided no strong counter evidence to my claims. He, therefore, has lost the effectiveness point and the debate. My opponent cites one good source on the issue of medical marijuana, a two page pdf with no blatant bias or dishonesty, but it seems to have ignored the 2000 IOM report. The 1999 report essentially said marijuana is bad, it\u2019s a good medicine, but marinol is probably better. The 2000 report looked into the evidence published after the IOM report. Although asking for more research, they state marijuana is bad (though how bad it actually is remains uncertain), marijuana is a good medicine, marijuana is better than marinol and other medications [1]. My opponent\u2019s reference is a little outdated\u2026 CONCLUSION: I think this debate for anyone is obvious. My opponent has engaged in mainly red herrings, and has given little evidence that marijuana is an ineffective medicine (and the evidence he has given is either weak or has been refuted). I strongly urge a pro vote. 1. http://www.nap.edu...",

            "premise": "I will begin my refutation by responding to the arguments of Marijuana compared to Alcohol and tobacco, and henceforth move on to refute the more pertinent medical argument. Alcohol and Tobacco- Quite simply put, the resolution deals with medical marijuana - not recreational. My opponent's argument concerning marijuana's relative safety compared to alcohol and tobacco is really irrelevant; that's like making the claim that doctors should utilize heroin as a cough suppressant, much like what was done prior to 1910[14] because heroin is safer than eating glass sharps. Glass shards aren't medicine, and neither are alcohol and tobacco. [14] http://www.businessinsider.com...- Concerning the medical arguments, Pro also uses only three different sources for his medically related arguments; HowStuffWorks, Business Insider and Opposing views -- one of which is a blog. Accordingly when debating empirics, con has the preponderance of evidence working in his favor for his more varied sources and for citing articles more directly from the source. Medical Benefits- Cancer- The article my opponent cites for marijuana preventing the spread of cancer is actually taking the original study out of context. The cited business insider article references an article from the Huffington post which references the original study, stating[15] \"...cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid with a low-toxicity profile, could down-regulate Id-1 expression in aggressive human breast cancer cells. The CBD concentrations effective at inhibiting Id-1 expression correlated with those used to inhibit the proliferative and invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells.\" The evidence was neither conclusive, not did it cure cancer; it only slowed down breast cancer cells in isolation. Furthermore, cannabidiol isn't in marijuana, it's a compound which is created using cannabis; the chemicals can be isolated and made in the absence of marijuana. Meanwhile, as I show in my constructive, marijuana is not a long-term solution. It doesn't cure anything, it acts as an anesthetic while impairing mental function[9][10][11] and reducing the body's ability to fight off infections by killing T-Cells (white blood cells)[8]. [15] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... Alzheimers- Again, following the article provided by my opponent will lead you to an article hosted by the Huffington Post[16] which details that marijuana serves as an anesthetic - not as a treatment for the disease. So then putting aside the fact that there are plenty of other anesthetics a person could use, we see that the article details an extensive list of side effects from marijuana usage. \"Smoking marijuana can increase a person's heart rate for up to three hours, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana also contains carcinogens (possibly 50 percent to 70 percent more than cigarettes), making smoking potentially harmful to RA patients, who may already suffer from lung problems.[16]\" \"Hazards of these products can include things like bacteria and mold, which would be illegal to sell in regulated food items. Some products may also be prepared in kitchens that aren't licensed, may not adhere to refrigeration schedules, or may be made with allergens like peanuts, but not labeled as such.[16]\" \"Dr. Mbakwe is uncomfortable with the lack of control and regulation of medicinal marijuana. She says other medications, like methotrexate, treat the autoimmune disease at the root of the problem, and in turn can control pain and inflammation in combination with pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ... On the other hand, while marijuana may help with pain symptoms, it does nothing for the disease progression or organ damage, Dr. Mbakwe says. [16]\" [16] http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Multiple Sclerosis (MS)- The Business Insider Article again links to another news media site (this time Reuters[17]) for it's content. The Reuters article stated that marijuana treats the topical symptom, such as spastic movement of those suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. Not the disease itself. In fact Dr. LaRocca, VP of research and policy at the national MS society had this to say \"\"But smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\" he told Reuters Health. People with MS are already at some risk of \"cognitive changes,\" LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\" [17] http://www.reuters.com... Arthritis- Business Insider links to the Huffington Post again and as with all the other arguments my opponent, the Huffington post[18] details how marijuana is used as an anesthetic; not as a treatment of the disease proper. Dr. Mbakwe was quoted again, so extend the negative impacts I talked about when refuting my opponent's Alzheimers argument. also; \" Dr. Mbakwe says. \u2028\u2028'If we mask these [symptoms] by giving them marijuana and giving them euphoria, the disease progression will keep getting worse and things like organ damage and severe problems will still occur,' she notes.[18]\" \"Another problem that Dr. Mbakwe encounters is that, even though she doesn\"t recommend marijuana to her RA patients, she has many who use it for pain, and she says these patients often have a tendency to abuse narcotics. \u2028\u2028'Most patients looking for this have other chronic pain issues and are likely on other controlled substances,\" Dr. Mbakwe says. \"It can be difficult to see who has a tendency toward abuse potential.'[18]\" [18] http://www.huffingtonpost.com... At this point, I would like to remind the voters that I used my opponent's own sources to point out these negative impacts; this evidence was readily available to my opponent and he chose not to cite it in his constructive. All of my opponent's cited evidence points to my prior stated argument that marijuana provides no benefit to a patient except an anesthetic one. Meanwhile the negative include: carcinogens, weakened immune system, impaired cognitive functions and unsafe production to name a few. not of the alternatives that I've mentioned have these negative implications. In conclusion, using such a dangerous substance solely as an anesthetic when other more viable alternatives[9][10][11] exist is irresponsible and should not be allowed to happen. I urge a vote for Con, and look forward to the next round!",

You say that medicinal marijuana can CAN be a safe and effective treatment. For some very serious medical conditions that are a huge concern for our society. Of the conditions you did state, i will say you are valid on 1 of them. That being pain, as to my knowledge Marijuana does act as sort of a pain killer, except without the high of some of the other pain killers out there like vicodin. But that goes to say how much pain would be required to needed for one to get said medicinal marijuana. To go on, one could simply fake pain to abuse the system, trust if it is legalized that would happen in great numbers. Furthermore, I would like to know how that is if you can show it to me if not it is of no matter, how it can help treat such illnesses such as AIDS, Cancer, epilepsy, etc. B. Now also how would you ensure that it is actually getting to those who need it and it is not just going to any random person who can present a card or something saying they have legal access to the marijuana? I say without at least a proper way of ensuring it gets to the right people Marijuana should remain illegal. Since there has also been no proven way to ensure all laws are enforced, since there is always a loophole or an exception of some kind. No one can justify making marijuana legal since it could and would be abused by a variety of people. No matter what the medicinal trials show about the drug, and how it MAY benefit people. Legalizing Marijuana would only fuel the rampant illegal use of it in our nation. It would give people a reason to then abuse the system and obtain marijuana for their own personal and selfish needs. It could also cause a lot of corruption in the form of a pharmacist selling said Marijuana on the streets or, in the back for a huge profit of their own personal gain.",

However, cigarette smoking doesn't affect how your brain functions and therefore does not pose a threat to society (unless you count second hand smoke, but the government has made efforts to minimize the effects of that through non-smoking zones). However, marijuana has immediate effects on your brain. It impairs coordination and judgement just as much, if not more, than alcohol, and crimes associated with alcohol (e.g. assault, reckless driving, rape, murder, etc.) happen even more frequently with marijuana users. It is such a powerful drug that most people get addicted to it within the first few uses. Even more dangerous than its short term effects are its long term effects. It is scientifically proven that the active NATURAL ingredient in marijuana, THC, actively destroys brain cells; over several years of marijuana use, a user's brain will SHRINK, and the user will never even realize it. Another chemical with the same nerve cell-damaging effect is Cyanide, one of the most well-known POISONS in the world. Marijuana is not accepted by the federal government of having any medical value. Medical marijuana is just an excuse to make marijuana more accessible to recreational marijuana users. There are far more effective treatments to glaucoma and cancer with far less severe side effects. Marijuana is poison with no medical value and should stay illegal.
