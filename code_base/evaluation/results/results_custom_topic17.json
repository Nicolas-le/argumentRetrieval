            "premise": "Contention 1: Marijuana should not be legal for recreational use because the side effects that are brought by it can be life endangering. One statistic suggests that smoking marijuana can increase one's heart rate by as much as two times for up to three hours.[1] The recreational use of marijuana could endanger the lives of those who may have heart conditions. Another side effect found in marijuana would be from the aspect of smoking the drug. The smoke will cause the lungs to be irritated and may lead to respiratory issues in the future.[2] It can be claimed that marijuana may lower pain of certain cancers and diseases, or even to be used as a medical substance, however I ask that this claim is not brought in as a contention due to the fact that this debate's main focus is regarding the recreation use rather than the medical use. If a doctor feels marijuana can be a healthy medicinal supplement, then that would be a different story. The claim that marijuana can be taxed and help our country make some much needed capital is also invalid given the fact that the health risks behind marijuana are by far much more important to worry about rather than allowing the focus to be upon tax revenue.",

Let's begin.The relief from stress from marijuana is definitely a benefit of marijuana for certain people that have terminal cancer, going to a mental breakdown, etc. This is good. We actually have medicinal marijuana for this. The thing that you are refering to is recreational marijuana I presume (correct me if I'm wrong). As in using marijuana for recreation, I will argue that it should be illegal to be used in that way. \"Marijuana also affects brain development. When marijuana users begin using as teenagers, the drug may reduce thinking, memory, and learning functions and affect how the brain builds connections between the areas necessary for these functions. Marijuana\u2019s effects on these abilities may last a long time or even be permanent. For example, a study showed that people who started smoking marijuana heavily in their teens and had an ongoing cannabis use disorder lost an average of eight IQ points between ages 13 and 38. The lost mental abilities did not fully return in those who quit marijuana as adults. Those who started smoking marijuana as adults did not show notable IQ declines (Meier, 2012).\"http://www.drugabuse.gov...;This excerpt from the government website just shows some of the problems that people face with long term marijuana usage. There are also other health risks such as breathing problems, increase heart rate that may lead to heart attack and it increases the user's chance of obtaining mental disorders such as random hallucinations, schizophrenia, and paranoia. With all these health risks involved, I see no reason as to why the legalization of marijuana should happen. To put that much risks at one's health explains why marijuana should not be legal.",

            "conclusion": "Legal Recreational Marijuana Revisited",
            "premise": "I negate: Legal Recreational Marijuana Revisited [Contentions] Contention I: Marijuana is a Gateway Drug. According to the Surgeon General (Year 2007) Marijuana is a gateway drug. This means that once a given high is established the user would seek a larger high from more harmful drugs. This includes Cocaine (the most common step drug from marijuana), LSD, and Heroine. Marijuana creates a high different from substances like Alcohol, which increases the urge for a greater high that can only be achieved through more harmful drugs. With marijuana more readily available, teens would more likely be hooked on it now, and thus make them want harder substances. Contention II: Increased Criminal Activity Since we have established that marijuana is a gateway drug we will now look to one major disadvantage to society, Criminal Behavior. Since marijuana would increase the urge for harder substances, which are illegal, then people would resort to crimes to obtain them. The addiction for drugs is so great that people addicted would go to great lengths to get these substances. Allowing marijuana in society would increase the want for harder substances which in turn would lead to higher crime rates. Furthermore, higher crime rates could lead to more violent activity. For these reasons I negate. [Rebuttal] \"Recreational marijuana use should be legalized. Just like any other legal drug, it comes with it's own set of responsibilities and restrictions. Sure, it is unhealthy, but no worse than many other legal drugs. I feel like every other legal prescription commercial I see, has warnings about possible side effects, even \"death.\" My Response: Ok, universalize your action. By allowing marijuana we should then allow any other harder substance. Yes, it may come with it's own set of responsibility but that doesn't mean that government should bend down and condone it. Furthermore, legal prescrpiton drugs have medical benefits. One reason for the illegilzation of drugs is for these 2 reasons: 1) Has no major medical benefits 2) The cons outweigh the pros Therefore, marijuana used for recreational purposes rather then medical should not be allowed for the public. Drop my opponents argument. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

            "premise": "As I'm sure we've all heard from our health teachers, marijuana is indeed a gateway drug. Marijuana can lead to the trial of other drugs which may be even more harmful that marijuana itself. I see what you mean by saying that there have been zero deaths in history from marijuana, however that statistic is simply regarding the short term effects while being under the influence. Your contentions have completely ignored the long term effects. For example, smoke inhalation (even from cannabis,) Can cause long term effects such as cancer. This debate is about the legalization of marijuana, and not about whether cigarettes and alcohol should be legal or not. Therefore, when I describe the health risks involved in marijuana (which are proved by what I have stated in round 1,) I am speaking about marijuana, not anything else. Another reason that marijuana should not be legalized for recreational use, is because marijuana is terrible for mental health. Marijuana creates a feeling of anxiety to some user which have been linked to depression. This, I suppose would essentially be considered another health risk. With that being said, there are too many long term health risks behind marijuana, so therefore it should remain out of the hands of recreational users.",

            "premise": "Recreational marijuana has recently become legal for recreational use in 8 states and the District of Columbia, under Proposition 64, of those 8 states being California. There is a great amount of controversy surrounding the passing of recreational marijuana. Legalized marijuana is regulated for customer safety. Before recreational marijuana was legalized and dispensaries started to be created people were buying it off of the street. This meant that it was being grown by the person selling it or they got it from someone who may have gotten it from another person. This meant that the consumer didn't know if there were harmful drugs or chemicals mixed in the product they were buying. According to The American Public Health Association (APHA), who wrote and article called \"Regulating Commercially Legalized Marijuana as a Public Health Priority\" on November 18. 2014, with recreational marijuana being legalized it will allow the government to enforce laboratory testing and regulations to make sure that the marijuana being sold is free of toxins. This means that the consumer will no longer have to buy off of the street but will be able to go into a dispensary where the marijuana has been tested for toxins in a laboratory. On January 8th, 2018 a Washington State Legislator posted and article called \"WAC 314-55-105: Packaging and Labeling Requirements\" which by law requires Washington state to produce health warnings, quality assurance, THC content and concentration, as well as other important information for the consumer. This allows the consumer to know exactly what is in their product its just like food labels that provide the consumer with information about what is inside weather is be vitamins, fat, or sugars. Legalizing marijuana allows for the consumer to read exactly what they are buying and know that it complies with the government regulations. The Bureau of Cannabis Control states that with recreational marijuana being legalized it allows the government to set age restrictions and the people buying it as well as license and regulate the entire supply chain of marijuana including growers, distributors, retailers, and testing labs. This means that the government will be able to control how much and who is selling the marijuana and it will decrease the amount of dealers on the streets selling and importing illegally. Brooke Staggs, a reporter of cannabis, wrote in and article titled \" \"Here Are the Rules for Legal Marijuana in California Once Law Goes into Effect Jan. 1,\" in November of 2017, that in California alone the legalizing of recreational marijuana will requires regulations that include limitations on the serving sizes for edible marijuana products, seed-to-sale testing and tracking, and 24-hour video surveillance at retail stores. The Government will now be able to monitor what is being sold to each consumer making shops close at 10 P.M every night. They will also be able to regulate where shops are located which requires them to be 600 ft away from any school according to The Bureau of Cannabis Control Regulations.",

Mental addiction of anything is not an argument, since it would eliminate too many things from society.Benefits of legalizing marijuanaIf marijuana were legalized for recreational use, this means there would no longer be any restrictions on growing hemp. There are many products that can be formed from hemp. One of which is paper. By legalizing pot, we legalize hemp. Then using it to make paper, we actually help the environment.Furthermore, we don't have to worry about ethics with medical marijuana if it is legal for recreational use.

            "conclusion": "The United States Should Legalize Marijuana for Recreational Use",
            "premise": "Racism & Poverty: Nothing for me to rebut here, any concerns Con raises here would be solved through legalization as well. Why Legalization Won\u2019t Work:Crime: Con begins by focussing on stats coming out of California. However, there is a large problem doing this. Marijuana for recreational use is not legal in California. In fact, California\u2019s marijuana laws are closer to Con\u2019s plan than mine. In California, marijuana (for recreational use) is often considered a \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d and punishment is done via fines, not jail time. (1) This is much like (if not exactly like), \u201cThe United States...should eliminate its mandatory minimum sentencing reduce the crime of possession of Marijuana from a felony to a misdemeanor.\u201d So for this reason, any arguments Con made based on statistics from California should be ignored. However, it still is worth rebutting the point with stats from areas where marijuana for recreational use is legal. Con starts off saying that legal marijuana would only drop 4.4% in price from the black market. First of all, that alone should end illegal drug use, since it\u2019s cheaper and safer, so no rational person would still try to buy illegal marijuana. Second, Con\u2019s source (http://www.rand.org...) never even states that there would be a 4.4% drop in the price of legal marijuana. Another problem with this assertion, is that marijuana on the black market doesn\u2019t have a typically agreed upon rate. It highly depends on the dealer, the situation, quality, etc. What we can be certain of though, is that with legalization in Colorado, price of marijuana has only been getting lower and lower, despite still growing as an industry, which would further kill any remaining black market. (2) Overall though, Con\u2019s main point is that crime will increase if marijuana is legal. However, the facts from Colorado and Washington dispute this. Both states have seen a drop in violent crime, since legalization (on top of the obvious decrease in marijuana related arrests). (3, 4) That is the complete opposite of Con\u2019s claim that legal marijuana will increase violent crime, which as mentioned above was dependent on stats from a state where marijuana isn\u2019t even legal for recreational use. Seeing as I have shown data from states where marijuana is legal to disprove Con\u2019s claims, which relied on data from a state where marijuana isn\u2019t legal for recreational use, I have successfully disproved Con\u2019s claims regarding crime. Schooling: Con essentially argues here that marijuana use will increase if marijuana is legal, specifically among younger people. First off, Washington hasn\u2019t seen an increase in marijuana usage among youth, since it has become legal. (5) One of the main reasons is that marijuana would still be illegal for those under 18 years of age. There are also some problems with the medical marijuana related study Con cited from the NBER. They (http://www.nber.org...) claim they got their information from the 2004-2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. However, if you actually look at that, it tells a different story (see the below graphs). (6) This data suggests very little difference in usage, over the time period. On top of that, another study regarding medical marijuana legalization and teen usage from experts from various universities, also shows little change in teen marijuana usage. (7) However, marijuana use has been for the most part increasing in the country since the War on Drugs among teens (as shown in my argument last round, Education is Superior to Bans), even though the opposite has been shown in alcohol and tobacco. Same argument here, it would be better to raise awareness about the dangers of marijuana and help those who abused it, than expect that simply banning it will be the best way to solve high usage. The money for that can even be found from taxes from marijuana sales (from my argument Taxation).

            "conclusion": "Medical as well as recreational marijuana should be legal in all US states",
            "premise": "The matter of legalizing medical marijuana is an important issue for several reasons. From the data observed in the link below [1] there are currently 23 states with laws legalizing marijuana, some still more restrictive than others. This of course is a significant step in the right direction. However, I believe that all states should follow the examples of Alaska, Colorado, Washington and Oregon to legalize not only cannabis for medicinal usage but also for recreational consumption. I will list my reasons further below. Before doing so I would like to specifically define the meanings of marijuana itself and respectively medical and recreational cannabis to avoid any confusions or misunderstandings. Marijuana is defined as \"a commonly used illegal drug made from dried leaves of the hemp plant\" and \"a strong-smelling plant from whose dried leaves a number of euphoriant and hallucinogenic drugs are prepared.\" Marijuana goes by many other names such as cannabis, hemp, weed etc. [2] Medical marijuana is defined as the usage of marijuana for medical or medicinal purposes. [3] [4] Recreational marijuana is defined as any other recreational drug which is described as \"a drug (as cocaine, marijuana, or methamphetamine) used without medical justification for its psychoactive effects often in the belief that occasional use of such a substance is not habit-forming or addictive.\" [6] I acknowledge the many different types of marijuana that exists for different purposes, most, I understand, are hybrids made for different specific medical needs. However I do not know enough on the subject of them, their effects and upsides as well as downsides. I would therefore appreciate if this debate could be exclusively on the matters of the aforementioned descriptions of cannabis, medical and recreational. Now I will present my arguments as to why I believe medical and recreational marijuana should be legalized in all US states.R32;R32;First of all I would like to point out that there is no scientific background with evidence as to exactly why marijuana was classified as a Schedule I drug in the first place. The definition of a Schedule 1 drug from the Drug Enforcement Administration itself clearly states, that \"Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\"[6] This definition leaves no room for doubt that no Schedule 1 drug has any medical use. However it has been a known fact for centuries that cannabis has been used for medical purposes with positive effects. This can easily be found true when looking at many different sources. Here I have merely linked one. [7]R32;The National Institute on Drug Abuse also states that there are medical benefits from marijuana. [8] R32;There can be many reasons as to why marijuana was classified the way it was and still has not been re-classified but that is a completely different debate. Here are links with possible explanations that no matter what do not justify why it was classified so harshly. [9] [10] R32;All in all, there can be no doubts that this classification of marijuana is deeply illogical and misleading. Second, I would like to stress that America would merit tremendously from the economic profits caused by legalizing marijuana. It can be no surprise to any logical thinking creature that America spends enormous sums of money on dealing with and prohibiting crime related to illegal marijuana sales and consumptions. All of this money would of course not be spent if marijuana was legalized. In stead I propose that all states start off like Oregon, Alaska, Washington and Colorado by legalizing recreational marijuana as well. These states all have different laws that specifically suits them and I believe this is a good way to start. R32;R32;The legalization of medical as well as recreational marijuana would be the only solution to properly profit economically from the marijuana businesses that are currently not legal. This is because these businesses will probably still exist if only medicinal marijuana was legalized. [11] [12] Third and last I believe, as mentioned, that marijuana should be legalised for recreational use. This is because I believe in every individual\"s right to care for him or herself\"s own health and decide what is best. Especially when it comes to smoking tobacco or marijuana for pleasure. I am aware of the fact that marijuana has other effects than regular tobacco smoking. However tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death here in America and I do not see how it in any aspect is justifiable, that tobacco smoking has no legal restrictions when a harmless plant such as cannabis is classified as a schedule 1 drug and illegal in most states. [13] I believe that cannabis should be legalized for medical and recreational use. Of course all sale should be done by an approved salesperson to ensure and uphold a certain safety. This will still leave room for illegal sales but not in the same measure as it is now. I am not trying to say that tobacco smoking should be classified as a schedule 1 drug as well. I am saying that the laws making marijuana illegal are so illogical that I am astonished this can happen in a well educated country in the 21st century. http://www.governing.com... https://www.vocabulary.com... http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com... https://www.leafly.com... http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://www.dea.gov... http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com... https://www.drugabuse.gov... http://www.ibtimes.com... http://www.drugwarrant.com... http://www.dailydot.com... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... http://www.cdc.gov...",

            "premise": "thank you con for the respones people doing drugs for the sake of doing illegale drugs. con state that people do majruiana becuase its illegale and it isnt as hard as other drugs. Then he state that herion smokers started to increase which is actual a fasle statement. since 1983 to 2010 their was a study of herion addicts in the neatherlands. Their obsveration actually said it decreased about 30 percent due to a heroin-assisted treatment that was a trial now required for herion addicts. Since they havent had to worry about looking for people with marijuana since legale. There goverment was actually able to put more time and money towrds rehabltion towards other drugs. One more thing that people are more likely to get marijuana that is laest with something other than pot. Than would probaly have a chance of getting addict to harder drugs due to withdraws of the laest marijuana. prohibition of marijuana For cons theory as a flaw to it thought. Even if people due illegeale drugs for the sake of it. If marijuana was legal the police force can actually put in more time in stoping these other harder more danguose drugs that are being sold on the street. i sated majruiana isnt a gate way drug ethier but con didnt understand what i was trying to say about \"the link between hard drugs would be broken\". What the meaning of that was since dealers sold drugs other than just marijuana. Then they be able to sell to an imprasable clinet. due to the fact that the person has mostly brought pot from him before. So in the person mind he was able to have a sence of trust which is actually false not understanding his money is just profit. So if legaling marjuana people can just go to a store and buy it in a safer place unlike the streets. When i stated link between harder drugs would be broken, i ment that people wont know as many dealers due to the fact they can just go to stores and buy marijuana. instread of haveing a chance of getting sold a harder drug from the same dealer. http://en.wikipedia.org...medical marijuana con stated that he personaly hasnt heard of anyone ever over doesing on over the counter nusea drugs. I just want to state that over 100 million peoples lives are taken away with just over doesing on Tylenol, Paracetamol. This is just one over the counter drug that killls people each day. Now i want to state like all these over the counter drugs marjiuana can be prescribed in does too. So if a patient takes marijuana that can help the rest of their lives they dont have to have strong type of cannibis. Actually they are most likely able to get mids. What is not even a fourth as strong as eating cookies or brownies. Another thing is not one person in the world has every died from smoking just marijuana. http://www.natap.org...For taxtion of marijuana con states that people can just grow their marijuana in their house as easy as growing fruits and vegtables. As i satted before thought not every person is able to due this due to time and other things on their schedual. A majiorty of the peole are going to go to stores to buy their mariuana. In genral the econmoy is going to make a bigger net profit than lost from taxting marijuana. conclusionCon has stated that marijuana should stay illegale. The reason he state this is frist people doing drugs for the sake of doing drugs. honestly people do do drugs that are legal too. So i fmarijuana was lega the goverment would be able to worry more sbout dealers selling harder drugs. Even be able to put more time and money in rehabiltion towards those people doing harder drugs like the neatherlands. That goes the same for orginzed crimes too. the police foruce would be able to fouces more on these bigger dealers with the harder drugs. For the taxtion of marijuana he beilves that most people are just going to figure a way to beat the system in taxing marijuana. As i stated before not everyone has the time or the place to even grow marijuana. that menas the nation will make a profit in taxting marijuana. Marijuana it self has a compund (T.H.C). that can honestly help prevent alot of deiases and even cancer. Thi slittle canibbis can be very befincal too this nation if the goverment ever legalelized it.",

Evidently, I will begin by asserting the facts that explain why I believe it should not be legalized. Marijuana is comparable to tobacco, which we all know has downsides.[1] Studies have shows that marijuana smokers are exposed to more smoke than cigarette smokers. This exposes them to an larger amount of carbon dioxide and tar, which increases the risks of a range of health problems including respiratory tract infections, bronchitis and lung cancer.[1] Not only that, according to drugfree.org, \"{s}moking a single marijuana joint is equivalent to smoking 2.5 to 5 cigarettes in terms of damage to the lungs, largely due to differences in how pot and cigarette users smoke.\"[2] \"The Guardian {also} reported July 31 that researchers at the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand found that the deep drags taken by marijuana users, along with their penchant for holding smoke in before exhaling, can cause problems like obstructed airways and hyperinflation of the lungs. The lack of filters on marijuana joints also contributes to lung problems.\"[2] As this is only round two, I shall await round three to give the rest of my reasoning to not legalizing recreational marijuana and my rebuttals against your arguments. I look forward to seeing your reasoning and arguments for why you believe recreational marijuana should be made legal. [1]http://learnaboutmarijuanawa.org...... [2]http://www.drugfree.org......",

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's) . I will begin by presenting a few main statements and their subset points if they apply. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose. I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. My Arguments 1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization. a) Marijuana is not addictive. b)Marijuana is physically impossible to overdose on c) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true. d) The Gateway theory is fundamentally flawed e) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. causing aggressiveness or other adverse changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user. f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreased g) assuming it is true that marijuana's potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged. 2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization. a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the country b)The medical benefits of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for many c) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, stopping drugged driving) d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. e)Cannabis integration would benefit our culture and uphold our rights as a nation under the constitution. 3. Even if marijuana was a harmful substance it is clearly no more harmful than legal substances (i.e. alcohol, tobacco) which have been perfectly integrated into society and are tolerated. Therefore, it should be treated no differently. 4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for all.",

            "conclusion": "Legal Recreational Marijuana Revisited",
            "premise": "The Gateway Drug Theory: The truth is the idea you have brought up is simply a theory. Tobacco and alcohol have also been accused of being gateway drugs. I understand marijuana and alcohol are different kinds of drugs but nothing about marijuana has been proven to qualify it as a 100% surefire \"gateway drug.\" Numerous tests and data have shown inconclusive evidence of the gateway drug theory. In 2007 the surgeon general said that marijuana was in fact a gateway drug. He, however, did not prove this himself, and was instead, stating a probable (but not true) side effect to marijuana use based on inconclusive research to help raise awareness about the negative effects. Two studies from University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy show inconclusive evidence to support this theory. So has the U.S. National Institute of medicine and RAND, who works for the U.S. government and military. All of these are reliable resources. Lastly, the assumption that marijuana would be legal for teens is false. Because marijuana is not legal, we don't know what legal using age will be put into place. Avoiding selling to teens is a very valid point that I agree with. Criminal Activity: There is no way to tell how society will react, especially because we don't know whether the gateway drug theory is correct or not. Because of the this unpredictability factor, we have to rely on history for answers. I could list and list events, but I don't want to waste your time so I'm going to concentrate on one significant, closely related one: Prohibition. As you know, Prohibition was when alcohol was illegal in the United States throughout the 1920's. It was proven that as soon as this drug was deemed illicit, crime (organized crime especially) skyrocketed as well as the smuggling of alcohol into the States. This all goes back to the fact that people in the past have increased criminal activity due to the act that made another so-called \"gateway drug,\" alcohol, illegal, the opposite of what you proposed. Alcoholics have a chance to do harder drugs, just like any other type of user, and if your theory was correct then the harder drugs should have become as much of a problem as alcohol in the 1920's...but they didn't. I think we can agree that, heroin, for example, is much more addictive and harmful than marijuana. The difference is so significant, that it makes the assumption that \"we should allow other harder substances,\" false. There are specific reasons marijuana should be legalized versus other drugs. By no means is the government supporting usage by legalizing it. Tobacco is legal yet you don't see the President of the United States endorsing it. The decision is up to the citizen and they have the right to be informed before using. Your two reasons of opposition (the numbered ones) are more of personal reasons why you would not use. The act of legalizing marijuana simply reduces the amount of crime in that drug deals connected to violence will be eliminated, providing users with a (lets just say) safe pharmacy where they can get marijuana. This is legalization to reduce criminal activity not discuss usage benefits/disadvantages. Just like alcohol or tobacco, marijuana use is a personal decision that has to be made. Advertisement bans, behind-the-wheel rules, etc. can all be made to ensure the safety of the public to help regulate this drug in a safer way so that people can use in the peace of their own home, without getting tangled up in crime. This is why recreational marijuana should, in fact, be legalized.",

Most people are scared of marijuana and parents, grandparents and other adults tell us that marijuana can kill us. First if alcohol and cigarettes are legal then why marijuana can't be legal too. Alcohol affects on people are scary and unhealthy. People with alcohol addiction are unstoppable they can't control their actions and because of this many life's were lost even of innocent people. To ppurchase marijuana legally you need to visit places like Washington or Colorado to buy a joint, which is far safer then a bottle of vodka. I have seen the affect on people when they are drunk and when they are high, so I rather see high person walking on the street chasing birds, then shouting young man with a vodka or bear bottle in their hands.Second marijuana can be used in medical world, as it shows good potential. Once I had broken my chest and experience is not the best. Pain killers never helped, but as I know marijuana can be used to stop that pain for good. Marijuana can even help in other situations like: mitigates multiple sclerosis and Tourette Syndrome symptoms, and may reduce dystonia. So if marijuana is so bad and its a devils gift to world why some countries, states allow it, maybe its not that bad after and some people should stop worrying about marijuana and start looking how it could help us.",

            "conclusion": "should we have to be 21 to smoke recreational weed",
            "premise": "Hello Con! I accept your debate. Since you didn't specify the requirements for the debate I will make them. Con is arguing that 21 should not be the required age and that rather 18 should be the legal age for smoking recreational marijuana. As pro I will argue that 18 should not be the legal age for smoking recreational marijuana. If pro will have it I will go as far to say that there should not be a legal age because smoking marijuana should be illegal. My stance as Pro is that marijuana's legal age for recreational activities should be much higher than 18 to the point of making it illegal to smoke marijuana. Here are some definitions. smoke: emit smoke or visible vapor. recreational: relating to or denoting activity done for enjoyment when one is not working. Marijuana: cannabis, especially as smoked in cigarettes. Since Con did not assume rules for this debate I will start my arguments and also take the liberty of using points from one of my other debates. If Con can rebut these points then I will delve farther and be more creative with my points but as of every other debate on cannabis these points are always the backbone. With that I present my arguments for my stance which is: 18 should not be the legal age, the age should be at least 21 but preferably marijuana should be illegal. My points are as follow: 1. Marijuana is harmful and addictive. 2. Marijuana can be abused and thus reduces the usefulness of the individuals who take it. (This argument sounds really mean. What I mean to say is that while someone is addicted to this drug they have a noticeable decline in productivity and it takes away from their quality of life.) 3. It damages developing minds. Let me start with my first argument. Marijuana is indeed harmful, addictive and known to be a gateway drug. \"Consumption of marijuana impairs the immune system and short-term memory, elevates the risk of heart attack, and causes respiratory and brain damage.\" http://www.heritage.org...... That seems to pretty much wrap up that argument but for me this isn't enough! So I did some more research and went to http://www.drugabuse.gov....... Long term effects include breathing problems, increased heart rate, problems with child development, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and worsening symptoms from individuals that have schizophrenia. The site also points out that marijuana is addictive. Now to put a personal spin on this I will provide examples from my personal life to back up how harmful this drug is. I am in grade 13 of my high school and I can honestly say individuals who have used marijuana have most likely used other drugs such as speed, heroin and meth. These are 9th to 12th graders I am talking about, just imagine what it would be like if this drug was accessible because it was legal? Obviously there would be an age limit but that does not stop youth at all. Now to tie in my second argument, these individuals are the lowest of the low at my school, we are talking drop outs and some cannot even hold a conversation with me because they are so high. Now to add facts into this \"Teens who abuse drugs have lower grades, a higher rate of absence from school and other activities, and an increased potential for dropping out of school. \" http://www.justthinktwice.com...... This makes sense, I observed how many were acting at my school, the drop outs, the low grades and then compared it to research. They match! This makes it a pretty concrete point. Now for my third argument. If you go back to the same site as my last post it states \"...your brain develops until the age of 25? Anything that you do to disrupt this process\"including substance\"will affect how your brain develops. \" and that \"When you use drugs, it interferes with the normal traffic patterns that the neurotransmitters use.\" To me this makes sense as well. To add my closing notes to this round that I took the stance of a student (since I am one) on this topic but marijuana is harmful to adults as well. All of these symptoms apply to minds that have developed and adults who use marijuana show decreased levels of productivity at work as seen on this site. http://learnaboutmarijuanawa.org...... I hope putting my personal experiences in this debate didn't ruined it in any form. Also if you are struggling with drug abuse you may want to go over here http://www.drugandalcoholhelpline.ca...... or here if you are under the age of 18 https://www.kidshelpphone.ca... These points prove that the legal age should be higher (or illegal) as it is harmful at younger ages (and all ages!) With these points I will switch this over to Con, good luck! (Definitions are from a simple google search.)",

With tourists flooding into Amsterdam strictly to enjoy the high grade of marijuana products in the area, it becomes readily apparent that there is all manner of money to be spent on the average popular mind altering substance.\" [1] I recognize that this piece of evidence supports your argument, but it supports mine as well. I will now list another piece of evidence: \"A ballot measure to legalize marijuana in California would so upend supply and demand that pot prices could plummet by as much as 90 percent and possibly undercut the tax windfall that supporters have touted to sell the initiative, a study published Wednesday found. The study by the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center forecasts some interesting scenarios if California in November becomes the second state, after Alaska, to legalize pot for recreational use by adults and the first to tax commercial cannabis sales. Pot prices could drop from $375 an ounce under the state's current medical marijuana law to as little as $38 per ounce before taxes as legal pot suddenly becomes available to the public, RAND researchers concluded.\" [2] I have already spoken about the health aspect of marijuana. Now, given this new information, I do not believe anyone can support the decriminalization of recreational marijuana. It can deeply wound our economy as well as causing health issues for uncountable people. [1] http://voices.yahoo.com... [2] http://www.dailypaul.com...",

The legalization on marijuana for recreational purposes will only amplify rates of drug usage among individuals at all ends of the age spectrum.

From a legal standpoint, laws would need to be altered in order to accommodate for committing or engaging in criminal activity under the influence of marijuana.

Let's jump right in.Legalization of recreational marijuana in the U.S. would benefit the economy in the following regards.Taxes:The legalization of recrational marijuana would generate billions of dollars in taxes for the government to spend on other beneficiary programs that might also benefit the economy. Legalization would generate tax revenue of an estimated $46.7 billion annually [1].The cost of incarceration:The cost to keep a prisoner incarcerated is an absolutely enourmous burden on taxpayers. It is estimated that it costs taxpayers a whopping $15,921,896,814 to house marijuana related inmates [2]. Although my own research shows that it may be even more, because source [2] bases this on the assumption that it costs $21,006 to house one inmate for a year, I hvae found other sources that state the value closer to $30,000 [3].Decline of Organized Crime / Corporation and trading benefits:Similar to the decline of organized crime following the repeal of alcohol prohibition in 1933, legalization of recreational marijuana would cause the marijuana trade to cease in America entirely, causing gangs and other organizations to disband. This branches off into my next point.The commercial availability of marijuana would cause business boom, employing countless citizens, getting people to spend money (always good for the economy), and generating a massive amount of revenue. Also since America is most definitly a world power, America's decision to legalize recrational marijuana has a good chance of causing a domino effect, making other nations see the benefits of legalization (employment and revenue) and legalizing it themselves. This would cause an international market to be crerated, opening up the U.S. to export it's recreational marijuana to other legalized nations, further increasing government profit and corporation revenue. With tons of foreign money being paid to the United States, we would inevitably see a increase in value for the dollar, which is good for everyone in the U.S.************************************************************************************************* I turn the argument to con.",

            "conclusion": "The U.S Government should legalize recreational marijuana.",
            "premise": "I thank Kasmic for accepting this debate, I look forward to seeing what the opposition has to offer. Contentions 1. Freedom of Autonomy Famous British philosopher, and political economist, John Stuart Mill theorized that, \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\"[0]. People should have the right to exercise their autonomy. As the quote above suggests, the only time this can be rightfully restricted is to prevent harm to others. The Government has *no responsibility* to ensure individuals do not harm themselves. This is patently obvious, as dangerous and even lethal activities are not illegal, such as smoking tobacco or GrandPrix racing, the latter killing 1/100 participants [1]. Con will need to show that marijuana itself creates a significant enough harm to others, in order to justify marijuana\u2019s illegality. Not only that, but he must demonstrate this harm to others is *greater than or on par at-least* with the harms that the U.S status quo already permits. It would be *illogical* to have one thing be illegal based on its harm to others, just to turn around and permit something of even greater harm. 2. Low Level of Harm to Self and Others The possible harms associated with several others substances are already legal and significantly more detrimental to society and the individuals themselves. The chart below [2] illustrates the level of harm substances have on their users and those around them. We can immediately take note that the *most dangerous* substance is *already legal*. The simple fact that the government accepts this inherent risk of self-harm and harm-to-others from Alcohol, is plenty of justification to accept the lower risks of another substance such as marijuana. Marijuana is shown to be nearly *five times* less harmful-to-others than Alcohol is. If the U.S government accepts these risks of harm, it is only reasonable that we should allow another substance who's risks are significantly less; that being marijuana. 3. Benefits from Regulation There are several benefits to be had from regulating marijuana on a federal/state level. a) Taxation: It should go without saying that the government benefits from the high revenue taxes generate on tobacco and alcohol. It is estimated that the legalization and regulation of marijuana could generate approximately *8.7 Billion* dollars in tax revenue [3]. This alone is a huge benefit worth the possible harm that legalized marijuana may pose. b) Safety and Reduction of the Black Market: With an easily accessible and safe source, people will not be at risk of obtaining laced drugs or poorly maintained products. Both of which contribute to further reducing the possibility of harming oneself or those around them. Additionally, this takes away revenue from the black market which helps to diminish its existence in the U.S. With the legalization of recreational marijuana in several states, NPR reported that the price of a kilogram of weed as gone from 90$ to 30$, making the illegal industry less worthwhile [4] c) Job Creation: In order to regulate marijuana there will need to be jobs to do so! Jobs in which will involve things such as business management, plant growing, product selling, and even cooking will inevitably be created. In turn further stimulating the economy. With the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, they saw a creation of upwards of 10,000 jobs [5]. Conclusion: Given the great benefits to be reaped from the legalization of marijuana, and the significantly lower harm it possess than what the status quo allows, I believe marijuana should be legalized.

Taxation off of marijuana could bring billions into each state's economy. The legalisation of this substance would also make many different medical disorders easier to treat without a prescription, reducing the cost of the everyday person, and decreasing corporate profits. This would consequently result in lower healthcare costs. (http://taxfoundation.org...) My second point is that of decreasing prison population. Marijuana illegalisation has been an excuse to lock up minorities for the last 50 years. Prison numbers and demographics prove this. If we want equality, we need this substance legalised. (https://www.washingtonpost.com...) Finally, if we allow a psychoactive drug like alcohol. And we tax and regulate it. Why now marijuana?",

However, the resolution of the debate was that: \u201cDecriminalizing recreational marijuana is wrong.\u201d The fact that he was arguing that legalizing marijuana was bad when the topic was about decriminalizing marijuana makes his entire 3rd round erroneous.Nonetheless, I shall make some notes about my opponent\u2019s arguments. He claims decriminalizing (or was it legalizing?) recreational marijuana has shown to be detrimental to the economy of Amsterdam. His only justification for this was based on a quote from Yahoo. He has not shown how such evidence supports his position. I certainly don\u2019t see how this supports his argument at all! He also claims that legalizing (or was it decriminalizing?) marijuana would cause its price to drop considerably. He cites an article from the website \u2018Daily Paul\u2019 to support this. Ironically however, it would appear that the original article supports my position! At the end of the article, the author, \u2018OFallonBrent\u2019 writes: \u201cLet's keep the prices high to send more money to criminal organizations, destabilize our borders, and put financial burdens on both sick and healthy users. [new paragraph] Yeah! That\u2019s the ticket!\u201d Surely, this doesn\u2019t support my opponent\u2019s argument! The only justification for this is the fact that \u2018marijuana is bad for health.\u2019 [1] I have already shown that decriminalizing marijuana does not increase its usage. My opponent ignores this. I address the claim that \u2018marijuana is bad for health ergo recreational marijuana should not be decriminalized\u2019 argument next in the next round, after my opponent has had a change to clarify himself [1] http://www.dailypaul.com...",

If you read her first source in round 2, the first section of that source is the quote she attacked as \"outdated\": \"\"It has been widely claimed that marijuana substantially increases users' risk of contracting various infectious diseases. First emerging in the 1970s, this claim took on new significance in the 1980s, following reports of marijuana use by people suffering from AIDS.\" This is not my source, my opponent attacks her own source in an attempt to pass it off as mine to mislead the reader. Also, to my opponent: I noticed you copy and pasted the majority of one of your sources. If you could please cite it, it would make it easier to differentiate the article from your argument. My opponent asserts that marijuana's benefits outweigh the risks on the grounds that there are multiple ways to ingest it. Smoking it is the most common way of ingesting it, and it causes very severe damage. But even without smoking it, it is a harmful drug. Although it has some medical benefits to people with lupus and multiple sclerosis, \"researchers found that marijuana triggered the production of a massive number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells leading to immune suppression and cancer growth by activating cells that respond to the cannabinoids found in marijuana\"[1]. Unless someone has a severe medical condition that requires treatment with marijuana, it should not be used. This has devastating side effects and like prescription medication, should not be taken recreationally for the purpose of intoxicating oneself. Next, my opponent claims that marijuana does not cause an increase in violent crime. That is a true statement. However, it must be taken into account that marijuana is a gateway drug. The vast majority of hard drug users started out by using marijuana. Children aged \"12 to 17 years old who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than kids who do not use pot, and that 60% of the kids who smoke pot before the age of 15 move on to cocaine\"[2]. When one builds up a tolerance for marijuana, it may influence the individual to try hard drugs in order to achieve the same high. The hard drug users, of whom the vast majority started on marijuana, are the ones committing the majority of the crimes caused by drug users. My opponent addressed her 4th point in the second round as well so I will address them both here. My opponent next used my source from fusion.net, which shows that cartels are rapidly increasing their output of methamphetamine and heroin to the U.S. because of marijuana being readily available to Coloradans and Washingtonians. It also shows that the cartels smuggle U.S. marijuana back into mexico to make profits as well. My opponent used my source, which only furthers my argument that cartels are not willing to lose their profits, they are making up for it by increasing output of meth and heroin to the U.S. while smuggling back U.S. marijuana. This study furthermore invalidates her original point. My opponent also asserts that because of the cost of the war on drugs, marijuana should be legal. However, she only offers that topic sentence and a source. She then proceeds to change the topic, victimizing law breakers. My opponent claims that one's \"life can be completely ruined\". While I don't agree with a prison sentence for first or second time marijuana possession, this doesn't justify the users' actions. If someone knows something is illegal and still willingly commits the crime, are they guilty? The answer is yes. Although you may not agree with a certain law, you still must follow it. My opponent says getting arrested for marijuana is \"damaging\", yet users are willingly breaking the law, so it is self-inflicted. If you willingly break a law, whose fault is it? My opponent next delivers no argument or point but insists that I read an article. Technically, alcohol should be illegal; the Volstead Act was repealed due to violence[3]. Second Round: My opponent says \"And for your last claim, the real claim is saying that 'marijuana is safer than those 2 legal substances so why shouldn't it be legal.'\" That isn't my claim at all. I'm not exactly sure what to make of this, but my claim is that the dangers of alcohol and tobacco do not justify legalizing another dangerous substance for recreational use. My opponent further recognizes that \"there is no doubt that it impairs your memory \", another harmful effect of marijuana use. My opponent next makes a series of claims on what would happen if marijuana was legal for recreational use: 1.) Marijuana arrests only would drop, as a result of its legality. But as I have previously explained, it is a public health risk. Not only for the users, but also for the innocent people getting in car accidents with stoned drivers. Perhaps issuing heavy fines for use would be more beneficial for the state. This would allow police to focus on violent crimes and jail space to be freed up without us encouraging drug use. 2.) It is illogical that fewer kids would try it. In fact, marijuana use is rising. \"Among 12th graders, 36.4 percent reported using marijuana at least once in the past year, up from 31.5 percent 5 years ago\"[4]. Increasing the availability to the public would increase its availability to children. 3&4.) Earlier my opponent claimed that there is no correlation between marijuana and crime [excluding its legal status]. These essentially invalidate her previous argument as they are precise contradictions. 5.) My opponent acknowledges that \"[a]ccidents and emergency room visits may increase\" which is true, it is an intoxicating substance and is harmful. There is no need to add another substance in the mix. She then uses the \"Guilt by association\" fallacy by negatively associating recreational alcohol users to those who commit acts of violence to their spouse. While it may be true that fewer adults use marijuana in the Netherlands than the US, the number of those who tried it is most likely significantly higher, which is not safe. Also, Colombia allows its citizens to grow up to 15 plants and their crime rate and doesn't have very favorable living conditions for the most part[5]. 6.) If you want to tax it, prices will go up. 7.) My opponent has contradicted herself on this stance, I have already rebutted this. [1] http://www.livescience.com... [2] http://www.drugfreeworld.org...

            "conclusion": "Marijuana should be legalized for recreational use",
            "premise": "Thank you as well - I am fully aware that this is a debate about recreational marijuana. You make some very good points as well.Rebuttals:(Rebuttal for your first paragraph): I am fully aware of that. According to this map: https://en.wikipedia.org...Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Hawaii are the only four states so far to legalize recreational marijuana. Pennyslvania, which is the state currently pending for legalization - used to not have it allowed at all. States such as: New York, Nevada, California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Maine, Vermont, Maryland, Deleware, Conneticut, Rhode Island, and Massachussetts; all have marijuana decriminalized. Most other states have marijuana legal in some form or for a certain purpose. The only states who outright ban marijuana completely are: Idaho, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Wyoming, Kansas, Indiana, West Virginia, and Pennyslvania. That means that only 11/50 states are in SUPPORT of marijuana in some way, shape, or form. And many more states in 2015 are pending for legalization such as California and Pennsylvania (as mentioned). The point I am trying to make is that most states are in suppport of marijuana, and it is not just a random group of people who support it somewhere in the united states. \"As Gallup shows, support for legalization is at 62 percent among adults under 30, 56 percent among those aged 30 to 49.\" This piece of evidence means that a majority of adults beliebe marijuana should be legalized.(Rebuttal for second paragraph): While that may be true - over the counter drugs actually cause more fatalities then (more dangerous) drugs you have mentioned. I understand that this debate souly focuses on marijuana but take a look at this statistic: CAUSE OF DEATHS FROM DRUGS PrescriptionDrugs Street DrugsCombined: 39% 45% (Amphetamine + Heroin + Methamphetamine + Cocaine) ~http://www.drugfreeworld.org...This statistic shows how perscription drugs kill more people then a drug like marijuana would (you cannot overdose on marijuana, but it does kill like any other drug, when hollucinating and driving especially). Making marijuana legal would give people an OPTION to use it very often or not so, THE SAME CHOICE people make with prescription drugs. So what are we going to do? Ban over the counter drugs now? No, we cannot do that, and neither can we keep this from people as a choice (you stated how this argument was not for medical purposes, but this paragraph you mentioned was on that topic - I am becoming confused).(Rebuttal for \"responce to second rebuttal\"): \"In 2014, Colorado retailers sold $386 million of medical marijuana and $313 million for purely recreational purposes. The two segments of the market generated $63 million in tax revenue, with an additional $13 million collected in licenses and fees.\" ` so far from Colorado's legalization of the drug, they already made MILLIONS of dollars in sales of the drug - a tax profit of $76 million total. THAT IS ONE STATE ALONE. For theoretical purposes, lets pretend that all 50 states had it legalized and all made a $76 million dollar profit. That would generate a three billion eight hundred million dollar tax revenue to go towards drug rebab etc. This would COMPLETELY outweigh the cost needed for drug rehab - and the government will still make a profit in the end. While that may be true, as you have mention, nuclear weapons are illegal because they can KILL soo many people if given to the wrong hands. They can affect INNOCENT BYSTANDERS. But marijuana cannot do that, it only effects the person consuming the drug and IN RARE CASES some of their peers - not killing hundreds of people at once for someone else's mistake. That is why the government has banned those kinds of weapons. As you have mentioned, the USA IS A FREE COUNTRY; and with freedom, comes freedom of choice. Think of ammendments such as 1, 11, etc. with freedom laws;(http://constitution.findlaw.com...).(Rebuttal for final paragraph): Only 9% of people who try marijuana become addicted - that is a SMALL percentage compared to the 91% who do not get hooked. Making marijuana legal for recreational use will NOT INFLUENCE the statistics of the drug as they are right now. That is because the goverment is not going around making commertials saying; \"Marijuana is soo cool, you should try it!\" etc. The government would simply be dicriminalizing the drug and making it legal and NOT PROMOTING it in ANY WAY. Even though the government wants to protect us the best they can, we all know they cannot protect us from EVERYTHING, that is just common sense and logic. But giving people freedom of choice in another form (because there are so many in this country already), in my opinon, would be something to be thankful, happy, grateful, and supportive of (as you have mentioned yourself).Citations:http://prospect.org...;http://www.drugfreeworld.org...;http://www.washingtonpost.com...;http://constitution.findlaw.com...;",

            "premise": "I believe that medical marijuana should be legal. Marijuana is customarily known as a street drug, but in recent years it has gained its credibility as a medication to treat chronic pain and sooth side effects of chemotherapy for cancer. Already 72% of doctors support medical marijuana. Cancer patients had positive feedback when they tried medical marijuana. They said things like \"It made me feel like I had an appetite for the first time in probably six months\". For the people who benefit from medical marijuana should not be criminalized. Current remedies for pain like Vicodin and Percocet are far more addictive and dangerous. In states where medical marijuana is legalized, doctors have seen a decline in opioid abuse. Making sure people actually need marijuana for medical use and are using it solely for that is where there is a valuable argument. Regulations and government involvement would need to be necessary as with any drug. This also opens up a new industry that could be profitable. There are many ways to consume marijuana than to just smoke it, which is safer to for your lungs. It is unfair to compare the legalization of the medical and recreational use of marijuana, it is a different debate as a whole. The legalization of medical marijuana could steer away from the abuse of opioids and give patients a new way of treatment that has been proven to be effective. It could also change the perception of the drug from a street drug to a medication.",

In most (and perhaps all?) countries Marijuana is subject to more severe legal restrictions and penalties than alcohol. Indeed in USA and UK alcohol is legal (though age restricted) and marijuana is a prohibited substance. I argue that this is wrong and that for a number of reasons Marijuana should in fact have less legal restrictions than alcohol or at least equivalent legal status. To clarify, for the purposes of this debate: Marijuana = any derivative or species variant of cannabis sativa or indica, including 'skunk' varieties, in any form; buds, hash, oil etc. for both medicinal and recreational use. Should = moral incentive. As my opponent has some experience of debating this general topic, I will allow him the option of presenting his arguments first, if he wishes to. If he would prefer however, he can instead use the next round merely for introductions and to challenge me to start the argument. I hope that this will be a fun and informative debate. Thankyou.",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana should be legalized for recreational use",
            "premise": "Thanks, you bring up some very good points - however, I would like to remind you that this debate discusses the recreational use of marijuana, not medical. In your first rebuttal, you describe the medicinal benefits that marijuana can possess. As of the present date, twenty-three states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia have passed legislation that allows for the legal use of medical cannabis in conservative amounts. In response to your description of benefits, a carefully measured, legally dispensed amount of medical marijuana can be effective in treating or bringing relief from said medical issues. However, I would like to again highlight that this debate is centered on legalization of recreational use of the drug. As with the majority of prescription drugs, these medicines are more difficult to access than over-the-counter drugs because potential misuse could have disastrous effects. This is why a doctor's prescription is required to obtain these prescription drugs. Should marijuana be legalized for recreational use, thus giving it the same accessibility as over-the-counter drugs, it is far more likely to be misused for purposes beyond medical reasons. By keeping it as a carefully monitored, limited, and measured and prescription drug, we as people are allowed to take advantage of such benefits you have described while avoiding the disastrous effects of potential abuse. In response to your second rebuttal, it is true that a tax on marijuana could contribute to government profit. However, as I mentioned in my introductory argument, its legalization could lead to even greater hikes in national spending by needing to provide for greater health care and educational needs that would need to be met as a long-term result of the drug's harmful effects. The government also realizes and embraces the fact that there are many other forms of taxation that they currently impose to gain revenue (whether we agree on them or not), and that the consequences of recreational marijuana legalization could far outweigh the benefits. It is true, in the meantime, that America is a country founded on principles of human rights and freedom. However, our forefathers established a government for many reasons - among these is to \"promote the general Welfare\" of our people, as quoted from the Constitution. This concept of general welfare can be defined as \"the concern of the government for the health, peace, morality, and safety of its citizens\" (http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com...). In carrying out this mission identified in the Preamble, the government works to protect its citizens by keeping from them the dangers and threats that this drug poses to the health and welfare of society. It is much the same reason as to why the government prohibits the public from accessing nuclear weapons - but it's a free country, right? Well, yes, but the government has good reason to be keeping such potentially lethal things from public use, even if the majority of users are responsible individuals who \"promise it doesn't affect them.\" Despite the fact that marijuana addiction itself is rare, the influence the drug (in non-medical use) can and does have upon users and those around them as described in my introductory argument is too significant to put aside. The government, though recognizing our freedoms, is remaining faithful to the law of the land by watching out for its citizens - providing safer ways of having a good time and relieving one from the pains of life. This, in my opinion, is something to be thankful for. :) Citations: http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org... http://www.nlm.nih.gov... http://www.archives.gov... http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com...",

A lot of people use it now, and will continue to do so. If it were legalized, those that do not use marijuana would not suddenly become marijuana users. It may be viewed as stress relief to some, but it is much more than that. It is a safer recreational drug than alcohol. It is a drug that no one has ever overdosed on, and it doesn't have the hangover effects that people get from alcohol. The period of prohibition was considered a mistake. It was decided by many that alcohol should be kept legal. From this, it only follows that marijuana should also be legal. Something less dangerous than a LEGAL drug, should also be legal. There are other benefits as well that I will discuss in the next round, due to the 1,000 character limit restraint.",

            "conclusion": "AAN: Marijuana should be legalized recreationally.",
            "premise": "For this round, I'll go ahead and rebut each of my opponent's claims.The Commerce Clause:Here my opponent basically explains that marijuana can be illegal, and that states have a right to prohibit the use of cannabis (and other drugs). It is important to remember that just because a state can do something, doesn't mean they should. Throughout my constructive, I have shown that keeping marijuana illegal works against the common good and takes away from freedom of the people. Though my opponent's point may be correct, this is not what we are debating today. I aim to prove that prohibition of cannabis is wrong on both a pragmatic and moral level and whether or not marijuana can be illegal has no effect on that.The FDA:I think what my opponent is trying to say with this point is that marijuana is not going to be legalized under the status quo because marijuana will not ever be found as \"safe and effective.\" The first thing to realize is that this point is clearly talking about medical marijuana. That is not what this debate is over. Never once in my constructive did I list marijuana as a \"cure\" to some diseases. Rather, I explained that marijuana is less harmful than cigarettes and alcohol, therefore it can be seen as a less harmful alternative to currently legal (and more dangerous) drugs. Now, if the FDA has approved tobacco and alcohol for recreational use, why should they not approve marijuana? Even if the FDA would keep marijuana illegal, within this argument, my opponent assumes that the legitimacy of the status quo to attempt to keep cannabis away from the public. If this indeed is the status quo, it works against the common good (as I have shown in my case).Laetrile:For this point, my opponent talks about a drug known as \"Laetrile,\" explaining that Laetrile was advertised as a potential cure for cancer, but ended up being completely ineffective. My opponent then goes on to explain that the Laetrile situation is similar to Marijuana situation. This simply is not true. NPR notes, \"nnobody argues that marijuana is the new laetrile. For one thing, nobody's claiming it cures any fatal diseases. But it is a departure from the usual rules of evidence for drugs (1).\" If marijuana indeed is the new Laetrile as my opponent claims, evidence must be provided that shows similar properties between the two drugs. Moreover, this debate is not over medical marijuana, rather it is over recreational marijuana; I'm not trying to argue that marijuana should be legalized for medical use in this given debate so so my opponent's point ultimately proves nothing.Tobacco:My opponent proceeds to explain how the FDA used to exclude tobacco from the law, and later on began to regulate it. This point has absolutely nothing to do with the given debate. One cannot compare two drugs with almost no similar properties. I'll get more into the tobacco point in my next rebuttal.Marijuana and Making it legal:My opponent's last two points are definitely the main argument he is making in this case. He explains that, \"Bbefore marijuana can be legal for consumers it must be shown to be a \u201csafe and effective\u201d drug because marijuana use is often confounded by other drugs or studies.\" Looking at the sources supporting this contention, it is quite obvious that this argument pertains to medical marijuana; obviously recreational drugs are not meant to be \"effective\" in any way. Even if this argument did pertain to recreational marijuana, I have proven in my constructive that marijuana is not a harmful drug, especially in comparison to alcohol and tobacco. If the FDA approves both alcohol and tobacco, why not marijuana (as I noted above)? Even if my opponent is correct and it is within the status quo to keep marijuana illegal, my opponent has provided no evidence that suggest marijuana should be kept illegal.ConclusionMy opponent's arguments pertaining to the actual negative health impacts of marijuana are very weak. I have shown in my constructive that marijuana does not harm mental health, physical health, or the well being of non smokers, and in some cases actually positively impacts it. Marijuana positively impacts the economy, and the drug will ultimately become less dangerous when bought from a reliable source. The problem with my opponent's case is that he includes no facts that actually prove society would be better of by keeping cannabis illegal.On the other hand I have shown how car accidents go down by nine percent through the legalization of marijuana, how the tax revenue will benifit the people in any area that legalizes marijuana, how cannabis legalization positively impacts the economy, and how in the end over 750,000 unneccessary arrests can be prevented.Therefore, I am pro.

Stephen Sidney, MD, associate director for research for Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, Calif., in the Sept 20 issue of The British Medical Journal states that \"the current knowledge base does not support the assertion that it has any notable adverse public health impact in relation to mortality,\" No one dies from a 'fatal marijuana overdose'. Since it cant kill you, why make it illegal? 2. Marijuana has relatively mild side effects. It is also non-toxic to humans. Dr. Mark Sircus says this in regards to marijuana use, \"...a low risk profile is evident from the literature available. Serious complications are very rare...\". 4. Marijuana is almost never addictive. 'In 1944, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia commissioned research to be performed by the New York Academy of Science. Among their conclusions: they found marijuana did not lead to significant addiction in the medical sense of the word. They also did not find any evidence marijuana led to morphine, heroin or cocaine addiction.'- CNN News .In fact, tobacco is three times as addictive, according to Dr. Sanjay Gupta. 5. Alcohol and cigarettes are addictive, but they are legal. If we want to be consistent in our values, then its a no-brainer that marijuana should be legalized. 6. Life, Liberty, and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. If we can have guns, and cigs, and beer, and play football (linked to CTE and fatality), then why not?",

            "premise": "Before I go into my position, I would like to say thanks to my opponent, whoever he/she would be. Without further ado, time to get into my position. With the Marihuana (it was spelled that way back in the day) Tax Act of 1937, Congress asserted the power to ban marijuana for any use outside medicine and industry. (rope is made from the marijuana plant) The rule wasn't exactly enforced, as it was even easier to get it for \"medicine\" back then. The Act remained the only national legislation on the plant until 1970, when Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act. This act placed marijuana in the group of Schedule 1 drugs, meaning that the drug has no supposed medical use, with a high potential for abuse, in the same category as heroin. So, thus, the Drug War begins. A lot of criminals get rich from drugs, a lot of kids get messed up by contaminated drugs and overdoses, and a lot of money (our money) is wasted. Now fast forward to 2013, several states, mine included, have recognized medical marijuana. Even though the federal law remains unchanged on the subject of marijuana. 2 have gone as far as to say that they have legalized recreational use. Now, even though I don't agree with the War on Drugs, I say that things like heroin and crystal meth are really bad. But those are chemically processed drugs. Marijuana is purely the plant, no chemicals. So I propose that we legalize marijuana for recreational use for individuals 21 or older on the idea that Unlike alcohol, tobacco, or even prescriptions, weed is not addictive. NO ONE in human history has ever died from weed. Ever. Alcohol has killed at least 50,000 people a year from direct consumption, let alone the accidents (although that is largely a lack of personal responsibility). Tobacco has killed 450,000. We could tax it and help pay down the national debt. We would have fewer victimless criminals clogging our prisons. The police, juries, and courts would have more time to deal with real crimes. We could certainly ease some suffering without killing people. (alcohol will kill you over time) We could regulate the quality so fewer people get sick from contamination or \"cut\" product. And look who's telling you this; I've never taken a recreational drug, never. Not one joint, inhale, or hit. Never even had a sip of alcohol. Thank you for reading. HoneyBadger",

The reason I went to great depth to explain the legal history of drug control is because marijuana (recreational or medical) is a drug and as all, drugs need to be proven \u201csafe and effective\u201d before it can be sold in any form to the public. My rationalized argument is at the end. The whole first half are facts to establish my argument. Moving on I would like to point out the flaws in Pro\u2019s sources and argument. C1) Marijuana's impact on users and those around them: Source 1 and 2 \u2013 Marijuana and psychotic symptoms: The trial groups were: \u201cMen and women age 18\u201350 years who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis according to the DSM-IV criteria were eligible for the study.\u201d [1] The second source is titled \u201cMedical Marijuana for Psychiatric Disorders\u201d also focuses on those with psychiatric disorders. So medical marijuana helps those with schizophrenia and other disorders\u2026. Our conversation is on recreational marijuana, as you pointed out. Source 3 - Marijuana and mental degradation: I would like to point out that the source is over 10 years old and references 15 studies not linked to the article. Studies more recently have shown differences in brain development though it has not impact on the performance of the brain has not been proven. Referring to my source, linked as [9], the brain development changes were found in the reward system of the brain. I will also link my previous sources showed that rats have been shown to have increased cell loss due to the chemicals in marijuana. Marijuana effects on the brain are disputed and its positive effects are for a small part of the population with mental disorders. Source 4 \u2013 Never Linked Source 5 \u2013 Marijuana instead of tobacco: First, not proven is marijuana smoke is better than tobacco smoke. They contain similar tars and cancer causing chemicals. (Refer to my argument). Without having shown that marijuana smoke is less harmful than tobacco smoke, switching has no positive benefit. Also it is only preliminary findings with a very small sample size of 12 in each group. Even with the small sample size, it was only shown that smokers smoked less after one week when being exposed to cannabis smoke instead of a placebo. This source has very little data and a small sample size. This source is unreliable and switching smokes has not been shown to have any benefits. Source 6 \u2013 Effects on Bystanders: I find this source interesting because it does show odd benefit of marijuana legalization. However I would like to quote the source \u201cResearch on stoned driving is inconsistent, with some studies finding impairment and others not\u201d. [5] Unnecessary arrest: This portion is irrelevant and only appeals to pathos. \u201cUnnecessary arrests\u201d is actually a false statement. Marijuana is illegal, and proving people are being arrested for drugs and being charged according to the possession of drugs does not support drug legalization. The laws are not \u201cinjustice\u201d and have been approved by the legislative of the people and the Supreme Court. Money and the Economy This point (people always use it) shows a lack of understanding of the economy and the Constitution. Disposable income will be spent either through one means or another. Colorado has seen a massive increase in tourism, which helps its economy [6]. Anyways it economic growth is similar to other states like Texas, showing no performance increase due to marijuana [7] [8]. Source 9 implies that instead of sending people to jail we can tax them. Avoiding a Slippery Slope fallacy, legalizing actions so they can be taxed is morally wrong and would be unconstitutional because the legalized actions are not for the benefit of the people even if the government generates tax revenue. Safer Cannabis: Thank you for supporting my argument. As with every drug, once marijuana was possibly approved by the FDA after medical researching that showed it was \u201csafe and effective\u201d it would be regulated to be not contaminated. Also like every drug, marijuana needs to be shown to be \u201csafe and effective\u201d before being sold to the public. So it should not be sold. Conclusion: Marijuana has not been shown to be a \u201csafe and effective\u201d drug to be sold to the public either recreationally or medically. Any study showing its safe has another study saying it is unsafe. Until medical research proves that it has no negative effects, it should not be sold to the public.

But I assume you are talking about recreational drugs, like marijuna, lsd, cocaine, etc. These drugs are classified into schedules I-V with I being the highest and are evaluated based on potential for abuse and whether it is used in accepted medical treatments.(1) Therefore something like marijuana which I enjoy partaking in should be illegal. It has a potential for abuse as 9% of users are addicted and over 30% have a marijuana use disorder. (2) This is the only recreational drug that has medical value outside of mushrooms which are allegedly able to help with cluster headaches but the research on that is being done now, so this is not yet an accepted medical treatment. 1.

            "premise": "Pro claims that the fact that people who use marijuana are more likely to use other drugs, is a correlation but not a causation. Though there is a very slight and confusing differential between both causation and correlation, some would say that in this instance, that this is more of a causation rather than correlation. This is because people who are smoking marijuana, have been urged in some way or another to begin using a different hard drug. Therefore, marijuana is the cause of people trying other drugs because it opens up a world of newer, harder drugs with it indeed being a gateway drug. To continue, pro claims that marijuana can be used to treat depression and anxiety, whether or not that is true or not, is not relevant to this debate, as we are debating about recreational use of marijuana, and not medicinal use for it. However, research provided by Mayo Clinic suggests that people who smoke marijuana are more likely to be diagnosed with depression, rather than non smokers. With that being said, pro also claims that smoking marijuana does not cause lung cancer. However, this is untrue because according to the American Lung Association, smoke in itself no matter where it is from, including marijuana can cause all sorts of lung illness ranging from damage of the lung lining, or even chronic bronchitis. Furthermore, marijuana is indeed harmful to our bodies, and can lead people (especially those that do not have very good control over behavior) to try harder drugs out there. Combine that with people that are prone to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and then we have got a world of very physically, and psychologically ill people. Maybe a consensus would be for a doctor to prescribe marijuana in some instance, which would be for a different debate, however the debate about whether or not marijuana should be available to anyone for recreational use, is proved to be con by the reasons stated above. Thanks for a good debate!",

A thorough physical examination MJ-A common street and recreational drug that comes from the marijuana plant: the hemp plant cannabis sativa. The pharmacologically active ingredient in marijuana is tetra-hydro-cannabinol (THC). Marijuana is used to heighten perception, affect mood, and relax. Many people think marijuana is harmless, but it is not. Signs of marijuana use include red eyes, lethargy, and uncoordinated body movements. The long-term effects may include decrease in motivation and harmful effects on the brain, heart, lungs, and reproductive system. People who smoke marijuana are also at increased risk of developing cancer of the head and neck. A pharmaceutical product, Marinol, that contains synthetic THC, is available as a prescription medication. It comes in the form of a pill (eliminating the harmful and cancer-causing chemicals present when marijuana is smoked) and is used to relieve the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy for cancer patients and to treat loss of appetite in AIDS patients. mood-altering herb they smoked marijuana Legal-1.

            "conclusion": "AAN: Marijuana should be legalized recreationally.",
            "premise": "IntroductionMy opponent believes I have misunderstand his first argument. This is not the case. The idea of making sure a drug is \"safe and effective\" in order to legalize it clearly pertains to medical marijuana. The FDA has allowed both alcohol and cigarettes which are less safe in comparison to marijuana (and certainly not effective in anyway). Even if this idea of safety and effectiveness does include recreational marijuana, my opponent's argument basically states that we can't make cannabis legal because under the status quo of the FDA, meaning it should stay illegal. This argument is flawed because my opponent has assumed the status quo of the FDA is legitimate. Moreover, throughout my constructive, I have shown that marijuana is a less harmful drug when compared to currently legal drugs.I will now look at each of my opponent's attacks on my constructive case...C1) Marijuana's impact on users and those around them:Psychotic Symptoms: My opponent begins by attacking my argument in which people diagnosed with schizophrenia were positively impacted by medical marijuana by saying that this debate (as I confirmed) is over recreational marijuana. This is true; however, cannabis used for recreational purpose can still have medical benefits. The two are not exclusive. I was mainly using that point to debunk the common misconception that marijuana worsens mental conditions.Mental Degradation: For this point, I had made a claim that explained the use of cannabis does not result in the loss of brain cells. My opponent attacks my source by explaining that it is outdated and the studies are not linked. The truth is, that it is difficult to find studies on marijuana / brain cell count because many regular users are unwilling to participate for fear of being caught. This point doesn't carry much weight in this debate, but I'll go ahead and address my opponents claims that state rats have lost brain cells from marijuana. The Union: The Business Behind Getting High (a documentary) explains that in such tests, animals are given an abnormal amount of marijuana; more than any human could possibly consume in such a short period of time. As with such a dose of most things, a test subject would be expected to lose brain cells (1).Marijuana as a Tobacco Substitute: For starters, I will note that the sample size for the study that proved marijuana as an effective substitute for tobacco was small. However, this does not prove the experiment to be invalid. As I have said earlier (on both sides of the argument) there is going to be an inevitable lack of evidence simply because marijuana is studied significantly less than one would expect. My opponent essentially explains that unless I can show that marijuana is less harmful than tobacco smoke, switching has no positive impact. The thing is, I have shown this through my constructive. As my fourth source has shown, smoking marijuana can increase lung capacity. Lets take another quick look at how marijuana compares to tobacco: USCF notes, \"Air flow rate increased rather than decreased with increased exposure to marijuana up to a certain level (2).\" As I've said before, smoking weed is not exactly *good* for one's lungs. However, it is preferable to smoking tobacco. Take a look at source two for more. Effect on Bystanders: This point was basically dropped. All my opponent did here is call out a quote from my source: \"However I would like to quote the source \u201cResearch on stoned driving is inconsistent, with some studies finding impairment and others not.\" Now, obviously there is some degree of impairment when individuals drive while high. The argument is that the degree of impairment is significantly less to that of a drunk driver. Remember, with legalization lives are saved through this odd benefit. In Colorado alone, we see that there are 3,000 less car crash fatalities each year.C2) Unnecessary ArrestMy opponent explains that from *his* stand point, this position is irrelevant. This actually isn't quite the case. My opponent has provided no actual evidence that proved that keeping marijuana illegal is beneficial. All he has done is argue that by the standards of the FDA, it should be kept illegal. Since my opponent has provided zero evidence as to why keeping marijuana illegal is beneficial to society, there is no reason that this shouldn't be considered. I am not arguing that the state doesn't have a legal right to make such arrests; obviously, they do. This argument is more of a moral one. It is against the common good to ruin someone's life through an arrest for a victimless \"crime.\" Also, (I'll get more into this on the money point) taxpayers pay a huge amount of money to keep these prisoners in jail.C3) Money and the EconomyMy first point went dropped by my opponent. This is definitely my most important point in this category. American taxpayers are paying around 1 billion every year to keep cannabis prisoners in jail. As I explained, the prohibition of pot has now become unfair to not only the consumer, but to the taxpayer as well. In reality, the only person that benefits when it comes to money is the drug dealers. In the words of my adversary, \"Legalizing actions so they can be taxed is morally wrong.\" That is, of course, not the main motivation behind legalizing marijuana. There are many practical reasons to legalize cannabis and that is just one of them. He continues, \"the legalized actions are not for the benefit of the people.\" The problem with that statement is, my opponent has done nothing to prove that legalizing cannabis hurts the common good. All he has argued is that it is within the status quo of the FDA to keep marijuana illegal. This point ultimately stands because through legalization, taxpayers won't pay for unnecessary arrests, tax revenue will benefit the states, and the economy will boom due to the new jobs.C4) Safer CannabisMy opponent has basically conceded to this point. Through legalization of marijuana, we will ultimately obtain safer cannabis. The thing we disagree on, is (a) whether or not marijuana is safe and (b) FDA's process of approving drugs. Note that alcohol and tobacco are regulated (and also more harmful than cannabis).ConclusionI have proved throughout the debate that marijuana should be legalized for a variety of reasons. As I said earlier on, even if it were harmful, that does not change the fact that though the legalization of marijuana:1. Taxpayers will stop having to pay for unnecessary arrests for victimless \"crimes.\"2. Tax revenue will work toward the benefit of society.3. The economy will thrive.4. Cannabis will be safer.The thing is, marijuana isn't a very harmful drug. In fact (health wise) it works toward the common good.1. People use it as an alternative to tobacco (which helps the lungs).2. People use it as an alternative to alcohol (which prevents car accidents).Therefore, I firmly believe we should legalize cannabis. Thanks to con for such an interesting debate.Vote Pro!!(1) The Union: The Business Behind Getting High (Movie Website: http://www.theunionmovie.com...)(2) http://www.ucsf.edu...",

It should be up to the individual to decide whether or not they wish to consume marijuana, regardless of what ever health effects it has on the body. If one enjoys passing their time by smoking marijuana that should not be an activity that is considered illegal. The three inalienable rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. the catch to these rights is you only have them if you are not infringing on another individuals rights. therefore if murder is how you pursue happiness that would not be allowed due to the fact that it infringes on your victims rights. As long as ones consumption of marijuana does not infringe on the rights of another individual, one should be allowed to consume it as they see fit.",

            "premise": "Hello and thanks to whoever accepts this debate. In most (and perhaps all?) countries marijuana is subject to more severe legal restrictions and penalties than alcohol. Indeed in USA and UK alcohol is legal (though age restricted) and marijuana is a prohibited substance. I argue that this is wrong and that for a number of reasons marijuana should in fact have less legal restrictions than alcohol or at least equivalent legal status. To clarify, for the purposes of this debate: Marijuana = any derivative or species variant of cannabis sativa or indica, including 'skunk' varieties, in any form; buds, hash, oil etc. for both medicinal and recreational use. I've tried to set this debate up before but there was some confusion about the topic so I'll try to be extra clear this time. I am arguing that alcohol is at least as bad or worse for individuals and society. I am not saying whether either substance should have any specific legal status. I am saying that marijuana should have less restrictions than alcohol. This could be achieved one of two ways: 1. Loosen current restrictions on marijuana. 2. Tighten current restrictions on alcohol. I do not intend to advocate one position over the other, merely to prove that alcohol has worse effects on behaviour and health than marijuana therefore the status quo is unfair and immoral. As my opponent will presumably be supporting the status quo, I will allow him or her the option of presenting arguments first, if they wish to. If he or she would prefer however, they can instead use the next round merely for introductions and to challenge me to start the argument. If you are unsure about the topic then please ask questions in the comments section before accepting the debate. I hope that this will be a fun and informative discussion. Thankyou.",

            "premise": "I was wondering when I would get a response. I find this topic very important and enjoy debating it. As per your request, I will focus on medical as well as recreational purposes this round. To begin with, marijuana used medically has proven very useful for a medication. Your fact that marijuana has some negative side effects is true; smoking anything in general can harmful for your lungs. However, the panic attacks, paranoia, etc., are effected by the environment and you mood when smoking. To go along with that, what strain of marijuana smoked does matter. Certain strains will make you more tired and sluggish or active and energetic. A main use for medical marijuana is that it reduces pain. Medical marijuana advocates in other states have said that when diagnosed, they have tried pills or other \"big pharma\" recommendations. When these do not work, many turned to alcohol. Once medical marijuana was allowed, they reported that they had finally found a medication that worked and had less side effects along with the fact that they worked better for them. As for the recreational reasons, the U.S. has an incredibly high incarceration rate; the highest in the world. Between 2001 and 2010, there were 8.2 million marijuana related arrests, 88% of those were for simply possessing marijuana. If marijuana was decriminalized and legalized recreationally, the arrest rate would in turn drop. Another use of recreational marijuana would be that it would reduce the number of deaths from other, much more harmful drugs. In states with recreational use, especially with Colorado, deaths related to Opium, which can be made into pills or drugs such has heroine, have decreased dramatically. If we were to instate proper laws, like those in states with medical and recreation use, (age requirements, laws against smoking in public, issuing proper medical use licenses) along with creating proper laws making driving while under the influence illegal, medical and recreational uses will prove useful and helpful, as well as fun. If it is alright with you, may we discuss the economic effects of legalization next?",

            "premise": "Why do we need recreational marijuana? Many people can understand why we have medicinal marijuana to help out people who have health conditions or disorder, physically or mentally but why recreational? Cannabis is a plant that contains the mind-altering chemicals tetrahydrocannabinol also known as THC which is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is responsible for a euphoric high. Cannabis should not be legalized, however, it the most commonly used drug in the United States. According to Agata Blaszczak-Boxe, wrote the article \"Potent Pot: Marijuana Is Stronger Now Than It was 20 Years ago\" on February 8, 2016, stated the potency of cannabis has increased from 12 percent in 2014 as a supposed to 4 percent in 1995. With that being said CBD, cannabidiol- an ingredient that sometimes boosted its potential health benefit, has drastically changed from 0.28 percent in 2001 to less than 0.15 percent in 2014. The increase of THC potency will build people\"s tolerance and have them dependent on cannabis which means people will soon become addicted to it. People who are heavily dependent on cannabis and stop using will suffer withdrawal symptoms like depression, stomach pain, anxiety, and insomnia. According to Dr. Drew Pinsky, a board-certified internist and addiction medicine specialist said [He's] been treating cannabis addiction for 20 years. When people are addicted to cannabis, cocaine, and alcohol the drug they have the most difficult time giving up is the cannabis.\" This states cannabis is addicting, and legalizing cannabis will result in having a higher percentage of people using. On August 2, 2016 Journal of Drug Issues wrote an article called \"Evolution of the United States Marijuana Market in the Decade of Liberalization Before Full Legalization\" and found in their study that \"the number of US daily marijuana users has risen dramatically since 2002 and now 68% of users report daily or near-daily use.\" This article was done in 2016 when it was still illegal now imagine how it is now, in 2018, that it has become legal. Before it was legalized, many people would make up excuses to use cannabis, now people don\"t need an excuse and are provided quickly. Since Proposition 64 was passed, many people walk into the dispensaries without the proper knowledge of usage, therefore, would cause them to abuse it. In a journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence published a survey and reported that \"22% of marijuana users experienced \"acute anxiety or panic attacks following cannabis use,\" and 15% had psychotic symptoms following use.\" That being said legalizing cannabis will result in a negative outcome like drug addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and misuse.",

Some people say Marijuana is to dangerous, but alcohol is more unsafe then the drug. You may also point out that I called it a drug, but tobacco is also a drug. Marijuana, even if it is not used medically, can be beneficial. Some people say it kills to many brain cells, but what their not thinking about is that when any brain cell dies, a new one is created. Which new brain cells are stronger than old ones, therefore making Marijuana healthy for the brain, if smoked safely. That does not mean I am saying you can smoke it anywhere you want. It still should stick with normal smoking laws. Another point is people try to complain that people can overdose on Marijuana, but you can do that with any drug or alcohol. Besides, Marijuana affect would have you pass out before you could even try to overdose. Prescription drugs kill about 100,000 people in the world each year. Off the top of your head, do you know how many deaths are caused by using Marijuana, either medicinally or recreationally? \"There are no deaths from Cannabis use. Anywhere. You can't find one,\" said Dr. Lester Grinspoon, professor emeritus at Harvard Medical School. Believe it: In 10,000 years of known use of cannabis, there's never been a single death attributed to Marijuana. Marijuana is smoked by some people to ease Arthritis pain in the muscles. Thought, this does not mean they should trade their medication for Marijuana. Marijuana is just a a pain remover. Going back to the prescription drugs; Prescription drugs, while legal, are experimental, dangerous and often toxic. Prescription drugs continue to kill hundreds of thousands Americans each year; meanwhile, Marijuana has never been the direct contributor to a single death. Overall I think the should legalize Marijuanna because of it medical help and because it will end many wars America is having!!",

It is established scientific fact that marijuana is not toxic to humans; marijuana overdoses are nearly impossible, and marijuana is not nearly as addictive as alcohol or tobacco. It is unfair and unjust to treat marijuana users more harshly under the law than the users of alcohol or tobacco. Marijuana use has positive attributes, such as its medical value and use as a recreational drug with relatively mild side effects. Many people use marijuana because they have made an informed decision that it is good for them, especially Americans suffering from a variety of serious ailments. Marijuana provides relief from pain, nausea, spasticity, and other symptoms for many individuals who have not been treated successfully with conventional medications. Many American adults prefer marijuana to the use of alcohol as a mild and moderate way to relax. Americans use marijuana because they choose to, and one of the reasons for that choice is their personal observation that the drug has a relatively low dependence liability and easy-to-manage side effects. Most marijuana users develop tolerance to many of marijuana's side effects, and those who do not, choose to stop using the drug. Marijuana use is the result of informed consent in which individuals have decided that the benefits of use outweigh the risks, especially since, for most Americans, the greatest risk of using marijuana is the relatively low risk of arrest.",

            "premise": "Hello, and thanks to Pro for giving me the opportunity to debate this important issue. I will begin by stating my contention. Growing marijuana, possessing marijuana, and using marijuana for recreational use (medical marijuana should be legal) should remain illegal, but the penalties for each of these violations should be altered drastically. This is a much more reasonable policy than full legalization. I would like to begin by stating that I agree entirely and will not attempt to refute many of the claims I anticipate that my opponent will make. I agree that marijuana has been proven to be an effective treatment for pain, that THC has been adequately proven not to have a direct adverse effect on the human body, and that the United States' policy on drugs is completely ineffective and has made no progress whatsoever towards their goal. If my opponent would like to present any other traditional arguments against the illegality of marijuana, chances are quite high that I will agree with them. However, Pro should not be disinclined to present them - just know that we are probably on the same page on 90% of issues concerning marijuana. I will now give overviews of how laws concerning marijuana should be changed, and the reasoning behind why it should not be fully legalized. I will not extensively cite sources, as this is an overview of my position - I will use hard data more extensively in later rounds, after I see what my parts of my argument my opponent chooses to combat. First, the so-called \"War on Drugs\" has been proven to be completely ineffective by both marijuana advocacy groups and neutral government research. Those who still agree with our current policies, which incarcerate thousands of people each year on non-violent offenses and cost the tax-payer absurd sums of money, are very few and far between. Instead, fines and other violation level punishments should be enacted to control and discourage the recreational use of marijuana. Why should marijuana not be fully legalized? There are several reasons. 1. The fact of the matter is, while THC itself is not a harmful substance, there are still negative health effects associated with the smoking of marijuana. It is reasonable to assume that if marijuana were legalized, marijuana cigarettes would begin to be sold in stores. As such, people would purchase and smoke these cigarettes. Some studies have found that, while 'joints' do not directly cause lung cancer or emphysema, they do have some negative effects on both the lungs and the brain. 2. Additionally, THC is an intoxicant. Anecdotal arguments are made quite often to suggest that marijuana use does not effect driving ability. However, this is absurd, as marijuana is a psychoactive chemical which has numerous effects on the brain and has drastically different effects which depend entirely on the user. Drunk driving is currently responsible for a great number of car accidents in the United States. While it is a fact that people use marijuana regardless of whether or not it is legal, and drive under the influence, I do not believe that legalizing it would have any positive effect in terms of curbing 'high driving'. Instead, methods for road-testing suspected drivers under the influence of marijuana should be developed, testing technology should be implemented by police departments, and laws should be changed to punish high drivers in the same way that drunk drivers are punished. 3. If legalized, marijuana would being to be mass-produced and large companies would soon dominate the market. Today's massive tobacco companies are very rich, and as such, have powerful lobbyists that make it very difficult to change laws concerning the distribution and marketing of cigarettes. It took years just to legally force tobacco companies to display warnings on their packets, and to change advertising methods to stop targeting children. There is no reason to assume that marijuana companies would enter the market with the public's good intentions at heart. Instead, the same types of money-mongers who capitalize on the public's urge to drink and smoke would presumably take control of the market and gain similar deceitful legal power. There is currently little control over the dangerous pesticides and chemical additives in tobacco cigarettes - again, there is no reason to assume these large marijuana companies would treat their crops and products with a similar disregard for their consumers' safety due to mass-production and distribution. 4. While it is true that marijuana smuggling is responsible for a great number of unnecessary casualties of drug wars in Mexico, marijuana is by no means the only drug these black market cartels are responsible for. While legalizing marijuana would certainly decrease gang activity dealing with that particular drug, it would simply shift their focus to other drugs or illicit activities. It would take full across-the-board legalization of all drugs to effectively end these deadly battles, and that is not the resolution. 5. The culture of intoxicant use in America has a long history, and while views have shifted over the years, there is still a general attitude of reverence towards legal intoxicants, especially alcohol. The simple fact is that legalizing marijuana would cast it in a more favorable light. While alcohol is known to have detrimental effects on the human body, the fact that this is generally recognized does not diminish the drinking culture that is promoted in films and on college campuses nationwide. The fact that alcohol is legal means it is generally permitted, and endorsing yet another intoxicant does not seem productive. 6. Legalizing marijuana would mean that it would be easier to obtain. While those that seek it are able to find it, it is still more difficult and risky than simply walking into a store and purchasing it. This would mean that underage (if, as should be presumed, there was an age law associated with marijuana) people would also be able to obtain it more easily, and marijuana IS proven to have a negative effect on the developing brain. Combining the above reasons, among others, I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana use. A pre-negation: the argument that marijuana should be illegal because alcohol is illegal is not valid. If brought, I will explain why. If not contested my opponent excepts the validity of this statement. I look forward to my opponent's argument! I have a feeling we are going to agree on a lot, but there are going to be key differences. Thanks again for allowing me the opportunity to debate this issue, and I look forward to a productive, illuminating debate.",

            "premise": "Gateway: The \"mild highs that make them want more,\" is an assumption you make about all marijuana users. You also previously stated that Cocaine was \"the most common step drug from marijuana.\" This humors me in that 1 in every 100 marijuana users have tried Cocaine. No matter how that ratio is scaled, it remains that 1% of marijuana users use the most common harder drugs, hardly enough evidence to hold the gateway drug theory legitimate. Perhaps one crucial factor that we have overlooked is that marijuana currently circulates not through pharmacies and such, but through the black market where other harder drugs are widely available. I say that it is extremely likely that marijuana users resort to harder drugs because of their exposure to them, in these unsafe environments where marijuana is being sold. By selling marijuana legally at certain places, it eliminates the user to have to get the drug illegally. (Why would any user risk the illegal black market over a safe legal place? Better quality? I don't think so. Drug dealers are notorious for giving mixtures of rat poison and bleach, saying that it was the substance they were seeking to buy) Lastly you say that marijuana produces \"a better high,\" than alcohol. While they produce separate effects, it is quite a logical fallacy to say that someone who has had ten shots of hard liquor is no less intoxicated than one who has been smoking a joint. As to whether these two different impairments have the gateway effect, there is nothing currently that proves it. Again, that makes your theory an assumption and because the hard data behind all the studies are inconclusive, your statements, unfortunately, become invalid. Am I supposed to take your word for it over experienced scientists? Marijuana = More Legal Narcotics?: Marijuana would be legalized because it is different than the harder drugs and not as potent. The difference between marijuana and harder drugs would be made known to the public. Legalizing marijuana will work however it is not a simple process. Restrictions and law enforcement would be put in place to keep everything in check. After the first few months of regulating everything I am confident that legalizing marijuana will reduce crime. As proven above, the assumption that marijuana is a gateway drug obviously does not \"hold water\" and therefore eliminates a lot of problems presented to me. It has been shown in studies that something that is scarce or forbidden, is psychologically more appealing. When legalized, the consumption of it will rise at first then lower, because of this fact. But, don't take my word for it, look at Europe, where alcohol is more legal and more widely available to younger adults, and alcohol related car crashes occur much less. Because marijuana is not a gateway drug, and because it could be regulated closely under watch, I propose that legalizing marijuana could work.",

            "premise": "\"The truth is the idea you have brought up is simply a theory. Tobacco and alcohol have also been accused of being gateway drugs. I understand marijuana and alcohol are different kinds of drugs but nothing about marijuana has been proven to qualify it as a 100% surefire \"gateway drug.\" Numerous tests and data have shown inconclusive evidence of the gateway drug theory. In 2007 the surgeon general said that marijuana was in fact a gateway drug. He, however, did not prove this himself, and was instead, stating a probable (but not true) side effect to marijuana use based on inconclusive research to help raise awareness about the negative effects. Two studies from University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy show inconclusive evidence to support this theory. So has the U.S. National Institute of medicine and RAND, who works for the U.S. government and military. All of these are reliable resources. Lastly, the assumption that marijuana would be legal for teens is false. Because marijuana is not legal, we don't know what legal using age will be put into place. Avoiding selling to teens is a very valid point that I agree with.\" My Response: It may be just a theory, yes. However, this theory holds water. You have conceded that marijuana and alcohol are different kids of drugs. Moving from there, you state it isn't 100% true. I say, it isn't 100% untrue. Society would be much better off if we keep it illegal, and hinder the possibility of loads of people getting hooked on it, then moving to harder substances. You then say that the Surgeon General was only looking at negative side effects. It's because of these mild highs that people get that make them want more. It just keeps building. Once the mild high cannot satisfy them, they look for a larger high. This leads them to try, Cocaine, LSD, etc. Furthermore, you agree that it is bad for teens to acquire them. Making it legal would make it so much easier for teens to acquire it. Look at the rampant underage drinking problem we have. It is legal and teens make older people get it for them or they get fake licenses. Making marijuana legal only makes it that much easier for teens to get it. In conclusion, the gateway theory must hold to help protect society from very likely negative consequences. \"There is no way to tell how society will react, especially because we don't know whether the gateway drug theory is correct or not. Because of the this unpredictability factor, we have to rely on history for answers. I could list and list events, but I don't want to waste your time so I'm going to concentrate on one significant, closely related one: Prohibition. As you know, Prohibition was when alcohol was illegal in the United States throughout the 1920's. It was proven that as soon as this drug was deemed illicit, crime (organized crime especially) skyrocketed as well as the smuggling of alcohol into the States. This all goes back to the fact that people in the past have increased criminal activity due to the act that made another so-called \"gateway drug,\" alcohol, illegal, the opposite of what you proposed. Alcoholics have a chance to do harder drugs, just like any other type of user, and if your theory was correct then the harder drugs should have become as much of a problem as alcohol in the 1920's...but they didn't.\" My Response: Ok, I have 3 responses 1) We have already concluded that marijuana is a different drug then alcohol and creates a different and better high. Therefore, alcholo was not really a gateway drug. 2) Since it is very likely that marijuana is a gateway drug, people would be more likely to resort to crime to get harder substances. This is plain logic. 3) Legalizing marijuana would just increase the incentive for harder drugs. Once the government gives into legalizing marijuana, people will look for all legalized narcotics. When that doesn't happen they will resort to crime. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

            "premise": "The key to the issue is causation vs correlation. 1. So, in response to your 'gateway drug' argument, marijuana is actually not a gateway drug. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse says that ' the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, \"harder\" substances. '. Factcheck.org says this- 'Though studies of large populations of people have indeed found that those who smoke marijuana are more likely to use other drugs, these studies show a correlation without showing causation \" a commonly misunderstood phenomenon in science.'. So its like saying that since usually it rains the day after your neighbor mows his lawn,mowing the lawn must bring rain the next day. It says more about the type of people that use drugs, than any problem or addictive power of marijuana. In Holland, where marijuana is legal, there has actually been a decrease in people falling into the 'gateway' trap. 'A 2010 Rand Institute report found that there was \"some evidence\" for a \"weakened gateway\" in The Netherlands, and concluded that the data \"clearly challenge any claim that the Dutch have strengthened the gateway to hard drug use.\" '-from a Time magazine article entitled 'Marijuana as a Gateway Drug: The Myth That Will Not Die'. 2. I will also point out that while marijuana has been linked to depression and anxiety, it can also be used to treat depression and anxiety. So wouldn't it stand to reason that the people who use marijuana take it because it relieves the depression? But when they are tested (presumably not while smoking a joint) they show up as depressed, anxious, etc.? What I mean is that the people more likely to smoke marijuana are people who are more likely to be depressed and/or anxious. 'There have been a number of studies that have explored the link between marijuana use and mental health symptoms. Strong associations are often found but this is not the same as a causal link (i.e. one causes the other).'- The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute. They also say that 'results are mixed'. 3. Smoking weed does not cause lung cancer. Research from Johns Hopkins University showed that 'Marijuana, unlike tobacco and alcohol, does not appear to cause head, neck, or lung cancer.' In marijuana/cancer studies, there is often no link between the two after accounting for smoking and drinking. Many weed users also do those things. The presence of tobacco can skew the results of such studies, unless you account for those substances. Marijuana on its own is 'unlikely to cause head, neck, or lung cancer', according to WebMD. (On a somewhat irrelevant note, 'What we do know, is that smoking marijuana may help some people cope with cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, \"cannabinoids may have benefits in the treatment of cancer-related side effects.\"- Verywell.com. So marijuana may have the opposite effect. ----I bring this in not as a reason to legalize, but just to show that it has the opposite effect than what some claim it does.) (We can pretend I didn't say it if you don't want it in.) So while weed may have some adverse effects on your lungs, it most definitely has not been proven to cause or increase the chance of lung cancer. (Rebuttals/Summations in Rd 4?)",

            "discussionTitle": "Debate Topic - Recreational Marijuana ought to be legalized nationwide",
            "conclusion": "Debate Topic - Recreational Marijuana ought to be legalized nationwide",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent and wish him the very best of luck in this debate. I shall now present my case. Case One - The problem with illegalized marijuana In many countries across the world we can see that marijuana usage (not just in a recreational sense) is illegal and anyone caught utilizing marijuana can be punished by local law. Now the nature of this law is mainly to prevent the abuse of a psychoactive drug which is shown to be addictive and harmful if used excessively and in the wrong conditions. However this often doesn't happen. If we look at the facts (see source one) the five most powerful drug cartels in the world operate in Mexico and Colombia. Two countries where the usage of recreational marijuana is illegal but unenforced by local law. This law paving way for drug cartels to take control presents a number of problems I will illustrate as follows - One - This has a rapid and dangerous butterfly effect on the governement and public service departments in the country. Mexico's cartel problem has paved way for massive drug rings to form. The money generated from drug rings allows for the financing of other criminal activities. Notably some of these examples include human trafficking, Bribery and corruption in the police force and the government (which allows them to cover up murders and gang-related attacks) and international smuggling. And these figures are on the rise. In Mexico crime rates have soared over the past three years. 28. 5% increase in violent robberies. 14. 3% increase in intentional homicide and 13. % increase in business robberies. The report has also attributed this increase due to the increasingly militarized tactics used by the perpertrators, A trait commonly associated for thugs under the payroll of drug lords. Two - The youth will be more exposed to drug usage more than if it was legalized. The simple fact is that drug dealers and drug lords do not care about the market they are supplying to. Their goal is simplistic and very focused. And that is to simply maximize profit and maintain discretion while doing so. It's very clear that in many developing countries across the world (notably India) enforcability of drug laws is extremely difficult and many members of the youth find themselves exposed to the influence of the widely accessible black market. Three - As hinted in problem one, The strength of the drug cartels in some countries will present incredible problems in another country. Because of the financing behind smuggling rings other countries that have also illegalized marijuana laws will find themselves at risk of massive influxes from the black market. This presents in itself a serious problem for the economy and social welfare. Almost all the negative externalties will be passed on and there will be widespread social chaos caused as a result for no tangible benefit for anyone other than a third party supplying illegal marijuana. Hence, By legalizing marijuana it allows a number of remedies to follow suit. It weakens the power of drug cartels and allows the government to have a stronger grip in tackling internal problems such as corruption and external problems such as the crime rate. While drug cartels specialize in the supplying of drugs other than recreational marijuana, That particular drug itself generates a bulk of the revenue for cartels as its widespread popularity and psychoactive effects are a huge selling point for the drug. Second, It allows the government to properly monitor the process in which legal recreational marijuana is distributed amongst the populace. This allows the government to prevent it from falling into the hands of the youth (as drug dealers will be considerably less inclined to partake in the business due to the fall in the profit margin) and better safeguard them from the psychoactive effects at a young age. Case Two - The similarities of alcohol and tobacco usage Now we're all well aware of the fact that recreational marijuana is only but one of the many things that alter behaviour and cause addiction upon consumption. Alcohol and tobacco are among these. The only difference being that alcohol and tobacco are legal in most parts of the world while marijuana is not. Not only that, But alcohol and tobacco have actually been seen as comparitvely more dangerous in case studies. One such case study (source three) has shown that alcohol and tobacco exposure was proven to be a higher risk factor than marijuana. One such example out of this is the fact that overconsumption of alcohol can potentially be fatal. Howver on the flipside, Overconsumption of marijuana is not known to be fatal on its own. The smoking of pure tobacco cigarettes on the other hand has been shown to be a greater factor to influence the growth of cancer cells and risk other diseaes catching on in comparison to marijuana. The hemp plant in itself has medical benefits. And smoking unfiltered marijuana is not known to cause any notable health effects that can compare to the effects brought on by tobacco usage. Thus we enter a legal loophole. Given that the effects of alcohol and tobacco are perceivably more harmful, It should be only natural that if it was so bad that marijuana had to be illegalized then alcohol and tobacco ought to follow suit. But given that's not the case and probably never will be in most countries, It should only be expected that marijuana is not made the exception simply because of its classification as a 'psychoactive drug'. Case Three - The economical benefits of legalization As most of us are already aware our governments love to tax us every day of our natural lives. They tax us on housing. They tax us for infrastructure development. They tax us to maintain the judicial system and public services. They tax us to finance their annual budget and to appreciate the currency. And of course, They also tax us on the products we buy. The money the government already makes from alcohol and tobacco taxes is quite notable to say the least. In the United States (see source four) $18 billion dollars was collected from tobacco taxes in 2015 and $16 billion was collected from alcohol taxes in that same year. This money goes into the annual budget. It goes into schools, Infrastructure, Hospitals, The works. And the reason is this possible is because the government monitors the sales of alcohol and tobacco through legal vendors. This does not happen with recreational marijuana due to the fact that it's illegal. And all the revenue generated from it goes into the black market and not into the economy at all. Hence the equation is simple. There are incredible economical benefits that can be derived from legalizing recreational marijuana but there are absolutely no economical benefits derived from keeping it illegal. If anything, We're spending more money simply trying to enforce the law by keeping it illegal which often does not work at all in stopping the spread of the drug. Instead of allowing the black market the power of selling the drug, Keep it in the hands of the government. At the bare minimum, The profit margin from legal sales will be incredibly useful in many other aspects of society. Summary In my argument I've laid forward three main principles to support my case that recreational marijuana should be legalized - One) Drug cartels profit immensely of illegalization laws which negatively impact society and the crime rate. Two) Alcohol and Tobacco (both legal utilities) have evidentely been showed to be a great deal more harmful on personal health and yet their status has not been changed simply because they are not labelled as 'drugs'. (This has mainly been the case why many medical practioners have suggested that marijuana isn't really a 'drug' because there are no known effects of usage that cause serious problems on health) Three) The economical benefits of a taxation scheme will not only help rack up revenue for the government to use on society but also help the government monitor the flow of marijuana sales in their own country. It's hard to argue that it would rather be better that we leave the hands of the drug to be sold by black market forces than the government. With that, I hand my floor open to my opponent to present his own case. Thank you. Sources - https://deserthopetreatment. Com/drug-abuse/cartels/ https://www. Garda.

I will respond to that before I move on to the facts he stated about why recreational marijuana should be be legal.Pro's RebuttalsPro stated that \"the person doing it chooses to do it is his body he damages by taking any relatively strong drug.\" This is true, but as citizens of this country, we want there to be more people who are not ill or dead. We want people to have good jobs so they will pay taxes. People are less likely to be hired for a job if the interviewer can tell they have been smoking, which is a hard smell and behavior to cover up. Pro has not given any more arguments against mine, so I shall move on to his facts about marijuana in round 2.Pro's Arguments Towards Marijuana1. \"Prohibition failed\"Indeed it did, but that is because the government did not have as much control as it does today. If that happened again today, there would still be illegal uses, but not as many because more people would be caught. What needs to happen is greater funding of the DEA and police. is un-supported by facts and statistics which have shown that since the war on drugs started more and more people use drugs[sic]That is not true. There is plenty of evidence for health issues and statistics. I will mention some evidence in a moment.2. \"Better Quality and Possibly less use\"There's no such thing as 'better quality' marijuana. It's a plant. It is not synthesized. And it will only be used more, not less. If it is legalized, it will be easier to find, which will lead to more people using it. It's simple logic and statistics.3. \"Hemp\" I do not really know what to say about this energy thing. I personally think we need to move on to electric cars instead of bio-fuel or oil power cars. 4. \"It is not as harmful as legal drugs\"Actually, it is. It turns down brain activity until it is very low. When it gets to that point, it is barely capable of complex thought. Alcohol is better for the brain than marijuana because it doesn't shut it down as quick or as much. Cigarettes destroy the mouth, lungs, and throat, so I guess you could say that's worse. 5. \"Prison and Tax money\" Yeah, more people paying taxes sounds pretty good to me. That is what I was talking about earlier: we want less people dying from drugs so we can have more taxpayers to pay their taxes.I patiently await Pro's arguments.",

            "conclusion": "Should Marijuana Be Legalized",
            "premise": "Pro\"s arguments in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana greatly overstate the case. First, pro claims that marijuana is not addictive. According to Psychology Today* the most that we can say is that marijuana is not as addictive as some other substances. Between 10 to 30% of regular marijuana users develop dependency. 9% develop a serious addiction. Comparatively, only 23% of heroin users develop an addiction. While it is true that marijuana is not as addictive a heroin, that is not the same as saying that it is not addictive. Second, it is true that since marijuana was legalized in Colorado crime in Denver, the state\"s largest city, has decreased by roughly 10%**. However, a large part of that drop can be attributed to the fact that an activity which was once illegal has been legalized. If theft were legalized we would also see a decrease in illegal activity because an action which was once a crime would no longer be considered illegal. Beyond this, it is difficult to give the legalization of marijuana full credit for the decrease in crime. For instance, homicide in Denver has decreased by almost 50%. It would be an extremely difficult to make a case that a full 50% of homicides in Denver were marijuana related. Third, anorexia has nothing to do with appetite. It usually centers around body issues in which a person feels hungry but chooses not to eat. Increased appetite through drug use or medication is not considered a valid treatment for anorexia.*** Beyond all this, there are some strong reasons for keep marijuana illegal for the time being. First, legalization is likely to increase overall marijuana use. This is bad for the country. Even if we ignore the negative effects of marijuana, I think that we can all agree that recreational marijuana has little to no positive effects on a person. Increased availability of marijuana would not benefit the country overall. Second, we have yet to have a long-term test of the societal effect of legalizing marijuana. Yes, crime has decreased in Denver. However, the legalization is less than a year old. Before we should even consider the success or failure of this experiment, more time needs to pass. To base any action on the results we have seen thus far would be exceedingly premature. Finally - I grant that I am going out on a limb with this last one but I think that there is some truth here - it is unlikely the marijuana sellers will suddenly become model citizens. Selling marijuana is not a crime of convenience. To sell marijuana regularly requires a consistent choice. However, small time dealers will not be able to compete in the long run with major corporations that see the money making potential of selling marijuana. When these small time dealers find that they cannot compete it is unlikely that they will find honest work. They will more likely move on to a different form of illegal activity. There will always be people out there willing to ignore the law to make a quick buck. I want that person selling marijuana. While they are harming society, if they were not selling marijuana then they will most likely be doing something that is even worse. While recreation marijuana use might not be as destructive as some other kinds of illegal activities, on the whole legalizing recreational marijuana at this point in time would be the wrong choice for our country. *Source: http://www.psychologytoday.com... **Source: http://rt.com... ***Source: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org...",

I'm arguing in support of the legalization of the Cannabis sativa plant for any purpose the user wishes, medical or recreational. Marijuana was made illegal in the 1930's due to propaganda by Harry J. Anslinger [1]. It was seen as something only minorities used, but its use was spreading to America's youth. Because of his very conservative beliefs, he desired to eradicate it from America. The hemp industry was also a heated competitor with textile, paper, and oil industries [2]. For these reasons, its possession and use was made criminal. It has still not been proven that one single death in history has been caused by the direct or indirect effects of smoking this herb. It has many uses, and is perceived as harmless by many. I invite any contender to argue in support of the position that it should not be decriminalized and/or made legal.

            "conclusion": "Recreational Marijuana Legalization",
            "premise": "Recreational marijuana has many benefits in society today. It has gone through history as a drug grouped together with heroin, meth and cocaine. Grouping them together is highly unrealistic. There are many reasons that marijuana prohibition has done more harm than good and , if legalized, won't cause a massive American meltdown. I will start with 5 reasons and you may rebuttal any of them. 1) Marijuana's health benefits greatly outweigh the risks accociated with them. The main medical risk i hear about is the fact that when you smoke it it damages your lungs. There is truth to that. Inhaling a hot smoke can damage the lungs and can leave tar everywhere. However the reason that happens is because it's not filtered like it is in a cigarette. The inhaling hot smoke predicament can be solved by using a bong which filters out the tar using water leafing a fresh clean smoke and it cools down the smoke considerably. Besides you can get oils, patches, and edibles. Thus most of the dangerous part of marijuana on your health is stopped. (Source: http://www.truthonpot.com... ). That only leaves the mental health side of things. Sure it has an effect on you brain but in the studies done in 2011 on a large swath of people who had a control group and a group of heavy marijuana users what happened suprised the professors. The brain had a few changes that weren't substantial and didn't prove to be a dangerous change. It was just a small difference with no substancial threat. For their reaction times change. That can only be expected from a mind altering drug ( Source: http://m.jneurosci.org... ) it's a 2015 study. Plus the benefits are much greater. It all starts with the reduced risk of many cancers and dangerous diseases including Heart disease, osteoporosis, and can even helps the brain after a traumatic brain injury. http://www.tokeofthetown.com... 2) Marijuana doesn't cause an increase in violent crime. The claim that it does is wrong and has negitively been used to tarnish marijuana and say it's a danger to society. Use this article as an example http://www.iowamedicalmarijuana.org... 3) Marijuana can add money into the economy and add another trade with canada. The tax revenue in the first year of colorado alone was 63 million and is projected to grow up to 1 billion by 2016 (Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com... ) now multiply that by 50 to get a gross estimate of the amount of total revenue per year. Now isn't that a lot of money. Extra link: http://norml.org... 4) If the legalization were nationwide then the cartels would feel quite the smack. If texas and new mexico, their biggest target consumers, were to legalize it they would feel a huge decrease in revenue. About 17% and only in those 2 states and California. (Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com... ). 5) Keeping marijuana illegal is a waste of time and tax dollars it cost 14 billion a year to keep it illegal (Source: http://www.prohibitioncosts.org... ). Not only that, your life can be completely ruined. Even being arrested and not convicted is enough to put a damaging mark on a persons record. Even for having a gram or an empty bong on theirselves. Plus it adds so many people in prison for a non-violent crime. 88% of drug arrests were for normal people possessing small amounts of marijuana. (Source: https://www.aclu.org... ) Read this to see how damaging it really is for an arrest for possessing marijuana https://www.aclu.org... 6) I know i said 5 but i had to bring up another topic. The alcohol and tobacco vs. marijuana topic. I won't get so deep into this but i will add a link for you to read http://bgr.com... That source has a like to the actual study. Those are a few reasons that marijuana should be legal. You may provide your assertions",

            "premise": "\"1) Legalization of medical marijuana is a 'back door' for consumption of recreational marijuana, 2) Marijuana is a highly dangerous and addictive substance 3) Marijuana is dangerous\" Alright to start off, thank you Con for the response. But for the above argument, this is very incorrect. Marijuna is not very dangerous, there has been no known deaths directly tied to the consumption or use of Marijuna. Also Marijuna is not addictive. I have personally smoked marijuna, and I have never felt any of these \"side effects\" The only reason users feel a feeling paranoia is because they are afraid they are going to get caught and get in HUGE trouble, which is wrong, if the government is okay with the legalization of weed, then why does it carry such a high punishment for the use, and LEGAL distribution. Now I understand this if it is illegal, but most of the time, you go to jail longer for selling weed than killing someone. \" Marijuana is addictive. Marijuana is as addictive as alcohol[3]. Here are a few statistics proving the similarities: \"One study looked at 2,446 young adults between the ages of 14-24, and followed them for a period of 4 years. Approximately 10% met the criteria for marijuana addiction. 17% experienced withdrawal when they stopped using, 14% had difficulty controlling their use, and 13% continued to use even though they had health problems due to their marijuana use.\" 2nd Argument: for the above argument, again I have smoked weed, and sadly I to have Drank. And non of these were addictive to me. And also Marijuna doe snot raise the heart beat, it actually slows it down and makes you calm, it also doesn't kill braincells, it actually promotes cell growth, and it is used for medical use I was diagnosed with chronic migraines at the age of ten, after I tried weed, my headaches went away for quite a while, but as soon as I stopped, they came back. This concludes my rebuttals and contentions. Thank you. ALSO SORRY FOR NOT RESPONDING QUICKLY, I DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME IN CLASSES.",

            "premise": "Final rebuttals:(rebuttal for \"impacts americans\"): If you are so strongly against the use of this drug because it effects other people - please explain how you jumped to that conclusion. If you are trying to say that it impacts innocent bystanders on the road for example if the person is driving stoned, you have a point. HOWEVER, then why is alcohol legal? Alcohol kills more people on the road then marijuana does - so unless you are willing to give up drinks then do not be so willing to ban marijuana when it is actually LESS DANGEROUS then drugs ALREADY LEGAL.(rebuttal for \"over the counter\"): Techinaclly not, I reffered to over the counter drugs as prescription drugs for people that are ill or have issues. Marijuana does not fall into that category - legal or not. Marijuana does not kill people - it is IMPOSSIBLE to die from taking it yourself because it is IMPOSSIBLE to consume an overdose. So before you jump conclusions - prove to the viewers of this debate that marijuana is \"utilized as a prescription drug,\" because it is not.(rebuttal for \"tax\"): But how does what you presented have anything to do with this debate? It does not matter than some Americans are not fond of taxes because that is just the way our economy works - we buy something, we are taxed. That is COMPLETELY different subject, you might as well want to debate if we should ban taxes or not if you want to pull that card. There will be drug dealers either way - with marijuana legal or not legal. There will always be some type of drug that is not allowed and people sell illegally. That is just the world we live in - of course drug dealers are continuing to go behind the backs of our government. Becausr that is just what they do - wheither this drug is legal or not, there will always be a black market and illegal sales. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you will not make that argument again in a future debate.(rebuttal for \"rehabilitation\"): I will not take back what I have stated because it does not contradict any of my arguments. America is suppost to be LAND OF THE FREE, A FREE COUNTRY. One of our freedoms is to CHOOSE what we want to do with OUR OWN BODIES. Why should the government try to stop us from making decisions that could effect us - they should just let us face the consequences. And even though America wants to protect its citizens - there are some things the country can just not protect us from - and drugs are one of them. If someone is addicted to a certain drug, he/she will find a way to get that drug weither it is legal or not legal - that is just the way it is. And currently you are not addressing the people who are already addicted to illegal drugs - making the drug legal or harder to get will NOT STOP THEM. If someone is addicted, they will do ANYTHING to obtain their craving/needs. So why go through all the trouble when the people with just get what they want in the end? It is a waste of time and money to keep funding people to stop others from consuming or selling / having possesion of the drug/s.(rebuttal for \"accessibility\"): I will like to include a quote from J. Wesley Boyd, Harvard University, he answered the question: If marijuana is legalized, will addiction rates rise. Here was a PROFFESSIONAL'S responce: \"I believe the answer is no. Despite these legitimate concerns, thus far there are no compelling data to suggest that drug use has increased in Colorado where recreational cannabis is currently legal. Even though it\u2019s only recently that Colorado legalized marijuana, I don\u2019t expect this to change going forward.\"(Thank you for your kind words. I appreciate the effort you put into this debate as well).",

C1-Costs The War on Drugs has cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, money which could be better spent on infastrucutre, debt repayment, etc. (1) C2-Right to Liberty In the Declaration of Independence it states that one unalienable right is the right to liberty. That means people should be free to pursue their own choices without restriction from any government or other person. For this reason, people should be allowed to smoke marijuana without fear of being punished. Realistically, many things many people do every day, such as eat fast food, are not good whatsoever, yet they have the right to do so. C3-Unviolent Crime Arresting someone for marijuana is using the law, which is meant to protect people from others, to arrest someone from making a choice which does not directly harm anyone else. R1-Health The health argument is irrelevent. Something cannot be illegal, simply because it is unhealthy. It doesn't harm anyone else, and people have the right to do what they want as long as they are not harming others. In fact, it is not even conclusive it is bad. Some studies have found marijuana does not effect teh brain. (2) 1-http://www.drugsense.org... 2-http://www.iflscience.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "Decriminalizing recreational marijuana.",
            "conclusion": "Decriminalizing recreational marijuana.",
            "premise": "I thank Con for posting an intriguing argument against the decriminalization of marijuana for recreational purposes. Before I make my arguments, however, I am going to define a few terms. I will use Oxford Online Dictionaries. Decriminalize: cease to treat (something) as illegal or as a criminal offence [1] Marijuana: cannabis, especially as smoked in cigarettes [2] Cannabis: a dried preparation of the flowering tops or other parts of the cannabis plant, or a resinous extract of it, used (generally illegally) as a psychotropic drug, chiefly in cigarettes. [3] Now, let\u2019s start. There are multiple reasons why marijuana, for recreational purposes, should be decriminalized. My first argument, ironically, is supported by my opponent\u2019s only argument in the last round; that consumption of marijuana, for recreational purposes, is detrimental to the consumer\u2019s health. I argue that a result of decriminalizing marijuana, coupled with emphasizing the possibility of therapy for drug takers (instead of them being sent to jail), would lead to either less people consuming the drug, or no difference in the amount of people consuming the drug. This was similar the policy that Portugal implemented several years ago. The neuroscience journalist Maia Szalavitz, in an article written for Time Magazine writes: \u201cCompared to the European Union and the U.S., Portugal's drug use numbers are impressive. Following decriminalization, Portugal had the lowest rate of lifetime marijuana use in people over 15 in the E.U.: 10%. The most comparable figure in America is in people over 12: 39.8%. Proportionally, more Americans have used cocaine than Portuguese have used marijuana.\u201d [4] Peter Reuter, of the University of Maryland says: \u201cDrug decriminalization did reach its primary goal in Portugal, and it did not lead to Lisbon being a drug tourist destination. [5] The lawyer Glenn Greenwald adds: \u201cJudging by every metric, decriminalization in Portugal has been a resounding success. It has enabled the Portuguese government to manage and control the drug problem far better than virtually every other Western country does.\u201d [6] Another country that has decriminalized marijuana is the Netherlands. Even though it\u2019s marijuana/drug policy is not as successful as Portugal\u2019s, it is still quite successful, as the Netherlands Ministry of Health Explains: \u201c\"It has been demonstrated that the more or less free sale of [marijuana] for personal use in the Netherlands has not given rise to levels of use significantly higher than in countries which pursue a highly repressive policy.\" [7] A report written by Donnelly et.al also suggests that marijuana liberalization does not increase intake of the drug. They write: \u201cThere is no evidence to date that the CEN [decriminalization] system ... Has increased levels of regular cannabis use, or rates of experimentation among young adults. These results are broadly in accord with our earlier analysis of trends in cannabis use in Australia. ...They are also consistent with the results of similar analyses in the United States and the Netherlands.\" [8] Decriminalizing marijuana would also ensure that money is not wasted on the legal and criminal systems. According to a study by King and Mauer, the United States currently spends a significant amount of money (4 billion dollars) dedicated to minor offenses, such as possession, and $2.1 billion on the police enforcing marijuana laws. [9] Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard, makes a similar point. In his paper \u201cThe Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Legalization in Massachusetts\u201d he writes that prohibition of marijuana in Massachusetts results in: \u201c120.6 million per year in government expenditure on criminal justice enforcement.\u201d [10] Furthermore, a study by Scott Bates finds that in Alaska, $25-30 million dollars were used for enforcing marijuana prohibition laws alone! [11] James D. Austin, commenting on the study writes: \u201ca net swing of $35 - $50 million per year would appear in the state\u2019s coffers if marijuana were decriminalized\u201d [12] As we have seen above, decriminalizing marijuana does not increase its usage, so surely, the money used for enforcement of laws, and throughout the criminal justice system is a waste of money; money that can be used for other, more pressing purposes, such as education, health, and social programmes.

            "conclusion": "Decriminalizing recreational marijuana.",
            "premise": "In the Second Round, I provided two strong reasons why marijuana should be decriminalized for recreational purposes; one of which directly refutes my opponent\u2019s only argument in his first round. My opponent has not provided a reasonable response to either of them. In the previous round, he attempts to critique my second argument. He claims that because \u2018the global economy is going rather well,\u2019 there is no need to decriminalize marijuana to ensure that not so much money is wasted on criminal and legal systems, especially for minor offenses. Such a response completely misses the point for, it is completely irrelevant whether the global economy is going well or not. I am arguing that the United States of America is wasting an inane amount of money on criminal and legal systems, dedicated to minor offenses, and that decriminalizing marijuana would ensure such money can be better spent, on more pressing issues. My opponent has not even responded to my argument that decriminalizing marijuana does not increase its usage, and in some instances, lead to a decrease. In this round, I argue that the prohibition of marijuana would be irrational, given that its effects overall would be less harmful, as compared to tobacco smoking, or drinking alcohol. The assertion that marijuana is less harmful than tobacco has been demonstrated in several ways. I list just 2. First, a study lead by Mark J. Pletcher of University of California, San Francisco, published in the Journal of American Medical Association shows that marijuana is less damaging to the lungs than tobacco. [1] According to Pletcher: \u201cWe found exactly what we thought we would find in relation to tobacco exposure: a consistent loss of lung function with increasing exposure. We were, however, surprised to found such a different pattern of association with marijuana exposure.\u201d [2] Leland Kim, also of the University of California, San Francisco confirms this: \u201clow to moderate use of marijuana is less harmful to the users\u2019 lungs than exposure to tobacco.\u201d[3] Secondly, marijuana is less addictive than tobacco. Only 9% of marijuana consumers develop a serious addiction. Conversely, 32% of tobacco users develop a serious addiction, more than 3 times than marijuana consumers! As the psychologist Jann Gumbiner writes: \u201c\u2026.is marijuana addictive? For most people, no. About 10% of recreational users will develop problems serve enough to impair their work and relationships.\u201d [4] Marijuana is also less harmful than alcohol, both short-term and long-term. On a short term basis, there is no doubt that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol. According to Ruben Baler, of the National Institute of Drug Abuse: \u201cYou can die binge drinking five minutes after you have been exposed to alcohol. This isn\u2019t going to happen with marijuana.\u201d [5] On a long term basis, there is even less doubt that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol. First, alcohol is more detrimental to liver health than marijuana. Consumption of marijuana has little effect on the liver. Contrary to this, consumption of alcohol has a massive effect on the liver. According to the American Liver Foundation, consumption of alcohol over time can cause three major diseases: fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis. [6] Alcoholic hepatitis is can be an extremely serious disease, for it can lead to \u201cserious complications including liver failure and death.\u201d Alcoholic cirrhosis is even more serious, for it \u201ccannot be reversed and can cause liver failure.\u201d [7] Alcohol is also more detrimental when it comes to kidneys. Although marijuana has little on the kidney , alcohol can cause kidney failure through raising blood pressure. Murray Epstein, in his paper \u2018Alcohol\u2019s Impact on Kidney Function\u2019 writes in his conclusion: \u201c\u2026alcohol consumption can have profound negative effects on the kidney and their function in maintain the body\u2019s fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance, leaving alcoholic people vulnerable to a host of kidney-related health problems.\u201d [8] Furthermore, alcohol is linked to a wide variety of cancers. As a matter of fact, 3.5% of cancer deaths can be linked to the consumption of alcohol. However, there is virtually link between marijuana and cancer! Saferchoice.org notes this: \u201cAlcohol use is associated with a wide variety of cancers, including cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, lungs, pancreas, liver and prostate. Marijuana use has not been conclusively associated with any form of cancer. In fact, one study recently contradicted the long-time government claim that marijuana use is associated with head and neck cancers. If found that marijuana use actually reduced the likelihood of head and neck cancer.\u201d [9] It has been asserted, however, that marijuana is associated with lung cancer. However, this has now shown to be erroneous. The journalist Joseph Brownstein demonstrates this: \u201c\u2026 while early studies showed some evidence linking marijuana to lung cancer, subsequent studies have debunked that associating. Baler [researcher] it\u2019s unclear why marijuana smoke does not have the same result as tobacco smoke on the lungs, but [perhaps] some beneficial compounds in the marijuana smoke cancel out the ill effects.\u201d [10] This, perhaps is the most telling graph, which summarises the case I have argued above: [11] In conclusion, I have demonstrated that marijuana is less harmful than both tobacco and alcohol. However, how is it fair that marijuana but illegal in almost every American State, as compared to tobacco and alcohol, which are only regulated? Surely, now there is no rational basis for the oppressive prohibition, and complete banning of marijuana for recreational purposes. [1] http://jama.jamanetwork.com... [2], [3] https://www.ucsf.edu...

            "discussionTitle": "Should marijuana be legalized",
            "conclusion": "Should marijuana be legalized",
            "premise": "Observation: We are arguing if something should or should not be legal. It is important to note what it is we are not arguing. For example, we are not arguing what punishments are or are not justified. Likewise, we are not arguing about overcrowded prisons, or mandatory minimums, these are not relevant topics to the resolution. Many who argue about marijuana often argue that it should be decriminalized. Again, while an interesting and important topic it is not directly related to this debate. For example, It is feasible to argue, as many do, that something should be illegal and decriminalized, or to argue for less stringent punishments for violations. Now that we have covered what is not being debated, we can get to the core issue. This debate rests solely on the question of if Marijuana should be legalized. I will present my argument in two parts. The first being that the U.S. Government ought to protect citizens from Marijuana, and the second, that the Government protects citizens through the rule of law. By arguing such it will become clear that the U.S. Government should not legalize recreational marijuana. Argument Part 1: The Government ought to protect citizens from Marijuana. My case here is quite simple (P = Premise, C = Conclusion) P1: The U.S. government ought to protect citizens from harm. P2: Citizens can be and are harmed by Marijuana C: The U.S. Government ought to protect citizens from Marijuana. P1: The U.S. Government ought to protect citizens from harm To understand what the government ought to do it is important to understand the Role of government. The supreme Law of the U.S. is the Constitution. The authors included a preamble that summarized the core values and purpose of Government. Some of those values and goals listed were \u201cto form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare\u2026.\u201d Such governments could only accomplish these goals and realize their purpose if citizens are protected from harm. There can be no justice, tranquility, general welfare etc. if citizens are subject to harm that the government could reasonably prevent. That is to say Governments ought to protect their citizens from harm. P2: Citizens can be and are harmed by Marijuana From the U.S. government website devoted to facts about drugs, we read that marijuana can alter the user\u2019s sense and mood. It can impair body movement, alter memory, and decrease the ability to problem solve. It is known to affected brain development negatively. It can cause breathing problems, hallucinations, and paranoia. It can cause anxiety, depression, and has been shown to induce suicidal thoughts in teens. (1) Talk about harm. It is not a stretch to assume that someone who\u2019s mood is altered, having hallucinations, is paranoid, and having suicidal thoughts poses a threat to themselves and others. One such example was given in the New York Times. \"There is the Denver man who, hours after buying a package of marijuana-infused Karma Kandy from one of Colorado\u2019s new recreational marijuana shops, (where marijuana has recently been made legal.) began raving about the end of the world and then pulled a handgun from the family safe and killed his wife, the authorities say.\"[2] You tell me, Is this Tranquility? A more perfect union? Was justice established Etc\u2026 Is this man\u2019s family more safe? The harm posed by Marijuana is not hypothetical. Legalizing a drug does not remove the harms inherent to that drug. Thus we see that Citizens can be and often are harmed by Marijuana in the U.S. Conclusion of Part 1: As P1 and P2 are affirmed that the U.S. government ought to protect citizens from harm and that Citizens can and often are harmed by Marijuana it follows logically that the U.S. Government ought to protect citizens from Marijuana. Argument Part 2: The Government protects citizens through the rule of law. How does a government \u201cform a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility\u2026 , promote the general Welfare\u2026.?\u201d Simple; through the rule of law. Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law, including law makers themselves. Put another way. The Government is subject to law as are citizens of this nation. How is it that the government can protect citizens from the harm of marijuana as we have established it should if the laws that make this protection possible are repealed? Simply put it cannot. If Recreational Marijuana is legalized the government cannot fill its duty. Governments ought to protect citizens from Marijuana. To do this it becomes necessary for the law to enable the government to do so. Marijuana is harmful and is thus rightly outlawed. Conclusion: It has become clear that; 1: The U.S. Government ought to protect citizens from Marijuana. How is that done? 2: The Government protects citizens through the rule of law. From these two points it logically follows that; C: The Government through the rule of Law should protect Citizens from Marijuana. This is why I am opposed to the resolution; that is to say that the U.S. Government should not legalize recreational marijuana. Thanks for watching please Vote Con!

            "premise": "For my final round I will affirm my own case and attempt to group the responses to Con\u2019s rebuttals within my contentions. Contentions 1. Freedom of autonomy By taking an idealist interpretation of Mill\u2019s quote, Con\u2019s plan would result in absurdities such as banning cars, Con does not respond to this problem. I take a position of a *realist* interpretation of the quote, as does the U.S government. Both me and the U.S government understand the differences between *direct harms* and *potential harms*. That\u2019s why murder is illegal (results in a direct harm), and smoking tobacco isn\u2019t illegal (potentially harmful). I am not claiming that the harms of marijuana aren\u2019t real or don\u2019t exist, I\u2019m simply stating they could be a *potential* problem depending on the user. This sort of statement can\u2019t be used against laws that prohibit murder though, because murder will *always* harm someone regardless of the user. Like having a glass of scotch at night, smoking a bowl of marijuana does not guarantee any specific harm-to-others will occur. Even if it did, the status quo already permits these harm-to-others, and unless Con demonstrates that marijuana possess a greater harm-to-others than alcohol, it is *illogical* to say marijuana shouldn\u2019t be legal. This means Con *must* refute my chart I have provided in R2. (This contention stands so long as I win my \u201cLow Level of Harm to Self and Others\u201d contention, something which is standing extremely strong as of R4.) 2. Low level of harm to others. So far Con has chosen not to address my chart. I can only conclude that he agrees with it and that alcohol is significantly more of a net-detriment to its users and those around them. This alone is overwhelming justification for the legalization of marijuana. Con does make an attempt to *cherry pick* a case in which someone had bought marijuana infused candies and hour later ends up murdering his wife However his very source betrays him a paragraph or two down saying: \u201cThe vast majority of the state\u2019s medical and recreational marijuana stores are living up to stringent state rules, they say. The stores have sold marijuana to hundreds of thousands of customers without incident.\u201d [1] This case is not the rule, it is the *exception*. My entire purpose of my second contention is to demonstrate that if we were to weigh the risks of all the *potential harms* on a scale, alcohol would *drastically* weigh more. The chart I provided takes into consideration the cases like the one he provided and adds into the \u201charm to others\u201d bar. Which as we can see is much large than that of marijuana. This contention has in *no way* been refuted. 3. Benefits from Regulation I have thus far proven that the benefits of legalizing marijuana would *greatly* outweigh is harms, in the forms of freedom, taxation, safety, and job creation. Con\u2019s job was to demonstrate that the potential harms outweighed these benefits, he has yet to show they may possibly do this. In his rebuttals he suggests that neither alcohol nor tobacco should be legal because their potential harms apparently outweigh their benefits, but this is a *bare assertion*. The U.S federal government has already recognized that freedom and taxation, along with the slew of other benefits outweigh these \u201c1 in 10 deaths among working-age adults\u201d that alcohol potentially causes. This is the status quo. Even though I personally also find these potential harms to be rather great, the harms of marijuana simply cannot begin to be weighed in comparison. It\u2019s amusing that Con would bring up how the status quo allows for a possible risk of losing about 500,000 people *every year* from tobacco. This only validates my position even more! The chart below demonstrate the staggering difference between the deaths from tobacco and that of marijuana. [2] As we can see, if the U.S federal government is willing to allow this many casualties from these substances, it is exceedingly obvious they would believe that a substance like marijuana would have its benefits outweigh its harms. Conclusion: I have shown that marijuana possess a lower level of potential harm than any of the current legal substances. Not only that, but whatever miniscule harm that was there is *greatly* outweighed by the benefits of freedom, taxation, safety, and job creation. This is all excellent justification that shows that recreational marijuana should be legalize. [1] http://www.nytimes.com... [2] http://www.vox.com...",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his response. Marijuana drug (cannabis): dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant,usedforitseuphoriceffects,used in cigaretteformasanarcoticor hallucinogen. Moving on to my opponent\u2019s arguments: R1: \u201cI think marijuana should be legal because it has an effect like alcohol and it better health wise than cigarettes. I will further my argument in the next round\u201d R2: \u201cmarijuana should be legal because it is not bad for you at all. it can not kill you and in some cases is good for you\u201d My opponent gave no evidence to support his claims that it has better effects like alcohol and more healthy than cigarettes. He also states that\u2019s it\u2019s not bad for all and that it cannot kill you. These arguments may be considered invalid or unreliable, and nevertheless, I\u2019m here to refute these contentions. P1: Marijuana has health risks Marijuana can lead to death cases, for instance, Thomas Geller, an Associate Professor of Child Neurology at the Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center had to discuss a case on 3 deaths, he is what he wrote in an article in April 2004: \"Each of the 3 cannabis-associated cases of cerebellar infarction was confirmed by biopsy (1 case) or necropsy (2 cases)... Brainstem compromise caused by cerebella and cerebral edema led to death in the 2 fatal cases.\" {http://pediatrics.aappublications.org... (I will address some arguments there if contested)}. Next, marijuana can be emotionally and mentally addictive, which can lead to serious problems. Using this drug will place the person on a euphoric state, which can affect the person\u2019s emotions and eventually taking control of them. So basically, if someone is depressed, they can take this drug and feel good again, but the bad part is that once they feel depressed again, it will lead the user to use again and again which results to addiction. Marijuana kills brain cells, and can lead the person to laziness and may eventually negatively change or destroy a person\u2019s life. Drug addiction via recreational use can lead abuse, which is not good. {http://www.spencerrecovery.com...} Marijuana also damages the immune system, and studies also suggest that using marijuana habitually may damage the cells in the bronchial passages which protect the body against inhaled microorganisms and reduce the ability of the immune cells in the lungs to fight bacteria off. {http://cyber.law.harvard.edu...} There are more arguments supporting marijuana\u2019s negative effects on health, (it can even lead to birth problems), I will address them later if contested, but for now, this is enough to assume that marijuana can be a risk to health that can result to serious problems or even death. P2: Legalization will increase marijuana consumers If we legalize marijuana, it will surely make them more obtainable and affordable to users and even minors, and as I\u2019ve argued, once it\u2019s accessible, it can lead to bad effects, which is undesirable to society, but if we do not regulate such drug use, we can deter the use and reduce them. P3: Even if legalized, it can still lead to crime We can assume that drug users are more likely to commit crime, since they use marijuana to take out the depression of their problems (i.e.: in need of money), so they rob a store or bank. More violent crimes can even occur while the perpetrator is high on drugs. These are my arguments for now, we can surely assume that marijuana use sure have more risks than its benefits, the harms outweigh the advantages. Thanks, I await my PRO\u2019s response.",

Marijuana dependency affects more teenagers than all other drug dependencies combined, and the number of teenagers in rehab for marijuana dependency is larger than any other drug group and costs taxpayers millions http://www.teendrugabuse.us... http://www.healthieryou.com... http://www.drugabuse.gov... http://www.well.com... If Marijuana was legalized, then access to the drug for teenagers would mushroom, along with the number of cases of teenage dependency and addictions to the drug. 2) Chemicals Marijuana is known for having chemicals that alter the mind and create a euphoria for the smoker, however marijuana also contains chemicals that slows reaction time, alters how the brain process information, degrades decision making, etc. Marijuana also contains carcinogens that can cause cancer and severe lung damage over long periods of time. Legalizing marijuana. http://www.sciencedirect.com... http://www.jstor.org... http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org... Legalizing Marijuana would allow millions of people to unwillingly expose themselves to very harmful drugs that causes numerous health complications such as lung cancer in the far future while in the short term future decision making skills and mental healthiness deteriorate. 3) Lethal nature of Marijuana Every supporter of Marijuana legalization will hide behind the weak argument that marijuana doesnt kill. Those people are only looking at the fact that it is impossible to overdose on Marijuana, however they completely ignore how Marijuana can cause many types of cancers since many chemicals within marijuana are carcinogenic. Apart from causing death by cancer, marijuana's alteration and degradation of brain functionality plays a role in other common accidents, mostly car accidents where decreased reactionary times to events going on on the roads end in fatalities. On the other hand, the current drug trade involving marijuana causes dozens of deaths and has even triggered small scale civil wars in certain countries (Columbia and Mexico). Marijuana does kill people, either by the long term health damage it triggers or through gang violence. 4) Saturation of the market. People who support the Profusion Of Toxic, Heavy Euphoria Agents + Drugs....... or \"P.O.T.H.E.A.D.'s\" for short........... Dont realize that if euphoria agents and drugs such as marijuana are legalized then teenagers and those not old enough to legally smoke the drug would have far greater access to smoking the drug either recreationally or heavily are now much more at risk for developing either a dependency on the drug or develop health complications caused by marijuana chemicals, carcinogens, and mind-altering agents within marijuana. Legalizing marijuana is a bad idea if you look at it through the health complications it would unleash on this massive nation of 350 million people. Marijuana already causes health complications in millions of people while the drug is illegal, making it legal would expose many more people to the health complications brought about by marijuana now that it would be far more accessible to millions of people who may or may not be of legal age...",

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's). I will begin by presenting all my points and their subset points for legalization. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose (if you don't however, I will assume you either acknowledge/agree with my point or cannot refute it). I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. If you do not understand anything I say, simply ask and I will clarify, no need to be rude.My Points1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization.a) Marijuana is not addictive.b) It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuanac) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true.d) The logic of the gateway theory is fundamentally flawed and therefore it cannot be truee) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. calmness, changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user (although it would be anyway).f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreasedg) Assuming it is true that marijuana's psychoactive potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged.2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization.a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the countryb)The medical benefits (known and to be known) of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for manyc) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, reducing drugged driving)d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.e) Gang violence and crime revolving around marijuana will be greatly decreased.f) Legalization's resulting industry would create jobs and generally benefit the national economy.g) Marijuana education would be healthy for both youth and adults (because now the only education is lies unless you dig deeper).3.Marijuana Prohibition altogether is a colossal failure.a)The whole purpose of cannabis prohibition is to prevent use nationwide, yet, cannabis use is still very prevalent.b)Because of point a, the adverse societal effects of marijuana (however minuscule) are in effect despite it's prohibition, ergo prohibition is purposeless.c)marijuana prohibition is exactly the same as the 20's alcohol prohibition save for the failure to end it.4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for the nation.a) Proof of the government's failure to do this is how a constitutional amendment was needed to sign alcohol prohibition into law (and is now being used to prohibit marijuana). This means that the views/values this nation was built on differ from those that allow/support prohibition.",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana\\Cannabis should be legalised for both medical and recreational purposes in the U.S.",
            "premise": "I thank Wush for this debate. == Definitions == Cannabis\\ Marijuana: Cannabis, also known as marijuana, marihuana, among many other names, refers to any number of preparations of the Cannabis plant intended for use as a psychoactive drug. [1] Recreational: A pastime, diversion, exercise, or other resource affording relaxation and enjoyment. [2] Medical: Curative; medicinal; therapeutic. [3] Legalised: To make legal [4] U.S.: http://en.wikipedia.org... == PRO Arguments == --- Harm of Marijuana --- There has so far been no deaths recorded that directly result from the use of Marijuana, and there has been no recoded deaths in the U.S., and when stacked up against other products, Marijuana is relatively harmless [5]. Indeed, unlike many other substances, it is extremely hard to die from the use of Marijuana. As noted on the below article: \"A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.\" [5] We can therefore conclude that it is extremely hard to technically kill oneself solely through the use of Marijuana. Also, Marijuana does not have any detrimental long term effects on a person health and mortality. As noted in two studies [6], the users of Marijuana were far less likely to have shorter life spans. The only noted possible health effect of Marijuana is a increase in heart attacks 1 hour after smoking Marijuana. This is however an extremely rare risk, given that it only occurs in .2% of all heart attacks [6], of which would have to occur within the first hour of Marijuana consumption, an extremely rare risk indeed. However, if one was concerned with the increase in heart attacks, there would be substances with a far greater plausibility of increasing the risk of heart attacks in the long term, such as Fast Foods [7]. We can conclude from this Marijuana is a therefore a substance which, while it has risks, is safe. One must consider that while Marijuana has negative effects, every product has risks and negative effects. --- Benefits of Marijuana --- While we know the are very few extremely low chance risks involved with the use of Marijuana, there are many benefits to it use, most, if not all, of which are medical. There is a list as long as my arm of illnesses treated by Medical Marijuana [8], but some illnesses include various cancer (Testicular, Prostate, Skin), forms of Hepatitis, Diabetes related illnesses and dependence illnesses. It is also used to stop the build-up of Alzheimers Disease [9], reduces the growth of breast cancer cells [10] and stimulating appetite in HIV\\AIDS patients [11]. It is clear there are a large number of medical benefits from the use of Medical Marijuana. --- Individual Choice --- Currently, the use of Marijuana is a victimless crime, that is to say, no one is harmed in the consumption of Marijuana other than the consumer, who has willingly consumed the Marijuana by choice. Even should there be mounds of evidence suggesting Marijuana is extremely harmful to consume, it is still the personal choice of the individual to consume it and suffer any negative effects. There is no need for the government to impose themselves in people's lives unless they are preventing them from harming another person directly, which is why people would obviously not be allowed smoke Marijuana and drive a car, or operate machinery. --- Benefits of Legalisation --- As it stands, the US government spends a huge amount of money to suppress the use of Marijuana. It is estimated that the US could gain $14,878,200,000+ by legalising and taxing the sale of Marijuana [12]. It is clear that the US economy would benefit from the legalisation of Marijuana through the creation of jobs. The War on Marijuana is also ineffective, as most of the arrests (89%) are possession of Marijuana, not distribution [12]. Furthermore, it would reduce the amount of funding available for criminal gangs, as drugs trading is a huge source of income for them. This would reduce criminal activity and have a benefit to society. --- Conclusion --- From my argument we can conclude that Marijuana has very few real risks associated with its use, and has multiple uses as a treatment. Furthermore, the use of Marijuana is one which only carries risks for the user once used on private property, and furthermore, it is uneconomical to attempt to enforce a prohibition of Marijuana. Seeing as Marijuana has medical benefits, it should to be legalised for medical purposes. Furthermore, as it is a victimless crime and has few risks, it should be legalised for recreational usage.

            "discussionTitle": "Marijuana Should Be Legalized.",
            "conclusion": "Marijuana Should Be Legalized.",
            "premise": "These are my top 10 reasons on why marijuana should be legalized. 10. Prohibition has failed to control the use and domestic production of marijuana. The government has tried to use criminal penalties to prevent marijuana use for over 75 years and yet: marijuana is now used by over 25 million people annually, cannabis is currently the largest cash crop in the United States, and marijuana is grown all over the planet. Claims that marijuana prohibition is a successful policy are ludicrous and unsupported by the facts, and the idea that marijuana will soon be eliminated from America and the rest of the world is a ridiculous fantasy. 9. Arrests for marijuana possession disproportionately affect blacks and Hispanics and reinforce the perception that law enforcement is biased and prejudiced against minorities. African-Americans account for approximately 13% of the population of the United States and about 13.5% of annual marijuana users, however, blacks also account for 26% of all marijuana arrests. Recent studies have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics account for the majority of marijuana possession arrests in New York City, primarily for smoking marijuana in public view. Law enforcement has failed to demonstrate that marijuana laws can be enforced fairly without regard to race; far too often minorities are arrested for marijuana use while white/non-Hispanic Americans face a much lower risk of arrest. 8. A regulated, legal market in marijuana would reduce marijuana sales and use among teenagers, as well as reduce their exposure to other drugs in the illegal market. The illegality of marijuana makes it more valuable than if it were legal, providing opportunities for teenagers to make easy money selling it to their friends. If the excessive profits for marijuana sales were ended through legalization there would be less incentive for teens to sell it to one another. Teenage use of alcohol and tobacco remain serious public health problems even though those drugs are legal for adults, however, the availability of alcohol and tobacco is not made even more widespread by providing kids with economic incentives to sell either one to their friends and peers. 7. Legalized marijuana would reduce the flow of money from the American economy to international criminal gangs. Marijuana's illegality makes foreign cultivation and smuggling to the United States extremely profitable, sending billions of dollars overseas in an underground economy while diverting funds from productive economic development. 6. Marijuana's legalization would simplify the development of hemp as a valuable and diverse agricultural crop in the United States, including its development as a new bio-fuel to reduce carbon emissions. Canada and European countries have managed to support legal hemp cultivation without legalizing marijuana, but in the United States opposition to legal marijuana remains the biggest obstacle to development of industrial hemp as a valuable agricultural commodity. As US energy policy continues to embrace and promote the development of bio-fuels as an alternative to oil dependency and a way to reduce carbon emissions, it is all the more important to develop industrial hemp as a bio-fuel source - especially since use of hemp stalks as a fuel source will not increase demand and prices for food, such as corn. Legalization of marijuana will greatly simplify the regulatory burden on prospective hemp cultivation in the United States. 5. Prohibition is based on lies and disinformation. Justification of marijuana's illegality increasingly requires distortions and selective uses of the scientific record, causing harm to the credibility of teachers, law enforcement officials, and scientists throughout the country. The dangers of marijuana use have been exaggerated for almost a century and the modern scientific record does not support the reefer madness predictions of the past and present. Many claims of marijuana's danger are based on old 20th century prejudices that originated in a time when science was uncertain how marijuana produced its characteristic effects. Since the cannabinoid receptor system was discovered in the late 1980s these hysterical concerns about marijuana's dangerousness have not been confirmed with modern research. Everyone agrees that marijuana, or any other drug use such as alcohol or tobacco use, is not for children. Nonetheless, adults have demonstrated over the last several decades that marijuana can be used moderately without harmful impacts to the individual or society. 4. Marijuana is not a lethal drug and is safer than alcohol. It is established scientific fact that marijuana is not toxic to humans; marijuana overdoses are nearly impossible, and marijuana is not nearly as addictive as alcohol or tobacco. It is unfair and unjust to treat marijuana users more harshly under the law than the users of alcohol or tobacco. 3. Marijuana is too expensive for our justice system and should instead be taxed to support beneficial government programs. Law enforcement has more important responsibilities than arresting 750,000 individuals a year for marijuana possession, especially given the additional justice costs of disposing of each of these cases. Marijuana arrests make justice more expensive and less efficient in the United States, wasting jail space, clogging up court systems, and diverting time of police, attorneys, judges, and corrections officials away from violent crime, the sexual abuse of children, and terrorism. Furthermore, taxation of marijuana can provide needed and generous funding of many important criminal justice and social programs. 2. Marijuana use has positive attributes, such as its medical value and use as a recreational drug with relatively mild side effects. Many people use marijuana because they have made an informed decision that it is good for them, especially Americans suffering from a variety of serious ailments. Marijuana provides relief from pain, nausea, spasticity, and other symptoms for many individuals who have not been treated successfully with conventional medications. Many American adults prefer marijuana to the use of alcohol as a mild and moderate way to relax. Americans use marijuana because they choose to, and one of the reasons for that choice is their personal observation that the drug has a relatively low dependence liability and easy-to-manage side effects. Most marijuana users develop tolerance to many of marijuana's side effects, and those who do not, choose to stop using the drug. Marijuana use is the result of informed consent in which individuals have decided that the benefits of use outweigh the risks, especially since, for most Americans, the greatest risk of using marijuana is the relatively low risk of arrest. 1. Marijuana users are determined to stand up to the injustice of marijuana probation and accomplish legalization, no matter how long or what it takes to succeed. Despite the threat of arrests and a variety of other punishments and sanctions marijuana users have persisted in their support for legalization for over a generation. They refuse to give up their long quest for justice because they believe in the fundamental values of American society. Prohibition has failed to silence marijuana users despite its best attempts over the last generation. The issue of marijuana's legalization is a persistent issue that, like marijuana, will simply not go away. Marijuana will be legalized because marijuana users will continue to fight for it until they succeed.",

            "conclusion": "Regulated/taxed recreational marijuana legal over the age of 25 & any age for validated medical use",
            "premise": "I am for the legalization of recreational & medical marijuana ONLY under strict & enforced regulations and laws. I am looking for an opponent that can lay an opposite view based on science & statistics, though I understand some may use religious views and I am happy to debate those as well. I will lay out some ideas of laws/policies pertaining to regulating, taxing, and criminal/civil consequences of violations of both recreational & medical marijuana. I will cite sources in my comments. I will first address legal age & recreational use. 1) The legal minimum age for recreational marijuana set at 25 ; there is no minimum age for medical marijuana as prescribed and supervised by a licensed and registered medical doctor after recommendations from 3 separate licensed and registered doctors. Why ? The human brain has been scientifically proven using brain scans that it has not fully formed until between the age of 20-25. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex is not yet fully developed. It's the part of the brain that helps you to inhibit impulses and to plan and organize your behavior to reach a goal. It also helps you understand the future consequences of present and past actions. Another part of the brain that is still forming is the brain's reward system that becomes highly active right around the time of puberty & then gradually levels out about it reaches around age 25. That makes adolescents/teens more inclined to engage in uncertain situations & actions in order to seek out and try to find whether there might be a possibility of gaining something from those situations/actions, whether pleasurable, monetary, or socially. As that MEDICAL marijuana use is prescribed by a licensed and registered medical doctor under recommendation from 3 other doctors & own medical knowledge after extensive testing and evaluation of the patient in question, the ramifications & possible side effects of marijuana use by a person under the age of 25 has been evaluated by knowledgeable ADULTS & judged that the benefits to the patients health & general wellbeing out ways the cons of its use. 2) Private homegrown marijuana - A: must be registered in the county of residence with the marijuana regulatory county office B: can not grow from seeds (a) must buy transplants from licensed retailer (b) strains must have low THC and high CBD C: limit of 4 plants total at any time per household D: homes with minors and/or those under the age of 25 are excluded from home growing E: growing outside a lockable & secure structure ( ex -homes, greenhouses, sheds, shipping containers) is illegal F: must commit and be open to both bi-monthly and random testing and inspection by licensed and regulated inspectors for violations & health/safety laws G: required to have 24hr video surveillance w/ daily downloads to a marijuana regulatory office - minimum number of cameras upon discretion of registrar and/or inspector 3) Commercial growers - A: must be licensed in the county of business, subject to all state and federal taxes, deductions, and benefits with the county marijuana regulatory office B: Must grow inventory in a lockable and secure structure (ex-warehouse, commercial greenhouse) C: limit of 6 flowering/budding plants & 10 transplants per registered resident within 20 miles D: those between the age 16- 25 are excluded from growing/manufacturing/sales area & all employees are subjected to random drug tests E: growing outside a lockable & secure structure ( ex -warehouse, commercial greenhouse) is illegal F: must commit and be open to both bi-monthly and random testing and inspection by licensed & regulated inspectors for violations and health/safety laws G: required to have 24hr video surveillance w/daily downloads to a marijuana regulatory office - minimum # of cameras upon discretion of registrar and/or inspector G: strains must have high CBD and low THC H: commercial growers are prohibited from private recreational selling & are limited to selling to licensed recreational facilities, supplying an attached licensed recreational facility in a joint business venture, & supplying transplants for private growers Why ? Cannabidiol\"CBD\"is a cannabis compound that does not make the majority of first time users & regular users feel \"stoned\" and lethargic to the point of incapacitating. Investigators at Kings College in London assessed the physiological & behavioral effects of CBD and THC versus placebo in 16 healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. It was reported that the oral administration of 10 mg of THC was associated with various physiological and behavioral effects\"such as increased heart rate and sedation\"whereas the oral administration of 600 mg of CBD did not. Strains that have high THC and low CBD creates bad behavior, physiological and psychological side effects and can put the user and those around them at risk. Recreation is intended to relieve stress and promote feelings of wellbeing, which low THC and high CBD strains create, therefore strains with higher levels of THC are not needed. A .5oz daily use is large enough for a single person and the average plant under good growing conditions can produce between 1-2oz - a plant limit for home growing minimizes overuse yet allow for a leeway for underproduction & registered growers can legally sell overproduction to licensed recreational use facilities they have a contract with. Limiting commercial plant numbers minimizes over saturating the market, helps inventory control, and minimizes chances of robbery/theft. Limiting numbers in conjunction to the # of registered citizens within a 20 miles radius makes sure there is enough available to local registered customers, promoting local economies and businesses, yet opens the option of extra for visiting tourists (registered users of course) as having competing businesses will fluctuate the market depending on promotions & prices of the recreational facilities. Private growers prohibited from growing from seeds & obtaining transplants from licensed commercial growers promotes local business, makes sure that private growers can not grow high THC strains & helps in accounting for household plant limits. A regulatory system & inspectors creates jobs and taxable income in a stagnant & slowing economy and low employment rates. If all 50 states legalized cannabis today, they'd be collectively raking in more than $3 billion a year in taxes according to NerdWallet, a personal finance site. The site's estimate assumed a flat, 15 percent excise tax on marijuana -- the same as Colorado's excise tax on recreational marijuana sales, adding 2010 state and local sales taxes to that figure. The site didn't subtract medical marijuana tax revenues in the 23 states at the time that allow medicinal use of cannabis also. The post-prohibition forecast also failed to calculate reduced government spending on law enforcements never ending drug war nor the loss of revenue to private security firms running jails & prisons. In 2010, Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimated more than $8 billion in annual savings in law enforcement costs if marijuana were legalized. To estimate each states marijuana sales, NerdWallet used the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Surveys on Drug Use and Health to find the number of marijuana consumers aged 25 and older. NerdWallet calculated the approximate number of pot users in each state, & applied the percentage to the U.S. population. It estimated the total U.S. marijuana market at $14 billion. 4) Recreational facilities - A: must be licensed by the registrar of the marijuana regulatory office in the county of the business location B: subject to all state, city, federal taxes, health and safety laws, retail/recreational licenses & permits & their benefits, deductions C: can not operate within 300 ft of a school, elementary, middle, and high school (private/public included and excludes homeschooling locations), licensed childcare facility, or within 150ft of a church with more then 200 regular attending members D: must obtain inventory from a licensed commercial grower or registered private grower within 100miles E: customers under the age of 25 are prohibited on site of the business at any time F: smoking is prohibited in outdoor seating (a) outdoor seating must be enclosed with a fence/wall with minimum 10ft height and preventive security measures G: smoking products and inventory are taxed at a higher rate (3times) then edibles, oils, tinctures, body and bath products H: indoor smoking is only to be in enclosed rooms with scrubbing ventilation, size and number determined by the fire marshal & marijuana regulatory office I: the facilities are required to have scrubbing ventilation in open space areas, size and number determined by marijuana regulatory office J: establishments that sell edibles, oils, tinctures, body & bath products, and not liable for its use once it has left the sales premises and are the responsibility of the purchaser K: facilities are required to have a production area on-site that is video monitored and secured for smoking buds and products, edibles, oils, tinctures, body and bath products L: facilities are to require that all their staff be CPR/ first aid certified & a RN be on staff during business hours M: facilities are required to hooked into the national register system that monitors registered users amount and purchases N: all purchasers are required to use their register cards during purchases O: Facilities are limited to 10mg of THC per serving size of any edibles/product and must properly label ingredients, nutrition, and quantity, strain of marijuana contained P: purchasers are limited to .5oz a month total from all purchases from all licensed recreational facilities in all 50 states (medical quantities excluded from total) Q: medical users are prohibited from recreational purchases",

            "premise": "After further reading the questions posted by little con, it has occurred to me I should add some more description, and that I will do. Here's what is stopping kids from accessing marijuana, age laws, I specifically did say adult. As for the next question, there is no reason to stop sellers from faking illnesses as legalization of recreational marijuana is also part of the debate. Nothing is stopping people from growing and selling this as long as they abide by normal safety regulation, why not, it should be a legal, regulated, and taxed industry. However like any product to be sold legally it would have to go through any regulations put in place. If patients have it for medical purposes, nothing is stopping them from smoking it if they are adults, same as cigarettes or alcohol. Driving while on marijuana would still be illegal obviously, I should have specified that. And sure if a patient is in a hospital and they smoked it for medical purposes they could be put in a certain insulated room or whatever doesn't seem like a big deal. And what do you mean where would all this money come from, the U.S government can afford medical marijuana, how much does it cost 100 million? That's peanuts to the U.S government who spends trillions yearly, and billions on fu(king pork barrel projects alone. And yeah it would be available for public use, I included recreational marijuana too. And the negatives outweigh the positives in leaps and bounds, but I'll get there next round. And this argument you make that tries to say everyone will think medical marijuana is the new drug that fixes all problems that every existed ever makes no sense, that's such a grandiose claim that you provided no evidence for, it hardly even makes sense. Look little con many many drugs affect male fertility it isn't a new thing, yes marijuana can affect fertility when used frequently, but antibiotics, blood pressure medication, and exposure to lead and mercury all also lead to potential fertility problems among others, so this isn't a new thing, or a valid argument, that's just a side effect of many many needed drugs. You asked if I think that if medical marijuana is federally legalized if i think that would cause everyone everywhere in the country to drop all medical research, again no I don't this is such a grandiose claim that it needs some sort of evidence to prove, and no medical research will still keep going even if marijuana is released that's obvious. And you asked where the government is going to get millions for additional research grants into medical marijuana, as well as some potential costs of ambulance services. How about millions of dollars is like fu(king peanuts for the U.S government, they can throw that in the trash and be fine. But since you wan't I'll propose a plan, the U.S spent over 4 billion dollars in taxes on pork barrel projects in 2016, since pork barrel projects are nothing but nepotism, we will cut pork barrel projects for the purpose of funding medical marijuana research.I'll start outlining the real pros with legalizing medical and recreational marijuana in the following rounds, little con can start with the negatives first if he wants.",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana Should Be Legal For Medicinal Purposes",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his refutations and I thank the voters for reading. Heart Disease- The article my opponent links and quotes in refutation does not lead to a source where the content of his quotation can views. Whereas the Heritage foundation clearly shows that heart disease comes with prolonged exposure to marijuana. Furthermore even the American Heart Foundation[19] backs this claim with even more evidence on the matter. [19] http://www.heart.org... To claim marijuana has no effect on the heart is the height of irresponsibility. Immune System Deficiency- I would like to point out the my opponents cited source for his immune system argument, Norml.org, is a source with the express purpose of legalizing marijuana. Furthermore he doesn't he link to the article he links to the site's homepage; whereas I have offered several qualified academic sources to suggest that long-term marijuana usage harms the body's T-Cells, especially in the lungs where blood is oxygenated. It wasn't Dr. Nahas that I cited to show the effects of marijuana on the immune system, it was a collaborative study headed by Dr. Nora Volkow, NIDA director. The study explicitly stated that[20] \"marijuana smoke does irritate the lungs and increases the likelihood of other respiratory problems through exposure to carcinogens and other toxins. Repeated exposure to marijuana smoke can lead to daily cough and excess phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illnesses, and a greater risk of lung infections. Marijuana also affects the immune system\" [20] http://www.drugabuse.gov... Birth Defects- Again my opponent cites the marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML; this evidence is biased and should not be preferred against the evidence the Con provides. Furthermore pregnant women should not partake of any manner of smoke related products. Marijuana can cause significant harm to a fetus just as cigarettes or alcohol can. From Otis Prenancy, \"Marijuana contains about 400 different chemicals, and some marijuana cigarettes may contain other drugs or pesticides ... one study reported an increased risk for heart defects among babies prenatally exposed to marijuana.[21]\" [21] http://www.otispregnancy.org... Finally I would like to point out to the voters that in my opponent's very own refutations he compares marijuana to the likes of alcohol and cocaine; I cannot stress this enough, but these are not medicine. Saying that marijuana is safer than cocaine is not a reason to use it in medicine. For recreational use, people should be able to do whatever they want; but in medical usage we shouldn't allow something because it's safer than cocaine. Schizophrenia and Paranois- I will group these two arguments; I will at this point respond the issue of empirically accountability civilly, but with urgency; My opponent has consistently make harsh empirical claims throughout this debate and linked to either an article from an unreputable or outright biased sourse; the refutation here comes from ProCon.org, and doesn't even link to a specific study. This is not an academic source and shouldn't be accepted on the basis of the preponderance of evidence against my prior cited sources which do indeed show a direct casual link between marijuana usage and psychosis of the brain[13] \"This showed that the effects on individual brain regions were subtle, but brain waves across the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were completely disrupted. These two brain areas are vital for memory and decision-making, so the rats were no longer able to accurately navigate a maze. Both areas are also involved in schizophrenia.\" Cancer- This refutation is wholly unacceptable. I offer legitimate evidence to warrant the arguments on marijuana's link to cancer, and my opponent simply claims that this was not what he found in his research. This argument is a drop from my opponent and should be directly extended. Anesthetic- By the preponderance of evidence my cited evidence shows that marijuana is indeed an anesthetic. Furthermore in my attacks of the Pro case I show by explicitly citing my opponent own sources that marijuana is only ever used in some regards to anesthesia; it numbs the body's pain which while it does relax the patient does nothing to treat their condition Look directly to my refutations of my opponent's arguments in the prior round. I cite Dr. Mbakwe saying, [16]\"...other medications, like methotrexate, treat the autoimmune disease at the root of the problem, and in turn can control pain and inflammation in combination with pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ... On the other hand, while marijuana may help with pain symptoms, it does nothing for the disease progression or organ damage\" be mindful that this evidence was provided by Pro, not me; it is legitimate ans shows that marijuana has not medical benefit beyond anesthesia. Addictive- My opponent sources don't lead to the cited article, they lead to the main webpages of NIDA and Psychology Today; there is not empircal or unbiased study to follow in order to solidify my opponent's claims. Furthermore, a simply search of the NIDA website validifies my claim of addictiveness[22]. It states, \"Long-term marijuana use can lead to addiction; that is, people have difficulty controlling their drug use and cannot stop even though it interferes with many aspects of their lives.[22]\" and \" ...marijuana accounted for 4.5 million of the estimated 7.1 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs.1 In 2009, approximately 18 percent of people aged 12 and older entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse...[22]\" [22] http://www.drugabuse.gov... quite frankly I'm not sure what my opponent is attempting to cite. Gateway Drug-. NORML.org is again being utilized here. This evidence is biased and should be rejected. Aside from that my original argumen concerning marijuana as a gateway drugs referred to it as such because made a gateway for other drugs to come into the country[2]; it has opened a gateway for drug trafficking and crime to prosper and run rampant. This argument concerning crime was never addressed Now at the end of this rebuttal three things remain clear; - Marijuana is not a sustainable treatment for any manner of disease. The only function it serves in the medical community is an anesthetic one; even my opponent's evidence points to this truth. Any vote for the Pro would be irresponsible and place patients in harms way where there are plenty of alternatives to marijuana usage - Pro's refutation (as well as advocacy, which we'll get to in the next speech) concern themselves with marijuana on a recreational level. Not a medical level. All of the negative impacts I have provided, both through my constructive as well as my rebuttals have been met with responses of marijuana's relative safeness compared to such recreational drugs as alcohol as cocaine. Comparative safety to the likes of cocaine does not warrant usage in medicine. - The significant amount of harms associated with medical marijuana do not warrant it's sole usage as an anesthetic . I show such impacts as psychosis, immune system deficiency and heart disease which my opponent only meets with weak rebuttals from biased sources. These impacts must be acknowledged and we must be mindful of them; denying them for the sake of argumentation is irresponsible and could put lives at risk if voted on. I urge the voters to consider these issues; marijuana may be viable as a recreational drug, but should not be used in medicine where patients entrust their lives expecting to be taken care of. There are reasonable alternatives to marijuana. Vote Con!",

            "premise": "\"The illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world.\" - Carl SaganAlthough there exist many benefits associated with the legalization of marijuana, including economic, moral, civil, and societal advantages, in this round I will attempt to build my case solely by focusing on only two primary contentions; namely, 1) the medical benefits of marijuana, and 2) the level safety associated with using marijuana. Ultimately, the criteria of a good medication is one that can provide a worthwhile medicinal benefit without resulting in any unreasonable side-effects; I believe marijuana fulfills this criteria, and should therefore be legalized for medicinal use.The Medicinal Benefits of Marijuana:The legalization of medical marijuana would undoubtedly result in the relief of millions of suffering people who seek to find an escape from their significantly numerous ailments; in fact, various authoritative studies have consistently confirmed that Marijuana treats and prevents glaucoma, epileptic seizures, cancer, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, muscle tension, muscle spasm, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, chronic pain, and various other medical problems [1] [2]. Marijuana has also surprisingly been observed to help consumers increase their lung capacity, as well as provide them relief from the symptoms that accompany treatment of hepatitis C [3]. These studies have been performed, reported, and confirmed by non-partisan medical organizations and universities [4]. For example, Business Insider has reported on the following findings related to the medical benefits associated with marijuana use:Cancer: \"One chemical found in marijuana, called cannabidiol, prevents cancer from spreading, researchers at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco reported in 2007. Cannabidiol stops cancer by turning of a gene called Id-1, the study, published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, found. Cancer cells make more copies of this gene than non-cancerous cells, and it helps them spread through the body. The researchers studied breast cancer cells in the lab that had high expression levels of Id-1 and treated them with cannabidiol. After treatment the cells had decreased Id-1 expression and were less aggressive spreaders [5].\"Alzheimer's: \"Marijuana may be able to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, a study led by Kim Janda of the Scripps Research Institute suggests. The 2006 study, published in the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics found that THC, the active chemical in marijuana, slows the formation of amyloid plaques by blocking the enzyme in the brain that makes them. These plaques are what kill brain cells and cause Alzheimers [6].\"Multiple Sclerosis:\"Marijuana may ease painful symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis, a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in May suggests. Jody Corey-Bloom studied 30 multiple sclerosis patients with painful contractions in their muscles. These patients didn't respond to other treatments, but after smoking marijuana for a few days they were in less pain [7].\"Arthritis: \"Marijuana alleviates pain, reduces inflammation, and promotes sleep, which may help relieve pain and discomfort for people with rheumatoid arthritis, researchers announced in 2011. Researchers from rheumatology units at several hospitals gave their patients, sativex, a cannabinoid-based pain-relieving medicine. After a two week period, people on Sativex had a significant reduction in pain and improved sleep quality compared to placebo users [8].\"Of course, this isn't to say that there are no negative side-effects of Marijuana -- there are; however, the negative properties of cannabis pale in comparison to its positive ones. In any case, it's no secret that the vast majority of legal medications possess at least one or many negative side-effects themselves.Therefore, despite the potential downfalls of marijuana, I submit that its abundant positive properties make it a justified candidate for legalization, especially considering the fact that many other legal medications possess similar or even worse side-effects [9].Marijuana Compared to Alcohol and Tobacco:One of the most perplexing realities surrounding the illegalization of medicinal marijuana is the fact that many other legal substances and are much more dangerous, particularly alcohol and tobacco; for example, http://www.saferchoice.org... provides the following comparisons between alcohol and marijuana:1) People die from alcohol overdoses; there has never been a fatal marijuana overdose2) Alcohol use damages the brain; marijuana use does not3) Alcohol use is linked to cancer; marijuana use is not4) Alcohol is more addictive than marijuana5) Alcohol use contributes to aggressive and violent behavior; marijuana use does not6) Alcohol use contributes to the likelihood of domestic abuse and sexual assault; marijuana use does notFurthermore, the following comparisons can be drawn between marijuana and tobacco:1) Over 400,000 people die every year from tobacco; no one has ever died directly from the use of marijuana [10]2) Tobacco causes cancer; marijuana does not [11]3) Marijuana is not as harmful to the lungs as tobacco smoke [12]Therefore, considering the fact that alcohol and tobacco are legal for recreational use, I submit that marijuana should certainly be legal for medicinal use, especially considering the fact that alcohol and tobacco are significantly more dangerous.________________________________________________________________________________________________[1] http://health.howstuffworks.com...[2] http://www.businessinsider.com...[3] Ibid.[4] Ibid.[5] Ibid.[6] Ibid.[7] Ibid[8] Ibid.[9] http://www.opposingviews.com...[10] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...[11] Ibid.[12] Ibid.",

            "premise": "Hello all, I will be arguing for the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use in the United States (to at least a level equivalent to that of alcohol's). I will begin by presenting all my points and their subset points for legalization. I respectfully request for my opponent to refute them, then I will challenge their arguments. This is simply to establish a sense of organization, please and thank you. Also feel free to add any points you may have or to not address any of mine that you choose (if you don't however, I will assume you either acknowledge/agree with my point or cannot refute it). I do not wish to focus on other drugs besides cannabis although I intend to mention them for argumentative purposes if necessary. If you do not understand anything I say, simply ask and I will clarify, no need to be rude.My Points1.There will be little to no negative effects to the country/society from marijuana's legalization.a) Marijuana is not addictive.b) It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuanac) Marijuana's supposed \"negative\" effects, whether long term or short, are negligible, and many of which cannot credibly be declared true.d) The logic of the gateway theory is fundamentally flawed and therefore it cannot be truee) Marijuana's intoxicating effects are not harmful to the users or others within itself (i.e. calmness, changes to mood or perception), and therefore responsibility is placed on the user (although it would be anyway).f) Youth's access to marijuana will not be increased by legalization but will in fact be decreasedg) Assuming it is true that marijuana's psychoactive potency has increased since the 1900's, it is an irrelevant fact seeing as how the negative effects remain unchanged.2. There will be a plethora of positive effects resulting from marijuana's legalization.a) The revenue saved and made from marijuana's legalization will be substantial and much needed to the countryb)The medical benefits (known and to be known) of marijuana would benefit many of its citizens, saving lives and creating a greater quality of life for manyc) Legalization will allow regulation of cannabis and therefore a greater degree of damage control. (i.e. preventing child access, reducing drugged driving)d) Legalization will improve society by ending prosecution and punishment of responsible, contributing citizens simply for committing the victimless crime of consuming cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.e)Cannabis integration would benefit our culture and uphold our rights as a nation under the constitution.f ) Gang violence and crime revolving around marijuana will be greatly decreased.g) Legalization's resulting industry would create jobs and generally benefit the national economy.h) Marijuana education would be healthy for both youth and adults (because now the only education is lies unless you dig deeper).3.Marijuana Prohibition altogether is a colossal failure.a)The whole purpose of cannabis prohibition is to prevent use nationwide, yet, cannabis use is still very prevalent.b)Because of point a, the adverse societal effects of marijuana (however minuscule) are in effect despite it's prohibition, ergo prohibition is purposeless.c)marijuana prohibition is exactly the same as the 20's alcohol prohibition save for the failure to end it.4. It is not the governments place to tell us how to live, but to protect the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for the nation.a) Proof of the government's failure to do this is how a constitutional amendment was needed to sign alcohol prohibition into law (and is now being used to prohibit marijuana). This means that the views/values this nation was built on differ from those that allow/support prohibition.",

            "premise": "I am taking the position that marijuana should not be legalized on the grounds that marijuana is an extremely addictive drug, it causes teen dependency, it is a drug that contains hundreds of chemicals many of which are carcinogens, it has not directly killed anyone however it does play a role in some deaths, and on the grounds that marijuana is too easy to access to minors for it to be legalized.1) Addictive, both to adults and especially to teenagersMarijuana is one of the most addictive illegal drugs out there, it affects one in ten recreational users but teenagers on the other hand are much more vulnerable to becoming dependent on marijuana than adults. Marijuana dependency affects more teenagers than all other drug dependencies combined, and the number of teenagers in rehab for marijuana dependency is larger than any other drug group and costs taxpayers millionshttp://www.teendrugabuse.us......http://www.healthieryou.com......http://www.drugabuse.gov......http://www.well.com......If Marijuana was legalized, then access to the drug for teenagers would mushroom, along with the number of cases of teenage dependency and addictions to the drug.2) ChemicalsMarijuana is known for having chemicals that alter the mind and create a euphoria for the smoker, however marijuana also contains chemicals that slows reaction time, alters how the brain process information, degrades decision making, etc. Marijuana also contains carcinogens that can cause cancer and severe lung damage over long periods of time. Legalizing marijuana.http://www.sciencedirect.com......http://www.jstor.org......http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org......Legalizing Marijuana would allow millions of people to unwillingly expose themselves to very harmful drugs that causes numerous health complications such as lung cancer in the far future while in the short term future decision making skills and mental healthiness deteriorate.3) Lethal nature of MarijuanaEvery supporter of Marijuana legalization will hide behind the weak argument that marijuana doesnt kill. Those people are only looking at the fact that it is impossible to overdose on Marijuana, however they completely ignore how Marijuana can cause many types of cancers since many chemicals within marijuana are carcinogenic. Apart from causing death by cancer, marijuana's alteration and degradation of brain functionality plays a role in other common accidents, mostly car accidents where decreased reactionary times to events going on on the roads end in fatalities. On the other hand, the current drug trade involving marijuana causes dozens of deaths and has even triggered small scale civil wars in certain countries (Columbia and Mexico). Marijuana does kill people, either by the long term health damage it triggers or through gang violence.4) Saturation of the market.People who support the Profusion Of Toxic, Heavy Euphoria Agents + Drugs....... or \"P.O.T.H.E.A.D.'s\" for short........... Dont realize that if euphoria agents and drugs such as marijuana are legalized then teenagers and those not old enough to legally smoke the drug would have far greater access to smoking the drug either recreationally or heavily are now much more at risk for developing either a dependency on the drug or develop health complications caused by marijuana chemicals, carcinogens, and mind-altering agents within marijuana.Legalizing marijuana is a bad idea if you look at it through the health complications it would unleash on this massive nation of 350 million people. Marijuana already causes health complications in millions of people while the drug is illegal, making it legal would expose many more people to the health complications brought about by marijuana now that it would be far more accessible to millions of people who may or may not be of legal age...",
