The advertisers wouldn't fund them if nobody was watching them.\"Women turn on those tv shows just so that it can serve as background noise while they do their things around the house when nobody else is home. You know how guys like to turn the tv on in the background while they masturbate to whatever they are looking up on their computers? Same thing except women do that to get stuff done while men do that just to masturbate. \"It wouldn't be so bad if husbands had nice sexy wives to come home to but most don\"t because the majority of women - 62% in America- are overweight, just because they have so little physical work to do. No wonder strip clubs are booming these days.\"But then women invented anorexia and bulimia to start fighting back against those numbers, and so far its working! We just need to give them time and sooner or later, all women will be thin and sexy.... If they arent dead. \"True, blacks get a public holiday in America, but women already have Mother's Day, and although it's not a public holiday, they still get cards, presents and breakfast in bed. That should be more than enough I would have thought.\"That only applies to mothers though, while all the single proud independent women who dont need no MAN in her life are left out in the dark when they shouldnt be. They deserve a day of appreciation too!\"\"Vagina Day\" sounds a bit clinical, don\"t you think? Why not something a little more poetic like Lady Garden Day, Hairy Clam Day, Gates of Heaven Day or Map of Tasmania Day?\"They can go with 'map of tasmania day' in Australia if they want but Vagina just has a melody to it that 'lady garden' just doesn't have. Walk up to any teenage boy in America and ask him about his opinion of Vaginas, then do the same about Lady gardens and hairy clams, I guarantee that they will give different opinions and wont start drooling over themselves like they do at the sound of 'Vagina'\"A week before Valentine\"s Day is just about the worst possible day\"Valentines Day always falls on a friday, Vagina day would be the thursday before Valentines day, meaning that Vagina day would always be the day before Valentines day, not a week before it! That would be suicide\"My opponent might as well have proposed a \"Cowboys and Indians Day\" We call that Thanksgiving I think. \"Hamburger Day\" Every day is hamburger day in Americaor \"Raccoon Day\" hey are natures adorable bandits <333or \"Atom Bomb Day\" We combined blowing sh*t up day with the Fourth of Julyor \"NASA Day\" That would really only work in Floridaor \"College Shooting Day\" or \"Soda Pop Day\" or \"Tornado Alley Trailer Park Day\" or \"Hollywood Day\" Im sure they will work outor \"Wall Street Greed and Incompetence Day\"Every day is wall streed greed and incompetence day in capitalist America!

            "premise": "Teachers have holidays for us students to show our appreciation towards them being hard-working and patient in teaching us. Students Appreciation Day shouldn't be a National Holiday because of the following reasons. 1. Students still hadn't prove much of themselves yet. They are still in the process of learning. 2. Students go to school to study and some are even forced to go to school because they do not want to or too lazy to attend. They do not work hard that much unlike teachers. According to Deno Machino \"Every day you go to school, you have the chance to learn something that will change your life forever.You are rewarded with knowledge. \" Are you so self centered that you need acknowledgement for making a better life for your self? Most of your teachers had the chance to be anything in this world, but they chose to pursue a career that helps you. While most professions help society, none are quite like a teacher. While a doctor may save your life once you become ill, a teacher saves your life by giving you the knowledge to be able to live. Without teachers, you could not afford a house, car, or the doctor. Without a teacher, this doctor would not have the knowledge to save your life. (Source: http://www.smallworlds.com...) And besides, without teachers, we wouldn't even learn a lot of things.",

            "premise": "My opponent highlights the supposed plight of women but we should ask ourselves why we perceive that women suffer so much. The answer is that they never stop complaining. Whinge, whinge, whine, whine, moan, moan: they never get tired of carping on about how hard they're lives supposedly are. \"A woman's work is never done\" they grumble, but if that's true who are all those women's shows on daytime TV aimed at then? The advertisers wouldn't fund them if nobody was watching them. The fact is, these days, housewives have it even easier than ever what with modern appliances such as vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens, washer/dryers, dishwashers, food processors, they hardly have to lift a finger around the house. Furthermore, with the wide availability of ready-prepared meals and affordable clothing housewives no longer have to cook or sew. So, instead of doing something useful they lounge about all day watching TV or go out and spend their husbands' hard-earned cash on clothes, shoes and make-up. It wouldn't be so bad if husbands had nice sexy wives to come home to but most don\"t because the majority of women - 62% inAmerica- are overweight, just because they have so little physical work to do. No wonder strip clubs are booming these days. Now, to address my opponent's specific points in turn. \"Why should women get a holiday when others dont?\" This is positive discrimination gone mad. True, blacks get a public holiday in America, but women already have Mother's Day, and although it's not a public holiday, they still get cards, presents and breakfast in bed. That should be more than enough I would have thought. \"Why does it have to be called vagina day? why cant it be called women's day or something?\" \"Vagina Day\" sounds a bit clinical, don\"t you think? Why not something a little more poetic like Lady Garden Day, Hairy Clam Day, Gates of Heaven Day or Map of Tasmania Day? \"When would Vagina Day be?\" A week before Valentine\"s Day is just about the worst possible day: think about all the time, effort and expense men will be expected to go to in order to appease their womenfolk on Vagina Day only to have to waste even more time and money buying chocolates and flowers a week later. \"Why cancel work on that day?\" People would always welcome a free day off work and, therefore, might vote for my opponent\"s plan for that reason alone. My opponent might as well have proposed a \"Cowboys and Indians Day\" or \"Hamburger Day\" or \"Raccoon Day\" or \"Atom Bomb Day\" or \"NASA Day\" or \"College Shooting Day\" or \"Soda Pop Day\" or \"Tornado Alley Trailer Park Day\" or \"Hollywood Day\" or \"Wall Street Greed and Incompetence Day\" or anything else all-American. \"How is it celebrated?\" Giant balloon vaginas? My opponent hasn't thought this through. The last vagina I checked had a gash right down the middle of it and, clearly, this feature would not aid buoyancy in a balloon. And, while there have been some great women through the years but there have been some rotten ones too: let's remember Elizabeth Bathory, the Blood Countess, who tortured and killed hundreds of young girls so that she could bathe in the blood of virgins in order to keep her younger, or the 'Bitch of Buchenwald' who was the wife of Karl Koch, a Nazi concentration camp commandant, and who reveled in torture and obscenity, or the evil tyrant Margaret Thatcher who brought misery and despair to millions of decent, hard-working British people through her vile political campaigns against the working classes in the 1980\"s and 90\"s. These women all had vaginas and, as such, would be celebrated, but to do so would be an insult to the memories of their victims. Finally, fireworks would be wholly inappropriate: as a feminist studies graduate once expalained to me, fireworks are phallic symbols which rape the sky and pollute the air that women have to breathe.

Do you know how much of a pain in the a** it is for women to put up with guys in their life? At just about any age all women usually have one creepy guy obsessed with them, four hot guys she wants to date but no matter how hard she tries cant get them to take the hint, deal with either an overbearing father or not having one at all, and just being forced to live in a world that is run by the dumbest men you can find.

Even though women only have it moderately bad today, it used to be WAAAAAAAAY worse then that just a couple of generations earlier, and they have not received their credit for it when many others have. \"Why should women get a holiday when others dont?\"Name one other group who have had it just as bad as women and didnt get compensated for it. You may think that blacks should get their own day right? THEY DO.

When you think of 'Vaginas' though, you cant immediately think of anything bad about them, am I right? Lets face it, God was taking his sweet time when making the Vagina and its probably his best work too. Vagina also just sounds more upbeat and happy too.

            "premise": "I'll use this first round to make my case against 'Vagina Day' and the next round to attack my opponent's case. Right out of the batting box I'd like to establish a few thing: a. The pay gap between men and women is a myth[1], Men have to deal with their image just like women[2] and men have far fewer health benefits than women do.[3][4][5] [1] http://cbsn.ws... [2] http://bit.ly... [3] http://1.usa.gov... [4] http://bit.ly... That said, it is my contention that vagina is unwarranted. Women are already celebrated in our society to a significant degree, by continuing to focus so heavily on women we create a systematic inequality among men and women. 1. Societal celebration of women- As I've already shown the rates for prostate and breast cancer are roughly the same[3]. Let's put aside for just a moment that both men and women can get breast cancer[5] whereas only men can get prostate cancer. The real impact here is our focus on health. Despite the rates of these cancers being about equal breast cancer research receives a significantly higher amount funding than any other type of cancer[3]. Our society akins breast cancer to women, and supports it so as to help women. This is proof that we value women [5] http://bit.ly... Further, let's compare two holidays already in place: Mother's day and Father's day. Out society spent about 5.9 Billion dollars more on Mother's day in 2008 than we did on father's day[6]. Furthermore we see that Men spend on average twice as much as women do on Valentines day[7]. [6] http://bit.ly... [7] http://bit.ly... So from this you can take home that we already place a huge value on women. There simply isn't a need for another holiday to express our gratitude towards them. But there is a second, even more potent issue that must be discussed when one discusses the legitimacy of 'vagina day', and that's the role of men. 2. Male Disposability- Whether we're willing to admit it or not, men are disposable in our culture. It's for that very reason that a such a huge gap exists in college enrollment between men and women[8], 93% of work elated deaths are men[9] and the suicide rate for men is at least 3 times that of women across the board [10]. And that's just the minimum difference. [8] https://bitly.com... [9] http://bit.ly... [10] http://bit.ly... We treat men as though they're disposable, as though they're tools, and despite the fact that we know men are at a disadvantage in all of these different areas the goal of mainstream gender 'equality' movements for the past hundred years have been bout benefiting women and women alone. In 2000 Dr. Warren Farrell wrote 'The Myth of Male Power'[11], in which he redefines the classical ideal of the patriarchy as vessel of female oppression. Ferrell argued that neither Men nor Women classically held 'power', as that would imply that they had the power to control what they could do with their own life. The fact is that until the past hundred years or so, men and women had to play their traditional gender roles for the sake of survival. Men would go out an do backbreaking labor which ultimately put them in very poor shape physically and health-wise, whereas women would stay in the safety of the home so that they could be healthy enough to raise children. As Ferrel writes this was not oppression of women, but a necessary social structure for mankind to survive. [11] http://bit.ly... So What's next? The demonization of masculine values has been an element in the realm of gender equality for a while now[12]. The white ribbon campaign for instance, asserts that only men are responsible for domestic violence[13]. It claims that the traits which fuel domestic violence are inherently male traits, whereas peace is an inherently female trait. [12] http://bit.ly... [13] http://bit.ly... By voting for 'vagina day', even in jest, we propagate this negative view of men. I urge a vote for Con, for Gender equality.",

Moreover, densely populated states with higher delegate counts would become the dominant focus of the campaigns and the media. In addition, political parties would have little control over the selection of their eventual nominee, and state party leaders would no longer have the flexibility to set their primary or caucus dates according to state-specific considerations, such as redistricting issues, state holidays, or other state and local elections. In 2008, at least 24 states held a primary on February 5, resulting in what was essentially a de facto national primary. Super Tuesday became Tsunami Tuesday.

Using serious arguments in a troll debate is the equivalent of a full forfeit too.... Ill see what I can do to restore the humor in this but seriously you gave me NOTHING to work with and now the whole debate is shot to hell. \"The pay gap between men and women is a myth[1], Men have to deal with their image just like women[2] and men have far fewer health benefits than women do\"The man who claimed that the pay gap is a myth was arrested in 2008 for trying to sharpen his penis in a pencil sharpener so that when he has sex with women he can stab them to death. The man clearly has it out for women and tries to discredit them whenever he can. He actually published a book about how Hitler was secretly a woman just to try to disprove feminism.... And men dont deal with their image JUST LIKE women do. No guy in the history of guyness has ever had to spend more then 30 minutes in the bathroom making sure they look good before going out to a dinner, or had to put that icky green stuff on their face to exfoliate their skin or whatever. Lastly OF COURSE men have fewer health benefits then women. Last I checked men dont bleed out of their penis once a month\"Our society akins breast cancer to women, and supports it so as to help women. This is proof that we value women\"Oh yay, we value women enough that we want to keep them alive, HOW THOUGHTFUL OF MEN. The point of Vagina day is to celebrate all of the good aspects that women offer society BESIDES BEING ALIVE, like having good taste in decorations, making sure us men have good hygiene, doing all the stuff guys are too dumb to do in the first place, everything. \"So from this you can take home that we already place a huge value on women. There simply isn't a need for another holiday to express our gratitude towards them\"How typical for a MAN to convince himself that we already shell out enough for a women.... Men always think that they satisfy women but women know damn well that men never shell out enough, they go good at first but then finish early and then take a nap.\" It's for that very reason that a such a huge gap exists in college enrollment between men and women\"No its not, its because men are IDIOTS. Look up 'dumbass stunt' anywhere on youtube or the internet and I guarantee you that 99 out of 100 results will feature something a guy did. Hell, look at any episode of Tosh.0 and all the stupid stunts they feature are done by MEN. The reason women are enrolled in college more then men is because men are idiots, not because women are somehow favorited voer men. \"Men would go out an do backbreaking labor which ultimately put them in very poor shape physically and health-wise, whereas women would stay in the safety of the home so that they could be healthy enough to raise children.\"How in the hell does doing intense labor make somebody in POOR shape? Doing hard labor makes men STRONGER not weaker, thats why there are gyms ever two blocks in America! This Doctor is clearly an idiot, and no surprise HES A MAN. I guess they just let anyone be a docter these daysForfeited arguments: - Con forfeits that it would be cool to have parades with giant balloon vaginas - Con does not dispute the title of Vagina Day - Con forfeits that \"Vagina Day\" rolls off the tip of the tongue - Con fails to give a single Vagina Joke - Con failed to give an example of other groups of people who dont have some holiday like women do (only a fraction of women are mothers) - Con forfeits that God spent a lot of time first making the Vagina and that he did a damn good job at it - Con forfeits basically everything since he decided to take a troll debate seriously and new arguments cant be introduced in the last round....You know what, just tie it.

Response: with all the avenues available on a single day vote (Internet at library, shelters, could provide other government locations) voting would not only be available to all Americans but it could be convenient. 2. \"...Those that have to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive and feed their family.

You'd only know a person's finger pad pattern, not what they look like and people would not have to have a photo ID if they didn't want to.\" Response: with so much difficulty passing voter ID policies, logging fingerprints would prove implausible for two reasons. First, one argument against voter ID is that some have difficulty finding their birth certificate or other forms of ID. Second, many feel it is an invasion of their privacy and denies them their right to vote. Although I support voter ID laws, the fingerprint policy would be a step up in both categories. 4. \"Then, you could take your time to vote. Voting at your own convenience.

Too much money for tv. Sports are slaves to tv as well.\" Response: if the vote were done over a period of weeks, the spectacle and drama would be dragged out and exacerbated even more than it is now. For example, television shows such as The Bachelorette rely on this type of drama to generate ratings. Presidential elections that only occur once every four years would play right into this type of sensationalism. Additionally, the voting could not occur during the transition period between November and January. During this time, the president-elect needs to conduct business related to a smooth transition between leaders. Therefore, the vote needs to be finalized by early November, it cannot drag on for months. Although the Electoral College process does not officially elect the president until much later, there has never been a President-elect who was not officially elected by the Electoral College. 5. \"For those that want national ID cards or required photo IDs YET they want total privacy and no records to match who voted for who, you can't have both.\" Response: displaying an ID in order to vote but maintaining total privacy on the actual person the voter selected is completely possible. The ID provides the voter the ballot, the voter then votes privately. 6. \"Suggestion #2: Better yet, align voting and taxes then if you want to vote you have to pay your taxes (which should already be the case, even if you owe nothing or expect a refund) No taxes, no vote. Citizens benefit from services and infrastructure provided by taxes and it is their duty to pay them, voting should also be a duty of a citizen.(I agree both are duties, but like I argued in Round 1, apathy is the problem)\" Response: The IRS is currently backlogged as it is (see link below), so involving them in the voting process would provide an even more significant delay. Additionally, the IRS experiences tax evasion fraud as well as their own surveillance scandals (see link below), so convincing Americans to provide fingerprints would be next to impossible. Lastly, you mentioned single day voting being a burden on the poor. Surely attaching a financial requirement to the vote (albeit a legally assessed tax) could provide a disincentive to conduct both actions (paying taxes and voting) and could also create discrimination similar to post-Civil War poll taxes used to deny African Americans their right to vote. It also could provide the undue burden on the poor that you refer to at the start of your argument. IRS backlog link: http://www.cchgroup.com...

It would also be easier for people to intimidate voters since the government would have a tough time manning polling locations for weeks or months instead of for just one day.

            "conclusion": "Columbus Day Should Not be Celebrated.",
            "premise": "Whether or not Columbus Day should be celebrated lies in whether or not it is a national holiday. Thus, the resolution should read: Resolved: Columbus Day should not be a national holiday. Definition: Columbus Day: a federal holiday as declared by President Benjamin Harrison in 1892 celebrating the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. Framework: As my opponent has stated, the BOP for the CON is to show why Columbus Day should still be a national holiday. Thus, the BOP for the PRO is to refute the contentions presented by the CON and establish his own advocating why we should no longer make Columbus Day a national holiday. Additionally, read Contention 3 for the last part of PRO's BOP, where he must prove that there is bad INTENT in celebrating Columbus Day. --- Arguments: Contention 1: America has long admired Columbus Columbus Day marks the arrival of Europeans to the New World, and celebrates the \"beginning of a cultural exchange between America and Europe\"[1]. America has more Columbus statues and Columbus memorabilia than any other nation in the world. He's admired for his bravery in sailing West at a time when most uneducated believed the world to be flat. Contention 2: Columbus Day is the only day which recognizes the heritage of almost 26 million Italian Americans. Columbus Day became a national holiday in 1971 after Congress passed a law stating that the second Monday in October is Columbus Day. Along with the accomplishments of Columbus, the law passed in 1971 commemorates the arrival of over 5 million Italians a century prior. Columbus Day is thus the only day which recognizes the heritage of a group now nearly 26 million in size. Contention 3: Intent It is important as we judge this debate to consider the intent of Columbus Day. The intent, as defined, is to celebrate Columbus's arrival to the New World. Much like how Manifest Destiny didn't encourage the killing of Natives and much like how Independence Day doesn't celebrate the killing of British in the Revolutionary War, Columbus Day doesn't celebrate the deaths of Native Americans that may have ensued. It's a celebration of the discovery of the New World. In order for my opponent to win this round, he MUST prove that there is bad intent in celebrating Columbus Day. Unless he does so, he cannot win. This is added to his BOP. --- Refutations: ++represent my opponent's arguments ++\"It is in my opinion that Columbus's legacy is grossly misrepresented\"++ How has his legacy been misrepresented? He discovered two new continents, and that's what he's celebrated for on Columbus Day. ++\"His \"accomplishments\" was nothing more but a failed journey\"++ Again, how was it a failed journey? I understand that my opponent is upset over the deaths of natives that ensued after the discovery of the New World, but the intent of Columbus Day is to celebrate the discovery of continents on which 1 billion people now reside [2] [3]. When Columbus Day is described or taught in classrooms, it's taught as a celebration of discovery. No one is celebrating death on Columbus Day. Furthermore, Westward expansion and Manifest Destiny are two deeply rooted American beliefs, but as a result of them many Native Americans were killed. Should we remove the verse \"from sea to shining sea\" from the national anthem [4] because it hints to those who died in westward expansion? Should we no longer celebrate Independence Day because we killed many British and lost American lives during the preceding war? ++Columbus Day celebrates \"genocide and imperialism.\"++ Basically, my opponent is a) claiming that Columbus Day celebrates the deaths of Natives, b) imperialism is bad, and c) he is upset about it. My responses: a) that isn't the intent of the holiday. and, b) imperialism was the way of the world back then. c) the killing of Natives wasn't a genocide. The primary cause of death was smallpox, which was unintentionally brought from Europe to the Americas. Disease easily traveled across continents thanks to sea travel. and, d) Columbus was merely an explorer, actually didn't do much in the Americas except travel. He made four voyages and stopped at numerous locations on the Americas. It was the later conquistadors who were the ones who enslaved and killed natives on a large scale. The resolution has been negated. I thank my opponent for posting this debate and eagerly anticipate his responses and upcoming contentions. [1] http://www.osia.org... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org...

            "premise": "This debate is about whether Columbus Day should be a national holiday in the United States. I believe that either the holiday should be abolished or that it should be renamed. Columbus' treatment of the natives was inhumane as his men murdered and raped members of the native tribes. In this country, we should categorize men like this as a murderer instead of a national hero. Let's begin by looking at how this became a holiday...it was a celebration by certain members of society because he was Italian and Catholic. His accomplishment of reaching America made him a hero in those communities. But how did he go from being a hero in the Italian and Catholic groups to being a hero in the United States? First of all, he did not \"discover\" America. Unless you ignore world history until this point, you know that there were native tribes living in the Americas for centuries before Columbus landed, so how can you \"discover\" something when there is already someone living there. Not only that, he never even touched down into the modern-day United States. He explored islands in the Caribbean and in central America, not in the present day United States. To give credit where credit is due, his explorations led to other European nations exploring the Americas and led to the colonizing of the Americas. However, that is not how Columbus is perceived is most parts of our society. My final point in this round is that there are only two holidays here in the United States that are named after individuals; Columbus Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Washington's birthday has been reduced to an overall President's Day. It appalls me that Columbus has a holiday named after him, but Washington, the father of our country, Lincoln, who in a round about way ended slavery, nor heroes like Pat Tillman have holidays named after them....you know, TRUE HEROES!",

            "premise": "I rescind any statements in the comments section. I am not forfeiting and I urge voters to be mindful of the following statements. I would like to make a couple of overarching statements before I respond to some house-keeping issues and line-by-line analysis. I am confident that many of you will take these things to heart, but whatever. If I've lost you by this point I'm not worried about how you respond to this. a. let it be known that there was not a framework established for constructive arguments, clash, or rebuttals in the first round. This is important as my opponent seals his final speech with an underview speaking on my supposed drops and urging you, the voters, not to listen to any 'new arguments' in this speech. The first thing that I said in my second round 'speech' is that I would use that round for constructive arguments and then use this round for rebuttals; I made my intentions clear from the get-go, and there's no reason to ignore that framework since an alternative was not provided. Further, I'd like to point out that my opponent used this speech to respond to my argument, so attempting to block me from responding to his is bull. And if you don't buy that, I still on comparative advantage so drops wouldn't matter anyway. b. U mad bro? Pro is obviously upset at how I've tackled this debate, this is evidence that I've done a good job trolling him. We need to move away from this idea that the only good kinds of 'trolls' are established memes or cliches, that's both boring and lazy. I opponent didn't expect me to respond in the way that I did and it threw him off-guard, I've done an excellent job trolling him. Further, if the issue of entertainment is what you're concerned about I win there too. Reading some dadaist nonsense in the form of a 'debate' may get a chuckle, but the drama that this debate will cause will be much more entertaining to read. Now onto the line-by-line. I'll cover my opponent's constructive by grouping similar arguments and responding appropriately. 1. Women have things they have to put up with? Cool beans, so do men. Primarily the issue of being disposable and the possibility of being financially enslaved following a divorce.[14] [14] http://bit.ly... 2. Why women and no-one else? Women are a gender, blacks are a race. This issue of discussion that the Con proposes is that of male disposability, something Black men are not immune to. So MLK day doesn't make ground for anykind of argument. 3. Why call it Vagina Day? This is really mute as I never attack it's name. 4. Plan Also mute as my opposition wasn't how we would enact it, but it's ethical repulsiveness. 5. Portion of others without Holiday Men. Now with all that housekeeping out of the way I'm going to tell you very simply why you need to vote Con in this debate a. Instead of being a good troll and continuing to debate in a silly manner, Pro gets butthurt[15] about how I've decided to respond and makes passive aggressive as well as directly aggressive remarks about my conduct. This is not the mark of a good troll, and serves as a substantial reason to vote Pro. [15]http://bit.ly... b. Pro doesn't even realize how badly he's been trolled as of his previous speech. He doesn't seem to understand that making a serious argument to an obviously silly argument is a brilliant trolling mechanism. If he doesn't have an appropriate response given this reaction, then he deserves to lose. c. Con is winning one every technical round imaginable: I'm winning arguments, framework and sources -- even if you don't buy my argument that a serious response is still a troll, then you'd have to vote for me based on the content of the debate. Finally I'll leave with this: the only possible ground I could see anyone voting for Pro, is by them siding with him that I've 'ruined this debate'. However I'm going to predict that many will largely abstain from voting altogether. Either way I urge a vote for Con.",

It's a magical experience, wolfing down that tennis-racket looking goodness. If you're staying at a Hotel in the great state of Texas, the waffles even come in the shape of the state! It's not even an option thing where you *can* get them in that shape, the griddle is shaped like Texas. Why isn't this something we should recognize on a federal level? 2) It would unite a divided legislature- In order to become a federally recognized holiday, a piece of legislation would have to pass through both the house and Senate. Particularly during an election season, this would be non-contentious and provide a much-needed sense of unity to help restore the US population's faith in government. 3) Waffles are fun, and wildly underrated- While Eggo had it's heyday back in the day, we don't really give the waffle the proper credit it deserves today. If we were to federally recognize national waffle day, Eggo would be primed to come back into the spotlight swinging. That would mean we would see the return of Eggo's hilarious marketing team b) If Eggo would come back to prominence the way it was in the late 90s and Early 2000s, it would pave the way for other snacks that got left behind. Conclusion- Waffles are the bomb dot com, and there is absolutely no reason not to affirm. Federally recognizing National Waffle day would be good for our taste buds, government and soul.",

In 1875 Congress extended the Tuesday date for national House elections and in 1914 for federal Senate elections. This no longer applies to American society because travel is a lot easier and nobody would travel three days to vote. Election day should be moved to the first Saturday in November. This keeps the date close to the other date and does not hurt schedules now too much. It is so inconvenient to leave work on Tuesdays or to generally get around. It would be a lot more convenient for Americans if Election Day was moved to a Saturday. Census data shows that many Americans do not vote due to the fact that it is so inconvenient or unlikely that they will be able to leave work.",

            "premise": "My opponent seems to be sold on the idea that Columbus should be honored for his \"discovery\", simply because If it weren't for him, \"the very creation of modern nations\" wouldn't have occurred. Unfortunately this notion is ridiculous and I will tell you why.. To believe in my opponents claim you have to.. 1. Be completely sold with the thought that Columbus and Columbus only was the one individual who desired to travel to the unknown territories of the globe.. 2. No one in the future would have had the capacity to pull of Columbus's task.. 3. Think that industrialization of nations is accepted by everyone to be an awesome thing. If the exploration aspect of Columbus's legacy is the big concern for you, than why don't we have a national holiday for NASA to commend there achievements in space exploration? At least they didn't commit genocide.. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My responses to con's 3 main topics (1) Columbus's \"Discovery\" First of the \"discovery\" was an accident. Columbus had an entire crew behind him, (which he treated horribly) which right off the bat kind of makes it a bit dumb in the first place to give props only to Columbus. Most importantly the discovery is irrelevant. The main concern with which I have with Columbus Day and why I feel it should not be celebrated is purely for who Columbus was, what he ACTUALLY did, what his real intentions were. Which, sorry were frankly evil, imperialistic, and above all SHOULD NOT be honored with a national holiday. Con parades with the notion that the holiday clearly doesn't celebrate the deaths of native Americans.. To which I reply: No sh*t. That's not the point. The point is the holiday commends Christopher Columbus, who is historically DOCUMENTED as a complete sadist who did nothing but exploit and enslave. So no con, I do not have to prove malicious intent in celebrating Columbus Day, all I have to prove is why Christopher Columbus should not be honored with a national holiday. Con states: \"Even if a hundred genocides occurred\".. Obviously my opponent could careless about who is honored nationally as long as they \"discovered\" something ( By accident) , it doesn't matter how many people or civilizations were wiped out in the process... (2) Genocide As much as my opponent may think he's have been \"proving\" he has really just been running away from my argument. I NEVER said that the intent of Columbus Day was to \"celebrate genocide\". NOT ONCE IN THE ENTIRE DEBATE! NOT ONCE! Con pulled that argument out of thin air. What I did say was.. \"It is in my opinion that Columbus's legacy is grossly misrepresented and that his \"accomplishments\" was nothing more but a failed journey riddled with genocide and imperialism. Thus, Columbus shouldn't be honored with a national holiday.\" Keep in mind that I have restated, and gave further elaboration to my very first argument in both rounds two and three. Con on the other hand has absolutely ignored his first two contentions and merely ran away with his third. (3) Malicious Intent I have repeated myself quite enough and I think by now con may get the picture now and stop pulling that argument out of thin air. As for his argument.. Again, if you sincerely believe that Columbus and Columbus alone is THE individual who is single handedly is entitled to be given thanks for the modernization of nations in the America's I'm afraid you're dead wrong. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *THE BOTTOM LINE* \"Columbus was merely an explorer, actually didn't do much in the Americas except travel. He made four voyages and stopped at numerous locations on the Americas. It was the later conquistadors who were the ones who enslaved and killed natives on a large scale.\" - Con (Face palm) http://www.youtube.com... Disproven. Don't like RT? Think they're full of it? Ok, how about another source.. http://www.youtube.com... Disproven again. Don't like the Biography Channel? Think they're full of it? Alright than, how about another source.. http://www.youtube.com... So I'll ignore cons dead wrong perception of Christopher Columbus and grant him the naive proposition being that Columbus was a great explorer who should be credited with the discovery. Why would the U.S. , have national holiday for an explorer who notoriously is known for enslaving indigenous natives and engaging in genocide. Not only that, but above all never set foot in what would now be considered the United States OR even the continent of North America.. I know I've been a bit harsh with words, so I thank con for accepting this debate and I certainly had fun with it, thank you.",

            "premise": "Here's some fun math to talk about: 1*-1=-1 1*1=1 and -1*-1=1. Likewise in arguments a negative times a negative equals a positive, and negative times a positive is negative. The resolution is a negative statement and I have the positive side; therefore I have a negative burden of proof. You have the negative side so you have Positive burden of proof. therefore it is not my duty to convey why you should not celebrate a holiday until you provide sufficient justification for celebrating. That should win the argument for me in this debate, but lets hypothetically say I don't really think that and believe the voters will not either, then I will go ahead provide more reasons for why you should not. Your refutation about my point of earning more money was your retired. But you see the flaw with that argument is that you should not be retired either. this state of existence is an illogical one to enter into in the first place. the ultimate goal for anyone, God or no God, before they die is to leave the world a better place than when we left it. To contribute to society. As long as there is breath in our bodies this is still something we can do. But often we can never truly measure the good one has done until some time after they have died and there has been enough time to start seeing the chain affects directly resulting from the actions of their life. So in our own live there will never be a day we can say with certainty \"I have left the world a better place than it would have been had I not been born, so I can quit contributing and retire now\" Plus the resolution deals with all atheist, not just you, and we can not assume that all atheist are crippled to a degree that they can not help anymore so retirement is a state of existence they must enter. So its logical to benefit society for as long as possible and never retire, and it is logical to make more money, so one should not celebrate a holiday. Another point worth making, if being a hypocrite honestly is concerning enough to us that avoiding being such warrants stating we should not do certain things, then by your definitions this qualifies well enough as being hypocritical. Because to celebrate Christmas as you defined would bring you to church on Christmas morning reading scriptures about the birth of Christ and how he was a gift of god. You, an atheist, who does not believe their even is a god... well the action would contradict your stated belief. Celebrating L Ron Hubbard's birthday as you defined it would involve passing out copies of his book \"The Way To Happiness\". You, an atheist, who does not believe in any Gods, would be doing something contradictory if you celebrated the life of a man who not only thought that there were gods,but that you could become one. (I am aware that they don't use the 'term' god, but that is what a thetan is). For an atheist the resurrection of the dead is not possible, So it contradicts to celebrate on Easter the rising from the dead of an individual 2,000 years ago. Unless you believe in sin, then Christ sacrifice does not mean anything, so that would contradict in your action to celebrate it. But as I said all this would only be pertinent if being a hypocrite is a relevant factor to whether one 'should' or 'should not' do something. I am not sure I could prove that it is. But they are other reasons I can argue not related to money or being a hypocrite that show you should not celebrate the holiday's. Because it is outright detrimental to the quality of your life to do. One might read that and go 'are you crazy, holidays are fun, an important factor to improving the quality of ones life' One might also not ever go into such deep thought on their own witch is why I pose the question for you. But bear with me and I shall explain. Whether you believe their is a god or their is not, All generally agree that we should live our lives,that our life is ours and we should rise up and live it! the expression 'difference in breathing and being alive' or 'standing outside the fire' is rooted in this philosophy. Everyone would want to 'be alive' (not a reference to your mortality) as being so is described in Tim McGraw's song 'live like you were dying'. I contend that Holiday celebration is a disease to your ability to live like you were dying. The hype surrounding enjoyment of a single day causes a lull into the quality of every other day of the year. You merely 'get by' day to day waiting like a drone for the next holiday to come. I ask you why would anyone logically choose to make Christmas the day for giving gifts and helping the poor? the Native Americans gave presents to each other in potlucks long before the people who brought the celebration of Christmas with them to America. why show special affection to your wife on Valentines day when she deserves it everyday from you? If you recognize the day specifically enough to show romance on it you are accepting in some degree that all other days of the year are not for showing that much affection to her. If you do give her your love on all other day's of the year then there is nothing during Valentines day to even recognize, because it is the same as any other day. All of this is especially important for you Con, because if we ignore the reasons I gave for not retiring and simply look at the purpose and goal behind doing so, you retire so you can spend all your time doing things that are fun. If you live your life in a way that you can not be said to have 'lived like you were dying' then the whole purpose of your retirement is a failure, so it can be argued that it is vital that you avoid holidays that can be a poison to your doing so, so I am arguing it. Maybe it is possible to celebrate holidays without lowering the quality of your life every other day of the year waiting for them to pass by. But if there is the danger's are far to high. So this I find is my best argument to fit my opponents criteria for persuading why he 'should not' observe a religious holiday, because it not enough to warrant explicit forbidding statements in my conclusion, but enough to advise against. So to wrap up: 1) Con had the positive burden to justify celebrating any holiday in the first place. 2) retirement is not a logical reason to pass up overtime, because retirement is not logical in the first place 3) Observing (as Con defined) the holiday's (as Con defined) honestly is contradictory in action with the professed belief. So if being a hypocrite is concerning to you, vote Pro. 4) Every man dies, but not everyman lives. don't waste your life waiting for holiday's make every day special, and in effect make nothing special about the holidays. For any of the above 4 reasons I urge the voters to vote Pro on arguments Because My opponent has sourced to define stuff and not directly back up an argument, nearly ignoring the definitions as was, vote Pro on sources. As for spelling and grammar, vote Con, I understand why Conduct, vote tie, I have enjoyed this debate and do not see any uncordial act on either side.

            "premise": "Good morning, noon, or evening!My name is arrowjaw. Today I will be participating in a debate in which I am the Pro, or the Affirmative. I am for the resolution. It is my burden to prove to you, the voter, that the resolution is true or should be carried out. It is also my burden to refute the arguments of the Con, or the Negative, who is against the resolution. Similarly, the opposition must prove to the voter that the resolution is false or should not be carried out. This debate has the following resolution:Should Columbus day be a national holiday in the United StatesMy opponent has set the character limit to 3,000, so I cannot structure an adequate debate. I will, thus, respond to my opponent only. My opponent begins by saying that Columbus day is a holiday because \"he was Italian and Catholic\". Italians and Catholics first lobbied for Columbus Day to become a federal holiday in the United States. This is in no a way a detriment to Columbus day. African-Americans were proud to be of the same heritage of M.L.K., and the rest of America admired him for his achievements. Columbus is the same. Just because his holiday was first urged on by members of his heritage does not mean that it should not be a federal holiday. My opponent says that \"[Columbus] did not discover America...there were native tribes living in the Americas for centuries before Columbus landed\". When people say 'Columbus discovered America', they are referencing that he discovered it for the more civilized and more technologically advanced part of the world: Eurasia and Africa. This is frankly a ridiculous and ignorant attempt to discredit Columbus for a monumental achievement. My opponent said that \"[Columbus] never touched down in the modern-day United States\". How can you blame him directly, place only the blame on him for all the deaths of the Natives of the Americas if, in your own words, he never even landed there. He paved the way for the colonization of the New World. He is not, however, responsible for the disgusting way in which the New World was conquered and colonized. My opponent then goes on to consent that \"his exploration led to other European nations exploring the Americas and led to the colonizing of the Americas.\" If that is not an achievement worthy of a holiday I do not know what is. My opponent has contradicted himself and consented, in his own words, that Columbus completed a monumental achievement, which is obviously worthy of, at least, a federal holiday. The Spanish Conquistadors may have killed millions in their conquests of South and Meso America, but that does not mean that Columbus is responsible for those deaths. Just as Karl Benz created the car but is not blamed for automobile-related deaths, Columbus should not be blamed for the horrific actions of others whom he had no control over.",

            "premise": "I am not going to touch on the court case issue, as it has nothing to do with whether or not April Fool's is an atheist holiday. You have provided no reason for why April Fool's day would be an atheist holiday beside your one reference to Scripture. You must establish why that Scripture should determine when an atheist has a holiday. I could provide you with a citation from Dawkins or Hitchins that says \"Christians are fools.\" Would that make April Fool's Day a Christian holiday? You say \"Christians could not take Groundhog's Day as a holiday because it has no connections to Jesus Christ.\" I the same way, atheists could not take April 1st as a holiday because it has no connection to atheism. Indeed the fact that you link atheism to the date through scriptures is a striking reason why April 1st would NOT be an atheist holiday. Atheist would try to distance themselves from the connection as much as possible. Once again, why would atheists be linked to a date through Christian Scripture? That makes as much sense as setting a Buddhist day of celebration based on the Koran. I have no idea what the Gregorian calendar has to do with April 1st being an atheist holiday. A digression: atheists follow the calendar because it is historical contingency that happens to be used in our society. Some new points: You may be right that atheists are fools, but that does not make April 1st the atheistic holiday. Your conclusion is essentially drawn from the following premises: April 1st is the holiday of fools. Atheists are fools (so sayeth scripture) April 1st is the holiday of atheists. However, a large number of groups are fools (nazi's, flat earth-ists, clowns, people who gamble large quantities of money). So April 1st is their holiday also. This shows that the holiday is not a day designed for atheists \"to celebrate their non-faith.\" The holiday is not exclusively for atheists. Furthermore, as you state the atheist holiday is \"to celebrate their non-faith.\" Yet April 1st has nothing to do with a celebration of non-faith. It is already steeped in traditions of practical jokes that have nothing to do with atheism (please do not try and make some witty jab at atheism in response). In fact, your own argument shows that the link between April 1st and atheists is not \"a [celebration] of non-faith,\" but their apparent foolishness. Finally, what is a holiday? Merriam Webster: \"Holiday\" 1: holy day 2: a day on which one is exempt from work; specifically : a day marked by a general suspension of work in commemoration of an event 3:chiefly British : vacation \u2014often used in the phrase on holiday \u2014often used in plural 4: a period of exemption or relief Clearly an atheist could not have 1, a holy day, and April 1st isn't one anyways. April 1st does not meet the criteria of a holiday under 2, because there is still school and work on April 1st. 3 also does not apply because April 1st is not a vacation. Finally, atheists do not receive a period of exemption or relief on April 1st, so it is not a April 1st is not a holiday PERIOD, much less an atheist holiday.",

            "premise": "Christopher Columbus was a terrible person who killed and enslaved many for self-gain. It is disgusting that to this day we celebrate him annually with a national holiday in his very name: Columbus Day. We as a society should not honor this man. We need to acknowledge that he was not a hero but a greedy mass-murderer. The atrocity that I hint at is his genocide against the Arawak Indians. After encountering these Indians, he wrote thus in his log of them: \"They would make fine servants\u2026With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.\" He also said this: \"As soon as I arrived in the Indies, in the first island which I found, I took by force some of the natives, in order that they might learn and might give me information of that which there is in these parts.\" From the very start he treated the peaceful Indians forcefully. He later sent many as slaves to Spain. In 1495, he sent 500 Arawak slaves back to Spain, 200 of which died on the voyage. He wrote: \"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold\" Christopher Columbus also forced all Arawaks 14 years or older to pay a certain amount of gold to them per month. If they failed to do this, they were killed. Many fled, and were hunted down and killed by Columbus and his men. Indians were worked endlessly in mines. With these terrors, mass suicides started being committed amongst the dwindling Indians. And point in case, in 2 years, half of the Indians on Haiti were dead. And so when we go back and look at history, we see that Christopher Columbus was a terrible human-being who should not be honored with his own national holiday. -Harlan",

Psalm 14:1 states, \"The fool says in his heart, that there is no God.\" Thus, if an atheist says there is no God, then by scripture, he is a fool and April 1st is his holiday. Get it? April Fools Day. Atheist is fool for not believing in God. Fool...Fools Day? Must I keep hitting on this point each round? \"I the same way, atheists could not take April 1st as a holiday because it has no connection to atheism.

You posted all lot of definitions round one so I expect you to keep those. \"So I am taking the Con and pose this debate to anyone who is willing to tell me why I should NOT observe Christmas, Easter, St. Patrick's Day, Rosh Hashanah, L. Ron Hubbard's birthday or Halloween.\" I note your use of the term OR in this sentence. So this indicates all I must do to negate the resolution is effectively show why you should not observe at least one of them. To come strait to the point One should not observe any holiday, even if one is not an atheist. They have no logistical providing purpose for you personally. They either take up your time or your money celebrating the customary or accepted way. At Christmas time the customs dictate you buy presents for relatives you may not necessarily like. At thanksgiving the social imposition is put on you or perhaps someone close to you that you care about to put together a feast for these same relatives to eat. Icons like plastic eggs and green attire has lost their symbolic meaning to us they used to have for people. When one drives by a house with Christmas lights on it nothing iconic really comes to mind about light and righteousness as supposedly intended, only 'hey those look pretty' and maybe 'I wonder how they made those work that way' or 'were can I buy lights like that' It takes time and energy and money to put up those lights on your house. In this flip flopping economy every penny you have counts. To assure security in ones finances one should not live beyond their means by purchasing things that do them no good. One should not stay home Halloween night passing out candy when they could be using this time to work overtime and get paid more! It is common knowledge that most jobs cant let you work on holiday's without paying a greater amount than is standard. Logistically one can hardly justify expending ones time on trying to follow the acceptable customs of holidays when you have the alternative of using that time on something that will reward you with cash not normally at an option for you to acquire. Even if you believe in God you can avoid celebrating all these things without contradicting your scriptural beliefs because most of them are not even mentioned in those scriptures. Without believing in a God their is even less of interest offered by these holiday's. Even if there was something to consider of interest for you, it could never come off as the better choice of your options in what to do with your time, because overtime on holiday's pays a large amount compared to whatever your standard income is. So in conclusion 1) spending time and resources on resources pays back as much as investing your money in watching a baseball game at a stadium. 2) The customary symbols of the holidays are not very effective at communicating anything to you as part of your surroundings 3) Overtime on holiday's is a much more fiscal, thrifty, and logical use of your time. Therefore you should not pick the less logical of actions; as long as we are purely talking about what one 'should' do. and the less logical Is observing the customs of these holiday's. http://www.opm.gov...",

Someone who is power and has influence, Most powerful people would not go through the trouble of announcing it, So it's likely it would not happen anyways.

This sounds like you just wanted to poke fun at atheists, not like you had something interesting the argue about. I searched on the internet for a court case involving the lack of an \"Atheist holiday,\" but could find no reference to an actual court case. What I did find was a myriad of internet JOKES about a case in florida like this, with the punch line of \"you already have april fool's day.\" You say \"no joke this has been brought up in many state courts nationwide.\" Since YOU make this claim, YOU have the burden of proof. Either present evidence for this claim (i.e., the names of some court cases we could reference), or admit that we have no reason to believe these cases exist. Now, of course \"the idea of an atheist being upset/discriminated by a theist holiday\" makes no sense. In fact I have never heard of an atheist complaining about the existence of a theist holiday. What they DO complain about is government endorsement of theist holidays. Of course whether this is legitimate or not isn't pertinent to the debate. As to the \"April Fool's Day\" Issue: 1) I have never known an atheist to celebrate or consider April Fool's Day an atheist holiday. I have seen atheists celebrate (as a joke) the autumnal equinox and 11/11 (palindrome day). If atheists do not celebrate a day, it seems silly to think that it is a holiday for them. 2) It is extremely ironic to decide \"BY SCRIPTURE\" that April 1st is an atheist holiday. Why would an atheist holiday be based on scripture? 3) If Christians are justified in deciding Atheists have a holiday on April 1st by Christian standards (i.e., scripture), then Atheists can do the same thing to Christians and say that Groundhog's day is a Christian holiday, because Christians believe in nonsensical and meaningless rituals.

It does not recognize any other religious holiday in the same way. By recognizing and celebrating Christmas above all other religious festivals, the government is demonstrating a preference for Christianity above all other religions. My opponent has not bothered to argue this point, and so I assume he recognizes it as true. Con said: \u201cThe Federal Government does not force it's [sic] employees to \"celebrate this religious festival\". The paid holiday period can\u2026be ignored. If a federal employee views religious observance as an anathema to their ideology, they may choose to utilize their paid time-off in any non-religious fashion.\u201d Thank goodness! Imagine a state of affairs where citizens were actually driven into churches and forced to pray! You\u2019re right, Heineken. That would be much, much worse. It\u2019s bad enough, though, the government showing such a marked preference for Christianity and making all federal employees take a day of out of respect to a religion they may not follow. Con said: \u201cnot all Federal Offices close down for the Holidays\u2026 All Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines that do not submit an official request for Holiday leave, will be required to report for normal duty.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Heineken, that they don\u2019t stand down the entire military for Christmas, or indeed for any federal holiday. I suppose they keep the essential services running. I don\u2019t really see how that affects the argument, though. Con said: \u201cPro must show that\u2026mandatory leave is viewed negatively by the employee.\u201d You astonish me. I would never have thought you would put a citizen\u2019s feelings before his rights. Or that you would say freedom is about being positive. I disagree entirely, and for many reasons that are well outside the scope of this debate. I will only say here that this debate is not about people\u2019s emotions. It is about whether the US government should stop imposing religious observance onto its citizens in the form of the Christmas Day holiday. And yes, it should stop. ------------------ Con said: \u201cThe average Federal revenue for holiday sales in [sic] 565.5 billion dollars, which is a 565 billion dollar profit margin, after spending .5 billion on federal holiday pay.\u201d This is my favorite of all your arguments, because of the large sums of money involved and because of its ambiguity. What point are you trying to make here? If only there were an extra round, I could ask. As it is, I will take a few guesses at what your argument might be, and rebut them in turn. 1. Christmas day pays for itself. Non-Christians don\u2019t have to subsidize it. Actually, according to your own sources, \u201choliday sales\u201d mean all sales in November and December and \u201cHolidays during this period include Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.\u201d http://www.nrf.com...... In fact, there is no information here about how much money in taxes Christmas contributes specifically. In any case, the government encourages non-Christians to give gifts, send cards and put up Christmas trees. To contribute taxes, in other words. So whether it\u2019s though sales or income tax, non-Christians are subsidizing this religious festival. 2. We\u2019re so gloriously rich here in America, what difference does half a billion dollars make? Half a billion dollars is still a substantial amount of money. And it\u2019s the principle of the thing. Citizens can\u2019t choose whether or not to subsidize Christmas Day. The government makes them. 3. Christmas Day makes money for the government. Therefore, the government is right to encourage it. As you convincingly argued elsewhere, Christians aren\u2019t alone in having gift-giving festivals. The government doesn\u2019t need to mandate a federal holiday to rake in the benefits of religion. In any case, this is a distressingly cynical line to take. Surely religious freedom and equality are worth more than a seasonal rise in retail sales? ------------------ Con said: \u201cThe Jewish Holiday of Purim\u2026Hanukkah\u2026Eids\u2026Diwali far exceeds Christmas in extravagance and duration. The Chinese New Year celebrates elaborately with gifts and festivities.\u201d So true. So many wonderful cultural and religious festivals that thrive without government interference! Why can\u2019t Christmas be like that too? Con said: \u201cThe Jews do not celebrate Christmas, neither do the Muslims. The Indians also do not observe Christmas and cultural Chinese members of the U.S. also do not observe Christmas. In fact\u2026 80% of Americans observe the Holidays for non-religious reasons. Christmas is not religious, it's a commercial Holiday.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Heineken. Yes, the vast majority of Americans find no religious significance in Christmas Day. It makes sense, then, to replace Christmas with a secular holiday. Such as winter solstice. ------------------ Con said: \u201c I challenge my opponent to provide this official federal designation\u2026This is a straw-man argument. No such federal position, law, guideline or clause (no pun intended) exists.\u201d I\u2019m sorry. I did put the US government link in, but you had to find it on the list of links at the bottom, click on it, then scroll down to find the right bit. I should have just put in the quote directly. Here it is. \u201cChristmas is a Christian holiday marking the birth of the Christ Child. Decorating houses and yards with lights, putting up Christmas trees, giving gifts, and sending greeting cards have become holiday traditions even for many non-Christian Americans.\u201d http://www.usa.gov... What\u2019s a \u201cstraw man argument\u201d? It sounds bad, almost as if you\u2019re accusing me of making things up. But I\u2019ve included sources all along. Con said: \u201cIt should be noted that Christmas is not a national Holiday. Congress does not have the power to declare a national Holiday. It can only pass federal observance.\u201d Ah. So that\u2019s the difference between a \u201cnational holiday\u201d and a \u201cfederal holiday\u201d. Thanks. That\u2019s really interesting. Conclusion There are eleven federal holidays in the US. Only one of these, Christmas Day, is a religious festival. The government has no business showing such respect and preference to Christianity. The US prides itself on being a country of religious freedom. Federal holidays, which are compulsory holidays for all federal employees (in non-essential services), and which are subsidized by US tax-payers, should be secular and inclusive. Christmas Day should be celebrated by Christians in a private manner, just as people of other beliefs celebrate their own festivals.",

            "premise": "Pro stated:\"On Christmas Day, federal government employees are forced to take a day off to celebrate this religious festival, and they are paid to do so.\" Rebuttal: The Federal Government does not force it's employees to \"celebrate this religious festival\". The paid holiday period can be observed, but it can also be ignored. If a federal employee views religious observance as an anathema to their ideology, they may choose to utilize their paid time-off in any non-religious fashion best suited to their ideology. In fact, not all Federal Offices close down for the Holidays. The Department of Defense requires it's employees to submit a request for Holiday-down time. All Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines that do not submit an official request for Holiday leave, will be required to report for normal duty. The military leave policy can be review here: Army --Army Regulation 600-8-10 - Leaves and Passes Air Force --Air Force Instruction 36-3003 - Military Leave Program Navy --MILPERSMAN 1050, Leave and Liberty Marine Corps --Marine Corps Order (MCO) P1050.3H - Regulations for Leave, Liberty, and Administrative Absence To satisfy the burden of this premise, Pro must show that observance of the Christmas ceremony is being forced upon federal employees, that mandatory leave is viewed negatively by the employee. ------------------ Pro stated:\"Each year, Christmas Day costs US tax-payers around half a billion dollars.\" Rebuttal: The Unites States government's gross annual revenue from domestic product sales is estimated at 2.9 trillion dollars at the Federal level. [1] Approximately 19.5% of these sales occur over the Holiday season. [2] The average Federal revenue for holiday sales in 565.5 billion dollars, which is a 565 billion dollar profit margin, after spending .5 billion on federal holiday pay. ------------------ Pro stated: \"No other religion is celebrated in this way, of course. Christmas Day is the only compulsory religious festival in the US calendar.\" Rebuttal: The Jewish Holiday of Purim is a big Israeli gift-exchanging holiday, but Hanukkah celebrates eight days of gift-giving in the North American tradition. The Muslims exchange gifts over two Eids in Ramadan as well. The Indian celebration of Diwali far exceeds Christmas in extravagance and duration. The Chinese New Year celebrates elaborately with gifts and festivities. Hence: The Jews do not celebrate Christmas, neither do the Muslims. The Indians also do not observe Christmas and cultural Chinese members of the U.S. also do not observe Christmas. In fact, while wikipedia reports that 78% of Americans are Christians, a recent Gallup reported in the \"Statistical Illusion\" article showed that only 20% of Americans are truly Christians, as defined by their Church. [3] That means 80% of Americans observe the Holidays for non-religious reasons. Christmas is not religious, it's a commercial Holiday. ------------------ Pro Claimed: The government designates the following Christmas activities as appropriate \"even for\" non-Christian Americans: Decorating houses and yards with lights, Putting up \"Christmas\" trees, Giving gifts, Sending greeting cards\" Rebuttal: I challenge my opponent to provide this official federal designation. Which federal law, passed in which year by what ruling body made the above list a federal \"designation\"? This is a straw-man argument. No such federal position, law, guideline or clause (no pun intended) exists. Federal observance of the Christmas Holiday was passed in 1870. It did not dictate how the holiday should be observed. \u3000 Conclusion: It should be noted that Christmas is not a national Holiday. Congress does not have the power to declare a national Holiday. It can only pass federal observance. Non-government entities are not required to shut down for Christmas. \"Constitutionally, there are no \"national holidays\" in the United States because Congress only has authority to create holidays for federal institutions (including federally owned properties) and employees, and for the District of Columbia.\" [4] Lastly, it should be noted that getting time off for the Christmas season does not mandate Church attendance or religious observance. You are free to spend Christmas catching up on sleep, getting drunk, or like most Americans, try to take advantage of spectacular discounts on retail prices. Going to Church is optional. \u3000\u3000 \u3000 http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com... [1] http://www.nrf.com... [2] http://www.christianitytoday.com... [3] http://en.wikipedia.org... [4]",

            "premise": "Hello, I am XStrikeX representing the opposition/con side of this debate. I am stating that the American public should say \"happy holdiays,\" rather then saying \"merry Christmas.\" Introduction: Certain people of English-speaking countries have said \"Merry Christmas\" to each other around the time of Christmas in December. This tradition has been amplified in the last century. Now within the services and retail businesses as well as in government, many have successfully argued that the term should be changed to \"Happy Holidays\", because such a statement expresses a religiously neutral perspective and is an inclusive term. The controversy has become particularly prominent in larger retail stores such as Wal-Mart, which have a prominent place in the present-buying surrounding Christmas. Wal-Mart actually began encouraging the use of the term \"happy holidays\" in place of \"Merry Christmas\" in 2004 and 2005. This move was met by significant opposition, causing Wal-Mart to change course in 2006 and subsequent years, where it began using the term \"Merry Christmas\" once again. In 2009, in a similar instance, Best Buy changed its policy, defining \"happy holidays\" as their preferred form of seasons greetings. And for the first time ever, in 2009, the White House called their \"Christmas tree\" a \"holiday tree.\" These and other moves by companies and governments at different levels have stimulated a major debate. Points: 1. Happy holidays includes all religions and faiths. Hanukkah and sometimes Eid al Fitr fall in the same period as Christmas. Hanukkah as a Holiday predates the Christmas holiday by almost 200 years [4] as it dates from the 1st Century AD. Christmas was forbidden by the early Christian Church and created a Holiday coinciding with the pagan Feast of Sol Invictus by the Roman Emperor, Constantine the Great, in the 4th century AD. 2. Merry Christmas is offensive. Organizations and businesses that have a policy of saying \"merry Christmas\" risk being seen as favoring Christians. A non-Christian that receives the message \"merry Christmas\" could certainly, therefore, feel their faith is being excluded or just under-considered, and could thus react very negatively to the message. Subsequently, while \"merry Christmas\" certainly makes Christians happy, it carries the risk of offending non-Christians. No matter what the intended \"spirit\" of \"merry Christmas\", this risk is real for non-Christians. I look forward to debating with my opponent.",

            "premise": "First, this debate was not intended to be a joke or poke fun at atheist thinking. However, if you are from the opposite point of view, it may appear to look that way in nature. There are many cases to which this has happened across the country. Honestly, searching the \"Internet\" for a few moments will not always uncover the treasures of knowledge in which you seek. It usually takes a little more probing. Must I find the links to issues such as: ~ the atheist family who took their school to court so that the school choir would not sing Christian Christmas songs during the Christmas program (optional participation). ~ the atheist individual who petitioned his child's school to continue schooling during Easter and Christmas break because of religios discrimination. Do I need to go on with my points, or can you \"research\" them yourself? \"In fact I have never heard of an atheist complaining about the existence of a theist holiday.\" An aquintance of mine, an atheist, just complained to me (a Christian) the other day about the Christmas holiday. Stating that it should not exist based on the assumption that the holiday derives from a myth. This happens on a daily basis in regards to atheist perceptions of theist holidays. In response to your points: 1) That is the point of this debate. To have a holiday, set by the Western American calendar, that allows for atheists to celebrate their \"non-faith.\" 2) By default, atheists must follow the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian calendar is rooted in the Christian faith. The following link shows this to be true and explains http://en.wikipedia.org... I'm guessing you do follow the Gregorian Calendar? 3) Christians could not take Groundhog's Day as a holiday because it has no connections to Jesus Christ. However, like I said before...Consider Psalm 14:1 states, \"The fool says in his heart, that there is no God.\" Thus, if an atheist says there is no God, then by scripture, he is a fool and April 1st is his holiday.",

Refutation/Rebuttal My opponent has claimed that it is offensive to atheists if you tell them, \"Happy Holidays.\" However, this is untrue, for even atheists celebrate Christmas. According to the NY Times, many atheists celebrate Christmas. Even Charles Darwin, the challenger of Christianity who came up with the idea that God didn't create man celebrated Christmas with his family. Also, according to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, \"holiday\" can be defined as \"a day exempt from work.\" Many people are allowed to go on vacation and others are allowed to take their day off to celebrate with their family. So in other words, \"happy holidays\" can possibly mean, \"happy day-off.\" Also, my opponent has not furthered their case why \"Merry Christmas\" is any better than \"happy holidays.\" Happy holidays is more inclusive, even as my opponent said. She said \"happy holidays\" celebrates Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanza, and I previously stated that those with a day off of work can be told \"happy holidays,\" and even atheists celebrate holidays like Christmas. My opponent even said that Merry Christmas means belief in Jesus/God which is Christianity. One religion is included in Merry Christmas, whereas several are included in Happy holidays. I wish my opponent luck, and would like to thank her for accepting this debate.",

However, this is (a) making the assumption that all atheists celebrate Christmas, and (b) does not address the problem of offending someone. If the whole benefit of saying \"Happy Holidays\" is that it presumes the person you're greeting does not believe in Jesus, but merely celebrates a holiday, then saying \"Happy holidays\" still presumes that they're celebrating a holiday of some kind. Also, Con notes that \"holiday\" can refer to \"day off\" therefore saying \"Happy Holidays\" is just a way of telling one to enjoy their day off. However, not everyone has off the holidays so again this greeting is based on the same assumptions that \"Merry Christmas\" is. Further, people say \"Happy holidays\" during the holiday season, and people do not have off all throughout the holiday season therefore this analogy isn't even completely cohesive. Moreover, if Con's argument is that people get off from work on Christmas and therefore saying \"Happy Holidays\" is appropriate, then the exact same thing can be said about saying \"Merry Christmas.\" If I say \"Merry Christmas\" to an atheist, then maybe I am simply telling them to enjoy their day off, right? Christmas is indeed celebrated on December 25th therefore saying \"Merry Christmas\" can just as easily be translated to, \"Merry day off\" by my opponent's own standards. In conclusion, I admit that saying \"Happy holidays\" includes 2 holidays more than one therefore it is logically obviously more inclusive. However, not many people in the U.S. celebrate Hanukkah or Kwanzaa anyway therefore the number of people this satisfies isn't dramatically greater. More importantly, it does not address the problem of offending non-believers which is Con's whole argument of why he supports saying \"Happy holidays\" in the first place. The phrase \"Happy holidays\" ignores non-believers, Muslims, Buddists, and a handful of other religions I mentioned and cited in R1. If \"Happy Holidays\" translates to \"Happy day off,\" the same could be said about the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" since Christmas is usually a day that people have off. That said, the reason I cited in the last round about why \"Merry Christmas\" is acceptable was (let me copy and paste to prove I addressed this) -- \"Con is is ignoring people's right to free speech. There is nothing immoral, dangerous or even explicitly rude about saying \"Merry Christmas.\" If one chooses to take offense to it, then that is their prerogative.\" Here you can see that my argument isn't that saying \"Merry Christmas\" is BETTER but that it's merely equal, so Con saying \"Happy Holidays\" is better has been negated. Further, I have explained that saying \"Merry Christmas\" shouldn't be considered taboo or politically incorrect simply because people have a right to say it, it's not offensive and it is more of a personal and genuine greeting to those who believe in Christmas. Thanks again, Con, and good luck to ya.",

PRO admits that 60 million people died in World War II, so all of the deaths in every other wars amount to 90 million. Do you see what I'm getting at?If only 150 million people died in every war ever, making a special holiday for those who served specifically in World War II would be extremely unfair to people who served in other wars, as they aren't getting as much respect and credit for their efforts. Not only that, but 60 million people are getting honored rather than 90 million. Singling out specifically 60 million out of 150 million is unfair to the other soldiers/civilians and ludicrous, especially since it is more probable that a higher number of casualties were a result from wars.Yes, World War II was a tragedy, but PRO's claim that specifically those who were involved in that specific war rather than every person involved in every war should somehow receive more credit, respect and honor than others who were involved in every other war is ridiculous, not to mention we already honor everybody who served and/or died in wars.Therefore, vote CON.Ciatations[1]-http://www.nytimes.com...",

Time for the final round. :D A key thing I would like to point out to the audience is that the proposition has only refuted my points, while never actually proving why Merry Christmas is any better than Happy Holidays. My opponent has stated that when I argue that happy holidays is about telling someone to enjoy their day off, merry Christmas has the same effect. However, this is untrue, and can be separated by a single word. Holiday. Merry Christmas does not contain the word holiday and points to a specific day. Plus, there are many other religions besides the idea of Atheism and Merry Christmas solely includes Christianity, while leaving out Judaism and Kwanzaa. \"Con begins by stating that it is not offensive to say \"Happy Holidays\" to atheists, because many atheists do in fact celebrate Christmas even if they don't believe in Jesus. However, this is (a) making the assumption that all atheists celebrate Christmas, and (b) does not address the problem of offending someone.\" Well, saying \"Merry Christmas\" is even worse. It does not include as many faiths as \"Happy Holidays\" and assumes that the person is Christian. The proposition has failed to show why Merry Christmas is better. Just because we can say it, doesn't mean that we should say it or that it is better or more respectful. According to U.S. News, 52% of the American public are offended by Merry Christmas to some degree. This adds to a 2005 Pew University poll which shows that 26 percent of Americans are extremely irritated by the saying. \"The phrase \"Happy holidays\" ignores non-believers, Muslims, Buddists, and a handful of other religions I mentioned and cited in R1.\" The phrase \"Merry Christmas\" ignores non-believers, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, and other religions, too. Happy holidays includes more religions than Merry Christmas, which is why it is better. For these reasons, Happy Holidays is better than Merry Christmas.

The basis of their thinking is the fact that there is no real exsistence of a spiritual being or God. If this is the case, they do not (like they expect us to leave their expressions alone) to partake in any of the festivities that go along with any theist holiday (and no, no one makes you).

            "premise": "My opponent stated that this date remembers the injustice done to aboriginals over the years, but it has s much more meaning then that. This is a day to celebrate how far we have come as a nation and what we have achieved since settlers have arrived in Australia. Bad things happened to aboriginals for many years, but we have grown from that which I, and many other aboriginals, think is the true meaning of Australia Day. I agree that the aborigines need proper recognition after all that has happened to them, but the 26th of January is a very important day for Australians and that shouldn\"t be taken away from us. Instead of changing the date, face the real problems in society. We should not forget the wrongdoings done to indigenous people when the English settled in Australia, but we should learn from the past and move forward from it. Aboriginals should be recognised as the traditional owners of the land, and then we should all move forward as a nation and celebrate the new era of our country, where changing the date of celebrating our nation should not matter. My position in this argument is against changing the date of Australia Day, a national holiday, celebrating all things Australian on the 26th January each year. The history of Australia is very significant in our lives and makes us who we are today. This date symbolises when Australia was first recognised as a country, and settled by the English. This era was a time of inequality and conflict between different groups of people, but we have grown from our mistakes and are now second on the UN\"s human development index. Australians have celebrated this holiday on this date for nearly 100 years. What better date could we choose to best represent our growth as a nation? The 26th of January reflects the origins of our country and the nation it has become. This date is and always will be an important date for Australian history, no matter what people choose to think. Changing the date of Australia Day cannot erase our history. No matter what, our history will always be a time of injustice. Instead of thinking about how awful aboriginals were treated, we should learn from that injustice and create a better place for everyone, which is shown on Australia Day. Australian Of The Year is awarded on this day, which encourages people to speak out about injustice in different communities and is a great time for everyone to remember the true owners of this land, aboriginals. This award focuses on the good work being done now, and acknowledges the past, but focuses on the present. As Mother Theresa once said, \"Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today, let us begin.\"",

            "discussionTitle": "Merry Christmas vs. Happy Holidays",
            "conclusion": "Merry Christmas vs. Happy Holidays",
            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for the debate! I'll respond to Con in the order of argument he's presented... 1. First, Con says that I have not stated why saying \"Merry Christmas\" is better than saying \"Happy Holidays.\" I have actually refuted this in 2 ways, and explained explicitly how in the last round. First, I said that my burden isn't necessarily to prove that saying \"Merry Christmas\" is better but simply that it is equally appropriate. Second, even if for some reason you would assume that my burden is to prove that saying \"Happy Holidays\" is BETTER, I have already explicitly stated in the last round that, \"saying 'Merry Christmas' shouldn't be considered taboo or politically incorrect simply because people have a right to say it, it's not offensive, and it is more of a personal and genuine greeting to those who believe in Christmas.\" Therefore Con is incorrect in saying that I have not fulfilled a burden or ignored something in particular. 2. Con says that \"Merry Christmas\" refers to a specific day and therefore it is not as acceptable to say. However, people start saying \"Happy Holidays\" from late November to early January, generally through New Years Day [1] though Christmas is only on one of those days, and Hanukkah and Kwanzaa only last for 7-8 days out of that 28 day period. In other words, there is no actual holiday going on during the times when people say \"Happy Holidays\" for 3/4 of the time. Therefore it is implied that \"Happy Holidays\" is a general greeting just as \"Merry Christmas\" is a general greeting and they generally mean the same thing. Neither greeting actually implies that there is an actual holiday going on during that day. If that were true, then people wouldn't say \"Happy holidays\" long after something like Hanukkah has ended. Even more proof is the fact that Kwanzaa in particular begins AFTER Christmas on December 26 [2], which is usually when people stop saying \"Happy Holidays.\" The point here is that when people say \"Merry Christmas\" they say it long before the actual Christmas day therefore you can't say that \"Merry Christmas\" only acknowledges one day and \"Happy holidays\" acknowledges more than one day. The fact is that those phrases both, in general, mean the same thing and there is no actual way to know if someone is celebrating something, therefore the phrase is generally a representation of what the individual celebrates. If one chooses to take offense, that is their preoperative; however, it is just as offensive to assume that one celebrates any holiday to begin with. 3. Con acknowledges that there are more religions aside from atheism, which proves absolutely nothing. I've already acknowledged this and actually listed a bunch of the world's most popular religions in order, so...? My point was that saying \"Happy holidays\" assumes one is either Christian, Jewish or celebrates the African culture - which is no different or better than assuming someone celebrates just Christianity. 4. Con says that \"Merry Christmas\" excludes Judaism and Kwanzaa. That's entirely true - and so what? It's not my job or anyone else's job to make everyone feel included. If Wal-Mart wanted to hang a giant sign that said, \"Merry Christmas!\" then that would be their prerogative. If people felt excluded - oh well. Once again, this is no different than Atheists feeling excluded (or awkward) about \"Happy holidays,\" and I'm sure it's no different from how Muslims might feel excluded since Wal-Mart doesn't hang a sign that says, \"Happy Ramadan.\" Also, many times the holidays of Easter and Passover over-lap; for instance Passover in 2010 lasted from March 29 to April 5 [3] and Easter for Christians was on April 4. However, nobody said \"Happy holidays\" despite the fact that 2 major religions were both celebrating holidays at that time. Instead, one either said \"Happy Passover\" or \"Happy Easter,\" and if the person receiving the greeting did not celebrate either/or holiday, then they would simply make a correction if they felt so inclined. No harm no foul. 5. Con says, \"Just because we can say it [Merry Christmas] doesn't man that we should say it or that it is better or more respectful.\" Once again, the exact same thing can be said about \"Happy holidays.\" Con also has not shown why saying \"Merry Christmas\" is disrespectful. Also, I don't think that saying \"Happy holidays\" is more respectful simply because it includes the holiday of one other faith (Judaism) - especially because it implies that one is either Christian or Jewish, as if no other religion or belief system exists. 6. Con notes that 52% of Americans feel offended by the saying, \"Merry Christmas.\" However, this statistic should hold absolutely no weight. For one, CON NEVER CITED THIS SOURCE meaning we have no incentive to believe him. Second, 83% of Americans identify as Christian [4] ... so how can Con's statistic be true?! If more than 8 out of 10 people are Christian, then how can more than 5 out of 10 feel offended by the phrase, \"Merry Christmas?\" I Google'd this statistic and could not find it anywhere [5]. However, I did find that Rasmussen Reports reported 69% of Americans usually greet each other with \"Merry Christmas\" anyway [6] and since most people are Christian, many actually get offended when people say \"Happy holidays\" to them instead. In fact, \"A 2005 survey by Pew Research found that 42 percent of Americans preferred the \"Merry Christmas\" greeting over the non-religious \"Seasons Greetings.\" But 45 percent of Americans said it did not matter what greeting they received\" [7]. The same source expresses how political correctness should never trump our first amendment right to free speech, which is what I was explaining in Point 1 and how I countered Con's argument. Conclusion: Con ends by saying that \"Happy holidays\" is more appropriate because while both terms are inclusive and exclusive, the phrase \"H H\" includes more people. However, I've already explained two things. One - Since 83% of Americans are Christian, it's really not THAT more inclusive. Two - Since all other holidays are ignored, and Atheists do not fit into either category, Con is essentially saying \"Well it's okay if we make the Muslims feel left out so long as we include the Christians, Jews and Africans.\" This presents a double standard and does not solve the dilemma that there will be people left out and/or offended either way. In that case, it's best to let people say whichever phrase they prefer -- probably \"Merry Christmas\" since most people are Christian -- and be open minded if others get offended at people's right to free speech.

The world was at war in World War I as well. 2: 'but civilians deaths were so bad. people were caught in a war they didn't want be in.'Why is that different from any other war?3: 'the civilians in japan had the atomic bomb dropped on them. two cities with population of about 300,000 each according to my history book. so has their ever been another war were a atomic bomb or nuke dropped? no their has not. because the cold war was based on it it but the we never nuked each because well plenty of reasons. so those civilians need to be recognized'I think the important thing here is that civilians died and were injured. That is no different from any other war. Yes, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was horrible. But that doesn't change the fact that all civilian casualties from wars are just as tragic. Contention 1/P1: Having an honor day for a group who fought and/or lost their lives in one war is unfair to everybody who fought in every other war, because they deserve credit as well as respect and I already proved that it would be a ridiculous idea to honor every single war on separate days. P2: People who fought and/or lost their lives in other single war deserve credit and respect too. C1:Therefore, it would be unfair to people who lost their lives and/or fought in every other war if people involved in World War II got an honor day, thus, the end of World War II should not be a holiday. Contention 2: Remembrance/Veteran's DayWe already honor everybody involved in every war ever--it takes place on November 11 every year and it is called Remembrance/Veteran's Day. Therefore, because World War II was no worse than every other war combined, the end of World War II being a holiday would be unnesecarry. Contention 3: People will not learnIf we make September 2 a holiday, people will not learn from their mistakes, as CON has claimed earlier. There has been 3 010 wars in history [1](even more than that, actually). Humans have been at war since the beginning of time and making September 2 a holiday will not make humans stop going to war.

            "premise": "You have seemed in your first statement to have accepted that it is hypocritical to celebrate religious holiday's as an atheist but that it is an acceptable hypocrisy, as if the populace are celebrating, this is in itself a reason to also celebrate as an individual. The difference of course being if you label yourself as an atheist, rather than agnostic, undecided or even of a minority faith within the populace, you are actively of the belief in the REJECTION of a God/deity and therefore of any religion which concludes the existence of a God/deity. The act of rejection is to dismiss or refuse, so surely anything other than dismissal or refusal to participate within religious celebration is in itself hypocrisy. In relation to the other mentioned religiously based 'holidays' it is also hypocritical for an atheist to participate within their celebrations. St. Patricks day is misconstrued as a day to celebrate being 'irish' it is in fact a celebration of the catholic patron saint of Ireland st. Patrick, who is being celebrated for bringing Christianity/Catholicism to the people of Ireland. Irish people who celebrate this day are not just celebrating the fact that they are irish, but the fact that they are irish Catholics. This holiday was brought to and popularised in America due to the number of Irish Catholic immigrants who have settled there. As someone who is from Ireland and was born in Belfast, I can categorically tell you that in Ireland only irish Catholics actively participate in the celebration of st. Patricks day, irish Protestants for instance refrain from celebration as they reject the ideology. St. Valentines day is slightly more ambiguous but still nether the less is a solely religiously based idea, st. Valentine was a Christian priest or bishop in the 3rd century who (although not absolute historical fact) was executed by roman Claudius II, for conducting marriages which had been outlawed, it is claimed that on the day of st. Valentines execution on February 14th that he sent a love letter to a lady signed 'from your valentine'. Valentines day is also related to an earlier pre Christian holiday Lupercalia, a celebration of a roman God. Halloween, known by Catholics as all saints eve/night, is a catholic religiously observed holiday it's roots are heavily based in celtic mythology and paganism and is a holiday which has again been bought to and popularised in America by its irish/Scottish immigrants, it is totally religiously based. In America however the lines have been blurred for many religious holidays, as America is a capitalist nation, it Capitalises on such holidays for financial gain, rather than there true meaning of religious holiday, corporations, company's and media outlets promote aspects of religious holiday to 'all' within society as means of making money from them. This however does not change or alter the fact that they are religious holidays which celebrate the belief in a religion which promotes a God/deity theory, which atheists actively reject. As I made clear in my first argument, I am not suggesting that to prove ones atheistic beliefs they should deliberately offend the populace, but that to participate within or to benefit from the celebration itself is hypocritical to the beliefs and ideologies of atheism. Atheism ironically is classified as a religion, and to classify yourself as an atheist is making a 'statement'. I would assume that as you have taken up the con position to this debate that you are an atheist, therefore are making a statement that you are in rejection to the belief of the populace, so in claiming that you can still continue to participate with celebration of the populace's religious holidays, which are inevitably a celebration of religious scripture, doctrine and of the idea that God does infact exist, is undoubtedly hypocritical. So onto ownership of the holiday of Christmas, it can almost certainly in modern history be seen to be owned by Christianity, irrespective of wether or not it was the actual birth date of Jesus, it is what is being celebrated. Denial of this is nonsensical, to deny that you are celebrating the birth of Jesus because historically Jesus may actually have been born on a different date is simply silly, wether Jesus was born on December 25th or not, Christmas is still ultimately the celebration of his birth, so ultimately a celebration of Christmas is the celebration of Jesus/Christianity. Another argument atheists may have, is that prior to Christianity's influx into Europe an extremely similar holiday took place around the same time the 'winter solstice' and that Christianity adapted this holiday to fit in with the changing of beliefs of the new converts. This is true, it is extremely likely that Christianity took the winter solstice and changed the ideology into representing Christian values rather than pagan values. But this argument in itself makes no difference if you are indeed an atheist, because the winter solstice itself was a religious festival/holiday which was celebrating the belief in a God/deity by pagans, and would be contradictory to the belief in atheism. As I have previously stated there can be no rebuttal to the question, 'is an atheist celebrating Christmas hypocritical' it is fundamentally hypocritical, it is however a hypocrisy that is accepted amongst atheists, an argument of if you can't beat them join them ect does not make you any less hypocritical for doing so.",

I'm thinking that you and I are similar minded individuals and probably wouldn't disagree about much. Nonetheless, the one thing I do disagree with is your opening proposition. \"Abolish all holidays\" Even public holidays have their merits. On these occasions we all have free time together, allowing us to meet up with family and friends and to hopefully have an enjoyable time. As to the events we are supposedly celebrating. Well, you can give these as much regard as you care to. In your case I would suggest you give them no regard at all. And just enjoy a day of work. Whether or not we are any happier after holidays.

Whereas a simple get together with family and friends. At the end of the day, will probably end up being far more enjoyable and rewarding. For goodness sake, don't abolish holidays.",

But if you don't know their preference, then don't be presumptuous and assume that their preference is yours. On the public side, it is also about making us all feel inclusive and there is a very simple law that must be taken into consideration. You repeatedly reference the First Amendment and Freedom of Expression, but that is on the individual side. The first part of the First Amendment is is the \"Establishment Clause\" which makes it clear that there should be no laws or public support of any particular religion. This is not only in the Bill Of Rights itself, but it has been interpreted and expressly ruled on by the Supreme Court In Everson v. Board of Education (1947) when the Court drew on Founding Father Thomas Jefferson's correspondence to call for a specific \"wall of separation between church and State\". And so, I wish you well. Have a nice day. Take care of yourself and whatever your individual beliefs, enjoy them to the fullest. In conclusion I wish you \"Happy Holidays\" whatever they may be.",

Having separation of Church and State means that in a public institution, there should not be any words in a document about any deity or religious belief. Before, the pledge did not have the phase \"under god.\" But, in 1954, Congress put a bill through and it was signed into law, which added this phase.[2] Thus, the government did indeed put forth an action with religion in it.Point Two:\"In God We Trust.\"[3]If you turn around any dollar bill in the United States, you can see this phase above the word \"ONE.\" Currency is only printed by the Federal Reserve Banks, which is a government institution. Not only it is a motto on our dollar bills, but it is also our country's official motto, signed into law by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 as a law. This motto comes the bible it self, \"in God I have put my trust;\"(Psalms 56:4.) The bible is the holy book of Judaism and Christianity. Both are considered religions. Point Three:\"Monday, December 26 : Christmas Day\"[4]This day is a Federal Holiday. In Christianity, it is the day in people believe Jesus was born upon. Most public schools observe this day, along with Easter, the day in which Christians believe Jesus came back to life. Along with this, the white house has a national Christmas tree, which the President lights him self. Other religions have holidays which are school holidays too, such as the New York City system, with a week set aside for Passover, Easter, and Good Friday.[5]Questions for my opponent:1. Why do national holidays have religious roots?2.

Top 10 Reasons Why I Love Christmas Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. Not just my favorite holiday, mind you, but my favorite time of year, period. It's not necessarily because of the presents, although I do love buying presents and receiving them isn't bad either. And I'm not religious either. There's just something about the season, the time of year, and the atmosphere that makes Christmas my all-time favorite. 10 . The weather is one of a kind. I live in the Bay Area of California, so we don't exactly experience snow to the extent the East Coast does. However, winter still means mittens and scarves for us. Skirts and flip flops get old (though there are those who still stick to them when it's cold). 9. The movies and music are unforgettable. Christmas music has become such a significant part of my holiday experience. It starts when my mom and I wake up at 4 a.m. for Black Friday shopping (which we have done for years), and we drive over the river and through the woods to go to the stores - we listen to the same Christmas albums every year (including Kenny Rogers and Celine Dion), and it isn't Christmas to me without them. \"Jingle All the Way\" is one of those movies the whole family can watch without getting mad (except when my parents gripe about Arnold's job as Governor of California). Otherwise, we all enjoy those holiday films and episodes we scrape out from the bottom of the VHS box and view... old school \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" Garfield and Charlie Brown Christmas specials, and, of course, \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" 8. Things smell so good. Christmas trees, cinnamon and spices, cold ground after rain and snow, baking hams... yeah... 7. The food is delicious and so special. Besides fruitcakes, there are dozens of holiday treats that make my mouth water. Egg nog and Christmas cookies included... these are things I look forward to every year. 6. The decorations are fantastic. Face it: nothing can beat the loaded window displays, the ribbons and garlands around every lamp post, the glittering lights of various colors and doilies, and nativity scenes, and the trees...! 5. ...Presents. Need I say more? I'm a big fan of wrapping presents as well (not true for my dad though). I am known for buying my presents early and being able to find the best gifts. There's nothing like finding the perfect gift for someone and seeing their reaction when they rip open the wrapping paper. 4. It's not necessarily JUST for Christians and Catholics. I am not of any denomination, yet I absolutely adore Christmas. It has become so commercialized that agnostics like myself can still experience it. But the devout can still enjoy the holiday for everything it symbolizes and celebrates religiously. To me, the wonder and glory of Christmas as I know it is something I want to share with everyone. And who knows? Usually I go to church with my Christian mother and partake in the songs too. I may not be very pious, but I respect what Christmas means to those who are. 3. It's celebrated all over the world. While there are world issues that separate nations and peoples, Christmas is something that people around the world can share. 2. Family comes together. Christmas is about the only time of year I see people outside my immediate family. They come to the house and we get to regroup for the first time in 364 days. It's the closest I feel to my family and it makes me feel so grateful to have them in my life. 1. Everything is so happy. In spite of mad shoppers and grumpy retail workers, I revel in the air of Christmas. As cliche as it sounds, it really is magical to me. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.",

            "conclusion": "Columbus Day should either be abolished or re-named",
            "premise": "Let's begin by looking at how this became a holiday...it was a celebration by certain members of society because he was Italian and Catholic. His accomplishment of reaching America made him a hero in those communities. But how did he go from being a hero in the Italian and Catholic groups to being a hero in the United States? First of all, he did not \"discover\" America. Unless you ignore world history until this point, you know that there were native tribes living in the Americas for centuries before Columbus landed, so how can you \"discover\" something when there is already someone living there. Not only that, he never even touched down into the modern-day United States. He explored islands in the Caribbean and in central America, not in the present day United States. The Vikings were the first Europeans that we know of that came to the Americas [1]. So if the Vikings were the first Europeans over here (and in North America), why is it Columbus that gets the credit? The first European colony in the modern-day United States was Ponce de Leon in modern-day Florida. The United States derived from the British colonies...so again, why is it Columbus that we celebrate? Aside from the fact that Columbus had no bearing on the modern-day United States, his name should be erased from this holiday due to his treatments towards the native tribes. The native tribes that Columbus encountered (Taino) were murdered, raped, and enslaved by Columbus and his men [2]. Columbus blamed the Taino for the failures and laziness of his own men. The Taino greeted Columbus with peace and generosity and yet he treated them with hostility. My final point in this round is that there are only two holidays here in the United States that are named after individuals; Columbus Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Washington's birthday has been reduced to an overall President's Day. It appalls me that Columbus has a holiday named after him, but Washington, the father of our country, Lincoln, who in a round about way ended slavery, nor heroes like Pat Tillman have holidays named after them....you know, TRUE HEROES!

            "conclusion": "Atheists Do Have a Holiday: April 1st (April Fools Day)",
            "premise": "First, I would like to ask that voters give a brief reason for decision in the comments. Now, Reasons I win this debate: 1) April 1st is NOT a holiday (for anyone) as it does not meet the definition of a holiday. If it isn't a holiday at all, it cant be an atheist holiday. I win this debate on this point alone, as my opponent did not dispute this at all. The title of the debate is \"Atheists do have a holiday: April 1st;\" if April 1st isn't a holiday, then it is impossible for ANYONE to have it as their holiday. Again, this argument was completely ignored by opponent, meaning I win on this point automatically (essentially its an argumentative forfeit on his part for what would equate to \"not showing up\" on a sports field). 2) My opponent has defined the atheist holiday as a time for atheists to \"celebrate their non-belief\" (his R2). I pointed out that April 1st has nothing to do with atheists celebrating their non-belief, so it does not meet my opponent's criteria for what an atheist holiday should be. My opponent's only response to this is one word: \"scripture.\" He doesn't elaborate or provide any analysis so I quite frankly don't know how he intends scripture to address this argument. I can guess what argument he might be trying to make (although he doesn't actually make it, he just says \"scripture\"), so I will address his non-argument here. While you may be correct that atheists are fools (as scripture states) and are thus tied to April 1st, that does not necessarily make the date an atheist holiday. As my opponent said, an atheist holiday must be a time for atheists to \"celebrate their non-belief.\" April 1st does not do this. I will point out that at no time did my opponent dispute my claim that April 1st had NOTHING to do with a celebration of non-faith. So, since April 1st has nothing to do with a celebration of non faith and since the atheist holiday must be a time for celebration of non faith, April 1st can not be the atheist holiday, despite the tie between atheists and April 1st. Think of it like this: A group simply having a tie to a certain date doesn't mean that date is their holiday. ON EITHER OF THESE TWO POINTS ALONE, I win. Both points illustrate how it is not possible for April 1st to be the atheist holiday. These are both offensive arguments for my position that were either dropped entirely or addressed so poorly that they might as well have been ignored. HOWEVER, if that is not enough to convince the judges (although it should be more than enough): My opponents entire argument rests on a scripture passage that says atheists are fools. However, he has provided no reason why a scripture passage has the ability to set a holiday. Why should scripture set the atheist holiday? Why shouldn't a book by Dawkins? What authority does scripture have to dictate holidays? To be blunt: why should we care what scripture says when setting holidays? My opponent's only answer: \"Must I keep repeating the Scripture?\" This does not answer my questions about the relevancy of scripture in any way. Please note that this isn't a case of a poorly developed argument, but a complete omission of an explanation for how his argument matters. My opponent simply doesn't explain how scripture is relevant. Christian scripture doesn't set Hindu holidays or Islamic holidays, why would it set atheists? Now you can see that: 1) My opponent provides no convincing reason why April 1st is an atheist holiday 2) It is impossible for April 1st to be an atheist holiday. As a Judge, you should vote Con.",

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting this challenge. Although, in the past, I have been queried as to my observance of some religious holidays, I must make it clear that I have not felt compelled by anyone to either observe nor abstain from observing any religious holiday so far. But, then again, I do not carry picket signs and march in protest of them, either. My opponent has stated, \"To come strait [sic] to the point [,] One should not observe any holiday...They have no logistical providing purpose for you personally...because overtime on holiday's pays a large amount compared to whatever your standard income is.\" To Refute: I am Retired (as I state in my profile) and have absolutely no problem eating a meal provided by somebody else and I do not intend on purchasing gifts for anyone I do not want to. As for Halloween, I have yet to have anyone come to my unlit doorway begging for candy and if someone did, I would no doubt assess their need rather than their desire to determine if I would donate anything to them. However, on the positive side, I do enjoy listening to music and find much of the traditional Christmas (\"O Holy Night\" is particularly beautiful) music thoroughly enjoyable, especially when sung by a choir or chorus when accompanied by a church-type organ. I may listen to this at home, on my stereo or attend a concert on Christmas Eve and it really only costs me what I feel appropriate to give. Being an atheist does not mean I am totally mercenary or pecuniary, nor does it imply that I have no taste for good music. I also enjoy the feeling of giving someone I cherish a gift that brings joy to that person or offering charity to someone less fortunate than I. These, to me are more profitable than asking the government for additional Social Security Benefits for not attending some customary holiday function. (Which I would not receive, anyway.) As you have implied, most of what is considered traditional or customary is secular and does not directly promote a spiritual message, thus would not, or at least should not raise the ire of anyone of the underlying faith to which the specific holiday is dedicated. I do wonder, though, if some Fundamentalist Christians might not take umbrage... I eagerly await my opponent's response.",

            "premise": "Hello and thank you for accepting. This is a debate about whether Christopher Columbus should be \"honored\" with a holiday, and therefore this debate is about whether he should be honored, and not about the holiday itself. For the sake of organization and to assure that no point will go unheeded, I will quote each of your points and then provide my rebuttals. <<\"My first contention is that Columbus day isn't celebrating christopher columbus, but rather his achievments Making knowledge of the Americas known\">> This contention is valid, yet outside the range of this debate. If you will notice the resolution, it is not whether we should have a holiday to celebrate his achievements, but whether we should have a holiday to honor him. This debate is about whether he as a person is worthy of being honored with a holiday. Not whether we should have a holiday to celebrate the events leading to American independence. Saying that Columbus has merit, because his actions very indirectly led to the existence of the United States, is akin to giving Hitler merit because his actions indirectly led to the formation of The United Nations. The United Nations was formed after WWII so that a diplomatic crisis such as a world war would not occur again. Since Hitler played a large part in the starting of World-war II, he \"paved the way\" to the UN. So basically, having a holiday to honor Columbus is about as sensible as having a \"Hitler day\" on September first (the day he invaded Poland). http://www.un.org... <<\"My Second Contention is that the Affirmation isn't fairly portraying Columbus.\">> I gave the general gist of what Columbus did: went across the ocean driven solely by self-gain, found aborigines, and then used them for his self gain, by using them as slaves and using them for gold. The ONLY \"good side\" that you can attest for in his nature is that his actions inadvertently set off a chain reaction which led to the US. This does not contribute to the virtue of his personality or good-intent of his actions in any way. It merely illustrates that horrible actions from people like Columbus can accidentally bring good things\u2026centuries later. The comparison to the Fourth of July does not fit for the following reasons: 1. The Fourth of July celebrates the independence of the US, not the guy who wrote the declaration of thus. It is not \"Jefferson day\", but \"The Fourth of July\". Unlike the holiday which is implied by the resolution, the Fourth of July celebrates the instance that was incurred by the man, and not the man himself. 2. While Thomas Jefferson had many quality attributes, Columbus had none worthy of note \u2013nor have you denied this- but the persistent idea from you that he should be honored because his wickedness inadvertently led to the independence of America 300 years later. This however is not an attribute to his nature as a person, but the fortunate turn of events that history took. Thomas Jefferson had many virtues and his motive was pure, unlike Columbus who acted merely on the Motive of self-gain. Morality and virtue can only be measured by the intent with which actions are partook, and not the consequence of said actions. <<\"My third contention is that actions such as slavery were acepted at the time, and according to Spanish Monarchy during the 1400's Native Americans were not deemed people, so in essence he wasn't doing anything wrong in the eyes of his time period.\">> You have seemingly made this assertion about the time period with no backing. And my guess is that you aren't exactly an expert on the 1400's, either. With some research you will find that the very nature of the documentation of Columbus' grievances denies that slavery was the morally accepted standard of the time period. Much of what we know about the matter stems from what is written by Bartolome de las casas, who thoroughly opposed the selfish grievances of Columbus. He originally helped in the conquest of Cuba, but then realized that it was wrong. He wrote \"History of the Indies\", which provides much information for historians on what Columbus did. Here is a quote from book 2 of this series: \"[Columbus] was so anxious to please the king that he committed irreparable crimes against the Indians\u2026\" Are these the words from someone of a period where genocide and slavery were morally acceptable? No. It was just that the Spaniards where greedy and acted immorally. After recording the horrible conditions of the dwindling Indians, who were reverting to suicide, and who were quickly being depopulated, he said thus: \"My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write\u2026\" Even if it was 500 years ago, there was still many basic ideas about human nature and morality that persist today. Things such as religion make sure of this. The ten commandments are very, very old. Las Casas wrote: \"Two of these so-called Christians met two Indian boys one day, each carrying a parrot; they took the parrots and for fun beheaded the boys.\" I hope these quotes from Las Casas served to illustrate the point that people with a sense of morality at the time did not approve of the actions of Columbus and the other Spaniards. And as far as you're assertion that Indians were not considered Human, the quotes have also contradicted this. You're only backing for that claim was that of \"according to Spanish Monarchy\". To this I reply: the biased views of those in power do not reflect upon the moral code of the era. \"Since my opponent is insinuating that Columbus day shouldn't be celebrated since christopher columbus held slaves, the [sic.] he is suggesting that noone [sic.] who has ever held a slave, or mistreated another culture should be celebrated.\" The words you have put in my mouth are an absolute statement, stating that \"noone\" of those specifications should be celebrated. I do not imply this, however. Columbus should not be celebrated because he had absolutely no virtuous attributes that are worthy of note. If he did, then it would be acceptable to celebrate him. Not only was he not a hero, though, but he was greedy and performed acts of genocide solely for self-gain. Once more, morality can only be measured by the intent of actions, and the intention of Columbus was evil, unlike so many great people in history who did great things and were good in nature, contributing greatly to humanity, but also had slaves. You have yet to provide any positive quality about the nature and personality of Columbus. The only thing you have provided is that he very distantly and inadvertently caused American independence to occur. <> I apologize that I have not provided the sources yet, but I would like to point out that holding them void would be unnecessary, because I made the only real citation that was necessary: Citing that it was the words of Christopher Columbus. However, for you're convenience I will tell you where I found the quotes. I got the quotes and subsequent information from \"A people's History of The United States\", by Howard Zinn. Alas, it is not an internet source, as you assumed, but a book. If you wish to use it for reference, you may find it at you local public library. If you wish to seek whether the quotes are \"made up\" or not, that is you're burden. I give you my word those are quotes from Columbus, and I have provided the way in which you may verify this. If for convenience you would like to find the quotes from another source (internet), than that is also upon you. -Harlan",

View below to see how this does not 'include everybody.' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"You can't choose one over the other. If it excludes all, at least it's not favoring one over the other.\" If I'm Christian, I shouldn't be made to say Happy Hanukkah, or anything that implies I'm saying Happy Hanukkah. A Jewish person should be allowed to say Happy Hanukkah, and not have to say anything that implies he is saying Merry Christmas as well. Making a Jewish person celebrate the birth of Christ is rather offensive to him. He should be allowed to celebrate his own holiday, in action and in words, and not be made to verbally celebrate a 'pagan' holiday. The very concept of saying Happy Holidays isn't really about including all holidays, but excluding them. Leaving the individual holidays out so it's less 'offensive.' The only way to truly accept all holidays is to let people celebrate their own. Saying Happy Holidays only helps to destroy the individuality of Christmas, Hanukkah, and other holidays. If we build a world where only Happy Holidays should be celebrated outside of the house, then we begin to remove individual holidays from the public. You don't begin accepting them, you begin excluding them. Claiming that celebrating an individual holiday in public is offensive. Building a world where only Happy Holidays is allowed to exist outside our home. If you want to 'accept and include' my holiday, you have to let me celebrate it individually, inside and outside my house. And I have the right to fully choose whether or not I want to include (what is to me) a 'pagan' holiday to my list of celebrations. I myself do not want to celebrate a 'pagan' holiday, in action or in words.",

Now if there is a long holiday, it is like a knife that was not sharpened regularly, therefore students may be stupid in their young age, when they're supposed to be smart. Regarding enjoying life, well, it doesn't have to be long holidays to play or to go on vacation, right? I think, the best way for a win-win solution, is that the school who change the way they teach, by giving less homework and less topics, but more practice and more depth, still, that doesn't mean we have to have a very long holiday, right?

The fact that you don't observe in customary acceptable way (your definition from round 1) is a case for Pro, not Con witch I thought you were taking. You then proceeded to tell me about how you do enjoy Christmas music. This not relevant. I enjoy Carrie Underwood's song 'before he cheats' and yet I do not believe in condoning any such actions described in the song. The Christmas you defined in round 1 was stated as: \"Christmas: 1 : a Christian feast on December 25 or among some Eastern Orthodox Christians on January 7 that commemorates the birth of Christ and is usually observed as a legal holiday.\" Enjoyment of music does not fulfil \"Observe: 3 : to celebrate or solemnize (as a ceremony or festival) in a customary or accepted way\" for this Holiday you defined. \"Being an atheist does not mean I am totally mercenary or pecuniary\" I suppose it does not; but the resolution regards what an atheist SHOULD do. And what one should do regardless of your belief in a deity or not is always something Logical. And Logic embraces these two concepts. \"I also enjoy the feeling of...\" You can justify why feelings should dictate what anyone should do, including Christians. A Well known atheist, Terry Goodkind said 'Reason can be my only sovereign' \"of giving someone I cherish a gift that brings joy to that person or offering charity to someone less fortunate than I.\" These are nice add-on's to someone who is choosing to observe Christmas but they do not necessarily 'celebrate or solemnize' the birth of a savior by themselves. \"These, to me are more profitable than asking the government for additional Social Security Benefits for not attending some customary holiday function. (Which I would not receive, anyway.)\" Here is a link to rules of acquisition, vital to a culture wanting profit. http://en.wikipedia.org... So though it may seem profitable to you its contradictory to auguring profit. Also I have never herd of these SS Benefits you speak of. It does not make since for the government to pay you to not go somewhere like that. Con has failed to give a rational case for why an Anyone, let alone an atheist, celebrate a holiday. He has only spoken of being fond of music related to some holidays, which I have shown is not 'observing' by his definition I await your response.",

            "conclusion": "Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential election",
            "premise": "Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections. My partner and I are on the con side. Our points are: 1. The Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. 2.there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts 3.Direct popular vote is flawed in many ways 4.The Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. My first point is the Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. According to Kristina Dell, \"with a direct popular vote...the selection of the president would often be the biggest, most populous states with little attention paid to smaller ones.\" Without the Electoral College the voices of small states would be drowned out by the larger ones. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans says, \"In the election of 2008, because all votes in the Electoral College are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states.\" The Electoral College is a necessity in order to give small states the right to have a voice in presidential elections. My second point is that there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts. As Professor Judith Best argues, \"an electoral system should produce a definite, accepted winner and avoid prolonged contests and disputes that create uncertainty and public turmoil.\" This is the function now played by the Electoral College. To its defenders, it does so in two ways. One, it saves the nation \"from the effects of a vague outcome.\" In this way, it confers the necessary legitimacy even in the face of close elections. And two, it also \"protects the nation from the crisis of a disputed election.\" In a direct popular vote, during a close election, candidates will be too tempted to challenge every result. Whereas before if you carry a state by 10% there is no reason to challenge under the Electoral College, now a nationwide deadlock will ensure each state undergoes a recount. The judiciary committee once again explains, if one candidate contests a certain area, his opponent, to protect himself, warns of a contest where he thinks something might have been adverse to him. And in a little while, the whole electorate is involved. My third point is that direct popular vote is flawed in many ways. Proponents of a direct popular vote too often over simplify the question at hand. They fail to realize that, like any other system, direct popular vote will be vulnerable to numerous problems. One such problem is the increased threat of vote fraud. The Electoral College is a series of self-sealing containers, so that each state does not influence the outcome of another. If fraud occurs, it is isolated. In a direct election, however, each vote is of premium importance to the national decision. As such, agents within the election will have a far greater decision to influence votes. Consider an election that stays in an almost complete deadlock throughout the day. As word travels, the urgency of West Coast votes becomes so great that the temptation to commit fraud by local officials is overwhelming. The election is then illegitimate. The Electoral College avoids this because even if one county of one state commits fraud, it will not be enough to impact the overall election. (This is why I urge you to vote con) My fourth point is the Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. The cornerstone of democracy is not majority rule. It is reasonable majority rule with the protection of minority rights. A nation is far better served when moderate ideologies prevail. This government ensures liberty and equality maintain an optimal balance for all citizens. As former senator James Eastland writes, \"Because of winner-take-all (under the electoral system), a party is under a strong inducement to extend its platform as widely as possible within each State; it must expand its base of support to carry a popular plurality. Since both major parties face the same requirement, both must campaign in most of the same places before most of the same votes. Both must be hospitable to a wide range of minority interest which might otherwise be excluded from electoral competition.\" This has so many great benefits, including reasonable polices that are widely appropriate in nature. Under a direct popular vote, no such system would hold. Candidates must currently be able to get a majority of votes in a statewide election to obtain even a single electoral vote. Ideologically extreme candidates are discouraged from running because they know they cannot appeal to that wide of an electorate. Under direct popular vote, however, there is no need to win statewide majorities and therefore elections will become crowded with extreme candidates. This will further polarize politics as candidates make specific appeals to narrow voter interests. Then, the President will not be elected by a large body politic. He or she will be the voice of only a few. This is why I urge you to vote con",

            "premise": "The original reasoning behind choosing Tuesday for election day no longer applies. That you have clearly demonstrated in your opening argument. However, this should not lead one to conclude changing election day to a Saturday. Although the original reasons for a Tuesday election are outdated, this does not mean that other reasons have not also come into play as times have changed. First off, many jobs give either an entire day off for election day, or extended lunch breaks on election day in order to allow employees to vote. Typically, civil service jobs and other jobs working for either the city, state, or federal government get the entire day off to vote. Corporations very rarely give workers an entire day off, but there are a great many that still give extended lunch hours to workers in order to vote. In both of these situations, the extra time that such people are given specifically to vote can definitely cause a guilt trip. I have heard plenty of people say in the past that they felt compelled to vote as a result of having the day off or having a much longer lunch break. This cannot happen if election day is a Saturday. Most people have Saturday as a regular day off anyway. This may seem like it would lead to more voting, but this is probably not true. Census data can only show what people claim are reasons for not voting. When a person doing a survey asks a non-voter why they did not go to the polls, how many of those people would be honest enough to answer that they just didn't feel like it? Those that claim that work conflicted with them being able to vote are probably looking for time from their jobs to vote. I don't think they are really trying to move election day to Saturday. That is always a problem with that type of poll. The honest answer is not given. In this census, what percentage said they simply didn't feel like voting? I'm sure the number is extremely small if that answer even appears in the data. Yet common sense and experience would tell us that the number of people that simply don't feel like voting is very high. This is something that has a lot more to do with personality than with the particular day of the week. I believe that most people that refrain from voting would do so regardless of the day of the week chosen. And as a civil servant, I'm glad to have an extra day off. I'm sure that many teachers and students also appreciate the day off when the school is used for voting. And as I mentioned earlier, when a person is given extra time to vote (and a Saturday would not fit this category since it is not extra), it can cause a guilt trip and make that person more likely to vote. But this reason is actually a minor one. There is a much bigger problem with your idea that I will present in the next round.",

Perhaps he is new, or wants a quick easy arguments. I have seen people going all out, like otakujordan. I find this unfair and unnecessary, it is a waste of time, and unfair to the opponents. [1] Rebuttals: \"Well families cant spend much time with their families forcing the families to change plans.\" Why can't families spend time together? They can go to the stores together, something I always do. Also, if the families change plans, you are implying they would spend time together later. They would still end up together. In addition, people don't have to go to stores during holidays, it is their decision. Arguments: For this arguments, I will be explaining 3 basic points, one of which I have already mentioned, but I would like to embellish. More pay, and cheaper prices, and emergencies. That chocolate you need to buy for someone special, the presents you need to buy for that little rugrat, all of these items are usually sold on holidays like Christmas, and valentines day. And what comes with holidays that everyone loves? Not the lack of work, not the nice people, but the sales. During holidays, things go on sale, which is what everyone loves, because it is cheaper. Cheaper is better. In doing so, people of all incomes can purchase items, without having any financial issues. This is the beauty of holidays, there are sales, so people can get more objects. This is a great thing, because people save money. And though may love it, the employees love it as well. During holidays, things get a little crazy. This is actually a good thing. Since things get crazy, more employees are called in, and they get more hours. This gives more money for all employees. Not only that, but with the sales, employees can add their employee discount, and purchase items for practically free. And lastly emergencies. Emergencies happen all the time, no matter what time of the year, including holidays. Take the ice storm in Toronto on Christmas in 2013. This happened very recently. [1] These people were freezing, and out of power all over the city. They needed food, water, clothing, salt, gas etc.. Now let's say the stores were closed the the holidays, they would all be in huge trouble! Imagine that, out of power freezing in your house, all your food spoiled because you have no electricity to store it, and you can't even get emergency supplies! This would be terrible. So in conclusion, stores being open on the holidays would not only be beneficial to both sides of the commerce, but it can also be life saving.

            "conclusion": "United States should use an Elector appointment System to solve the problem of low voter turn out.",
            "premise": "Often times for a Mayor position or a city council positions most people have no ideas that an election is even taking place much less vote. So a relatively few amount of people decide the leaders of a comparatively large population. This isn't the fault of the people they have their own lives to live, and unless there is a specific pressing issue that has gotten to the point where they are mad, they aren't really motivated to vote. Now I think that is bad, because it makes us rely on Cliff-Edge election politics. Were people are only driven to vote when there is a problem instead of taking into account who is running and who would be the best for the job. Now this happen's in the city level with city commissioners and mayors, also the county level with county commissioners. And to a large degree state legislatures also go through this. I don't believe this is a really representative means of public offices competition always breads the best person for the job, and were there isn't an atmosphere of significant competition we're not going to bet the best person for the job. So what I offer is a different system. A National Election's Congress -not to be confused with our regular congress. This congress See's each U.S. district vote in Electors into the Congress. The role of this congress is to year round find the best person's suitable for the public office's that are due for elections. The Congress would be split into two or more champers. The East Chamber and the west Chamber, or more regional chambers. The best way to see how it works, is to see a case study- then I will break down the system later. For example the city I live in is plantation. Our city government has 5 commissioners and one Mayor. Traditionally the people seeking that office will file and intent to run form with the registrar for that county. On election day people would come vote and the person with the highest votes wins the office. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- With an Elector System. A person seeking the office of Mayor/commissioners would file an intent to run form with their county registrar. From that moment they can campaign and seek citizen-endorsements. A citizen can go to their cities designated location and file a a citizen-endorsement for that candidate. They would be able to do this from the moment the person running for office submits their intent to run form with the country registrar, until the deadline. The candidates would be campaigning for a while for citizen-endorsements until the deadline , then they would be given an appointment to appear before their regional chamber of the National Elections Congress. If a candidate failed to receive 10% of all the citizen-endorsements received for that specific race, they are automatically denied. On the other hand if a candidate received 2/3 of all the citizen-endorsements received for that specific race, they automatically get appointed. If a candidate is not in those two categories they present themselves before the Congress give a speech talk about their record. Before hand the Congress would have their resume and Political record if applicable. After this congressman may take the floor and argue their position in regards to who should get the job. And finally the matter is put up before a vote, the winner of that vote wins the office. I think this is a great system to elect mayors and commissioners and state legislatures, because it makes sure that there is good competition. Instead of a small voter turn out effecting the entire population, voter turn out is a plus but it isn't the determining factor. With the Electoral appointment system every time there is an election below the governor level , merits are evaluated and a decision is made based a compromise of who is best for the job and who has the most support. I think this country should switch to an Electoral appointment system. It may sound far out, but thats probably becuase this is the first time anybody has heard of it. The elections of the elector's themselves that would be sent to this congress would be paired with the Presidential election, you would vote for them on the same ballot as your president, and this ensures a high voter turn out.",

There is absolutely no evidence placed in this. How does the Electoral College encourage more \"informed\" voters. How do those two even correlate?? What I was saying was that if the people have less power in the political process, i.e. with the Electoral College, there would be less of an incentive to be more informed as the Electors in the Electoral College are the ones in charge of electing the president. If people have more power, then there would be an increase in deliberative democracy since they have more of a choice about who becomes president. The reason why an National Vote would be preferred is because with a National Vote, more people would be represented and the vote would be much more accurate. I still fail to understand how the \"Electoral College\" which gives the voters less power, encourages \"deliberative democracy.\" I have not seen any evidence for this, just a bunch of quotes about people praising it, but no reasons why the Electoral College is an incentive for more informed voters. Con's Contention Two: The Electoral College protects against fraud First of all, the only thing Con says to \"argue against\" my claim that a close election is less likely since there would be large pools of data, is that it is wrong. Any evidence? Con doesn't acknowledge that it would be less likely that there would be fraud or that fraud wouldn't count as much since there would be huge pools of data.\"National Popular Vote has argued that a direct election would reduce the likelihood of a close election and decrease the feasibility of fraud. They contend that the large nationwide pool of 122 million votes would make a close outcome much less likely than it is under the current system, in which the national winner may be determined by an extremely small vote margin in any one of the numerous statewide tallies.\"http://en.wikipedia.org...... All Con says is that the Electoral College prevents fraud, which doesn't really counteract my claim. If anything, other restrictions can be placed to prevent minority and majority fraud. It doesn't necessarily have to be with the Electoral College. I never strawmanned Con. Con stated that if a close election came under a National vote, recounts would be more difficult to handle. What I stated in rebuttal was that under a National Vote, it would be less likely that there would be a close election since there would be enormous pools of data that would differentiate greatly. Con's Contention Three: You can't rely on swing sates to \"reflect\" public's will. That's just speculation. The most accurate way to reflect the public will would be to actually focus on what most of them want instead of speculating in states that are at the political center. I fail to understand how this would be an \"inaccurate\" way to see what the majority wants. Ohio is much less populated and therefore less people would be affected by the choice of president. Not everyone will always be pleased with the President, but most will if we get a majority vote on it. In Conclusion The Electoral College simply isn't necessary. The Electoral College was established in the first place because the writers of the Constitution were Elitists and didn't want the \"ignorant people\" to choose the President because they were uneducated. But now people are much more educated therefore eliminating the need for the Elitists to choose who runs the country.The reason why in a National Vote, it would be a more \"fair\" election would be because it would accurately reflect the public's will. The Majority Vote=Most of what the people wantMost of what the people want=A Fair Election The Elitists should go The People should decidehttp://whowhatwhy.com......http://www.usnews.com......http://www.kpbs.org......http://en.wikipedia.org......",

            "premise": "Opening ArgumentThis argument is going to be quite short, apologies in advance. The issue with closing all stores during Thanksgiving is that not all Americans actually celebrate Thanksgiving. This is due to a number of reasons such as immigrants may not want to celebrate a purely American custom or maybe people don't want to 'give thanks' when there is nothing worth giving thanks for. In fact, 13% of Americans say that they do not celebrate Thanksgiving [1]. While in portion to the rest of the population may not need to go to stores due to the holiday, it would be unfair to close down the entire country when 13% of the people don't celebrate the holiday. Another problem is that the origination of the Thanksgiving holiday was not so cheerful after all. In 1637 about 700 Pequot Native Americans gathered so as to celebrate their local Corn Festival. English and Dutch mercenaries surrounded the Natives and shot and clubbed as many as they could to death. The next day the Bay Colony governor called a 'Day of Thanks' because of the ruthless murder of almost 700 unarmed Native Americans. During this day of thanks the English colonists raided and kidnapped as many Native Americans as they could. On that day large numbers of ships with 500 newly captured slaves left Boston Harbor. Therefore, it is clear that Thanksgiving is neither a particularly well understood holiday as often people consider it as a long fest between Native Americans and Colonists. This is completely untrue. Thus one could argue that stores have the right to remain open due that they don't want to be forced to respect an honestly barbarous holiday.

            "premise": "Round 1: Pro R2 : Cross Examination R3: Con R4: Cross Examination R5: Rebuttals/Summary/Final Focuses I am aware the rounds are a bit off from a real debate. That's because debate.org only allows so many rounds. I apologize for that. ---------------------------------------------- Be it resolved that, the United States should convert over to a one day primary campaign when it comes to electing a new president. I firmly stand in affirmation for this claim for the following contentions. *Contention 1* The idea of a one day Primary essentially means there would be one day for campaigning and the next day would be the actual election. There would most definitely be a better change in private policy. Even if the representations were to go up, that doesn't mean everyone will benefit. A one day Primary would easily boost political participation. In 2012's Primary, had a 17% turn out. Why? Well according to the University of Mexico, the voters in the outside states rarely vote because they feel their votes don't matter. This is because they are lead to believe the primary states have already decided the election, when in reality this isn't true. Every vote should count! There is a belief that the most votes from the more wealthy and educated citizens, causing the less wealthy and educated to feel below them. Even some Congressmen state, \"A one day Primary could close the gap in voter turn out and prevent both political parties from becoming victims to polarization. *Contention 2* At the moment, our current state of election is full of media madness. This takes away from the real idea of voting; electing a new leader to guide the nation. We get so caught up in the, \"he said she said\" aspect of it that we seem to forget about how much really is at stake here. The media seems to focus on \"Horse Race\" journalism. This means they only cover, \"Who's winning in the delegates?\" or \"Who's higher in the polls this week? Will it change next week?\" You wouldn't see any of that in a one day Primary! Patrick Whithers explains in 2012, \"Staggered elections reduce turn out by fatiguing the voters' pattern of the constant political he said, she said mess.\" The media crowds the main focus on policy and discussion. Out of 63% percent of journalists, only 16% focus on policy positions and records. *Contention 3* Many voters seem to give up their votes because their candidate drops out. The candidates the usually drop out are the less known and wealthy ones. Why? These candidates believe they don't have a chance half way through because the media makes it much harder for them to become recognized whereas Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were widely recognized because of their status in the media! A one day Primary would easily wipe this out, allowing more candidates to enter the race and more voters participating because they have the chance to vote for their candidate of choice. Statistics show that the earlier states were 5x more influential than the outside states causing them to be nearly unrepresentative. This past election, is was very hard to determine the voter turn out and neither state nor candidate could completely balance out their influence to give others a fighting chance. This creates an unbalance of power and harms democracy. This can lead to a division of the democratic ideal of \"One person, one vote.\" Earlier states seem to earn more federal money after the election than outside states, leaving them in the dust. This is why I firmly stand in affirmation for the resolution.",

            "premise": "\"I see no reason why you should feel offended if you say happy holidays to people.\" For the same reason you want me to say Happy Holidays in the first place. Your idea is to say Happy Holidays because saying 'Merry Christmas' might offend someone. Well saying, or implying that you are saying \"Merry Christmas, and Happy Hanukkah, and Happy birth of Buddha, and Happy Eid al-Adha\" might be offensive to the person having to say it. It's offensive to them to say for the same reason it is offensive for the other person if they do not say it (even though very few people care if the person says Merry Christmas.) If it's offensive for a Muslim to hear \"Merry Christmas,\" it's obviously going to be offensive for a Christian to have to say \"Happy Eid al-Adha.\" ------------------------------------------------------------- \"It's not really about saying thank you to every god, it's more about including people who want to be part of this time, but not be part of Christmas.\" You need to understand when I'm using an analogy. The only way for everyone to be apart of this time is to let them come to celebrate their own holiday separately at the same place and time. Not in separate parties either, and not by having their holiday left out because not everyone celebrates it. The concept of Happy Holidays isn't really about 'accepting' every holiday, it's about leaving the holiday out. The only way to accept Christmas is to let people come out of their own homes to celebrate it. Same with Hanukkah. You never truly accept or include it if you do not let them celebrate it as it's own. I am not here to celebrate the birth of Buddha, I'm here to celebrate Christmas. If you tell me I can not celebrate Christmas outside my house because it's offensive, than you aren't 'accepting' of my holidays or religion. ------------------------------------------------------------- \"The holidays aren't just Christmas you know.\" The Holidays are what ever that person celebrates. To most Jewish people, it's just Hanukkah, and to most Christians, it's just Christmas. ------------------------------------------------------------- You need to understand that every decision is a gateway to others. I've studied enough history (you'd love my library) to understand how one decision can lead to a potentially deadly intake of others (deadly not because of the amount of decisions, as the amount won't be that large. It's deadly because of the standard of decision you've set.) We are having a discussion on whether or not it is offensive to say Merry Christmas, and whether or not we should be allowed to say Merry Christmas in public. If it is decided that saying Marry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah at public events is not allowed, than how long before the overly-sensitive decide no religion should be expressed in public at all. Many can speculate this being a 'possible outcome,' but they do not have to because it's already a live topic for many. After we conclude that it is inappropriate to say Merry Christmas in public, it wouldn't take long for people to begin discussing whether or not it's appropriate to say anything religious at all in public. Although the discussion already loosely exists, you would fuel it by concluding on a discussion that is loosely the exact same. ------------------------------------------------------------- Like I said. Freedom of Speech cannot be waived for the overly-sensitive. It is not the \"Freedom to speech so long as everyone around you approves.\" You can say Happy Holidays, anyone can. If you like Happy Holidays, then say it. But do not demand everyone say it back because you get easily offended by people celebrating their own holiday and not yours.",

            "conclusion": "We Should Celebrate Colombus Day.",
            "premise": "Hello. I am glad to be debating you on this very controversial issue. I want to start off by saying that Columbus Day means much more than the discovery of America. It is more of a symbolic holiday - one that celebrates what was to come: democracy, freedom, the United States. I can see why you are against Columbus Day, and why we should abolish it. But I believe, firmly, that abolishing it is not only disrespectful but senseless. Let me explain. Although Columbus did not discover America, he did bring it into the limelight, the first to do so. The arrival of Columbus brought forth the beginning of recorded history in the Americas. This is an achievement worth celebrating. The arrival of Columbus also brings to light the achievements reached during the Renaissance. Discovering America allowed new exploration ideas to bloom. Discovering America permitted people to move and ideas to spread beyond the reach of Europe, Asia, and Africa. These ideas include innovations in agriculture, in medicine, in art, in music, in religion. And, most importantly, government. Columbus Day has been an important part of our past, another reason to celebrate it. The tradition of Columbus Day began in 1792 - the 300th anniversary of his first voyage. Many other historic events have occurred because of Columbus Day. The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 to honor the 400th anniversary of Columbus. President Harrison declared Columbus Day a legal day that year. The US has also traditionally admired Columbus - the proof is in the facts. Look at all the cities named after him - Columbus, Ohio for example. The US also possess the most statues of Columbus in the world. If we are going to commemorate him with all these statues and cities, it stands to reason that we have a legal holiday to celebrate his major accomplishment. Should we rename Columbus and take down the statues because Columbus did not discover America? Also, Columbus Day is the only holiday the US recognizes the heritage of an estimated 26 million Italian Americans - which accounts for the fifth-largest ethnic group in the nation. All of these reasons were pulled off of http://www.osia.org.... This is a great website and outlines my argument perfectly. Now, I know what opponents of Columbus Day used as their reasoning - that \"Columbus is responsible for the enslaving of millions, and the death of millions due to illness.\"I argue against the reason - it is ridiculous. Let's see - America was responsible for the enslaving of millions of Africans. America was responsible for the death of millions of Native Americans. America was, and is, responsible for tens of hundreds of wars in which we kill millions to gain nothing. But does that mean we ought not to celebrate the Fourth of July? Or Independence Day? No, we ought to - it is a symbol of freedom. A symbol of hard work. A symbol of the great nation that was built from this land. In the same way, Columbus Day celebrates the introduction of new ideas into the Americas. It celebrates new innovations in medicine, in agriculture, in government. And while America wasn't really discovered by Columbus, he did bring it into the limelight. He was the first to do this with his voyage across the Atlantic and should remembered for it.",

Such Christian countries should not turn their back upon their heritage and the faith background of the large majority of their citizens.

I hope that he will be able to respond to my R2 arguments as well as counter-rebut my R3 ones.RebuttalsRe: Representation and FocusState-by-state representation will not be needed in a national popular vote because each vote would be individual and would have no accordance with the state that citizen lives in. It is unfair to give a voter more value in an election simply because they happen to live in a state with smaller borders. If that state's borders were expanded for some reason, or the voter moved to a larger state, then the vote's value would drop. Small states would be over-represented. This is much less fair for people living in big states - their votes don't count as much toward the result as small states do. A national popular vote would eliminate thisproblem and ensure that every vote is equal the next. States need not be relevant in a national election.Regional concerns would be more prevalent in large states versus small states, since there is more space in larger states for problems to arise. The fact that Rhode Island has one regional concern would be of much more proportion to California with its five thousand regional concerns.There is no reason to abolish the Senate because the Senate serves the purpose of representing the states several times a month on many different issues, not like the EC which is only used every four years for one issue only: the next president of the U.S. The Senate can address each state's issues without needing to ask the state which candidate the majority of its citizens support.Re: ModerationWith the EC, candidates tend to only campaign in the states that matter: swing states. It would be pointless for a Republican candidate to campaign in a solid blue state and vice versa. With or without the EC, there is no reason for a candidate to visit a small town because there are few people living in that town that would affect the election outcome. Since rural areas already trend red, campaigning there is pointless.Candidates will moderate their policies regardless of whether there are swing states or not. It may be true that swing states will be appealing to candidates, but if there is no EC at all then the candidates will want to moderate their policies to appeal to all of America, not just a few states. Even if that was not the case, it doesn't matter a whole lot whether a policy is moderated or not. America will vote on what it wants, and that will make America happier because a popular vote is a direct representation of democracy in comparison to a flawed EC.Re: Clear WinnerTo dissect this argument, we must first find out why it is being contended that a clear winner in an election would be better than a close one. Two factors have been brought up: recounting and votes and a number of fraud attempts at a result of it.RecountingMy opponent has attempted to paint recounting in a bad light. However, recounting in a direct popular vote would not be all that bad. We must first consider that the new president isn't inaugurated until late January[1], leaving plenty of time from election day in early November to the day the president-elect takes office. 2\u00bd months is enough time to recount a nation's votes, seeing as how the votes on Election Day are all counted in one sitting. Also, the only time the nation would recount every person's vote would possibly be if the election was as close as the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy one. Even if there was a difference of a million votes between the candidates (such as the 2012 one), the election still wouldn't be close enough to trigger a national recount. Only in rare settings where the votes are really close would a recount be considered. To add, a recount would be much less likely in a national popular vote because there would be a single large national pool of votes instead of 51 separate pools.FraudSince fraud was brought up, it'd be proper for this subject to be addressed by the other side. It was claimed that a long recount time would risk further fraud opportunities. But because it is a baseless assertion to say \"a recount would take months and months\", there is no point in taking this argument seriously. We know that in each election, the votes are counted in one day, so fraud opportunities would not be higher. In fact, they would be lower because recounts would be less frequent as I pointed out earlier. Fraud attempts would actually be more frequent with the EC because the people committing fraud would know that if they did it enough, it might tip the vote balance of that state causing the entire state to go for the other candidate. In a popular vote, this wouldn't happen because each vote is individual and would have no effect on the state that vote was casted in. Fraud attempts would only give a candidate a few extra votes and there would be no risk of an entire state switching its votes because of it.Re: ConfusionIt is another baseless assertion that the two-party system would collapse because of a loss of the EC. If no candidate received 270 electoral votes in the EC, one from the three candidates with the most votes would be chosen by the Senate anyways. In a national popular vote, the candidate with the most votes would be elected as chosen by the people. Also, since few people vote for the party they know is going to lose, there would be no reason for the people to begin voting for third party candidates more often without the EC.Your turn, Con!Sources1. http://en.wikipedia.org...2. http://www.archives.gov...",

            "premise": "Australia Day must be changed from the 26th of January. The 26th is when the First Fleet from England landed at Sydney Cove and Captain Arthur Phillip took possession of the land for the British Empire in 1788. The day was first recognised in the 1880's, but only as an anniversary of the first landing. In 1946 it changed to Australia Day and in 1994 it became a public holiday and a day to welcome new citizens or honour people who have done a great service to the country. The National Australia Day Council recognises it as \"a day to reflect on what we have achieved and what we can be proud of in our great nation\", but the date means that not everyone can join in on this, because for some people the very day means nothing but sorrow and mourning. These people are Aboriginals. It is the beginning of the end of their freedom and culture, the start of the enormous amount of pain and suffering they were about to go through - having their land stolen from them; their food being hunted by white men with guns; their way of living being dismissed as savage and vulgar; the loss of so many lives due to European diseases, fights and battles, slaughter and rape; and later, having their children stolen to \"civilise\" them and develop them into white culture. Would you want to celebrate your country on the very anniversary of the day that you essentially lost it? How can we expect Aboriginals to do this?",

            "discussionTitle": "should September 2 be a holiday",
            "conclusion": "should September 2 be a holiday",
            "premise": "Rebuttals1:'Yes I see your point but some countries try to hid some of the things. Germany does not really have grwces for those who fought for Germany during ww2.'What are 'grwces?' Until my opponent spells that in at least an understandable matter, I'm afraid I cannot rebut that. 2: 'Everyone should remember this day so we can learn from are mistakes.'Following that logic, we should make a holiday for every single war, which would be insane, because in the past 3 400 years, humans have been involved in 268 wars [1]. It would be an insane amount of time and work to honor people who served on 268 days of the year, so that's why we invented Remembrance/Veteran's Day, so we could honor all of those who served in one day, including those who served in World War II. 3: 'And another thing is this was the most destructive war in human history.'While that may be true, all the other wars combined were much worse than World War II. Again, that is why we have Remembrance/Veteran's Day. Of course, that may not be true either. One article explains why the Vietnam War is the worst war, mostly because of a chemical called 'Agent Orange,' that was used during the war, which caused a variety of illnesses including cancer and Parkinson's disease, and was also able to pass down in families to infect affect children [2]. The war itself was also awful as well. Read the entire article, it is truly an eye-opener. 4: 'The civilians that lost their lives and the troops deserve this day.'Yeah, and so do all the other soldiers and civilians who lost their lives in all the other wars deserve a day. It would be unfair to give one group a day and the other nothing, so we give both a day--Remembrance/Veteran's Day.5: 'If we dont then most country's will forget there past. Look at Greece. Guess what there third biggest political party is. A Nazi party. Greece jist might end up like Germany if people dont do something'PRO, what is your point? I'm sure Greece's Nazi party remembers their past, it is just that there are horrible people out there, because how could they not remember what happened with the real Nazi's? In fact, they once praised members of Nazi Germany before [3], so of course they remember their past and what happened. Again, I don't know what happened to Germany because of your spelling error earlier.6: 'The war lasted 6 years about.'Yeah, and the Afghanistan War lasted 11 years [4]. Both wars were tragic. It would be unfair to give one group a day of honor and the other group nothing, so we give both groups an honor day--Remembrance/Veteran's Day. 7: 'Most of the world participated the war'Yeah, and most countries participated in World War I as well [5]. Both wars were tragic. It would be unfair to give one group a day of honor and the other group nothing, so we give both groups an honor day--Remembrance/Veteran's Day. 8: 'This war freed the people from nazi and Japanese'Yes, and the civil war freed slaves. Both wars were tragic (due to all the casualties, not the freeing). It would be unfair to give one group a day of honor and the other group nothing, so we give both groups an honor day--Remembrance/Veteran's Day. 9: 'So but another point is.millions of germans and jews and every country lost alot of good men'Yeah, and World War I ended a lot of good men's lives [6]. Both wars were tragic. It would be unfair to give one group a day of honor and the other group nothing, so we give both groups an honor day--Remembrance/Veteran's Day. ConclusionMy point from all of those rebuttals PRO, is that all wars are tragic. You cannot single out the people who lost their lives in one war and neglect all those who lost their lives in all the other wars. It is cruel and unfair. That is why we fairly honor all those who lost their lives on one day and one day only--Remembrance/Veteran's Day. We cannot fairly give a holiday to honor those who were involved in one war and neglect other wars.
