I am free to assume that there's no corporal punishment outside of school and vice versa. 3.I can begin in round one \"My opponent will start this debate with his arguments\" O Burden of Proof Is equal. O Definitions Corporal Punishment: \"physical punishment, as spanking, inflicted on a child by an adult in authority.\" Dictionary.com Child: \"a person between birth and full growth; a boy or girl: books for children.\" Dictionary.com O Notes Interestingly my opponent said \"Corporal punsihment for children\". That's right we're talking about punishment for children and not against them. One must realize that corporal punishment and child abuse are two different things .One acts as an attention getter in a controlled atmosphere, while the other is used intentionally to harm the child in a physical manner. My opponent may not under any circumstances say what kind of corporal punishment I support. In this debate you have mentioned no specifics hence I get to add my own details. O Arguments 1. Quick and Effective Corporal punishment is quick and effective. I don't think that this can be argued. 2. Being Spoiled Undisciplined children are in danger of becoming tyrants. Todays society is a good example: http://www.leaderu.com... 3. Parents We can argue until the bears take over this site but ultimately its our parents choice: \" Many school districts also offer parents an opportunity to state whether or not they wish corporal punishment to be used on their sons and daughters. Typically, the parents fill out a form which is filed in the school office. In many districts this is an \"opt-out\" system. In others an \"opt-in\" system applies, whereby no student is so punished without explicit parental consent.\" http://en.wikipedia.org... Thank you",

            "premise": "cor\"po\"ral pun\"ish\"ment noun 1.physical punishment, such as caning or flogging. implemented: Verb 1.put (a decision, plan, agreement, etc.) into effect. School corporal punishment refers to causing deliberate pain or discomfort in response to undesired behaviour by students in schools. It often involves striking the student either across the buttocks or on the hands, with an implement such as a cane, wooden paddle, slipper, leather strap or wooden yardstick. Less commonly, it could also include spanking or smacking the student with the open hand, especially at the elementary school level. As of 2015, 31 states and the District of Columbia have banned corporal punishment in public schools, though in some of these there is no explicit prohibition. Corporal punishment is also unlawful in private schools in Iowa and New Jersey. In 19 U.S. states, corporal punishment is lawful in both public and private schools. Years ago, it was acceptable for a husband in the United States to beat his wife in order to get her to do what he wanted or to punish her. His asserting his authority through corporal punishment was accepted as a social norm. Should we be teaching school children that in this day in age it is appropriate for them to be hit when someone disagrees with them and their behaviour. Physical punishment can easily escalate and cross the line to abuse and serious injury, particularly when an instrument is used and public schools are required to use a paddle or ruler to implement corporal punishment. An estimated 1 to 2 percent of physically punished students in the United States are seriously injured, to the point of needing medical attention. According to the AAP and the Society for Adolescent Medicine, these injuries have included bruises, abrasions, broken bones, whiplash injury, muscle damage,brain injury, and in a few cases death. I am aware that this data is out of date but we should not ignore the fact that through the ages the number of children being smacked by their superiors is large during the 2005-2006 school year, 223,190 children had corporal punishment implemented in schools. It is because of these reasons I do not believe it moral to implement corporal punishment in schools.

Let me explain, I believe that some slight forms of corporal punishment should be allowed, but not to the extent that you are talking about in your argument. In schools, children do not learn as much when they are being disrupted by other classmates. If a classmate is being a distraction, the others don't learn. If there are some very mild forms of punishment like a slap on the rust with a ruler or some other form of mild physical punishment, the student will be more likely to stop and quit being a distraction at other times. If physical punishment is only used as a last resort, being punished will become a thing that students (especially young students) not want. If a student knows they will only be lectured, they will be less likely to stop behaving that way than if they were lectured and mildly punished physically. When a student wants attention, sometimes they act out to get it. If they gen punished corporeally they wont resort to acting out in school to get the attention that they yearn. Also if it is used less often, and more conservatively, the student will not be psychologically harmed in the process.",

Also since you didn't specify what type of education, I must assume all grade levels(excluding college), and thus we will debate on that. First off, corporal punishment is a unnecessary act, and the schools have no right to hit a kid without consent of parents. Also since you never specified whether school had the parent consent. You have so many more punishments such as : Detention, sat. detention, in school suspension, suspension, and expulsion. I don't see why you need to enter the fist of \"justice\" into the picture. Secondly, striking the child isn't going to solve anything, all it is going to do is embarrass the child, and cause possible physcological problems. Also if the child is in high school and gets hit, then he or she may strike back. Also the allowing of corporal punishment in school leads to child abuse. What stops a teacher for beating the kid, or a student beating a teacher back in self defense. Thirdly, violence does not belong in the classroom. It does not help the education, and in fact probably harms it. The child will be more afraid of the teacher, they won't pay attention to the lesson plan. Also most associations are against corporal punishment, the one that caught my eye was The American School Counsellor Association. Hmmm, counsellors against the beating of children, didn't see that coming. If the people who are suppose to watch and help guide our children oppose why should it be used?",

For semantic clarity, the two possible debate-friendly meanings of this debate's title read as follows: \"Corporal punishment is being reintroduced to schools\" - versus \"no it isn't.\" \"Corporal punishment should be reintroduced to schools\" - versus \"no it shouldn't.\" \"Corporal punishment being reintroduced to schools\" is like saying \"Flowers being picked.\" One cannot agree or disagree, the sentence is worded as hypothetical. Based on my opposition's first round arguments, until otherwise specified, I will assume he means to use the latter, *should be* phrasing. That said, although public schools do not typically practice corporal punishment, it was never legally un-introduced from schools. 1. Parents are entitled to corporal punishment \"Corporal punishment of minors within domestic settings is still lawful in 49 of the United States. Delaware outlawed it as child abuse in 2012\" http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. Teachers are entitled to the same teaching methods as parents according to \"In loco parentis,\" a legal doctrine adopted by both the United States and Britain. \"this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent\" http://en.wikipedia.org... A doctrine that was never removed cannot technically be reintroduced. To 'reintroduce' corporal punishment, we would have to first ban it, then reintroduce it. I argue that we should not reintroduce it because that would require us to take the time to unnecessarily ban it.",

            "discussionTitle": "Should Corporal Punishment be allowed at school",
            "conclusion": "Should Corporal Punishment be allowed at school",
            "premise": "Corporal punishment means physical torture. This could be in the form of beating, canning, thrashing or even whipping. Corporal punishment is a common feature in schools. Several incidents of such punishment have been reported in the newspapers. Such kind of punishment can physically impair a student for his whole life. It may also affect him psychologically, disturb his mental balance. This kind of punishment should be stopped immediately. The method to discipline a child through corporal punishment was first practiced during the medieval period and is old-fashioned. Teachers should deal with their students patiently, advising and guiding them in every sphere of life. The term, 'Corporal punishment' means 'physical punishment'. It is a kind of punishment that affects the human body adversely. This could be in the form of beating, thrashing or even whipping'. Thus, punishment of this kind is physical torture to a student and should be condemned and stopped immediately. Moreover, such kind of punishment may sometimes physically impair a student for his whole life. Psychologists are of the opinion that such a punishment can affect a student mentally, for a very long period of time. In India Corporal punishment has become a common feature in schools. Several incidents of physical assault have been reported in the newspapers. For instance, a student of class XII from a popular school in Udaipur and a student from Delhi Municipality Corporation School died due to the beating, they received from their school teacher. This is shocking. In another incident, a class XI student in Ahmedabad accused a teacher of having hit him so hard that he suffered a temporary loss of hearing. Making a student kneel down or stand for hours, pinching and slapping are all set to be banned under plans to widen the definition of Corporal punishment in schools. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has suggested a code of regulations on the conduct of teachers in schools. A standout feature of the code is a total ban on corporal punishment. So far, only six Indian states have banned the cane in schools. Corporal Punishment is just another form of physical violence and has no place in an enlightened society. However there are numerous instances of milder punishment that go unnoticed. There is enough evidence to suggest that teachers, including those at elite schools, physically and verbally intimidate children, some of whom could be as young as five years old. There is unfortunately no national law banning cruel or unusual punishment in schools. The National Policy on Education merely says that corporal punishment is not permissible. Discipline is a must for students in schools and colleges. However, enforcing it through Corporal punishment is highly objectionable and rather, inhuman. This kind of punishment was generally practiced during the medieval period, and is very old-fashioned. Moreover, this is not the right procedure or technique to discipline a student. Teacher should realize that children at the school level are at an impressionable age. If they are subjected to such kind of physical torture, they may develop a fear (phobia) to approach or meet a teacher, or even attend the school. They will never respect and love their teachers which is very essential for the overall development of a student's personality. This is because a guru or a teacher is a role model for a student. He must set an example for his students through his behavior and actions. He must deal with his students patiently, advising and guiding him to excel in every sphere of life such as academics, sports, music and various other extra-curricular activities. A student must also be free and friendly with his teachers, ask questions, clarify his doubts etc. At the same time, he should always respect and obey his teachers. However, this obedience and respect cannot be demanded forcibly through corporal punishment. It can only come spontaneously through deep regard for one's teachers. Supreme Court states that 'children are not subjected to corporal punishment in schools and the they should receive education in an environment of freedom and dignity, free from fear. National Policy on Education directs the school authority to take necessary action in the matter, so that the pernicious practice of affecting physical and mental health of children can be nipped in the bud. Corporal punishment does not have any positive effect on a student. If further worsens the situation. For instance, a student who is very naughty, or least interested in studies, when subjected to corporal punishment, may become more aggressive in nature. He may even leave the school and studies. Nonetheless, such a drastic decision can be disastrous for a child's future. Corporal punishment may even cause permanent physical disorders in a child. For example, hard slapping upon the ears can make him totally deaf for the rest of his life. Harsh whipping and canning in the hands and legs can damage the bones and muscles paralyzing him completely. There are some people who would say scolding of school children and verbal intimidation should not be outlawed. This argument is flawed. Verbal abuse could be as damaging and humiliating for children, especially the younger ones, as physical punishment. Parents often complain to schools authorities against abusing their children in school. But they are too often cowed by school authorities to raise their voice. In such a situation, there is no alternative but for the state government to interfere. To conclude, it must always be borne in our mind that teaching is one of the noblest professions where one imparts knowledge to others. The teacher must consider his students as his own children, and treat them as lovingly and caringly as possible. He should applaud a student's achievements, and help him to overcome his shortcomings by motivating him to pursue his interests. A teacher should be there to guide a student to become responsible, educated and a well-groomed citizen of a country. While handling students, it must always be kept in mind that they are like flowers. They have to be nurtured with great care to help them blossom and spread their fragrance.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his argument. I will now present my argument as defined. Arguments Against Corporal Punishment being enforced in school. 1). The more \"spankings children\" experience, the greater the chance that they will become aggressive and engage in other anti-social behavior. Source: (Study reported in Archives of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, August 1997 by Murray A. Straus, David B. Sugarman, and Jean Giles-Sims) 2). Poor children, minorities and children with disabilities are hit more regularly in schools, sometimes at 2-5 times the rate of other children. Source: (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Surveys from 1976-2003, Center for Effective Discipline.) 3). Corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems. Research shows that this is indeed the message that kids receive whether it's inflicting, receiving or witnessing . Source: (Eron, Walder & Lefkowitz, 1971; Hyman & Snook, 1999; Lahey, Moffit & Caspi, 2003, Reid, Patterson & Snyder, 2002.) 4). Studies have shown that corporal punishment of children is related to decreased morality, increased aggression, more antisocial behavior, increased criminality, decreased mental health outcomes, increased adult abusive behaviors, and increased risk of being victimized by abusive relationships in adulthood. Source: (Meta-Analysis of 88 corporal punishment studies (Gershoff, E.T. 2002).) 5). Some statistics here: 78% of corporal punishment states achieved below the national average at the fourth grade level in reading. 75% of the corporal punishment states achieved below the national average in eighth grade level reading (Center for Effective Discipline, year: 2004). Sixty-seven percent of Ohio corporal punishment schools fell in the lowest 25% of schools on state school report cards in the 99-00 school year (Center for Effective Discipline, year: 2001). 6). Injuries often occur e.g bruises, broken bones. Children's deaths have occurred in the U.S. due to school corporal punishment. (hearing before the Juvenile Justice Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate. October 17, 1984) 7). Corporal punishment enforces physical aggression as an acceptable and good means of getting rid of unwanted behavior in our society. (Position paper opposing school corporal punishment by the Society for Adolescent Medicine (Greydanus, DE. et al, 2003).) 8). More school shooting deaths were found in states allowing school corporal punishment than those who do not. (D. Arcus, 2002.) 9). There is evidence that harsh physical punishments are damaging to children, emotionally as well as physically. (Mohr, WK and Anderson, J.A. 2002.) Facts: 10). Schools are the only institutions in America in which striking another person is legally sanctioned. It is not allowed in prisons, in the military or in mental hospitals. 11). Many alternatives to corporal punishment have proven their worth. Alternatives teach children to be self-disciplined rather than cooperative only because of fear. (No source here, just kind of general knowledge). These are the main reasons why I believe that corporal punishment should not be enforced in schools. I look forward to the next round.

            "premise": "Here are a few of my arguments for corporal punishment. 1. Corporal punishment sets clear boundaries and motivates children to behave in school. If children are clearly given the fact that if they misbehave, they will be given corporal punishment, then this will make them more aware of what will happen to them and will make them think twice about their actions. A lot of the time corporal punishment is not told clearly enough to the child and they do not understand the consequences of their actions, and therefore misbehave. 2. Another argument for corporal punishment is that it is quick. Other forms of punishment such as detention or suspension in schools can hurt the student because the student can miss school, and waste hours on top of hours sitting in detention, while corporal punishment is quick and takes a second. So non corporal punishment can ultimately be a waste of time. 3. A study showed that kids who have corporal punishment misbehave less. In other words it deters misbehavior. If we have corporal punishment kids will not misbehave as much because of misbehavior. 4. Young children are not able to discern right and wrong to the decree that older age kids are. For example, if a young kid were to stick his finger in an electrical socket, then if you give them a smaller dose of pain, then it will teach them not to do life threatening things. Little kids don't understand being grounded. They don't understand their being punished. Rather with corporal punishment toddlers know that their experiencing pain and it teaches them not to do the wrong thing. 5. As corporal has decreased in public schools and home, you would expect to seem a decrease in misbehavior, but that hasn't been the case. This is why corporal punishment is better. It shows kids that they will be given physical pain if they misbehave. In conclusion, corporal punishment should be allowed. Sources used 1. procon.org 2. soapboxie",

            "premise": "Before I start, let me just say this much: I'm against corporal punishment, this is just for fun since we just did this debate at school. Corporal punishment is when a teacher punishes a student physically for a mistake, and it needs to be brought back to schools. It is true that it has been misused in the past, but with new rules, corporal punishment would be a new and healthy part of a student's life. In this case, the ruler shall not be used, or any other tool used to strike the student, including the hand of a teacher. Instead, the punishment will be carried out in the form of running. Depending on the severity of the student's mistake and his/her physical status, the student will be required to run a certain distance. By doing this, it will not only ensure the student will not be abused by a teacher, and it is also good physical excersize. According to http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au..., running will help build strong bones, strengthen muscles, improve cardiovascular fitness. burn plenty of kilojoules. and help maintain a healthy weight. This way, not only is the student punished, it also helps maintain a student's good health. This form of punishment will also avoid missing classtime, which is a problem caused by detention or suspension. The running will be done before or after school, therefore no classtime will be missed, allowing the student to learn everything he/she is supposed to learn. It also costs no money to use this form of punishment. It is efficent both time and money wise. Therefore, corporal punishment should be brought back to schools in the form of running.",

            "premise": "\"In the first round you cut and paste a paragraph that included sexual abuse and spanking OFTEN. We are debating corporal punishment.\"As I said previously, research indicates that corporal punishment may adversely affect a student's self-image and his or her school achievement. This is a school study.[1] Anyhow, can my opponent give a substantive difference between corporal punishment at home and corporal punishment at school, whereby the deleterious effects of corporal punishment at home somehow transmute into positive effects when delivered by a teacher?\"Then you cut and paste corporal punishment to reduce anti social behavior. That is not what a school would spank for.\"Does my opponent doubt that antisocial behaviour occurs in schools, or does he think that it is not an infraction of school discipline? Or is he claiming that schools who practice corporal punishment only do so for sociable violations?My opponent has yet to show that school shoootings and lack of corporal punishment are linked, especially bearing in the mind the two problems I pointed out that he has to overcome.\"I've never heard a child justify hitting another child by saying that it's OK because mom and dad hit me.\"Unlikely that they do justify it at all. However, it has been shown that corporal punishment leads to increased aggression in children. \"Properly done, spanking causes no lasting physical damage.\"The issue is psychological damage. My opponent raises concerns about correlative studies. Studies linking smoking and lung cancer are correlative. We could argue that people who are prone to lung cancer are more likely to smoke. However, we also have a better causal mechanism that explains the link. We understand the concept of carcinogens.It is the same for corporal punishment. There is a link between spanking and increased aggression. We could argue that children who are likely to become more aggressive are more annoying and are more likely to get spanked, but there is a body of theory that explains spanking as a causal factor.Aside from violence being known to be a stressor, corporal punishment itself is understood to be a stressor.[2]In a summary of scientific research, Elizabeth Gershoff explains some of the causal mechanisms:\"Social cognitive theory suggests that children who are hit by their parents (and thus physically hurt by them) will develop a tendency to make hostile attributions about others that, in turn, increase the likelihood that they will behave inappropriately in social interactions. Finally, attribution theorists argue that, because corporal punishment uses physical force, its use by parents constitutes an external source to which children can attribute their compliance; corporal punishment does not promote internalized reasons for behaving appropriately. Children who have not internalized the reasons for behaving pro-socially thus have no reason to behave appropriately when their parents are not there to provide an external reason for doing so.\"[3]Of the association between behavioural and emotional difficulties,\"There is significant theoretical and empirical justification for assuming that at least some important part of this association is due to the causal impact of corporal punishment\"[2]The use of Corporal Punishment has been associated with anger, fear, and humiliation in the child. Also of concern is the issue of trust between children and adults, and the child's ability to deal with situations without resorting to violence.[4]There is a link between corporal punishment and later wife beating. We could argue that children who are likely to beat their wives when they grow up are worse behaved than other children, but we have a body of theory that explains corporal punishment as a causal factor.Importantly, even if causation were not established, corporal punishment is ineffective at preventing children from growing up to be wife beaters, alcoholics, depressives, and suicide risks. So what is the use of continuing the practice?\"would it mean that all forms of corporal punishment cause emotional and behavioral problems or only the more severe, abusive forms like hitting on the head or boxing the ears? \"How is one form of attack abuse and not the other? What is \"acceptable\" violence against defenceless children? Anyhow, several of the studies I have presented have been specifically on spanking.Strassberg et al. (1994) found that milder forms of spanking in the home correlated with aggressive school behavior to a significant degree, and that child abuse correlated with aggressive behavior at school to an even more significant degree. Any child who had been abusively \"hit\" even once in their life was excluded from the \"spanked\" group, yet the correlation between spanking and school aggression remained significant.[5] A 2006 review found that\"Research on the long-term effects of physical punishment are consistent, and overwhelmingly negative over a wide variety of child development outcomes.\"[6] Lazelere has no case.\"Parents that love their children and are involved in their lives may use spanking, but they will never use spanking in a way that harms their children.\"My opponent confuses intention with outcome. However,\"Rather than serve as a buffer, high parental support may create a context in which the child experiences incidences of physical punishment as inconsistent, confusing, and especially distressing.\"[2]My opponent's hyperlink is broken.Corporal punishmment is not more effective even in the short term than other measures.[3][7] There is no case for it at all.[1] Society for Adolescent Medicine, Ad Hoc Corporal Punishment Committee.

            "conclusion": "Corporal Punishment Should be Enforced in Schools",
            "premise": "I thank Pro for his rebuttal and will now give my rebuttal to his arguments. Pro begins his argument by listing the supposed \"pros\" of corporal punishment. 1) Yes it can be argued that corporal punishment teaches kids discipline but I think that the reasons why it teaches discipline is appalling. Corporal punishment teaches kids to be disciplined out of nothing else but fear. There is no real or valid motive for a child to be disciplined as a result of corporal punishment apart from fear of physical pain. This is in effect isn't teaching children genuine discipline or the importance of discipline. Here are some other proven to work alternatives of disciplining students other than physical abuse (http://www.webmd.com...). Why would corporal punishment need to be enforced as a means of discipline when there are plenty of other means. Not to mention the sheer problems associated with corporal punishment mentioned in my round 2 arguments. 2) You have no sources to back up the claim that corporal punishment actually deters bad behaviour. This article argues that corporal punishment doesn't deter bad behavior. (http://getreadyforcollege.wordpress.com...) several case studies show that by repeated physical tortures children usually become even more adamant and might also start hating their elders as they do not understand the reason that why doing certain things are intolerable. On the other hand, disciplining without hitting would mean to first make the child understand that why certain behavior is acceptable and some are not. Teach the child some basic rules of the society and why are they to be followed. It has often been found that by giving logical reasoning to your child's answers, they can be stop many wrong deeds. This is also educating the child about conduct instead of making the child fear constantly. Here is a case study on both the negative physical and mental effects of corporal punishment:(http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org...) 3) I'm not sure how \"no suspensions\" is such a pro of corporal punishment. Firstly students can still get suspended if corporal punishment exists in their school but surely suspension is more beneficial to a child than corporal punishment. Suspension 1)Removes a problematic student from school. 2)Provides temporary relief to frustrated school personnel. 3)Raises parental attention to their child's misconduct. It does all these things without the physical and physocological effects of corporal punishment. 4) Also I don't see how corporal punishment limits the amount of educational disruptions. Taking the time to give out corporal punishment in whatever form is much more of a disruption than telling a student to be quiet for example. Again there are many other effective means of punishment other than having to resort to physical violence, which as I have shown, has a great amount of disadvantages. Pro tries to argue that there are restrictions to corporal punishment e.g male teachers not being permitted to use this punishment on female students, however I do not see this as a valid argument. There may be restrictions to corporal punishment but this isn't really making a case on your stance that it should be enforced in school. I would like to state that The United States is the only nation in the western world which still permits corporal punishment in its schools. And even having said that, corporal punishment is banned in schools in 31 states. Statistics show that corporal punishment is on a decline. (http://www.corpun.com...) This is another point for my case. There is obviously a reason for this decline. People are coming to their senses are realizing that the disadvantages of corporal punish enormously outweigh whatever advantages there might be, which I feel I have shown I look forward to the final round.",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for their acceptance in this debate. Round 2 are arguments only, so let's start with that. First, I'll start with parental corporal punishment.Parental Corporal Punishment1. Hitting is frequently done impulsively.A study shows that parents are more likely to spank or hit their child almost immediately. In 10 minute audio recordings, it seems like the child is getting hit without them explaining why they have done their behavior. Parents usually hit out of frustration without actually thinking about the severity of what that child has done. They also spank their child for minor infractions, not just major ones. The practice of hitting a child is recommended to be the last resort, however, according to these studies, they seem to be doing it impulsively. They also recommend doing it once or twice however these audio recordings show them hitting their child a lot more than that. Basically, parents are abusing or overexaggerating moments to use the practice of corporal punishment. To extend on this, Holden states: \"From the audio, we heard parents hitting their children for the most extraordinarily mundane offenses, typically violations of social convention. Also, corporal punishment wasn't being used as a last resort. On average, parents hit or spanked just half a minute after the conflict began.\" [1]2. Hitting causes externalization of behavior and increases in aggression.A study from Michael Mackenzie of Columbia University indicated that maternal spanking at age 5 was associated with greater aggression and rule-breaking by the time children were age 9. In addition, lower scores on vocabulary tests by the age of 9 were also associated with the use of spanking at age 5. [2]3. Hitting children affects their development.A study from Akemi Tomoda (et al.) showed that harsh corporal punishment reduced children\u2019s gray matter, which processes information in the brain. Another study showed that corporal punishment had a bidirectional relationship with a lower cognitive ability, meaning that parents tend to hit children with lesser cognitive ability more frequently (most likely out of frustration), and children who experience corporal punishment often had a lower cognitive ability as a result. These negative effects on the brain can surely be connected to the increased aggression and externalization of behavior found in the other studies. [2] [3] [4]3.1 Hitting causes mental illnesses.The study, named \"Physical Punishment and Mental Disorders: Results From a Nationally Representative U.S. Sample,\" is released in the August edition of Pediatrics, which is online July 2nd.It states clearly that children who are spanked, hit or pushed have an increased risk of mental problems when they grow older. The research seems to show that the effect can range from mood and anxiety disorders to drug and alcohol abuse. Around 2% to 7% of children are affected by physical punishment. [5]Secondly, I'll talk about only one argument I have for school corporal punishment.Corporal Punishment in SchoolsCorporate punishment causes lower academic success.Aside from the infliction of pain and the physical injuries which often result from the use physical punishments, these violent disciplinary methods also impact students' academic achievement and long-term well-being.[6] Despite significant evidence that corporal punishment is detrimental to a productive learning environment, there is currently no federal prohibition on the use of physical discipline against children in public school. In fact, children in some states receive greater protection against corporal punishment in detention facilities than they do in their public schools.[7] For this reason and others, the ACLU and HRW are encouraged that this subcommittee is seeking to address the problems stemming from corporal punishment in schools.[8]Those are my arguments for round 2.Sources:[1] https://www.sciencedaily.com...[2] https://www.theodysseyonline.com...[3] http://www.cnn.com...[4] http://pubpages.unh.edu...[5] https://www.medicalnewstoday.com...[6] See generally A Violent Education, at 57; Impairing Education, at 4-5.[7] Corporal punishment of children in juvenile justice facilities have been prohibited by the Courts of Appeals in several Federal Circuits. See Nelson v. Heyne, 491 F.2d 352 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied 417 U.S. 476 (paddling of children in juvenile detention was a violation of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment); Morales v. Turman, 562 F.2d 993, 998 (5th Cir. 1977) (corporal punishment and physical abuse in juvenile detention facilities subject to prohibition as a violation of Eighth Amendment), rev'd on other grounds, 535 F.2d 864 (5th Cir. 1976), rev'd and remanded, 430 U.S. 322 (1977). See also,Santana v. Collazo, 533 F. Supp. 966 (D.P.R. 1982) (corporal punishment against juveniles in industrial schools and juvenile camps violates Eighth Amendment and is barred \"for any reason\"), aff'd in part and vacated in part, 714 F.2d 1172 (lst Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 974 (1984). The American Correctional Association has also issued standards banning use of corporal punishment in juvenile facilities. See also Steven J. Martin, Staff Use of Force in United States Confinement Settings, 22 Wash. U. J.L. & Pol'y 145 (2006). In addition, corporal punishment and other harsh disciplinary practices are prohibited in publicly-funded non-medical substance abuse and long-term medical care facilities. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290jj (banning corporal punishment in \"non-medical community-based facilities for children and youth.\"); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.13 (banning corporal punishment in long-term medical care facilities).[8] https://www.hrw.org... s://media.rbl.ms...; alt=\"\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0VIPEM1514055278\" /> s://media.rbl.ms...; alt=\"\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ZKWD5P1514055278\" />",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for posting his arguments.I will bring up my own points and rebut some of my opponent's points.I will elaborate on my rebuttals in future rounds, as I ran out of room.I would like the readers to notice that my opponent is often the logical fallacy called \"Appeal to Emotion\". I will expand on this accusation later in the debate.Before I begin my debate, I would like to say that I am not arguing for an extreme. I will be arguing for a moderate amount of corporal punishment.My 5 contentions will be:1. Corporal punishment serves as a deterrent2. Corporal punishment saves the child's future3. Corporal punishment is not abuse4.Corporal punishment increases productivity5. The Bible supports corporal punishmentBefore anybody starts bashing me on my biblical argument, I would like to point out that my opponent has not set any criteria for available arguments. Therefore, I will use whatever I want. The Bible is provided as more of a \"bonus\" contention.C1:Corporal punishment serves as a deterrentCorporal punishment by itself, is not different that another type of punishment.It is clear to everybody that punishment serves as a deterrent. If my opponent's tries to negate this, then he will have a very hard time.Just the idea alone makes sense. If I add a punishment onto an action, the person will be less likely to commit the action again.This applies to corporal punishment.If a teacher slaps person X for verbal abuse, then he will most likely not do it again for fear of being slapped.These practices successfully transition into a child's later life.... leading me to my next point C2: Corporal punishment saves the child's future Corporal punishment, in moderation, early in a child's life helps save their future.Dr. Walter E. Williams, a famous economist says (2):\"Today, it's not uncommon for young criminals to be arrested, counseled and released to the custody of a parent 20 or 30 times before they spend one night in jail. Such a person is a very good candidate for later serving a long prison sentence or, worse, facing the death penalty. If you interviewed such a person and asked: \"Thinking back to when you started your life of crime, would you have preferred a punishment, such as caning, that might have set you straight or be where you are today?\" I'd bet my retirement money that he'd say he wished someone had caned some sense into him. That being the case, which is more cruel: caning or allowing such a person to become a criminal?\" \"Experts theorize that corporal punishment helps create more disciplined and hard-working students and civilians that develop to be more prudent financially. When a nation develops its students into responsible citizens, the entire nation ultimately benefits through increased productivity and efficiency in the economy. Students learn through corporal punishment that there are greater objectives and goals beyond themselves. They ultimately learn to contribute to the economy in a positive way.\"(5)I know that we are talking about corporal punishment in schools, but this directly relates back to it. \"Whipping\" out any bad practices early in a child's life is acceptable as it saves them from committing the same mistake in a unforgiving and cruel adult world.Many children that would be corporally punished in schools are the \"back-talkers\", the interrupters, and verbal abusers. It is better to prevent these practices in childhood. In the adult world, verbal abuse and \"back-talking\" to your superiors is not tolerated. These practices can cause a child to lose their job, and even worse, their future.This discouragement of bad habits sets children up to succeed. Children are more impressionable than adults. Therefore, these effects will be amplified in them. (3)C3: Corporal Punishment is not abuseMy opponent's main arguments are centered around abuse and corporal punishment. Abuse is: \"Use (something) to bad effect or for a bad purpose\" (3) To prove that a corporal punishment is not abuse, I must show that there is at least one positive effect of corporal punishment.I have shown that corporal punishment saves a child's life in the future (and I will show how it increases productivity). Therefore, corporal punishment is not abuse.The logic goes as follows:1. Abuse consists of using something for a bad purpose of effect2. Corporal punishment helps children later in their life3. Therefore, corporal punishment is not abuse.This negates many of my opponent's points about abuse.C4: Corporal punishment increases productivityCorporal punishment increases productivity.According to Surinder Kahai: \"Contingent punishment behaviors also have been found to be beneficial by promoting group drive and productivity\"(6)\"Contingent reward behavior has been found to promote group drive, cohesiveness, and productivity. Contingent punishment behaviors also have been found to be beneficial by promoting group drive and productivity \" (6)This debate is not whether contingent punishment or contingent rewards are more efficient, simply about whether contingent punishment increases productivity.However, corporal punishment also serves as a incentive.Not everybody is going to get corporally punished. Corporal punishment also serves as a stimulant for those who don't misbehave.By not getting punished, they think that they are doing the correct thing. Therefore, they will keep doing it.This promotes good behaviour in those who already have it, and reduces bad behavior in those who misbehave.C5: The Bible promotes corporal punishmentThis serves as a \"bonus\" contention. According to the Bible:Proverbs 23:14. The authorship is traditionally attributed to King Solomon: \"Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.\"\"He who spareth his rod hateth his son, but he who loveth him is chasteneth him betimes.\" (King Solomon, in the Book of Proverbs [13:24].\"Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of correction will drive it far from him.\" (Proverbs 22:15)\"Do not withhold correction from a child, for if you beat him with a rod, he will not die. You shall beat him with a rod. And deliver his soul from hell.\" (Proverbs 23:13)RebuttalTrust IssuesI fail to see how trust issues with teachers relate to students.A teacher is not there to provide a source of comfort, merely a source for teaching and learning.A school has guidance counselors which the students can go to if they have issues, not the teachers.I assume that we are not talking about corporal punishment in the very low grades.Since about Grade 3/4 and up, student/teacher relationships are merely focused on teaching.In Junior High School, High School and University, there is virtually no student/teacher relationship.Corporal punishment would not damage any trust issues with teachers as there aren't any.If the student has problems, there is always a guidance counselor.Family/Peer IssuesI would like to point out that my opponent is using \"Appeal to Emotion\" in this subtopic as he is listing random sad stories of children getting abused.My opponent has also listed statistics (which I doubt are correct, but I will accept them for this point) that are completely irrelevant to this topic.I have shown how Corporal Punishment is not abuse, therefore negating many of my opponent's points.ConclusionI am running out of room so I will quickly wrap this up. I have shown how corporal punishment serves as a deterrent to future misbehaving, saves the child's future, is not abuse, increases productivity, and the Bible promotes it.Vote PROGood luck to CON(2)http://findarticles.com...(3)http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi...(4)http://goo.gl...(5)http://www.ehow.com...(6)http://www.leadingvirtually.com...",

            "conclusion": "Corporal Punishment Should be Enforced in Schools",
            "premise": "I thank the Con for accepting the debate and look forward to a fun and interesting debate with him! I would like to start off with the definition of corporal punishment, acquired from [1]. \"Corporal punishment, physical chastisement of an offender. At one extreme it includes the death penalty (see capital punishment), but the term usually refers to punishments like flogging, caning, mutilation, and branding. Until c.1800, in many parts of the world, most crimes were punished thus, or by such practices as confinement in the pillory or stocks, which combined physical chastisement with the humiliation of an individual possible in a relatively small, cohesive society. Flogging was especially prevalent, being used also to keep order among the institutionalized insane and in schools and the armed forces.\" I would like to remind the voters that this argument is based on corporal punishment in schools, not military, law enforcement, insane institutions, etc. I begin my argument with a list of the pros of corporal punishment in schools, which is what I will base my argument on. These are found on [2]. Teaches students discipline Deters bad behavior No suspensions Limits amount of educational disruptions These are several pros that can be justified in any modern day school system. With students today becoming more rowdy and rude towards teachers, less time is used for teaching, and more is used for issuing detentions, write ups, scolding in class, or other forms of punishment. This naturally would hardly deter any common misbehavior, as they would soon go back to their usual antics. Looking at the graph on [3], this illustrates how education in The United States has dropped from 1900 to present day. Keep in mind, the beginning of the 1900's to the late 1970's, corporal punishment was a widely used form of punishment in all schools across America. The message sent was clear. You go to school to learn, and you respect the teachers who give you this information. If the respect is not given, then you were punished. This undoubtedly kept students in line, a reason for the higher test scores. [4] shows the states who still use the method of corporal punishment, rarely, yet still in effect. For those who think corporal punishment allows for students to be physically \"beat\" I would like to use this next topic to show what forms of corporal punishment there are, and the restrictions. [5] lists the types of corporal punishment, and although many seems harsh, the most commonly used forms are that of canning, paddling, flogging and saucing. There are, however, restrictions set on corporal punishment, as seen in [6]. Such restrictions include male teachers not being permitted to use this punishment on female students, and vice versa with female teachers to male students. I end my debate here, as I still would like to include more arguments in my next round. I again thank Con for his acceptance to the debate, and hope for a fun clean interesting debate. I would like to remind voters that I am simply playing the devil's advocate and minority voice, and that the arguments may not reflect my personal opinion. I ask that you vote based on content and not beliefs, as these may not directly resemble my values. 1. http://www.infoplease.com... 2. http://www.ehow.com... 3. http://www.google.com... 4. http://www.infoplease.com... 5. http://privateschool.about.com... 6. http://www.educationrightscenter.org...",

            "conclusion": "Corporal punishment should be implemented in a school setting",
            "premise": "Before I really get started I want to comment on the rules. Rule 1, the Bible is not a valid source. Why would this be a rule? Does my opponent have a bias against the religious text that most Christians follow? Why does my opponent care so much about that with regards to this issue? That seems rather condemning of my opponent's biases. Rule 2, always state sources (if you do not give sources you automatically lose). This too is an interesting rule. Is there something magically true and perfectly right about sources? What if my source is a KKK website? I can still win the argument because I cited my source! This seems to betray another interesting bias. A bias towards automatic acceptance/reliance on \"scientific\" studies. No one can win a debate against someone who has already denied the validity of anything that is against what they already believe. Though I guess, to be fair, I'm not really aiming my arguments at convincing my opponent so much as you, the readers. And what am I going to try to convince you of?Well, first off, I know I'll never win on the very strong position \"corporal punishment should be implemented in a school setting.\" There's no way I could convince you that public school teachers should spank (or otherwise physically punish) their students. I don't want that any more than you or my opponent does. What I will be arguing for is the more modest idea, \"corporal punishment should NOT be OUTLAWED in a school setting.\" Study after study, which I'm sure my opponent will reference has shown that physically punishing children can have harmful results. I have no doubt that that general point is true. However, I would argue, and this is the main crux of my position, all those studies have been aimed at the wrong idea. They seem to be aimed at proving what we all know intuitively. That is, the more an adult hurts a child the worse that child will behave/develop. But, that's not what corporal punishment should be. The position paper of the Journal of Adolescent Health on this topic defines it as this: \"Corporal punishment refers to intentional application of physical pain as a method of changing behavior [1].\" (They're referencing Straus MA, Mouradian VE. Impulsive corporal punishment by mothers and antisocial behavior and impulsiveness of children. Behav Sci Law 1998;16:353\u201374.) Sure this is a fine general definition, but look at the source, \"Impulsive corporal punishment by mothers ...\" Corporal punishment cannot be impulsive. The effectiveness of any punishment system is in its comprehensiveness and consistency. If an authority says, \"Don't do that or I'll ...\" and then doesn't follow through and lets the child slide and continue to get away with whatever behavior the adult is trying to change, it'll never work. It doesn't matter if the threat is physical or non-physical punishment, if it's not carried out consistently and fairly, it's worthless. Impulsive punishment also won't work (again whether it's physical or otherwise). What is the goal of punishment/discipline? Are those two the same?Let's look at the issue from a totally different perspective. Let's think of discipline and punishment as two very different things. Discipline is a way to change behavior and is generally not physical. Punishment is retribution or the base result of breaking the rules/laws/regulation. Punishment can lead to or even cause a person to change his/her behavior, but that's not the primary goal of punishment. The goal of punishment is to mete out the consequences of wrong actions. Given that view, the goal of corporal punishment isn't to change behavior at all. Which means all those studies that my opponent will undoubtedly speak about, are wrong-headed in the first place. Discipline should use various methods get a child to change his/her own behavior. Punishment is the consequences for not changing one's behavior. Punishment need not be physical, and I would readily admit that in today's culture, physical punishment would probably lead to more problems than necessary. That's why I think the issue shouldn't be the encouragement of corporal punishment in schools, rather the permissibility of it. Think about how it looks from the unruly student's position if the worst punishment for misbehavior is expulsion from school. Taking away corporal punishment leaves school punishment toothless. The worst punishment for misbehavior at school is, not having to go to school anymore?! In many cases that's what the unruly student wants in the first place! Discipline should be multifaceted and non-physical to encourage growth and self-discipline. That's the goal after all, to get the child to control him/herself so as to not get punished because he/she doesn't do anything wrong. Discipline says, change, change, change, and here's how we, as your leaders, will help you change. Punishment says, you've done wrong, here are the consequences.Let's not hamstring the people who are supposed to be leading our children, in fact let's not hamstring ourselves by not meting out punishment when it is deserved.Sources:http://www.adolescenthealth.org...http://www.apa.org...http://www.huffingtonpost.com...http://www.newsmax.com...http://www.psychpage.com...;",

            "premise": "As my opponent had posted an argument in round one, albeit a cursory one, I did the same. May I suggest for future debates that my opponent state that round one is for acceptance and avoid making an argument in round one.School shootings are obviously largely an American phenomenon. My opponent is going to have a hard time linking them to bans on school corporal punishment, for two simple reasons. One is that school corporal punishment has been banned in many countries, where school shootings are either very rare or have not even occurred at all.[1] The other reason is that there are nineteen US states where school corporal punishment has not been banned at all.[2][3][4]I am amused that my opponent has used a debate as a source. Not only is it a secondary source, it provides rebuttals for me of any points he gleans from it.Via my opponent's own source, in defence of corporal punishment:In a survey completed by the Times Educational supplement, 6000 teachers were questioned. One in five believed that class room behaviour had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment and they believed the education system would improve with the re-introduction of corporal punishment.[5][6] Shrewd observers will have worked out that the large majority, four in five, believed that class room behaviour had not deteriorated and that education would not improve with the reintroduction of corporal punishment!I suggest the minority of teachers are the ones whose methods of discipline are ineffective and need more training at the very least.In the US, the National Association of Secondary School Principals has expressed its opposition to corporal punishment in schools.[7]Via my opponent's source, we can see that if there is any correlation between corporal punishment and crime, it is that use of corporal punishment coincides with crime. Of the states with the ten highest murder rates in the United States, educators paddle children in eight of them.Of the states with the ten lowest murder rates in the US, educators paddle children in one of them.Of the ten states with the highest percentage of the population in prison, educators paddle children in nine of them.Of the ten states with the lowest percentage of the population in prison, educators do not paddle children in any of them.[8]Crime in the UK (which is what my opponent is referring to with his 67% increase) has been rising since 1918. Plainly banning corporal punishment is not the reason for an upwards trend. Corporal punishment was actually banned in 1986.[9][10][11] There would then be a delay until children reached typical criminal age. Citing the crime increase since 1981 doesn't tell you anything useful.Part of the reason crime statistics have risen sharply is an increase in the reporting of crime. The British Crime Survey showed that the number of crimes was far higher in 1981 than that recorded by the police. There were three times as many thefts, twelve times as much vandalism, three times as many sexual offences, nine times as many robberies, and twice as many burglaries as the official statistics recorded.[12]\"Children\"s behaviour has been adversely affected by the rights culture we have in Britain\"Assertion not backed by evidence.My opponent claims that corporal punishment would be effective against bullying. Is my opponent claiming that bullying is a recent phenomenon, and does not actually occur in places which still have corporal punishment?My opponent claims that corporal punishment \"worked for 7000 years.\" What does my opponent mean by \"worked\"? Does he want to hold up 5000 B.C as a glowing standard? Surely all my opponent can mean by \"worked\" is that the human race continued to exist. Anyhow, tradition is no reason to continue a practice. We can imagine a man in Mexico arguing for the reintroduction of human sacrifice on the basis that it was an honourable tradition.Violence committed by adults on defenceless children is not defensible. If an adult assaults an adult in this manner it is criminal. Guards are not permitted to paddle prisoners. Why is this seen as an acceptable way of disciplining children? If we cannot treat adults in this way, if to do so is abuse, why do some think children should be so dealt with? Also, what lesson can children possibly learn from corporal punishment, except might makes right?My opponent has failed to engage with the scientific literature that says corporal punishment achieves the opposite to its aims. If they cannot do so, everything else is moot. The debate is over. I'll add a couple of more sources for my opponent to engage with.Research indicates that corporal punishment may adversely affect a student's self-image and his or her school achievement.[13] Research has also shown a correlation between the use of corporal punishment and increased school truancy, drop-out rates, violence, and vandalism.[14]I note that my opponent wishes to blame the hippies for everything, but that would be another debate.[1] http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org...[2] http://usatoday30.usatoday.com...[3] http://www.stophitting.com...[4] http://abcnews.go.com...[5] http://www.telegraph.co.uk...[6] http://debatewise.org...

            "premise": "Thank you. Let me begin by saying that yet again you have not given any sources at all so I can automatically assume that you did not use any and therefor this is all opinion based. I will now counter your previous statement. Seeing as you have not provided a source for you definition nor a formal definition. I have not been able to find one such definition that defines corporal punishment as torture or as death. That being said even if this was a true statement I can agree with you that is not what we are talking about. In this statement you say \"Children are different than adults and can be treated differently\" So I would like to ask you a question, do you believe that it is alright for children to be hit and not adults? Is it ok for adults to be hit? Because you said \"To equate the corporal punishment of adults to that of children is simply an invalid analogy\" Because this is your opinion I will state one of my own, I do not believe you to be true. I think that the comparison is very similar. A husband wanted his wife to listen to him and now adults are wanting children to listen to them. In both circumstances it was legal for these figures to assert authority through physical harm. Though now for a husband to hit his wife it is called abuse, why should it be alright for children to be exposed to the same treatment and it be called punishment. Could you please provide me with evidence of risks with other forms of punishment. This is the third time I have had to repeat something that I stated clearly in the rules of this debate. If you are unable to provide me with evidence I am unable to take your argument seriously. I said \"Please always state sources. if you run out of space you may post them in the comments with a note on the formal statement that you are doing so.\" you are doing none of these things and it is detrimental to your argument. Also laws have been in place to enact this form of punishment in the manner you have stated. However I will state previous evidence to support my claim that bad things still have happened regardless. \"the estimated 2230 children in need of medical attention in 2005 alone, the 2 that died, and however many more that are emotionally scarred by corporal punishment experiences.\" \"corporal punishment will gradually become less effective and as a result the severity of it will need to increase. This is why corporal punishment should never be the preferred means of correcting children and teenagers\" I agree with you on this however it should not be a means of punishment at all. Definition for serious injury.\"physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health and happiness or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ\" Though you are correct about the access force resulting in injury and that is not how it should be implemented. Corporal punishment being legal opens the door for abuse. I believe that if it was not legal that the cases of brain injury, broken bones, and death would be nonexistent. It is for all of these reasons I believe corporal punishment to be far to detrimental to be used in schools.

I did have a fact in the statement, I wrote, \"No whiny little brats want to shoot someone when there poor little feelings get hurt because they have had no structure in school or at home.\" That is a pure and simple fact.

When I was a child we respected ALL adults, even the ones we didn't like. Repect was earned NOT handed out freely. Websites will follow at the end. Corporal Punishment as described by the Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus (in one volume - 1990) is \"punishment of a physical nature such as caning\". The term mainly relates to children being punished at school but can also refer to children being punished at home. As of 2008 corporal punishment has been banned in 24 countries, including Germany, Greece and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, it is still widely used by parents in their homes. In the UK, corporal punishment has been banned in schools for numerous years. However a debate is now arising as to whether the decision to ban corporal punishment in schools was the right decision and hence, whether corporal punishment should be reintroduced? If you ask the teachers, those on the front line of disruptive students, a recurring comment is that with corporal punishment off the agenda, there are no sanctions available to teachers for the most stubborn of terrors! 1 In a survey completed by the Times Educational supplement, 6000 teachers were questioned. One in five believed that class room behaviour had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment and they believed the education system would improve with the re-introduction of corporal punishment. We should adhere to the teachers requests. Coming from one of the most liberal professions, I would say 1200 teachers is a lot!!!!!!!!!! 2 It is inevitable that bad classroom behaviour will filter into life outside school. You only have to look at the crime statistics to see that crime has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment. Between 1981, when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997, after the abolition of corporal punishment, there was a 67% increase in crime. 3 Children\"s behaviour has been adversely affected by the rights culture we have in Britain. A teacher cannot threaten a detention, something they are allowed to do, without the retort of \"but you can't take away my freedom\", \"you have no right\" or \"I have rights\". In fact children are acutely aware of how much power they have over the teachers by way of laws and rights, and they use every opportunity to remind the teachers of that fact. If we re-introduced corporal punishment this back chat would cease and the power would be retained by the teachers. And detention is not going to be taken seriously by anyone. What does detention do other than waste your time? If you have ADHD or a creative mind you'll have a blast, effectively learning nothing to *correct* your behavior. If this is the only effective authority a teacher has for an out of control student then that teacher is and probably knows his/her authority is rather pitiful. 4 There is a real feeling amongst those who are bullied that telling the teacher will worsen the problem, not make it better. Victims of bullying fear repercussions. However, if there was a system of corporal punishment behind the teachers, then something could be done which would scare the bullies out of their bullying ways. This would open bully victims up as they would discuss bullying issues with teachers knowing that something definitive could be done. If a child thinks it's okay to hit because a teacher or adult uses corporal punishment then that child is slow and fails to realize the purpose and meaning behind such an action. Besides a good and effective teacher is not going to use corporal punishment all the time, but as a last resort when all else fails. A threat is no good unless there is some fearful truth behind it. Also, teachers are only ignorant to bullying matters because they know they cannot realistically do much to stop it. So in effect, bullying has gotten a lot meaner. 5 http://debatewise.org... 1-5 You can read the opinion of real moms on the following website. http://www.circleofmoms.com... I will leave you with this thought. It worked for over 7000 years. The problem is not in the spanking it is in the weak minds of our youth. Men used to go to war, come home and lead a normal life. Since the \"hippie generation\" they started coming back with problems. The men coming back from Afghanistan, GOD bless them, are having a real hard time mentally. I was in Rhodesia in 1981 and saw some real horrible things but my upbringing helped me to cope with the horrors I witnessed. I was paddled at least once a month from 2nd grade to 6th. That is the way they dealt with ADHD back them. I eventually got tired of being paddled and learned to calm down and do my work. I grew up fine. I raised 4 daughters and used room confinement, standing in the corner and paddling and they all turned out perfect.",

            "conclusion": "Corporal punishment on children by thier parents.",
            "premise": "Reason 2 Physical Effects Saint Augustine, a famous Catholic saint once said, \"The greatest evil is physical pain.\" This evil known as physical pain is commonly an effect of corporal punishment, and it is another reason why corporal punishment is wrong. There are numerous effects of the pain Corporal Punishment causes on kids. Studies have shown that kids who are victims of physical pain often feel less energetic. This impacts their school, activities, etc. Physical pain can cause kids to become too tired to do their work in/out of school which can tamper with grades, social performance, etc. The pain also causes kids to often become mentally impacted (see argument one). Pain had also shown to impact sleep. In numerous cases, kids have pain while sleeping physically which reduced the kid's sleep, impacting their devolopment. The studies have also shown that this physical pain also affects their relationships with their parents. After being inflicted with pain, kids often do not trust their parents as much because their minds are developing, and they're not capable of realizing their parents' intent (see reaction 2). This can cause kids to isolate themselves (coorelates with mental pain), or view their parents in a wrong way.Reaction To Pro\"This is pointed out well in the JRank article Con cited. The article is Causes of Crime. Under the heading \"Parental Relations,\" abuse is discussed, but nowhere is corporal punishment mentioned.\" The reason that I used this article is because Corporal Punishment is abuse. The dictionary (check my sources) says that abuse means to treat in a harmful way, and as you saw by my second argument, Corporal Punishment is exactly that. Harm is caused by Corporal Punishment no matter how harsh, mentally, or physically as you saw in my arguments. \"And even if corporal punishment is harmful and abusive, it has been commonly used for hundreds of years in many cultures by parents who are intending the best for their children.\" Evem if these things are intended for the \"best\", they can still affect the child. Studies have shown that kids while growing up take in things from their surroundings, and it commonly determines who they become. They also have things called Sensitive Periods, occassional times while the kid is growing up in which that the child is vulnerable to being impacted mentally. The growing mind does not always realize if these punishments are meant for good, and commonly are impacted by it. They also during puberty commonly have mood swings which can potentially make them become more vulnerable to being affected by Corporal Punishment. \"Corporal punishent may be appropriate, but like everything, knowing when and how to use it is important to making it appropriate.\" Even if a parents uses the appropriate measures for corporal punishment, the child (as stated) can potentially be affected due to his/her mind devoloping.\"The Consequences of Pain article doesn't even touch corporal punishment, only chronic physical pain. If CHRONIC pain results from a spanking, your doing it wrong, and it is abuse or a very bad accident.\" Pro took this too literally. Chronic pain is a long-lasting feeling of discomfort. Yes, physically the pain does not last forever, but mentally, and socially it does. Depression, and emotional pain are some examples of chornic pain. Although the pain from corporal punishment does not last long, the effects of it can. This is exactly why I have been talking about the effects of this. \"And Disciplining Your Child doesn't really cite reasons for advising against physical discipline.\"I know that. I cited that because I used that to show the other methods of discipline that could be used besides corporal punishment. I mentioned other methods of punishment that could impact the kids less in argument one so I cited it. It was meant to show that there are other methods besided physical punishment. I am happy that Pro looked at what I used, but I think he took them the wrong way.\"The appropriate corporal punishment is not meant to harm, but to discipline. That is the big difference.\"Yes it is intended that way, but as stated, the children often take it the wrong way and later get the effects I have been stating. \"Another misunderstanding I'd like to point out from the Dave Ramsey quotes: There is no mention of financial discipline (or other types) being used as a total replacement for corporal discipline. Just because he is using one type, does not mean he isn't using others. And just because a parent uses corporal punishment, doesn't mean they ONLY use corporal punishment.\" To start, this quote does show financial discipline. It is an example of kids losing their allowance if they did not do what they were supposed to do which is a harmless, effective, and proactive way of punishing a child that does not impact the kid, and still teaches a less. Secondly, why does it matter if it did not mention it replacing corporal punishment? I already gave statements on why it should replace Corporal Punishment. There are numerous things that could replace corporal punishment, and that could have the same positive effects, and none of the negative effects so there is no reason why corporal punishment should not be replaced.Sources(\"St.Augustine of Hippo\", Catholic Online)(\"Definition of Chronic Pain\", MedicineNet, 9/20/12)(Donohue Shortridge, Peter, \"The Absorbant Mind and the Sensitive Periods\", ShortridgeFoundation)(\"Abuse\", DictionaryOnline)Conclusion After numerous rounds of debate, we both have not came to a conclusion here, but we have proven both sides. It is up to the individual themselves to decide what is right, and what is wrong in this. Pro, it was fun debating with you. Corporal Punishment is wrong because of it's effects on both the child, and others. http://www.youtube.com...http://www.youtube.com...http://www.youtube.com...",

            "premise": "NOTE: You didn't say USA only so I shall use statistics and facts from aroudn the globe (mainly UK).Now onto the main debate. In a survey completed by the Times Educational supplement [1], 6000 teachers were questioned. One in five believed that class room behaviour had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment and they believed the education system would improve with the re-introduction of corporal punishment. We should adhere to the teachers requests.It is inevitable that bad classroom behaviour will filter into life outside school. You only have to look at the crime statistics to see that crime has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment. Between 1981, when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997, after the abolition of corporal punishment, there was a 67% increase in crime [2]. Children\u2019s behaviour has been adversely affected by the rights culture we have in Britain. A teacher cannot threaten a detention, something they are allowed to do, without the retort of \u201cbut you can't take away my freedom\u201d, \u201cyou have no right\u201d or \u201cI have rights\u201d. In fact children are acutely aware of how much power they have over the teachers by way of laws and rights, and they use every opportunity to remind the teachers of that fact. If we re-introduced corporal punishment this back chat would cease and the power would be retained by the teachers. Detention is not going to be taken seriously by anyone. What does detention do other than waste your time? If you have ADHD or a creative mind you'll have a blast, effectively learning nothing to *correct* your behavior. If this is the only effective authority a teacher has for an out of control student then that teacher is and probably knows his/her authority is rather pitiful.

There is no evidence of this in schools when corporal punishment is applied nor in average families, instead this practice is held due to its quick and effective nature. \"Aldo the other oart may go into depression because when they get hit or spanked they feel worse than when you talk to them and explain them what they did wrong and why it is wrong.\" Same objection as above. \" Well you can discipline your students without using corporal punishment, for example, in school today they don't use corporal punishment and kids turn out okay.\" As I have pointed out, under the spoiled section theres a link where we read that society is becoming more and more violent. Extra Arguments: 1.\" Even in school when beating is uses the kids lose respect for the adult who is inducing the beating, also they lose self-respect and they start act mischievously\" Both statements are unheard of when corporal punishment is moderated. 2. \"They learn that it is not wrong to use force in human interactions.\" Elaborate. 3. \"Kids also make many visits to the hospital for nerve damage or even broken bones.\" I proposed controlled corporal punishment and not battering.",

Spanking children distracts the child from the real goal; when you spank the children will than focus on the punishment and will not focus on the reason their bad behavior was bad; this means they will continue with that behavior because they don't consider it bad behavior. Corporal punishment also makes children view aggressive and violent behavior as acceptable increasing their chances of being violent. A scientific study has found that children who grow up in schools that use corporal punishment performed worse on tasks then those growing up In schools that did not use corporal punishment. Corporal punishment results in children not internalizing rules and standards meaning that the only reason they don't do bad things is fear of corporal punishment; children who do not get spanked are more likely to believe in rules and laws meaning they don't do bad things because they view bad things as bad. http://scienceblog.com... Another study found that spanking kids leads to more long-term behavior problems. Meaning spanking does not work but in fact increases bad behavior. http://www.cnn.com... Another study found the same results as the first two. http://www.time.com...",

            "premise": "Good luck, Lordknukle.*******Why shouldn't it be legal?Trust IssuesCorporal punishment in school facilities involves the hitting/beating of a student if they have disobeyed class room or school rules. If corporal punishment were to be implemented as a form of disciplinary action, there is no doubt that students would cease to disobey rules. However, this method can and will severely damage a student's trust with their teachers. As a result of this, the student loses that connection with their teacher to the point where they can't go to them a source of comfort. For example: James, 13 years old, has continuously interrupted the teacher with his distracting behavior. As punishment the teacher hits James in the face and is sent back to his seat. Because this damages their teacher-student relationship, the student will most likely avoid using that teacher as a source of comfort for other issues he may be having (bullying, grades, etc).Family/peer issuesI believe that is either extremely disobedient in class or has bad grades has either or both of these: Abuse/neglect at home Bullying inside and outside of school At home: Lets refer to the year 2006. This year, 61% (or 1.25M) children were victims of some form of neglect. These include not only physical, but mental, educational, emotional, and even sexual (http://pediatrics.about.com...). Neglect and abuse at home has a tremendous effect on a child, and to prove this, please take the time to read some of these stories: http://www.forthechild.org... For more statistics: http://www.childhelp.org... These children (mostly young) were all subject to some form of abuse. I'd like to point out one girl's story: Judy: This young girl (age 10) was moved to 20 different foster homes. Her crazed step father had sexually and physically abused her for many years. As a result she threatened to commit suicide in a school bathroom (no relativity). Take Judy's story and add the factor of corporal punishment in school. This would only add to here extremely bad situation and would have most likely ended up worse than it did.Bullying: http://www.makebeatsnotbeatdowns.org.... This link provides statistics on bullying. Feel free to scroll through. There is no doubt that students in fear of any form of bullying would not want to be beaten by their teacher for disobedience because: 1. Teachers and school faculty are the \"bully police\", so to speak. If they are physically punishing their students, the victims of bullying are less likely to go to those people for assistance. 2. Along with bullying, corporal punishment can cause the student to suffer from a depressive state of mind, resulting in possibly lack of loyalty and decline in curricular performance. Lesson learned...?What does corporal punishment in schools (and everywhere for that matter) accomplish? As I've said before, it is used to gain the expected behavior of the target. However, if this does work, another problem unveils itself. Not only does this inflict harm on the student, but it also teaches the student that you need to use physical violence to resolve disputes with peers, family, etc. This especially would become a problem when they are put in a position of authority.ResolutionOther methods (detention, suspension, etc.) can be far more effective, and for that matter, safer. Things like detention and suspension will not teach the student to resolve issues violently and will most likely not provoke depression (if not already being experienced from other matters). For detention especially, the teacher can assign tasks such as cleaning the desks, extra class work/homework, all the things that a student without detention would not want to do. As a result, the disobedient student would cease to break faculty rules.********Looking forward to your argument.Sources listed: http://www.forthechild.org... http://www.childhelp.org... http://pediatrics.about.com... http://www.makebeatsnotbeatdowns.org...",

            "conclusion": "Schools Should Have The Option To Use Corporal Punishment",
            "premise": "I'd like to thank the people voting and rockylightning for making this debate possible. First i'd like to start out with a definition. \"Corporal punishment is the deliberate infliction of pain as retribution for an offence, or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer, or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable. The term usually refers to methodically striking the offender with an implement, whether in judicial, domestic, or educational settings.\" Next ill post a practical example. Lets say a teacher is teaching a class. A student in the class talks out of turn. He is given a WARNING, and then he does it again and is given another WARNING, now, he talks out of turn again, he is called up to the front (or after school, at the teachers discretion) and the teacher would use a ruler to hit the students palms. There, end of story! This is the only way to speak to children these days because if they were punished orally or given detention the student would be more likely to repeat that mistake again. Now, i will bring some evidence to support my arguments. An editor from childdisciplinewithlove.com states \"[Corporal Punishment] That's the only language children understand, and they understand it instantaneously.That's how you can prevent children from spoiling. I'm good and successful today because my parents hit me when I did something wrong. That's why I'm doing well in life. I suffered no harm from my parents having beaten me. It has deterrent effect as well. If you beat one child in front of other children, not only that child learns to behave, others also learn a lesson to behave. Children try and test your limits. Show them some physical punishment so that they know it very clearly that each mistake of theirs will attract some physical punishment. \u2022It is only fear which restrains children from misbehaving. Show the something to be afraid of and they will behave. Corporal punishment has instantaneous effect. Children obey and behave absolutely right when punished. Pampering and talking to them lovingly spoils them. There is no point in talking to them regarding solving any of their behavior problem because they are young and have no understanding of the worldly wisdom. So it's better not to waste time on taching them through talking. Just show them the fear of doing something wrong and they will do everything right. History of corporal punishment suggests that it has taught children to behave over last so many ages.\" If you look at his last points it states that not only the child being faced with the punishment will learn but other children in the classroom will learn. Thank You.",

            "conclusion": "The Reintroduction of Corporal Punishment Into Schools",
            "premise": "Hello to everyone reading. In this debate, I will be arguing that it is inappropriate and irrational to introduce corporal punishment into the entirety of the education system. I claim that corporal punishment is ineffective (and in most cases, harmful), leaves indelible psychological stains, and undermines the respect and benevolence within a teacher-pupil relationship. With the following contentions, I will elaborate on these claims.ArgumentsC1: Prohibiting Corporal Punishment Reduces AbuseWe can see in countries across the world that have prohibited corporal punishment in schools that this ban has reduced rates of abuse in the home. Since Sweden banned the use of corporal punishment in education institutions in 1979, the rates of support of this practice among parents have dropped form 50% to 11%, and in correlation with these rates, domestic abuse rates have fallen. By this example, we can conclude that when corporal punishment is banned in school, it reduces domestic abuse rates in the home, and is therefore productive and beneficial.C2: Corporal Punishment Has Long-Lasting Psychological EffectsBeing punished physically, even in a controlled, academic environment, is a shock to the system. This shock is amplified in young children. It has been concluded in numerous studies that corporal punishment increases the risk of dangerous and threatening behavior developing in the punished child. Corporal punishment has been linked to addiction and various other serious mental disorders.A study affiliated with the American Academy of Pediatrics found the following:\"Harsh physical punishment was associated with increased odds of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug abuse/dependence, and several personality disorders after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and family history of dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio: 1.36\u20132.46).\"This psychological harm can cause a growing resentment to authority, making it more challenging for the teacher to effectively impart knowledge to the students. Evidently, corporal punishment is ineffective in the short-term and long-term, and outweighs any of the (apparently) few benefits. As psychologist Elizabeth Gershoff writes:\"Until researchers, clinicians, and parents can definitively demonstrate the presence of positive effects of corporal punishment, including effectiveness in halting future misbehavior, not just the absence of negative effects, we as psychologists can not responsibly recommend its use.\"C3: Corporal Punishment Undermines the Student-Teacher RelationshipStudents learn when they feel supported and comfortable in the teaching environment. Especially when the teacher utilizes corporal punishment, the students' trust in the teacher is severely damaged. As Edward Clark explains in his work \"Creating a Context for Teaching and Learning\", students do their best work when they are given positive reinforcement for successes rather than negative reinforcement for mistakes.Furthermore, when teachers attempt to impart lessons of acceptance and tolerance, students will not take these lessons to heart. Students will begin to associate teachers with the same type of violence they suffer at the hands of bullies and others which abuse them. This association, along with the natural resentment to authority explained in C2, effectively undermines the student's relationship to a teacher.C4: Corporal Punishment Can Be Used As A Tool for Non-EngagementCorporal punishment often draws away from the true nature of the problem, and instead focuses on the pure deterrence aspect. According to a principal of a school which uses capital punishment, many of the most commonly punished students are from struggling households where corporal punishment is more often administered. Physically punishing perhaps the most vulnerable students is not effective at teaching the underlying problem with their actions, often, it just escalates the problem itself.In states which allow corporal punishment as a means for teachers, 36% of these are above the national mean of state composite test scores, while 89% of the states that have banned this practice in schools are above the mean. This disparity has often been attributed to a lack of engagement to the student body by teachers, who use corporal punishment instead of engaging to find the root of the problem.-------------------------Overall, it has been proven and supported that banning corporal punishment reduces abuse in the home, and instituting this form of punishment in schools has negative psychological effects, undermines the relationship between students and teachers, and can be used as an excuse or cop-out for teachers instead of engaging with misbehaving students.It is resolved that the reintroduction of corporal punishment into schools would be inappropriate and irrational, for the above-mentioned reasons.-------------------------Sources(1) http://www.nospank.net...(2) http://pediatrics.aappublications.org...(3) http://www.apa.org...(4) http://ojs.great-ideas.org...(5) http://www.newsweek.com...(6) http://www.gundersenhealth.org...",

            "premise": "First Of I would like to state a major flaw in my opponent(s) arguments, THEY ARE PLAGIARIZED. 75% of his points can be found here: http://www.naturalchild.org... This is poor sportsmanship but I would still like to continue. Repeatedly, my opponent has dressed his arguments by using slashes and back slashes. That is not the point of the matter right now but it just goes to show how he wants to \"cover up\" his \"MISTAKE\" Now on to some refutes, my opponent has repeatedly stated that I have no evidence, if he had read my argument closely you would be able to see that I am quoting actual PEOPLE! He also made a ridiculous refute by comparing this to the age of Hitler? Look, Hitler was different, he was a crazy radical that trained kids to kill the Jews, but this doesn't count as corporal punishment, ITS REFERRED TO AS WAR! Now my opponent states: \"It has been prove, even in government, that it is wrong to rule with an iron fist. You should rule with reasoning, such as \"If you disrupt the class again you will be given after school detention on the minimum day\" Or \"You will have extra homework\" definitely not saying \"if you don't shut your trap you're gonna get a beatin'!\" Because after a while, kids get immune to the pain.\" Like I have stated before, if kids are given a punishment that they will probably forget within the week it is most likely they will repeat that mistake. Next, he also states \"Kids become immune to pain\" that is a completely blind statement, and is obviously very opinionated. Lastly, I would like to have my opponent clarify the following: \\\\\\I'm good and successful today because my parents hit me when I did something wrong. That's why I'm doing well in life. I suffered no harm from my parents having beaten me./// Refute: Good and successful is from a point of view, and you have no clear evidence that because your parents hit you it is why you are successful. You may have not suffered any harm but you don't know about other kids who have different minds, a personal experience in this case is irrelevant. Finally, this debate is about schools, not your family. I would like to state, YET AGAIN, this is an editor from childdisciplinewithlove.org who is using his experiences IN SCHOOL to show how he became a better person. This is clear evidence supporting my arguments. For my closing statement I will go back to my opponents introduction. I have not yet once stated paddling as a form of corporal punishment, OR a male teacher hitting a girl. Since the motion has the word, CHOOSE, they are at full discretion to modify and change their policies. A child will learn, that they will not face pain if they are good, therefore making them better people late on in life. I have some statistics to prove this statement: One Kentucky study noted, \"Out-of-school suspension and expulsion interrupt students' educational progress and remove students from school at a time when they may most need stability and guidance in their lives. Repeated out-of-school suspensions may make it impossible for students to keep up with the curriculum, complete class assignments, and advance from one grade to another.\" David Richart et al., \"Unintended Consequences: The Impact of 'Zero Tolerance' and Other Exclusionary Policies on Kentucky Students\", report prepared by the National Institute on Children, Youth & Families at Spalding University in Louisville, KY; the Children's Law Center in Covington, KY; and the Youth Law Center in Washington, D.C.

            "premise": "Definition: No problems there. \\\\\\Next ill post a practical example. Lets say a teacher is teaching a class. A student in the class talks out of turn. He is given a WARNING, and then he does it again and is given another WARNING, now, he talks out of turn again, he is called up to the front (or after school, at the teachers discretion) and the teacher would use a ruler to hit the students palms. There, end of story! This is the only way to speak to children these days because if they were punished orally or given detention the student would be more likely to repeat that mistake again./// You have not stated any evidence that this is the only way to speak to children. Because you have no evidence I will provide it. Wife beating is no longer acceptable, but in 23 states it is legal for school teachers and officials to spank and paddle kids, a form of corporal punishment. \"When a girl is spanked by her father or paddled by a male school teacher, she is being trained to submit,\" says Jordan Riak, a retired school teacher and the executive director of Parents and Teachers Against Violence in Education, a California-based nonprofit group dedicated to getting corporal punishment banned in U.S. schools. \"When a school district permits teachers to paddle girls, it is setting those girls up to be victims of future male authority figures, whether it be a boyfriend, husband or employer,\" Riak claims. \\\\\\That's the only language children understand, and they understand it instantaneously.That's how you can prevent children from spoiling./// There is the assertion, now where is the reasoning and evidence? \\\\\\I'm good and successful today because my parents hit me when I did something wrong. That's why I'm doing well in life. I suffered no harm from my parents having beaten me./// Good and successful is from a point of view, and you have no clear evidence that because your parents hit you it is why you are successful. You may have not suffered any harm but you dont know about other kids who have different minds, a personal experience in this case is irrelevant. Finally, this debate is about schools, not your family. \\\\\\It is only fear which restrains children from misbehaving. Show the something to be afraid of and they will behave. Corporal punishment has instantaneous effect. Children obey and behave absolutely right when punished./// It has been proven, even in government, that it is wrong to rule with an iron fist. You should rule with reasoning, such as \"If you disrupt the class again you will be given after school detention on the minimum day\" Or \"You will have extra homework\" definitely not saying \"if you don't shut your trap you're gonna get a beatin'!\" Because after a while, kids get immune to the pain. \\\\\\Pampering and talking to them lovingly spoils them./// You don't pamper and spoil them if they did something wrong! \\\\\\History of corporal punishment suggests that it has taught children to behave over last so many ages/// I agree! Golden eras such as the Nazi rule of Germany, where the kids in the Hitler youth were shot with automatic rifles if they deserted, that kept them faithful to Hitler! But seriously it has not helped... ==Points== I. Morally wrong Now, in 2010, physical punishment is considered too severe for serial killers, murderers, criminals of all kinds and ages, including juvenile delinquents, too demeaning for soldiers, sailors, servants and spouses. But it remains legal and acceptable for children who are innocent of any crime! There are laws preventing child abuse, therefore my opponent's case is not only immoral, but illegal too. There are no reliable statistics on the extent of crime a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago. From all reports, however, crime in the U.S. was extensive, especially violent crime and crimes among the young. The good citizens of 19th century America were also alarmed. They looked back to the good old days of simple rural life, before the growth of the cities. The crowded and crime-ridden Eastern cities were contrasted unfavorably with the \"wide open spaces\" of the West -- the West, that is, of Jesse James and Billy the Kid! Discipline in the one room schoolhouses was violent. Often the teacher engaged in a bare knuckle fight with the biggest student as a warning to the others of what would happen to them if they provoked his wrath. Horace Mann, the Father of American education, fulminated against the number of floggings per day, sometimes more than the number of scholars. Most of our great grandparents were satisfied with a fourth grade education and eighth grade was the end for all but five percent. The lawless mountain men of the Old West were recruited from the 14-year olds who high tailed it after one thrashing too many. Bands of outlaws stole horses, and plagued the defenseless. Public hangings and Iynchings were commonplace while pickpockets worked the crowds. Only the militia and the sheriff's posse maintained any semblance of order. I do not call this productive. II. Evidence Against Adrenalin output increases sharply during fear, anger and physical punishment. When this is prolonged or often repeated, the endocrine balance fails to return to baseline. The victim becomes easily angered and prone to poor impulse control and spontaneous violent outbursts. Car crashes caused by drunk driving are increased by a hidden factor. Bottled up anger, when combined with alcohol is the largest cause of the highway death toll which comes to 25,000 deaths every year, or one every 20 minutes. An investigation by Donald C. Pelz of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan in 1973 led to his finding that: \"For the young male, anger toward the adult world is likely to find vent in dangerous driving ... Hostility tends to multiply with their attitude toward the educational system ... Those who had rejected the school system ... are likely to reject the highway system. \" In fact he concluded that abiding anger was even more dangerous than drinking per se, but that the combination was the most deadly. The insult to high school boys of an embarrassing paddling raises the adrenaline level, which if repeated often enough stays high all the time. They are the timebombs whose battlefield casualties litter the roads and intersections of our country. A survey of 3,900 people in Houston as to what effect school corporal punishment had on their lives found that 76 percent of them said the effects had been negative and that they continued to resent what happened to them. That leaves about a fourth of them who were able to shrug it off and a mere handful who felt grateful for the timely punishment that \"saved me from a life of crime.\" Thus, the one who testifies that \"I was paddled when I was a kid and I turned out okay,\" must be labelled a survivor and congratulated on the strength of character that enabled him to make a life in spite of early mistreatment.",

This is poor sportsmanship but I would still like to continue./// They aren't plagiarized unless I do not state my source and I am going to state all my sources at the end of my rebuttal. I do not know if my opponent knows the definition of plagiarism but this is not what it is. \\\\\\Repeatedly, my opponent has dressed his arguments by using slashes and back slashes. That is not the point of the matter right now but it just goes to show how he wants to \"cover up\" his \"MISTAKE\"/// My god, you really are new... Those are pointing out what you said, and it helps organize my refutations, they stand out more than quotation marks, many debater on this site use them. \\\\\\Look, Hitler was different, he was a crazy radical that trained kids to kill the Jews, but this doesn't count as corporal punishment, ITS REFERRED TO AS WAR!/// You obviously did not read my argument carefully, I was using the Hitler Youth as an example, which there in the Hitler youth was, for a crime you were punished with bullets in your face. Crimes would include desertion, insubordination (back talk) and pretty much anything you can be given detention in school. \\\\\\Like I have stated before, if kids are given a punishment that they will probably forget within the week it is most likely they will repeat that mistake./// If you have been beaten in your life by a parent you do not forget. It is a fearful memory that is full of pain, I am sure you would not forget this very quickly. \\\\\\Next, he also states \"Kids become immune to pain\" that is a completely blind statement, and is obviously very opinionated./// Funny coming from someone who brought up personal experience as a point. This is not blind, if you are beaten repeatedly over the course of your childhood, you learn to take the punishment, as many kids have with other things. \\\\\\I would like to state, YET AGAIN, this is an editor from childdisciplinewithlove.org who is using his experiences IN SCHOOL to show how he became a better person./// Ironic, an opinionated argument coming from the accuser of opinionated arguments. Personal experiences should not be used as evidence. Statistics should be used as evidence. \\\\\\Out-of-school suspension and expulsion interrupt students' educational progress and remove students from school at a time when they may most need stability and guidance in their lives. Repeated out-of-school suspensions may make it impossible for students to keep up with the curriculum, complete class assignments, and advance from one grade to another./// Keyword \"MAY\" this MAY make it impossible to keep up with assignments? These are not statistics, this is an assertion, clearly my opponent cannot even follow the basic A.R.E. format and cannot identify statistics. I have refuted all of your assertions, now where is your reasoning and evidence? \\\\\\Thank You, I am carman16 on the motion that schools should have the option to use corporal punishment./// yes you are The motion is negated.

Here in the South most of the schools have forms stating the guidelines of corporal punishment. Speaking of detention, there are numerous ways you can make it effective. I'm in college now, but when I was in school, detention was copying the handbook. Most students were never back in that detention room. Most students who were paddled, however, were in there lots of times because once again I will say this, corporal punishment is ineffective. Once again, thank you for debating me.",

            "premise": "I was really hoping for a more intelligent opponent. In the first round you cut and paste a paragraph that included sexual abuse and spanking OFTEN. We are debating corporal punishment. Then you cut and paste corporal punishment to reduce anti social behavior. That is not what a school would spank for. Then you assume that I would rather spank than warn. I always talked to my children and let them know why they were being spanked just like my school did when I was little. Then you talk of parents losing temper and smacking kids on the streets, again this is about school corporal punishment. Being spanked does NOT show children they can hit others as stated below. I showed with historical fact that school shootings have increased over the last 40 years. Many schools were stopping spanking before the states changed the laws. Then you tried to make a false claim that crime is high in the 19 spanking states and low in the 31 non spanking. I showed the facts of low income inner city crime. Then you get stupid with human sacrifice, slavery, astrology, murder and assault. They believed it worked, people would rather slave than die, astrology holds truth, murder and assault are by weak minded people. Read this Some \"experts\" claim that spanking has no instructional value, teaches children aggression, is abusive, or harms children's emotional and psychological well-being . However, these are myths. Myth: Spanking has no instructional value. Reality: Some claim that spanking does not teach children how to behave. This is false. Suppose you spank your child for running into the street. Spanking is a punishment, and punishments stop behaviors. By spanking your child, you stop him from running into the street. So you have taught your child how to behave: you have taught him not to run into the street. But what if you spank your child for talking back. The critics would say, you teach your child not to talk back, but you have not taught her how she is supposed to talk to you. But you teach her how she is supposed to talk to you when you scold her before the spanking. Before spanking, you make sure your child understands what she did wrong and how you expect her to behave in the future. In this way, spanking does have instructional value. The critics might then ask why not just tell your child how she is to talk to you and skip the spanking. Unfortunately, telling children what to do is not always enough. Children often do not change their behavior unless the behavior has negative consequences--and spanking is a powerful negative consequence. Myth: Spanking teaches children to be aggressive. Reality: Some argue that if parents spank their child, the child will learn that hitting is OK, so the child will go out and hit other children. But this is absurd. I've never heard a child justify hitting another child by saying that it's OK because mom and dad hit me. What spanking teaches is that parents may swat their child on the bottom when the child misbehaves. It does not teach a child hitting another child is OK. Nor does it teach that hitting for a reason other than punishment is OK. Most children will see this. A child who is old enough to be spanked understand there are differences between him and mom and dad. Mom and dad can drive a car but he can't. Mom and Dad go to work but he goes to school. So he understands that mom and dad can do things liking spanking that he can't do. Moreover, parents can explicitly tell the child that their spanking him is different form his hitting another child. Myth: Spanking is abusive. Reality: Spanking is not abusive. First, abusive parents often don't love their children. They abuse their children because they regret having them, the children remind them of someone else, and so on. But for most parents, spanking is done out of love and care for the child. Second, abusive parents lash out at their children in anger, not caring if they injure the child or not. But parents that spank do not want to injure their children. Spankings are given to correct the child's behavior. Yes, spankings hurt, but they are done so as to cause no lasting damage. That is why spankings are given on the bottom, for the posterior does not contain any vital organs. Do some parents spank too hard and cause welts and bruises? Yes, and they have gone too far. They have crossed the line between punishment and abuse. But this merely shows that some parents misuse spanking, not that spanking is abusive. Properly done, spanking causes no lasting physical damage. Myth: Studies prove that spanking harms children's emotional and psychological well-being. Reality: Some researchers have reported correlations between receiving corporal punishment and behavioral and emotional problems later in life. However, these studies have several flaws. First, most are correlational. Correlational studies can tell us only that two things are related, but such studies do not tell us how the two things are related. Suppose we see there is a correlation between spanking and delinquency. A correlation only means that spanking and delinquency are related--it does not tell us how they are related. Correlational studies can not tell us what we really want to know: what causes what. It might be that children are delinquent because they were spanked. But it might also be that they were spanked because they were delinquent? A correlational study can not tell us which of these two possibilities is true. Therefore, such studies do not prove that spanking causes delinquency, anti-social behavior, depression or anything else because correlation studies can not prove what causes what. Second, many of these studies looked at corporal punishment, not just at spanking. And some studies had a very \"inclusive\" definition of corporal punishment. They defined corporal punishment not only as hitting on the bottom but also slapping in the face, hitting on the head, boxing the ears, and shaking, among other things. Some of the forms of corporal punishment included in these studies could be considered abusive such as hitting on the head or boxing the ears. So even if we could conclude from these studies that corporal punishment causes emotional and behavior problems, and we can\"t because the studies are correlational, but if we could, would it mean that all forms of corporal punishment cause emotional and behavioral problems or only the more severe, abusive forms like hitting on the head or boxing the ears? Larzelere1 found that when abusive forms of punishment were excluded from the definition of corporal punishment, researchers were more likely to find a beneficial outcome to using corporal punishment rather than a negative outcome. So abuse, not spanking, harms children\"s emotional and psychological well-being. We know that many children are spanked and turn out fine; they are not aggressive, delinquent, depressed or anti-social. Why? Simons3 found that what leads to aggression, delinquency, and poor psychological well-being is low parental involvement such as parents not loving or trusting their children, not knowing where their children go or who they are with, and not being consistent in discipline. Being spanked did not lead to aggression, delinquency, and poor psychological well-being. Parents that love their children and are involved in their lives may use spanking, but they will never use spanking in a way that harms their children. 1Larzelere, R. E. (1996).

            "premise": "Since corporal punishment raises aggression levels in children (as established by my first round sources), and aggression is often met with aggression, it must raise aggression levels in some of the adults that care for the children. A society with raised aggression levels is more likely to have a President with raised aggression levels (especially when you consider that the President may be a parent). A President with raised aggression levels is more likely to press the red button. Therefore, a society with corporal punishment in schools is more likely to be obliterated by thermonuclear war.My opponent asks,\"If [corporal punishment] didn't work then why would it have continued?\"If human sacrifice didn't work, why was it continued for hundreds of years?If slavery doesn't work, why has it continued?If astrology doesn't work, why has it continued?If murder doesn't work, why has it continued?If assault doesn't work, why has it continued?My opponent not only has to establish a link between school shootings and a lack of corporal punishment, something he has thus far failed to do, but now he also has to do the same for gang rape.\"For a union (liberal) organization such as teachers and living in a liberal society such as England it is AMAZING that 20% of the teachers would say they think it should be brought back.\"Is my opponent aware that the UK had a right wing government from 1979-1997 (eighteen years!), and has one again now?[1] The UK is a conservative country, and England even more so. The right wing Conservative Party received 36% of the vote in the last election, and the Labour Party 29%. Scotland and Wales are heavily weighted to Labour, so the difference in the share of the vote in England would be even higher. Teachers' unions are not party affiliated, and teachers are from across the political spectrum. My opponent cannot dismiss the opinions of the majority because he imagines he might disagree with their politics, and accept the opinions of the minority because he has a gut feeling that their politics might suit him better.\"Being spanked has never been proven to cause violence when a person becomes an adult.\"Corporal punishment has been shown to increase the risk of the victim becoming a wife beater in later life.[2]It has also been shown to lead to a lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence and externalizing problems.[3] I also refer my opponent back to the first round sources. Spanking has been proven to cause violence in children, and that is sufficient to condemn it.If my opponent has an issue with the methodology of any of my sources, he is welcome to tackle them individually. I trust that the readers of this debate will not give much credit to a blanket dismissal of scientific studies.\"Yelling at a child causes more mental damage than spanking.\"Unwarranted assertion, but irrelevant, as I am not claiming that yelling is a useful alternative to corporal punishment.\"However, a parent who calmly spanks a child after explaining why the child is being spanked and does so only to create a foundation for other primary methods of discipline (such as Time Out) is never going to develop a pattern of violence in the child. Never\"Assertion without evidence. The scientific literature I presented in round one on spanking would suggest otherwise.\"The American Academy of Pediatrics admits that spanking can stop a child from misbehaving in the short-term.\"Using a blog as a source is a bad idea. Cowing a child in the short-term does not outweigh damage done in the long term. The American Academy of Pediatrics,\"urges parents, educators, school administrators, school board members, legislators, and others to seek the legal prohibition by all states of corporal punishment in schools and to encourage the use of alternative methods of managing student behavior.\"[4]My opponent is right that there are (many) other factors involved in crime. I think it will be difficult for him to show that lack of corporal punishment is responsible for an upsurge in school shootings, gang rape and assault.My opponent does not say why it is not okay to hit other adults, including prisoners, but it is okay to hit children.Corporal punishment has no place in a humane society. It is violence, it is psychologically damaging, and it is detrimental to society at large.

            "premise": "Here is a paragraph by paragraph response to your opening argument #1-- pertaining to the definition of corporal punishment: broadly defined corporal punishment includes torture and the death penalty. With that in mind opponents of corporal punishment of children and adolescents will define it as broadly as possible and in ways unfavorable to the use of corporal punishment. Most people understand when we talk about spanking a 16 year old girl we are not talking about torture and can distinguish the difference #2 To equate the corporal punishment of adults to that of children is simply an invalid analogy. Children are different then adults and can be treated differently. Yes it is true physical correction of adult women by their husbands is much less acceptable than it used to be but it is also true in the past adult women needed to get the husband's consent for a range of activities outside the home-- including but not limited to-- a driver's license, employment, a bank account. A minor still requires a parents consent for much of this. #3 Yes there are some risks involved in the administration of corporal punishment. But so are there risks in other disciplinary approaches some of which can be serious. Such risks can be minimized if strict rules as to the administration of corporal punishment are closely followed. These would include the strap or other implement be applied only to the child's or adolescent's buttocks, the implement not be such that when applied routinely will not cause any injuries besides some reddening of the skin and perhaps a few welts that will dissipate within a few hours There is also a risk that if used as the primary means of discipline corporal punishment will gradually become less effective and as a result the severity of it will need to increase. This is why corporal punishment should never be the preferred means of correcting children and teenagers #4 What is the definition of a serious injury? There is general acceptance when distinguishing between corporal punishment of a child and adolescent and the abuse of such that a serious injury means a fracture, an internal injury, or any injury to the head. When these happen it is usually the result of excessive force being used, an inappropriate implement being used or the child not being properly restrained when receiving correction. There are less serious injuries which opponents of corporal punishment will construe as serious but really aren't when what one is describing is an isolated incident or two.",

I would like to point out to the voters that this study may be misleading, as the point of corporal punishment is to enforce order in the classroom. This sense of order may include students not talking, or being \"anti-social\" as Con states. Con's second argument states that children with disabilities get punished more than other children. This, my friend, is against the law. This is considered assaulting a cripple, or simply put Assault and Battery, \"Two separate offenses against the person that when used in one expression may be defined as any unlawful and unpermitted touching of another. Assault is an act that creates an apprehension in another of an imminent, harmful, or offensive contact. The act consists of a threat of harm accompanied by an apparent, present ability to carry out the threat. Battery is a harmful or offensive touching of another.\" [1] Con's third argument is solid, and without flaw. Or one thinks when first reading it. For this argument, he states that students find the message that violence is the answer. This is almost comparing the case of violent video games increasing the chance of violent children. This has been debunked on more than one occasion, and whether or not you agree with the statement, in the analogy of video games, if a parent does not agree with the \"rating\" of the game, they remove the child from the situation. This can be done with schools as well. If a parent feels that their child is not going to develop well in a school, they remove their child from the situation. As for Con's arguments in 4 and 5, if the voters will note all sources listed, they have dates of more than a decade ago. These are not entirely reliable sources, as science has made and will continue to make new discoveries, therefore changing the statistics shown and stated by Con. Con fails to point out in six that again, this would be against the law. Bruises may occur, but for breaking a child's bones, this is classified as Assaulting a Minor and Child Abuse. The case of the child's death, is second degree murder. [2] Remember voters, the objective of corporal punishment is not to beat a child senseless, but to give spankings or paddlings for inappropriate behavior in the classroom. In argument 7, Con states that due to corporal punishment, it gives an acceptable means of aggression to solve problems in our society. This will simply be preparing students for the real world. Our society is filled will people who believe aggression solves problems. These people are called politicians, and often, these politicians make the decisions for our country, and will invade foreign countries. They do this in the belief that America can enforce what they want when they want on who they want due to their aggressive and gigantic military. Argument 9 is a bit humorous to the argument. The point of corporal punishment is not to tickle students and reward them for misbehavior. It is simply to show them the superiority and wrongdoing of their actions through a physical punishment, which will probably physically harm them, and embarrass the student, emotionally harming them. This is simply just the point of corporal punishment. But there is one simple solution to this problem. Students who don't misbehave don't get punished. The problem does not go back to the teachers, but to the students. Under Cons facts, Con states that schools are the only legal place that it is permitted to strike another. Con has obviously never watched a hockey game. Schools are one of many institutions where others can get hit, home is another one of these, again under the parents discretion. Con states in 11 that \"Many alternatives to corporal punishment have proven their worth. Alternatives teach children to be self-disciplined rather than cooperative only because of fear. (No source here, just kind of general knowledge).\" While Con's \"general knowledge\" might be correct from where Con lives, it certainly is not general knowledge across the country. He proves no information on detentions working. I'm sure many of the voters have seen \"The Breakfast Club.\" The Criminal, played by Judd Nelson, obviously has no problem with getting Saturday after Saturday detentions. But later in the movie, when the principle brings him into his office, and they get ready to duke it out, Judd stands down giving the man the respect he desires. I thank Con for the debate acceptance and look forward to next round. Again voters please keep in mind this may not directly reflect my personal opinions on the matter of Corporal Punishment. 1. http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com... 2. http://criminal.findlaw.com...",

            "premise": "Oh gosh. Alright. Let's get this over with. When I was in fifth grade, I was going through severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I was acting out of line because of things happening at home, and if corporal punishment was allowed do you think that would help me in any way? Here's the answer: NO. Children can learn their lesson without physical pain. It's not so much that the teachers can't enforce rules because the punishment is weak, no. Instead, it's because some teachers are pushovers. Will corporal punishments help them not be pushovers? Likely not. Could the power be easily abused? Absolutely. My mom and dad have their experiences that they've shared with me. They find today's methods to be better and effective. And what about people with autism or bipolar disorder? Some of them aren't put into special classes. If they're in normal classes (which is more common than one may think), do you think they should suffer physical pain because of a mental illness? What if they're shutting down and don't respond? Oh, well, for giving your best efforts to keep calm, rather than being asked what's going on, you get your wrist smacked with a ruler and a wooden oar smacked against your a$$. Doesn't that sound pleasant and completely utterly reasonable? It shouldn't. Many teachers at the schools I've been to are hesitant to give a student punishment no matter how badly they're acting up. I'm not sure that corporal punishment would make a big difference, as they would probably avoid that. Gosh, sitting outside in the hallway was enough for a kid to learn their lesson the first time; it's humiliating. Though I haven't been there many times, a few of my classmates have and they always feel embarrassed. Always. So imagine that I'm teaching a class and you and a friend are talking. Oh no, the horror. How will the class ever survive? Well, it won't. So obviously you need to learn your lesson. I take a ruler and smack your wrist with it ten times, then go back to teaching. Now, you have a bruise on your wrist when instead you could've simply been told to stop talking.",

            "premise": "Today striking a child over the head is classed as abusive because it can lead to detrimental physical, psychological and congestive impacts which can be lifelong. I should have presented this point more clearly This point wasn\u2019t supposed to sound as if I thought abuse was the same as corporal punishment. It was meant to read that definitions of \u2018corporal punishment\u2019 in the past contrast with our modern views of what acceptable methods of punishment were (e.g. hitting your wife for \u2018disobeying you\u2019. Okay in the eighteen hundreds, illegal today). The definition of corporal punishment is \u201c\u2026 a means of discipline that relies on fear and submissiveness.\u201d or more broadly as \u2018\u2026 a wide range of parenting practices intended to cause physical pain. These include such acts as pinching, shaking, slapping, punching and kicking children, and, with or without the use of objects like belts, cords and brushes, spanking, hitting and beating children\u2026\u2019 these definitions mention nothing about the perpetration\u2019s emotions at the time of the corporal punishment, or them having to \u2018back it with love\u2019. Your point goes against corporal punishment, not for it because some people use it while they are angry or frustrated at a child for the child\u2019s actions so feel they should be disciplined. This definition doesn\u2019t include anything saying that parents can\u2019t be angry when they physically discipline children. Child abuse isn\u2019t always deliberate or taken out of anger, passive emotion child abuse being a prominent example of this. I know this because I\u2019ve spoken with child councillors from a national child abuse charity in person (as part of a project on child abuse). In my experience, parents who do use corporal punishment do so out of anger, not love. Besides, loving someone doesn\u2019t stop it from being abuse; perpetrators of domestic abuse sometimes believe they love their victims so are a prime example of this. The link between corporal punishments in children and an improvement their long term behaviour has never been made. In fact, a recent study has shown the opposite. While all children can act out in public, my parents never used any form of corporal punishment on me, this hasn\u2019t made me a bad person. It also never made us act out in public. In my childhood, I knew children whose parents used corporal punishment on them but behaved worse than me in public. The negative impacts of corporal punishment overweight the potential benefits of corporal punishment in children. There have been many studies which show that the negative effects of corporal punishment on children which disagree with your views. Notably, children who experienced parental corporal punishment are more likely to have antisocial behaviour and anxiety/depression than other children. The results of these studies are robust. Additionally, they have showed that children who experienced corporal punishment, similarly to those expeienced by child abuse victims.This impacts were outlined by Gershoff (sources in comments).",

Kids start to feel bad and there is a point when some decide that they will not take that anymore and rebel or start to react negatively which prove that in long term cases it does not work effectively. Aldo the other oart may go into depression because when they get hit or spanked they feel worse than when you talk to them and explain them what they did wrong and why it is wrong. Pro also states that undisciplined kids may Become tyrants. Well you can discipline your students without using corporal punishment, for example, in school today they don't use corporal punishment and kids turn out okay. EXTRA ARGUMENTS: 1. Even in school when beating is uses the kids lose respect for the adult who is inducing the beating, also they lose self-respect and they start act mischievously. 2. They learn that it is not wrong to use force in human interactions. 3. Kids also make many visits to the hospital for nerve damage or even broken bones.",

Merry Christmas to all at DDO.Right...I'll start by summing up the scientific evidence.Studies of corporal punishment show that those who are so disciplined have significantly higher lifetime rates of anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse, and one or more externalising problems. Those who are spanked are significantly more likely to become wife beaters.Other studies show that children who are disciplined with corporal punishment are more aggressive.These effects remain when studies discount those who have been abusively hit.Research indicates that corporal punishment in schools can lead to students having a negative self-image, and can negatively affect school achievement. There is a correlation between the use of corporal punishment and increased truancy, drop-out rates, violence, and vandalism.In the short term, corporal punishment has been shown to be no more effective than other methods of discipline.Even if corporal punishment did not cause the above mentioned problems, then it would still be ineffective at preventing them. However, there is a body of evidence and theory which shows that corporal punishment is a stressor and can lead to a violent reaction. This establishes causation beyond mere correlation.My opponent failed to show that any of the things he claimed were linked were in fact linked.There is also the human rights issue which speaks against corporal punishment. My opponent has been unable to say why it is not okay to hit others, including prisoners, but it is okay to hit children. That is because it is not okay. Violence against children must stop.",

            "premise": "I like to thank my opponent for his arguments in round 2. I will make my rebuttals to Round 2 here in Round 3.1. Corporal Punishment sets clear boundaries and motivates children to behave in school.Con adds to this by stating if the child is aware that they will be given corporal punishment, they will be more aware and prevent further bad actions/behaviors. Punishing the child for these behaviors, though it may be tempting, is not the way to go since it gives the impression that having the emotions in the first place is a bad thing. Klein suggests that rather than scolding a child for acting out, \"Helping a child understand their negative emotion (anger, sadness) and in time learn to understand why they feel as they do will help them develop competence socially and emotionally. So, empathizing with a child, rather than scolding them, while setting a limit (i.e., \"I understand you are angry, but I can't let you hit.\") bears better outcomes later than scolding and punishing the young child.\" Rather than \"shutting down\" a child's emotions, help your child see that you understand his frustration and it's OK to feel that way -- but that there's a better way to express it. [1]Con continues adding by stating that corporal punishment is not told clearly enough to the child, resulting misbehaviors.While this is true in some cases, parents are more likely to scold and give them other punishments, other than corporal punishment. Groundings, lectures, limits, etc. are a few examples of parent's different options to punish their child, other than corporal punishment.2. Corporal punishment is quick.Con takes this the school punishment way, by stating that other forms of punishment such as detention or suspension in schools can hurt the student because they can miss school and waste time.Sure, maybe while they are serving their punishments... but have you forgotten that the students will be then given all of the homework AND lessons when they come back to school? Teachers are not required but are heavily recommended to evaluate what they have learned. They can even have times before or after school so that the child can be privately taught what they have missed and must know. Therefore, resulting in the child gaining back their miss knowledge during detentions or suspensions. Therefore, non-corporal punishments are not a waste of time and can teach their child a lesson. It would only be a waste of time if the school gives detentions or suspensions for absurd reasons, which seems to be increasing over the years.3. A study shows that kids who have corporal punishment misbehave less.While my own arguments in Round 2 refute this claim, I must add something that this argument has made me remembered. Corporal punishment is child abuse and can cause trauma. In some cases\u2014depending on the number of reports made, the severity of the abuse, and the available community resources\u2014children may be separated from their parents and grow up in group homes or foster care situations, where further abuse can happen either at the hands of other abused children who are simply perpetuating a familiar patterns or the foster parents themselves. In 2004, 517,000 children were living in foster homes, and in 2005, a fifth of reported child abuse victims was taken out of their homes after child maltreatment investigations. [2] Sometimes, children do go back to their parents after being taken away, but these statistics are slim. It's easy to imagine that foster care and group home situations, while they may ease the incidence of abuse in a child's life, can lead to further types of alienation and trauma. For children that have suffered from abuse, it can be complex getting to the root of childhood trauma in order to alleviate later symptoms as adults. The question is, how does child abuse turn into Post Traumatic Stress Disorder later in life? What are the circumstances that cause this to happen in some cases and not others? [3] Therefore, the reason those have corporal punishment misbehave less is that of damaged family relationships and trauma. 4. Young children learn the dangers if you give them the pain of those dangers.The child will only learn the true way of those dangers if they experience it. If the child almost dies, why in any way would you want to hurt your child because they legitimately almost died? If you love them that much, you should be more or so having a heart attack than actually hurting your own child so they understand the pain of those dangers. It's best to keep them fully safe than experience any pain at all. It may cause trauma as well, they can be incredibly scared of those situations and can be bad if adults can do it themselves, not children.5. As corporal punishment decreased in schools, misbehavior has not decreased.I will not be refuting this argument fully if you do not show the proof (or the FULL link to the source) of where you find the proof.Those are my rebuttals for Round 3. I take the floor to Con.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent very greatly for accepting my debate and engaging with me in this discussion. The rules that he established are acceptable enough, so I agree with them. Most of his definitions are fine for the debate as well, except my opposition to his definition of \"corporal punishment.\" I will also provide a definition of \"ought.\" Corporal Punishment: intentional infliction of physical pain as a method of changing behavior. Corporal punishment becomes abuse if it results in injury. (National Association of School Nurses)Ought: Used to indicate duty or correctness, especially when criticizing someone's actions; used to give or ask advice. Now, to my debate:Contention 1: Corporal punishment is not proper for child rearing. In order for a parent to fufill his/her full duty as a parent, the parent must provide the most effective use of discipline against a child's behavior in order to be of aid in both the short and long term. Although corporal punishment has been proven to be effective in the short term for at the very least most children, it is utterly useless in the long run and can even end up to be harmful for the child in question. The use of corporal punishment against a child, thus, is not the proper choice for parental rearing of a child and goes against a parent's duty and idealisms of correctness.Sub 1a. Corporal punishment is ineffective in the long-term. The primary intention of corporal punishment is to install discipline in the child and make him/her learn what is correct behavior. The main problem with corporal punishment is that it serves well to discipline children in the immediate short-term, but as a practice to discipline children, it is ineffective to achieving the means as to what the punishment itself was meant to be for. Scientific studies display this well. In E.T Gershoff's 2002 study on the effects of corporal punishment: \" She found that CP decreases internalization of moral rules. This is concerning in that parents are more likely to use corporal punishment when they believe the child is at fault for some misbehavior. Thus, using a method that decreases moral internalization to respond to a failure to adhere to internal rules the child should have known is likely to perpetuate the problem.\"Gershoff, E. T. Corporal Punishment by Parents and Associated Child Behaviors and Experiences: A Meta-Analytic and Theoretical Review. Psychological Bulletin, 128(4), 539-579In the same study as well as others, Gershoff reports to us that the use of corporal punishment encourages a child's use of aggression: \"She found that CP is associated with increased aggression. This is especially troublesome, she notes, in that parents are more likely to use aggression to stop aggression. However, one study showed that use of corporal punishment to halt aggression increased risk for aggressive behaviors by 50%, regardless of whether the parent or the teacher rated the child\u2019s behavior. Use of aggression after being physically punished for aggressive behavior is likely to be seen as an escalation of misbehavior, which was also associated with greater use of corporal punishment. Thus, corporal punishment is likely to perpetuate the problem\"http://ace.ucr.edu...http://www.coe.int...http://www.nospank.net...http://www.neverhitachild.org...http://www.cyc-net.org...Sub 1b: Corporal punishment can cause physical and psychological harm. In addition to the general ineffectiveness of corporal punishment, the use of it thereof can lead to psychological harm and can go leeways into abuse as a result. These mental afflictions as a result from corporal punishment can result in alcohol abuse, adult psychological distress, and other negative effects in the future. This is not including the effect on the child's use of aggression to assert means.http://www.questia.com...Also, the line between corporal punishment and abuse is very thin. Corporal punishment can end up resulting in injury as shown in several cases and studies, including the previous Gershoff 2002 study, where she reported the following: She found that CP is associated with increased adult abusive behavior. She reports studies have shown that 2/3s of abusive parent-child incidents begin as an effort to discipline the child and \u201cteach them a lesson.\u201d If this means that adult antisocial behavior is more likely after being spanked as a child, given that other research shows antisocial parents are at greater risk to abuse children, then this could mean that spanking one\u2019s child may increase the risk of abuse for one\u2019s grandchildren.\"http://www.nospank.net...Sub 1c: There are effective alternatives to corporal punishment.Not only are there so many disadvantages to the use of corporal punishment, but there are also alternatives to the use of corporal punishment that are more effective than corporal punishment. This is mainly shown by the success of European countries that had outlawed corporal punishment and had reducing numbers in the amount of child abuse cases as well as reductions in public opinion where people believed that the use of corporal punishment is required for any child for effective parenting: http://www.neverhitachild.org...Other experts report on the same thing:http://www.psychologytoday.com...http://www.unicefusa.org...Contention 2: Corporal punishment is a violation of human rights. The argument that corporal punishment is a violation of human rights (defined by both European organizations as well as the UN with their Universal Declaration of Human Rights) is starting to take root, and these leading groups have made the argument that corporal punishment is indeed a violation the human rights of the child:\"Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) have progressively condemned corporal punishment, first in penal systems and schools and more recently in the home. Other decisions have also made clear that banning all corporal punishment does not breach family privacy or religious rights. The Court increasingly applies the standards of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in judgments related to children.\"\" Once visible, it is clear that the practice [of corporal punishment] directly conflicts with the equal and inalienable rights of children to respect for their human dignity and physical integrity.The distinct nature of children, their initial dependent and developmental state, their unique human potential as well as their vulnerability, all demand the need for more, rather than less, legal and other protection from all forms of violence.\" -- United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child http://www.coe.int...https://wcd.coe.int...Because corporal punishment can result in injury, the subjection of it to a child is a violation of a child's human rights defined by the Universal Declaration",

After all, if your plan is enacted (baning the punisment of tardiness), there would be no concequence to miss almost all of the lecture.2) Teachers are not punished when they are tardy.Contradictory and irrelevant. You go on that they get payroll deductions if they are tardy. That completely contradicts this point. Also, it's irrelevant when talking about removing the punishment for students. That's like saying we should feed a hampster more becuase we feed the dog an entire bowl of food. They are completely different: one educates and one recieves education.

'you can act like this here, act like that there, here are the boundaries for this place, whereas the boundaries are different over there'. Example... I got away with a ton at grandmas, less at home and even less at school. I learned what the expectations were at each place. And when I went off course, it was corrected and learned. It often frustrated my parents I was more well behaved for strangers than I was for them. That was a good thing. My own kids are the same way. Corporal punishment is not about pain. Its about an immediate, memorable and usually public action (consequence) taken at the time of the infraction. For the child to endure and others to learn from. I guarantee you, getting whooped (even if it didn't hurt) is more embarrassing than sitting in the hallway playing on their I-Phone or being sent to detention with their friends. Do you really believe kids are contemplating (and learning from) their actions in the hall? The \"pain\" helps create a memory (as it did to me)... I don't remember the pain itself, but I remember the event, the circumstance and how it made me feel. Embarrassed, like a child, etc. You mentioned your parents like today's methods. What are they? Because all I see is an absence of consequences hence the disrespectful, unruly youth. Admittedly, you make valid points about potential abuse of power (but that can be applied to anything), concerns for mentally ill (I understand that also). But in these days mental illness is diagnosed pretty early on. (whether its autism, bipolar or ADHD or anything else). Teachers are made aware and those situations as they are in fact special cases. Although, I will say I do not believe 'special' children should be in the same class with the 'normal' kids. I don't like the disruption and I also don't like the varying expectations being applied, displayed and encouraged in front of the rest of the class. I feel you should not be able to press the system for your kid to be in a normal class.... then ask the same system for your kid to be treated outside the norm. (I am sure that is another debate) Regarding teachers being pushovers... this plays right into my problem with today's society. All this liberal, don't spank your kids stuff is corrupting our youth. If all these young teachers were not raised so soft themselves, it would not be so much an issue. Soft parents and teachers simply exacerbate the problem.",

            "premise": "I affirm: Corporal Punishment is a reasonably adequate and just punishment for certain crimes. [Definitions] For clarity I pose the following definitions. Corporal Punishment: caning or flogging. Reasonably: fair, proportionate Adequate: sufficient for the purpose Just: giving each their due [Observational Analysis] For analysis of the resolution, I pose the following observations. 1. The resolution asks for a \"reasonably adequate\" punishment. This is a punishment that is proportion to the crime that has been committed. Note: Proportionality is not equivalence. 2. Certain crimes. The affirmative offers the 3 following crimes that warrant Corporal Punishment while in Jail/Detainment. Crimes: Rape, Kidnapping, Attempted Terrorism. [Contentions] Contention I: Corporal Punishment is a reasonable punishment.(Proportionality) For the 3 crimes I have posted above; corporal punishment is a proportionate response. These 3 crimes do not deserve death but they are too great for jail only. Punishments must be fair and proportionate. Using corporal punishment open up an avenue for an intrum punishment. I.e. a punishment between staying in jail only, and receiving the death penalty. For a punishment to be reasonable it must be: \"fair, proportionate\". Corporal Punishment is indeed proportionate for crimes that do not warrant death or jail only. Corporal Punishment could be sued while the person is in jail for the given amount of years, or life. (Since we are talking about rape, kidnapping, and attempted terrorism). Contention II: Reducing Crime (Justice) According to the CIA country information site, the countries which have corporal punishment have significantly lower crime rates then the US. E.g. Japan and Singapore. If deterrence is indeed a factor being played, it is a good secondary outcome, that is just for the members of society. Contention III: 8th Amendment (Proportionality, Constitutionality) The 8th Amendment is based off of the ideas of Beccaria. He said the famous quote: \"The punishment must fit the crime.\" The 8th Amendment claims no cruel and unusual punishment. Beccaria explains that this means that the punishment cannot exceed that of the crime committed. If it does, then it is an unjust punishment, and thus violates the Constitution. for reasons in contention I, the punishment is proportionate, and is thus in coherence with the constitution. Contention IV: Faulty Jail System (Justice) The jail system in the US is faulty. We have overcrowded jails which lead to lessining of sentences. This is the reality of things. however the justice system must keep justice. Using corporal punishment can be used to achieve proportionality but have reduced sentences, if necessary. That way, we would have more room to fix the system, and return it back to normal. Therefore, corporal punishment is a just way for members of society by reducing taxes and making a more efficient justice system. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

            "conclusion": "Domestic Corporal Punishment is Always Immoral",
            "premise": "Thank you for starting this debate! The resolution reads that \"Domestic Corporal Punishment is Always Immoral\" First, we must realize that the word \"immoral\" is subjective, meaning that what is immoral to one person, may not be immoral to another person. Thus, the resolution is impossible to argue from Pro's side because \"Domestic Corporal Punishment\" is not limited to immoral. Why Corporal Punishment is necessary. 1. You want to be respected. \"To be feared (in the sense of reverence) is to be respected. Your children should be weary of going against your rules. It also teaches them to submit to authority regardless of whether or not they agree.\" 2. . Love. \"You have to love your child enough to be tough and do what is necessary to get the desired result. Parent first, friend second.\" 3. You want to teach them how to make good decisions. \"Our destinies are determined by decision-making. Children have the option to obey or face the consequences, and they need to know consequences hurt.\" 4. You want them to have self-control. \"When you are aware of what is on the other side of making a poor decision, it is easier to exercise restraint.\" 5. You want them to be accountable. \"Every decision has an outcome, good or bad. Just as your reward your child for the good, you must also acknowledge and address the bad.\" 6. You want to set standards. \"Children need limits to learn how to grow up with restraint. They will never be able to do whatever they want. Teach them to live by the rules set in place.\" 7. You see strength not weakness. \"Western parents seem to assume fragility rather than strength. Spanking your child properly is not going to damage their self-esteem. Accepting mediocrity and dismissing poor behavior teaches them to indulge in being weak.\" (http://r.search.yahoo.com...-) Spanking is not abusive: Some people want to argue that spanking is abusive, but abusive parents don't love their children. Most spanking is done in love, and care for the child. [1] Second, abusive parents lash out at their children in anger, not caring if they injure the child or not. But parents that spank do not want to injure their children. Spankings are given to correct the child's behavior. Yes, spankings hurt, but they are done so as to cause no lasting damage. That is why spankings are given on the bottom, for the posterior does not contain any vital organs. Do some parents spank too hard and cause welts and bruises? Yes, and they have gone too far. They have crossed the line between punishment and abuse. But this merely shows that some parents misuse spanking, not that spanking is abusive. Properly done, spanking causes no lasting physical damage\" Spanking does not have an effect on a child's mental health: Many people want to complain that corporate discipline has a negative impact on a child's health, when in fact, that isn't the case at all. [3] \"Some researchers have reported correlations between receiving corporal punishment and behavioral and emotional problems later in life. However, these studies have several flaws. First, most are correlational. Correlational studies can tell us only that two things are related, but such studies do not tell us how the two things are related. Suppose we see there is a correlation between spanking and delinquency. A correlation only means that spanking and delinquency are related--it does not tell us how they are related. Correlational studies can not tell us what we really want to know: what causes what. It might be that children are delinquent because they were spanked. But it might also be that they were spanked because they were delinquent? A correlational study can not tell us which of these two possibilities is true. Therefore, such studies do not prove that spanking causes delinquency, anti-social behavior, depression or anything else because correlation studies can not prove what causes what. \" \"Second, many of these studies looked at corporal punishment, not just at spanking. And some studies had a very \u201cinclusive\u201d definition of corporal punishment. They defined corporal punishment not only as hitting on the bottom but also slapping in the face, hitting on the head, boxing the ears, and shaking, among other things. Some of the forms of corporal punishment included in these studies could be considered abusive such as hitting on the head or boxing the ears. So even if we could conclude from these studies that corporal punishment causes emotional and behavior problems, and we can\u2019t because the studies are correlational, but if we could, would it mean that all forms of corporal punishment cause emotional and behavioral problems or only the more severe, abusive forms like hitting on the head or boxing the ears? Larzelere1 found that when abusive forms of punishment were excluded from the definition of corporal punishment, researchers were more likely to find a beneficial outcome to using corporal punishment rather than a negative outcome. So abuse, not spanking, harms children\u2019s emotional and psychological well-being.\" \"Also children in some of these studies were spanked several times per week.2 I suggest that the parents in these studies did not know how to use spanking nor did they know how to raise children. Any parent that needs to spank several times per week has poor parenting skills. So if children in these studies have problems is it because the parents spanked them or because the parents spanked too often or because the parents had poor parenting skills overall? These studies can't tell us.\" \"We know that many children are spanked and turn out fine; they are not aggressive, delinquent, depressed or anti-social. Why? Simons3 found that what leads to aggression, delinquency, and poor psychological well-being is low parental involvement such as parents not loving or trusting their children, not knowing where their children go or who they are with, and not being consistent in discipline. Being spanked did not lead to aggression, delinquency, and poor psychological well-being. Parents that love their children and are involved in their lives may use spanking, but they will never use spanking in a way that harms their children.\" Sources: [1] http://www.angelfire.com...

            "premise": "Apologies for the FF. Responses to Con:There seems to be a misunderstanding of the difference between appropriate corporal punishment and physical abuse demonstrated by some critics of corporal punishment. I'd liken it to confusing eating desert, and gluttony. Both are eating, and both can be gluttony, but eating desert is not always gluttonous. This is pointed out well in the JRank article Con cited. The article is Causes of Crime. Under the heading \"Parental Relations,\" abuse is discussed, but nowhere is corporal punishment mentioned. The assumption on Con's part is that they are one and the same. Abuse is meant to harm. And even if corporal punishment is harmful and abusive, it has been commonly used for hundreds of years in many cultures by parents who are intending the best for their children. The appropriate corporal punishment is not meant to harm, but to discipline. That is the big difference. It seems to be modern journalistic practice to splash a headline, lead in with evidence supporting that headline, then near the end of the article, (when many people have stopped reading?) temper the stated point with evidence to the contrary (So the author can say they included everything?) (Maybe. Topic for another discussion.) In the USA Today article, this is just the case. The first few lines strongly support the headline, but near the middle of the article, we see this:\"A 2005 scientific review he co-authored, of studies comparing spanking with non-physical discipline methods, identified an \"optimal type of physical discipline,\" referred to as conditional spanking, and said that when it was used as a backup to nonphysical discipline it was better at reducing noncompliance and antisocial behavior.While the new study rules out the most severe cases of physically lashing out at children, , \"it does nothing to move beyond correlations to figure out what is actually causing the mental health problems,\" says Larzelere. He criticized the study's reliance on memories of events from years earlier, and says it's not clear when punishment occurred. \"The motivation that the child perceives and when and how and why the parent uses (spanking) makes a big difference. All of that is more important than whether it was used or not.\"The end result may often be a misled reader.Another misunderstanding I'd like to point out from the Dave Ramsey quotes: There is no mention of financial discipline (or other types) being used as a total replacement for corporal discipline. Just because he is using one type, does not mean he isn't using others. And just because a parent uses corporal punishment, doesn't mean they ONLY use corporal punishment. I grew up being spanked, but that wasn't the only punishment. Sometimes my parents just let me live with the consequences of my actions, sometimes they denied me TV, sent me to bed early, or plainly let me know they were disappointed in me. Corporal punishent may be appropriate, but like everything, knowing when and how to use it is important to making it appropriate.The Consequences of Pain article doesn't even touch corporal punishment, only chronic physical pain. If CHRONIC pain results from a spanking, your doing it wrong, and it is abuse or a very bad accident. Spanking, etc., is supposed to be temporary to encourage the child to correct behavior, not spank them and expect them to do it again.And Disciplining Your Child doesn't really cite reasons for advising against physical discipline.When I talked about children not knowing what is good for them beyond instinct, I tried to be clear that physical discipline is only appropriate once the child can act on their own and understand reasons for discipline. Maybe I didn't do such a good job in R2 in that respect.My arguments:I guess I'm still going to have to clean up some misunderstandings here, too. Physical discipline needs to be administered in a proper way. As the USA Today article said, it needs to be alongside other forms of discipline, the parent should not be angry when administering it so the child does not think they are being assaulted out of anger, or that it is a fight with the parent, and so the parent doesn't go too far, and so the child knows it is usually wrong to act out of angery aggression. The child needs to understand what they are being punished for and why, (understand the actions are just and so the kid understands what right and wrong is) and that the parent cares for them and is disciplining them for their own good. (To preserve the relationship. Good advice for any type of discipline.)Corporal punishment is not a cure-all, and not to be used in anger just because the parent doesn't like the child. That wouldn't teach the kid anything, just to fight.Corporal punishment is a good tool for loving parents to use, when used appropriately.",

            "premise": "Corporal Punishment (Con)Introduction For hundreds of years, parents having been using numerous punishments on their children. In many case, these punishments are either cruel, or inhumane. One of the most common examples that many people think of when they think of cruel punishment in modern society is corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is still be used today in certain countries while in others it is not. Corporal punishment by society is bad because of its effect on both the child and the parents. Reason 1 Mentality Although many may regard corporal punishment on a child as a good thing for the kid, it turns out that there are more negative effects on the child rather than pro, and many of this cons that come with it involves mentality. In a mental sense, the child can be mentally impacted by people inflicting corporal punishment on their youth. First, children who are victims of corporal punishment become more violent. Violence between parents and their kids is the leading cause of violence in women, and young black men. Corporal punishment has also been proven to cause anti-socialness, and increases the chance of suicide in the child. When a child is victimized by violence from their family, they tend to take it as an example, and later are more likely to do it. The child also tends to mentally become dehumanized and/or depressed from it which is likely to increase the chances of social isolation, and suicide. A survey of about 3,900 people to see what corporal punishment can cause showed that 76% percent of the people who were experienced the corporal punishment had been negatively affected. Many who experience corporal punishment are likely also to experience mental disabilities in their later life. Does this not have a coorelation? Reaction To Pro \"Parents should use corporal punishment on their children because children start off life with almost no knowledge as to what is good for them.\" When Pro said this, he did not realize something. If kids do not know what is good for them, shouldn't they not be punished? If they do not know what is good for them, they will still experience the affects of corporal punishment in their later life. Kids would even be more vulnerable to experiencing negative effects if they have no knowledge of what is good for them. They could take it the wrong way. \"But once a child reaches an age when they can act on their own, they retain the drive to get what they want to be comfortable, but lack discernment between what appears to be beneficial, and what actually is. \" It is true that discipline is important for a child to know is beneficial, and what is not, but why use violence to get a child to get them to learn that? There are many forms of punishment that have no violence whatsoever that could still have the same effect. Parents, for example could use allowance. Allowance gives children money to spend, and later learn how to use it (solves what is beneficial, and what is not issue). Allowance is also a great thing for parents because they can take the allowance away from their children if they do something wrong. Dave Ramsey an author, writer, and radio host shows a perfect example in saying, \"My children were taught at an early age how money works and that it comes from hard work. They've been on a commission - not an allowance - since they were little. They learned that if they worked around the house, they got paid. If they didn't work, they didn't get paid.\" \"The same point gets across to the child, (doing that results in pain) but the physical harm is not permanent.\" This statement is highly false. Physical harm is permanent. Physical harm has the following effects. * Changings in the child's nuerotransmitters that assist in modulating pain, mood, and sleep.* The body's pain relieving abilities reduces drastically, making physical punishment worse, and worse each time. * Increasing sensitivity to pain due to tissue injuries.* Disruptions on every day activities. (Less Motivation)* Anxiety, and depression.* Stress. * Increases in anger, and agitation. Therefore, your statement that physical harm is permanent is false. Most if not all of these affects last permanent, or long periods of time. Not to the extent of dehumanization, but rather mental, and physical disruption. \"A slap on the bottom after stealing from another kid on the playground should instill psychological disincentive toward stealing now, rather than trying to retrain an adult who robs a house who never got the lesson.\" This directly coorelates with the affects of corporal punishment. Studies have shown that the most common cause of crime is psychological disruption. Corporal punishment causes psychological disruption, therefore when you say that it would reduce stealing, it is false. The kid would have a higher chance of stealing due to the mental effects of corporal punishment. Sources(Healy, Michelle, \"Study links physical punishment to later mental disorders,\"USATODAY.COM.

Research into possible links between corporal punishment and abuse has proved inconclusive so far. Some studies have suggested that abusive parents use corporal punishment more than nonabusive parents, but other studies have shown this not to be the case.(7) The findings of one study,8 conducted a year after corporal punishment by parents was abolished in Sweden, suggested that Swedish parents were as prone to serious abuse of their children as were parents in the United States, where corporal punishment was (and is) widespread. These findings are far from decisive, but they caution us against hasty conclusions about the abusive effects of corporal punishment.\"",

            "premise": "\"My opponent claims that rape, kidnapping, and attempted terrorism do not cause death, and thus does not deserve a death sentence. However, this form of \"an eye for an eye\" judicial system does not hold up because of the intangible psychological effect involved. The main purpose of the mentioned crimes are to inspire FEAR in the victim, and this intangible (and yes, perhaps subjective) effect of the mentioned crimes must be taken into account.\" --> The adverse effects are taken into account. However jsut because someone might be afraid doesn't mean that a person deserves death as a punishment. Corporal punishment would be an adequate punishment for this. I will show how my opponents reasoning is flawed. E.g. Someone robs a house and is caught. However, the person in the house is afraid to be in his/her house again, because he/she does not want to be robbed. Does this fear mean that the robber deserves death? Obviously not. Just because fear may happen to a person doesn't mean that another person deserves death. \"If proportionality is not legal equivalence, then why am I wrong in advocating the death penalty for these criminals? If you do not demand \"an eye for an eye\", why can we not go above and account for intangible costs and deal them the death penalty? The death penalty is the greatest punishment that we can deal out, and in the cases of the despicable acts of rape, kidnapping, and attempted terrorism, the death penalty is justified (and has already been embraced by societies around the world)\" --> We can argue proportionality vs. legal equivalence all day. however this misses the point. You have yet to explain why in certain cases corporal punishment is not justified. You are just saying that we can use the death penalty if it warrants. Just because option, according to you, may be justified doesn't automatically make corporal punishment unjustified. \"Precisely, how is corporal punishment (i.e flogging, whipping ect) not harsh? Can we claim that it is the actually PLEASANT to be whipped and flogged? I think not. It is clearly intuitive that there is at least some harshness to the whipping or flogging of criminals.\" --> you miss the point. According to Beccaria, a punishment is harsh if it exceeds the punishment due. Punishments are not meant to be kind, they are meant to be harsh. You miss the point Beccaria is making. A punishment must be due, not exceeding the fairness of it. \"As to my citations for the prison guard beatings, is it not PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT with the intention of PUNISHMENT/RETRIBUTION? So what exactly distinguishes from the corporal punishment except it is not carried out in a regulated place. The use of physical violence in this case is clearly forbidden, and thus should be used as a precedent against the use of PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT (aka corporal punishment).\" --> Ok, then according to you the death penalty is unjustified, and you continually use that point. Also, labor would be unjustified because it can create physical pain on the body. \"But is not my opponent argument precisely that the mass-killers and all the perhaps mentally unstable and dangerous people in society should be given corporal punishment in order to reduce prison sentences?\" --> This is where you misunderstand my case. I am not abolishing all punishments to be replaced by corporal punishment. The key word is warrants. A mass-murderer has killed so he deserves the death penalty. I said if it WARRANTS they could reduce sentences and use corporal punishment. \"Furthermore, my opponent claims that it will serve as better deterrence; however, my opponent has not provided concrete proof of it (CITED STUDY FROM A SCIENCE JOURNAL). Since my opponent has the burden of proof, his warrentless assertion must be discounted\" --> If I remember correctly, I made a link between other countries that use corporal punishment compared to the US. Since deterrence cannot be proven 100%, we must use comparative arguments. \"My point is not that society should not punish, we should not use anachronistic methods of inflicting intense PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT in order to remedy crime. As a highly developed civilization, our morals dictate that we use the most reasonable and painless methods of punishment while retaining deterrence and other consequences of punishment at an acceptable level. The infliction of pain undermines the moralistic foundations of a society. If my government is actively beating people, what's to stop them from torturing us later? Perhaps we are restricting rights when we send criminals to jail, but we're violating not only their HUMAN RIGHT (as opposed to civil right) and SOCIETY'S ACCEPTED MORALS in order to deal punishment to those who might otherwise not need them. We need to restrict civil liberties of people in jail because their actions have justified that, but we have no right to invade human rights.\" --> Punishments and morality are incoherent. All punishments are in some way immoral. It is immoral to kill some, it is immoral to take someone out of society and restrict their freedoms (jail). Thus, your morality point is dropped on the fact you are trying to make to opposite ideas coherent. Secondly, we're going down a slippery slope of government violating our civil liberties. If the government can actively use physical punishment against criminals, what's to stop it from abusing this power or spreading it for the general populace? NOTHING. If we do allow corporal punishment, the fundamental civil liberties guaranteed to us by the bill of rights will be severely compromised. --> Nothing stops them now. They could easily use physical punishment on us without making corporal punishment legal. Furthermore, what makes the government not take everyone into jail, but we have a jail system. Your punishment has no real link to the resolution. \"Thirdly, my opponent claims that corporal punishment would show proportionality. Why is it that the current system does not accurately serve PROPORTIONALITY, apart from the very subjective argument that the crimes do not fit the punishment? The definition you provided for proportionaltiy could very well include the death penalty under its wings, making any discussion moot.\" --> As I said before, I am not taking away the DP all together. I am arguing that certain crimes and circumstances deserve a punishment in between 2 extremes. I.e. jail and the death penalty. Furthermore, it helps judicial discretion on the judges part. [Voting Issues] 1. My opponent has not negated the given resolution. All his points and examples explain why corporal punishment may not be the best system, but he doesn't explain how it is not a just punishment. 2. It is clear that corporal punishment is a justified when it is warranted. For these reasons I urge an affirmation.",

            "premise": "My own definitions (since that's what he asked for) Fair: giving each their due. Proportional: in likeness to. Sufficient: not extreme but not to easy \"Contention I: Corporal Punishment is a reasonable punishment. i.My opponent claims that the 3 crimes (rape, murder, attempted terrorism) do not deserve the death penalty. However, this argument is not true. My opponent later cites Beccaria's \"The punishment must for the crime\". For such horrendous crimes my opponent has mentioned, it is intuitive that the death penalty (or otherwise strongest possible punishment) is justified for the three crimes my opponent mentioned. The psychological and physical damage done by rape, murder, and terrorism clearly outweighs the death of the perpetrator (and thus is a fitting punishment.\" --> First, I claimed the three as: Rape, KIDNAPPING, and attempted terrorism. He claims that these 3 that I mentioned coincide with \"The punishment must fit the crime. I have 2 response: 1. No crime listed above results in death. The 3 I list are implied that it did not result in another crime, i.e. murder. Therefore, the death penalty would be too extreme of a punishment. 2. Let's say that one of these crimes did result in death. I am not advocating taking away the death penalty totally. If it was necessary then it should be up to the discretion of the court system. All I am arguing is that for certain crimes, just jail is not enough, but the death penalty goes to far. \"Secondly, my opponents claim that corporal punishment opens up for interim punishment is not inherent in today's society. The flexibility of prison years allows the government to pursue interim punishment reasonable for the crime.\" --> My opponent affirms right here. \"The flexibility of prison years allows the government to pursue interim punishment reasonable for the crime.\" Essentially, if the court system believes that a crime warrants corporal punishment as an interim punishment, then they would do so. Essentially, an interim punishment is one that is worked in relation with the jail system. I.e. during jail time they would receive a corporal punishment once a week. (For argument's sake) \"Contention II: Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy My opponent claims that corporal punishment decreases actual crime rates. First, I must demand citations (papers) to support this claim. Secondly, this is a classic case of Post Hoc Ergo Propter hoc fallacy. Correlation does not mean causation. One must question the other influences present in countries my opponent mentioned. One possible influence is better police forces or anti-gun ownership laws ect\u2026 Such confounding variables undermine my opponent claim of causation.\" --> First off I cited a source. He is open to look if he wishes. Secondly, I clearly state in my point that if deterrence is indeed true, and it does work, then it is a good secondary outcome. It is not necessary to affirm, but it is a good method to help protect society. \"Contention III: The 8th amendment may have been founded on the premise of \"the crime fits of punishment\". Furthermore, it also forbids harsh and unnecessary punishment. It is clearly evident that corporal punishment can be construed as harsh and unnecessary punishment.\" --> The key word is construed. Essentially, it is an opinion. Since the harshness of a punishment is subjective, we must look at Beccaria's proportionality part of the 8th Amendment. Link ym contention 1 to this \"Although this may not be the corporal punishment advocated by my opponent, it is certainly analogous to infliction of physical pain on a prisoner\" --> As is evident by the case presented, the force was one produced out of personal want to hurt another person. It was not intended as a means for punishment. Essentially, it was a vigilante (so to speak) use of force. Corporal Punishment would be overlooked by the justice system and the jail system. It would be administered proportionality in deal with the previous crime committed. \"Contention IV: Although our prisons may be crowded, my opponent has given no evidence in support of the deterrence of corporal punishment. For all we know, the reduced prison times may lead to the release of very dangerous criminals in our streets. Jails serve to keep dangerous members of society from mainstream society as well as a deterrence/punishment role. Releasing them early because they have suffered corporal punishment is antithetical to the first purpose. The economic costs of releasing known criminals (i.e murderers, rapists, terrorists) into the streets far outweighs the amount of money saved by the government in prison-keeping fees. Not only are economic costs incurred by releasing such prisoners, other intangible social costs (i.e higher crime rates, can't go out during the night ect) also result from releasing more prisoners.\" --> As is clear from my point, we would have less sentences with corporal punishment if it warrant. Obviously, we would not let a mass-killer out of jail. Furthermore, the use of corporal punishment would send a stronger message of just retribution for crimes as posed above. It would be much more effective then: \"Your going to jail.\" (Oh God, I'm so scared. Recreation time, meals included. I'm getting a free ride by tax payers. I don't know how I can deal with it.) I'll refute his own case Point I Ok essentially the whole idea behind this argument is that we as a society can't condone physical punishment on a criminal. Ok, I have 2 responses: 1. Ok, then why is it ok for us to restrict liberties when we send them into jail. For a society, according to you, should be above this. We wouldn't want to condone taking away given liberties. Furthermore, the death penalty is not painless as you so mention. For about 1 minute before you die, you go through shock and immense pain. (This is lethal injection) Basically, your point means that a society should not punish. 2. You will say that physical punishment is different. It doesn't matter. If the court decides that a criminal warrants such punishment, then it is used to achieve justice. According to Rawls, justice is foremost in an institution and society. We would be more of a society if we act out of justice. \"Secondly, the acceptance of corporal punishment would signal that the society no longer views corporal punishment by its members as illegal (i.e I can beat my wife.) --> This is stupid. Do people go around murdering because the government implements the death penalty. Do people kidnapping because the government puts people in jail. No. It is the exact opposite. People do not wish to have negativity brought upon them. Therefore, they will refrain from such actions. I.e. deterrence. \"Thirdly, my opponent argues that \"the punishment must fit the crime\". Does he advocate that we should rape, murder, or attempt terrorism on the perpetrators. Basically my opponent is arguing for a weaker form of \"an eye for an eye\". There are numerous arguments against this moral and judicial philosophy that I could mention later if my opponent so obliges.\" --> Proportionality is not legal equivalence. We should not rape because someone rapes. This is where corporal punishment has a plus. It is used as a punishment that needs harsher means but is not equivalent, or death. Having only jail shows that we as a society do not condemn crime as much as we ought to. Having corporal punishment furthers proportionality and wanes us off of legal equivalence. Turn this argument against my opponent. \"In conclusion, since my opponent has not shown (with proof/studies) that corporal punishment actually serves a significant deterrent against crimes or that corporal punishment\" --> He didnt' finish the sentence. However, the resolution is asking for fairness and proportionality. Deterrence is not necessary for that. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

            "premise": "My opponent supplies us by a new article from the famously liberal abc news. (I'm liberal myself but for this debate I have to admit that this is an extremely biased source). They essentially tear apart the idea of corporal punishment based on the 'theory' (for which no evidence is supplied) that corporal punishment increases aggression in children (which is ironic because you'd think having felt the force of violence that children would be less aggressive).Now I shall explain exactly why corporal punishment needn't be banned from SCHOOLS despite it's rightful ban in other places.As I said in round 1, \" A teacher cannot threaten a detention, something they are allowed to do, without the retort of \u201cbut you can't take away my freedom\u201d, \u201cyou have no right\u201d or \u201cI have rights\u201d. In fact children are acutely aware of how much power they have over the teachers by way of laws and rights, and they use every opportunity to remind the teachers of that fact.\" corporal punishment would allow the teacher, in a strictly monitored manner, to spank the child for not only the original reason but for the rudeness of the remark, is rather ineffective and useless (and my opponent supplied zero evidence otherwise).Also,, was my contention that \"If we re-introduced corporal punishment this back chat would cease and the power would be retained by the teachers. Detention is not going to be taken seriously by anyone. What does detention do other than waste your time? If you have ADHD or a creative mind you'll have a blast, effectively learning nothing to *correct* your behavior.\" The only point against this was that my opponent claimed to have first-hand seen reduction in repeats of detention as opposed to spanking issues but this easily could be because of more lenience in the school when it had detentions.I re-iterate that Between 1981, when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997, after the abolition of corporal punishment, there was a 67% increase in crime.

            "conclusion": "My 99th Debate: Kids and Corporal Punishment",
            "premise": "Benefits to the childI agree that this debate is about benefits to the child. I disagree, though, that it can be separated so clearly from benefits to the parents because the child and the family are so interlinked. Consider a frazzled mother in the kitchen trying to put together dinner for the family, and on the phone to her boss at work, and the children start messing about with knives. So she slaps them and takes the knives away. Mostly she does it so that they don't bother her while she tries to cook dinner. It's a short-term solution. She doesn't have time to chat to them about the danger of knives. On the other hand, the benefits to the children are obvious too - that don't cut themselves on that occasion, their mother can sort things out with her boss and continue to get paid, which helps them all maintain their lifestyle, and she can get dinner on the table so they can eat.It comes back to my original point, that we can assume that parents are acting on the whole in their children's best interests (allowing for exceptions). The exact way they do that may be complicated and parents go about it in different ways. Around the world, most parents use corporal punishment occasionally, and more parents than that endorse it as appropriate. For me, that's enough to accept that corporal punishment benefits children in the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary. Con has presented plenty of argument to the contrary, but none of it is convincing, as I will explain now.Establishing cause (1)There are two ways to establish cause. The first and best way is by doing an experimental study. An experimental study has a very particular design where subjects are randomly assigned to the treatment conditions. Without this part, the study is only observational and causality cannot be inferred from the results.For example, suppose I noticed a link between high school grades and yacht ownership. Families that own yachts tend to produce children who get high grades in high school. I could come up with all kinds of theories - yacht owners spend more time outside in the fresh air, practicing navigation and coordinating in a yacht team all develop thinking skills, etc. It's nonsense though. Far more likely is that yacht owners are rich, they can afford tutors, computers, resources for their children. They probably have household staff so those students aren't bothered by chores. They have high expectations and a sense of entitlement. In other words, there is probably ZERO causal relationship between owning a yacht and getting high grades in high school despite the correlation.Experimental studies on corporal punishment are impossible. Causality will never be established in this way because no ethics committee will ever allow children to be randomly assigned to a corporal punishment condition for experimental purposes, and any parents who would volunteer for such a study would be unusual and therefore could not be assumed to represent the population as a whole.That means that we know straight up that THERE ARE NO STUDIES OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT that have established a causal relationship between corporal punishment and outcomes. Gerschoff, in the meta-analysis that Con cited, makes this clear: \"the meta-analyses described here do not afford causal conclusions but allow understanding only of whether corporal punishment and child constructs are associated. In addition... researchers must rely on parent reports of corporal punishment rather than on observations.\" (1) pg. 540As I showed in the previous round, use of corporal punishment and attitudes towards it vary dramatically by culture. Black Americans are six times more likely to endorse it than white Americans. Chinese parents are 10x more likely to use it than Swedish parents. When we are comparing groups of parents on whether or not they use corporal punishment, then, we are comparing cultures. Parents who report that they do not use corporal punishment are more likely to be college-educated westerners, for example, than those who do not. Any \"outcome\" measures, then, are merely recording differences between cultures. There is no reason at all to attribute those differences to corporal punishment rather than anything else - say - skin color, social influence or language spoken at home. Establishing cause (2)We can never do an experimental study on corporal punishment - that doesn't mean that we can never make comments about the effects of it. If we have a clear and convincing model or mechanism for the way corporal punishment works on behavior and thinking, then we can believe in the causality in that way. Such models are subject to error and bias, though, so we need to be careful about what we believe. Two ChildrenImagine two Christian families where the parents insist on saying grace before eating. In Family A, the children are spanked if they forget; in Family B, there is a lengthy discussion about God and gratitude, and the next time the children are warmly praised when they remember to say grace.Two totally different messages. Child A learns about authority and power. He learns that authority sets the rules and that infractions will be punished if detected. He learns that there are three ways to escape punishment: 1. obey authority; 2. avoid authority; 3. be the authority.Child B learns about God and gratitude. She learns that by not saying grace she is somehow letting herself down by being ungodly and ungrateful. It is not obvious to Child B where power and authority lies, unless it's somewhere in the moral ether.This is what Con's sources are talking about: Child B has internalized the morality, while Child A has not. Child A has a much more pragmatic view of authority - he may be aggressive and defiant in attempts to contest it. Child B does not contest authority in the same way, because of that internalized morality. A Guest ArrivesEach child brings home a friend from school for dinner who sits down and starts eating without waiting for grace! How will the children respond?Child A would notie that the guest \"got away\" with not saying grace, and that guests have special status to avoid punishment. An interesting loophole to the rule.Child B would notice their guest behaving in an ungodly and ungrateful way. They would feel that the guest was letting herself down by behaving so wrongly. Even if Child B's parents had explained the rule about Not Everyone Living like Us, if Child B has really internalized the morality of saying grace, she can't help but lose a bit of respect for her guest.Benefits to the childIt really isn't obvious whether Child A or Child B benefits more. The internalized morality can lead to judgemental thinking which could damage relationships. On the other hand, a cynicism about authority could lead to defiant, aggressive behavior which could be problematic too.I think it depends on context. Suppose the children lived in a society with an oppressive ruling class, or in a chaotic, violent society or a society limited by class or racial distinctions. In such societies (most societies, perhaps), a pragmatic approach to power and authority could benefit children hugely as they grow into adults, which would mean that child A would benefit more than child B. Language, Culture, PropagandaWesterners are unusual in the way they tend to put their children to sleep in separate room from the parents. People in most other cultures are horrified by this and studies have linked it to bad outcomes such as anxiety and even increased infant mortality. (2,3,4) UNICEF acknowledges that co-sleeping is good for children, but if you search on its website, there are only TWO references to this issue, while there are 720 for corporal punishment (6). This report about funding for UNICEF shows that only 9% of funding for the organization is unearmarked - that is, the vast majority for funding is given for a particular purpose. It's very likely that more funding is provided for the issue of corporal punishment (consistent with Western internalized morality) than for co-sleeping (inconsistent with Western internalized morality). (7)Would you rather be slapped on the leg or shut in your room? I'd prefer to be slapped, and so would most American college students. (8) \"Time out\" sounds so nice, but it could legitimately be called \"isolation punishment\". Conversely, \"corporal punishment\" could be called \"kinaesthetic feedback\" without falsehood. Even the language we use about this issue is judgmental.RacismWhenever you see fund-raising marketing for developing country charities, there's always pictures of adorable, non-white babies looking adorable and vulnerable. We want to save the children!The thing is, everyone wants to save the children. Even their own families do. Instinct towards protecting and nurturing children is a universal quality in the human race. We wouldn't have survived otherwise. Intelligence is also universal (at the cultural/population level). The evidence isn't nearly strong enough to counterbalance this.(1) www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/pdfs/Gershoff-2002.pdf (2) http://www.incultureparent.com...(3) http://www.naturalchild.org...(4) http://libaware.economads.com...(5) http://www.unicef.org...(6) http://www.unicef.org...;(7) http://www.unicef.org...;(8) http://www.bloomberg.com...;",

Instead or punishing the teachers and parents should emphasis good behavior and applause them when they do something good, so they will feel better when they are prasied and will try better when their doing something positive. For example when a student is late for class the teacher should tell him or her to come a bit earlier next time. When teachers tell students to do something they will resist and maybe even ignore what teacher said if the teacher hits them instead of saying it in a good way. Some teachers hit them again if they don't listen. Then the student will try to quit the academy and if their parents are hitting them they might even decide to leave home.",

            "discussionTitle": "Corporal Punishment of Children Should be Illegal",
            "conclusion": "Corporal Punishment of Children Should be Illegal",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his response. Rebuttal: My opponent brings up a few crucial points for his argument that I'll refute in order of appearance. Firstly, the scenario you paint about the \"five year old boy who's very naughty,\" is a horrible one to be sure. But where we draw the line is important. Why not shoot the kid? That'll make things easier. Not to kill of course, just a flesh wound. He's acting out over the top and you are his parent. He would learn from a gunshot to the arm. I bet he'd never do any of that 'naughty' stuff again. Now, I am not equating the severity of spanking with the severity of a healable gunshot, but I am comparing your logical conclusion with the one I have demonstrated. Just because something is effective in controlling someone, doesn't mean it is right. Your case that children are not rational actors has little bearing on whether or not they should be physically punished. A mentally retarded forty-year-old thinks differently than a 20-year old student from Auckland. This doesn't mean one should be beaten and the other shouldn't. Unless you're suggesting that because a child's brain works differently, the only available option for punishment is spanking. I would argue this isn't the case. The gunshot idea still applies. I engage in hyperbole only to emphasize the point that while one method may be the easiest form of controlling a child, that doesn't make it the right way. There are other forms of negative reinforcement. In one paragraph you say: \"Most parents practice positive reinforcement in this style, such as giving good children a lollypop or a pat on the back. If that's good parenting, then I suggest that negative reinforcement (light spanking, for instance), to avoid undesirable behaviors, should also be classed as good parenting. That's why corporal punishment is sometimes required\" I agree that negative reinforcement is also good parenting. But my whole point is that spanking isn't a healthy form of negative reinforcement. Once again, if you give your child a flesh wound that will definitely heal it is also a form of negative reinforcement, but it is not an acceptable form. I agree with your premise, but the conclusion you draw is lacking. If you make your child go on a timeout, take away their favorite toy, or refuse to take them to the movie theater like they wanted, these are all forms of effective negative reinforcement that doesn't involve physical violence. And as for the line 'That's why corporal punishment is sometimes required.\" I disagree completely. Once again, corporal punishment, like gunshots, or knife wounds isn't the only form of negative reinforcement. And it is not a healthy form either. \"I see the harm of corporeal punishment as going deeper than that, however, as removing the power from parents to determine how to do good upbringing - which inevitably means good upbringing often does not occur.\" Removing the power from parents on how to do a good upbringing in many cases is a good thing. Some parents think it's okay to beat their children. Others may even think that a good few days of starving or dehydration is a good way to teach a child how to 'become a man.' These powers have been removed by courts and legislature because they are deemed unfit forms of parenting. In the same way, I think corporal punishment should be added to the list of outlawed things. There are still a host of positive and negative forms of reinforcement that can be used to bring up your child. If a parent can't think of a way to take away a toy, not allow a kid to see his friend on the weekend, not allow the kid to play with his pet, or to ground the child, as an effective punishment strategy, and if that same parent thinks that violence and physically beating a child is the only way to teach that child, then I would argue that there is something seriously wrong with the parent. Also, your point about Sweden doesn't bear on the issue. Just because parents were unable to control themselves or control their tempers and not beat their kids, doesn't mean that the kids should be punished because of it. Basically you're saying that kids should accept a little abuse from parents so they don't have to face a lot of abuse of the foster system. Just because a parent can't follow the law and refuses to think of actual forms of controlling their child without resorting to physical violence, doesn't mean that corporal punishment should be allowed. If a host of parents felt it was okay to beat their children (as was common in many third culture countries) black and blue to the point they break bones and refused to stop when it was outlawed, does that mean it shouldn't have been outlawed? No. It doesn't follow. Defense: In his first rebuttal he makes a few claims about how children regard their parents' actions and which ones they'll try themselves. There is no proof suggesting a child doesn't want to drive a car. They may simply not have the access to mimic this particular action of their parents. I have already cited sources suggesting that children mimic their parents. If a parent swears, so will the child. If a parent tells dirty jokes, so will the kid. And if a parent hits, in many cases, so will the son or daughter. The source he sites about a long case study has this to say: \"I have looked at just about every study I can lay my hands on, and there are thousands, and I have not found any evidence that an occasional mild smack with an open hand on the clothed behind or the leg or hand is harmful or instills violence in kids,\" she said. An occasional mild smack hardly constitutes usual corporal punishment. An occasional mild smack can be forgiven, because children are capable of forgiveness. Some parents may shout hurtful things at their children once or twice, this doesn't constitute emotional or verbal abuse. A child can forgive. Some parents may forget to feed a child once or twice, this isn't neglect it can be pardoned. So when a case study uses the mildest form of something, expect to see extremely mild results. Second con argues that smacking the bottom doesn't yield the same physical results as smacking a face. I agree. I never said it did. I said it had the same consequences. If you stab someone in the knee as opposed to the heart, you will not cause as much damage but you will still be guilty of 'attempted murder.' If you punch someone in the arm instead of the face you are still guilty of 'battery.' If you smack a bottom just because it will 'cause less damage' it doesn't follow that that makes it alright. The same consequences exist no matter where you strike. Not physical (it still causes pain and causes damage of welts, scarring prevention of being able to sit down), but emotional and legal. And once again I disagree that corporal punishment is 'required.' Third, I agree not all corporal punishment is harsh. Not all verbal abuse is barbed. Not all hateful rhetoric is overt. But it is still there and it still teaches the same thing. And in the long run it still has the potential to yield adverse results. Finally, my argument is that spanking is bad for society because it causes aggressive behavior, violent tendencies and stunts emotional growth. My points still stand. They were not refuted, but played down to the most minimal possible effect such as 'a light occasional slap.' If I steal only a gumball from a grocery store am I guilty of theft? If I only whisper a small sexual joke about a coworker am I guilty of sexual harassment? Just because con has taken the most mild case study, doesn't mean that the crime committed is any less serious. I never said a child should be treated like an adult. I said a child should be protected from violence like adults are protected from violence. This debate isn't about treating children like adults, unless you're claiming the only difference between a child and an adult is that adults are not spanked. Which it isn't.",

            "conclusion": "Discipline should be instilled by parents not school.",
            "premise": "Ruptured eardrums, brain damage and other bodily injuries and death in some instances are some of the bad and tragic effects of corporal punishment. While the physical damage done to the body can be treated, the emotional and psychological effects can affect the survivor deeply. Corporal punishment is the hitting of a person with a hand or an object such as a cane or belt. It is also kicking, burning, shaking or throwing of a person with the intention of inflicting pain on them. Pinching or pulling the hair, forcing one to sit in uncomfortable or undignified positions, or forcing one to take excessive physical exercise as a way of disciplining them is tantamount to corporal punishment. Although prohibited by law in Zambia as a way of disciplining children in schools, corporal punishment is still widely practised by teachers and by parents in homes. This is because no measures have been taken to ensure that legislation is implemented and the behaviour of perpetrators changed. Corporal punishment is still widely practised by teachers and parents as reflected in a qualitative and quantitative survey of 2,705 boys and girls aged between six and 18 years. The objective of the survey was to explore a diversity of experiences; views and feelings related to corporal punishment and other forms of humiliating and degrading punishment of children. It was also intended to estimate the levels of corporal punishment in schools and homes in the country. The study looked at corporal and humiliating and degrading punishment of children over a period of two weeks. It was conducted in 2005 in all the nine provinces of Zambia by the Zambia Civic Education Association and commissioned by Save The Children Sweden. According to the survey, corporal punishment and other forms of degrading and humiliating punishment are still widely practised in Zambia both at school and at home. Children are often hit with a hand, a stick or hosepipe in schools when they do wrong. At home they are hit with sticks, belts, hands and in some cases denied food. Some parents and child tenders alike practise corporal punishment because of the belief that children do not grow to be well-mannered adults if they are not spanked or beaten when they make mistakes. Some even say that abolishing corporal punishment is a Western-centric concept that will cause havoc in African cultures and lead to moral decay. The study also established that corporal punishment is more pronounced in low-income environments than in affluent communities. This can be attributed to poverty and its effects like stress and high illiteracy levels in these communities. Such factors tend to have an effect on how adults discipline children. Whatever reasons, parents and teachers and indeed other care-givers may have to justify corporal punishment as a form of child discipline. It should be noted that its effects on survivors are damaging. According to Father Derrick Mewing, an assistant priest at the Anglican Cathedral of The Holy Cross Lusaka, corporal punishment only induces fear and distorts reasoning. \"Beating or treating children in a degrading manner are ineffective ways of disciplining them because they only save as quick fixes that are detrimental to a child and do not provide a lasting solution to a problem. In schools for instance, teachers should tell pupils the benefits of possessing a good character coupled with good academic performance and also the consequences of one not possessing them. This approach installs a sense of responsibility in them. On the other hand corporal punishment induces fear and distorts reasoning. Fr Mewing asserted: \"Children need discipline but they need to learn self-discipline. There is need to encourage non-violent and non-humiliating ways of instilling discipline in them.\" Corporal punishment does not help a child to develop into an adult with self-discipline and respect for other people. Instead, it distorts sound judgement and creates anti-social behaviours. Fr Mewing further asserted that some people have taken biblical scriptures literally. He cited Proverbs 11: 7, which says \"spare the rod and spoil the child.\" According to Fr Mewing, the portion of the scripture in question does not literally mean what most people perceive it to entail \"This does not literally mean what it has generally been perceived to mean. In this case the rod is the code of conduct. The psalmist says, Thy rod and thy stuff they comfort me. How can something comfort and cause you pain at the same time? The rod referred to in the Bible is the code of conduct that is meant to guide and instruct one in the right path for them to have a disciplined and fulfilling life, Fr Mewing said. And according to the same study, corporal punishment is used more frequently on younger children (6-12 years) than on older children (13-18 years). Older children experience humiliating and degrading treatment to a larger extent. There was also a small but consistent trend for boys to be subjected to corporal punishment while older girls experienced humiliating and degrading punishment in the form of verbal abuse to a larger extent. Corporal punishment works against the process of ethical development. It teaches children not to engage in a particular behaviour because they risk being beaten. But it does not teach them the reasons and ethics for not behaving in a particular manner. It is said that violence breeds violence. The use of corporal punishment on children contributes to a perception from an early age that violence is an appropriate response to conflict resolution and unwanted behaviour. It teaches them that it is acceptable for powerful persons to be violent towards the weak and to resolve conflicts through violence. The escalating levels of gender violence especially against women and children are evidence of this archaic and despicable method of disciplining young people. Children exposed to non-peaceful ways of conflict resolution often become perpetrators of gender violence in their adulthood. Exposing children to violence can make them potential perpetrators of such vices later in life. Notwithstanding its devastating effects on survivors and society at large, it is disheartening to note that less than 20 countries globally have adopted legislation to prohibit corporal punishment of children. Some countries have even outlawed corporal punishment of children in schools and other institutions. Corporal punishment violates human rights to physical integrity and human dignity, as upheld by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, as well as the Zambian Constitution. Often times, children are viewed as second-class humans, but they are as much entitled to their equal enjoyment of rights just as adults. For some reasons, corporal punishment of children has not been given the seriousness it deserves. This has caused a lot of children to suffer silently. Children too have the right to be heard. But more often than not, society does not want to accord them the opportunity to do so. This is because adults tend to think that children are incapable of reasoning and hence cannot be consulted even on issues concerning them. Given a choice, children would prefer to be disciplined in non-violent and non-humiliating ways. According to the same study, approximately 70 per cent of the children found corporal punishment in the home and at school unacceptable. Their sentiment was the same for humiliating punishment, which approximately found 79 per cent unacceptable as evidenced by the study that showed 75 per cent of the children were against corporal punishment. The children said that the practice is harmful both physically and emotionally and that it induces fear in them and thereby reduces their concentration. The majority of children said that they would prefer parents and teachers to talk to them and explain what they did wrong instead of beating them or using other forms of humiliating and degrading punishment as a way of disciplining them. Given the children's response, it can be said therefore that children would prefer to be treated with respect just like everyone else. Thus, to have adults listen to them and to be given a better understating of what they have done wrong instead of rushing into beating or treating them inhumanely. However, eleven per cent of the children preferred corporal punishment when being disciplined. This option was more favoured by children from low-income environments. A possible sad explanation to this perception could be that these children live in environments where violent forms of discipline are acceptable and they are so used to violence as a way of correction such that they cannot imagine any other forms of discipline. Zambia Police Service Victim Support Unit coordinator, Peter Kanunka said most cases of corporal punishment go unreported unless in situations where a teacher physically and emotionally hurts a pupil. Unfortunately, even such cases are in most cases not reported, therefore, perpetuating the menace of corporal punishment as a form of punishment. \"Survivors grow up traumatised as a result of physical and emotional pain inflicted on them,\" Mr Kanunka said. Unfortunately, the ban on corporal punishment in schools has not been followed up by measures that offer alternatives to the vice. Many teachers feel that the Government prohibited corporal punishment without providing them with proper guidelines and training on alternative methods of discipline. The lack of skills to manage discipline through non-violent ways and cultural beliefs that tend to encourage the beating of children as a way of disciplining them have perpetrated the practice. There is need to provide teachers with some form of training in disciplining children by using positive and non-violent ways that can be incorporated in the teachers' training curriculum.",

            "conclusion": "Reinstate corporal punishment in schools",
            "premise": "I should probably mention I went to a private school, but now I'm in a public school. Actually, yes, sitting outside in the hallway or having a thirty-minute detention was enough. Though I acted out at times, it wasn't like I went unpunished. And after every punishment, there was a much longer gap between my \"act-outs\". The embarrassment was and has been enough to get the people to stop. *WARNING*: Next paragraphs are about my past and I get really REALLY worked up about it when I write about it. Sorry about that, but I need to include it to give you the full idea. I know it wouldn't have helped me because I would've linked the pain to some of the events (as that was occasionally what happened). That would've made me act out even more. In fact, one time it did. Being a private school, they weren't as strict about corporal punishments. Even though I hadn't been diagnosed with depression during fourth grade, it was starting to creep up on me (I hit it pretty hard once I realized my home life was nowhere NEAR normal). My fourth-grade teacher new about what was going on and she was very kind, nice, and understanding; because of all that, I nearly never acted-out. I did a lot in fifth grade because my teacher was not like that at all, and I would only respond badly to my sister if she were to NOT act nice. With her having bipolar disorder, it was either sweet as honey or the spawn of Satan. Though it sounds very stereotypical, with such an extreme case she had that was how it was. Anyways, my usual teacher was usually very understanding when I acted out, making it less frequent and much more mild and short. Not that they were really that bad, but hopefully you get what I'm saying. Note: There is a difference between me \"acting out\" (which is just me kind of reducing stress in an unhealthy manner) and me responding to \"attackers\". Just wanted to clarify. So when I act out after a particularly rough morning, the substitute smacks me (not unusually hard, but still enough) on the head. My parents weren't much of fighters against my sister, so because of that, even though I was only 11 (children learn to fit roles that weren't being filled), I would be pretty...feisty. So when my flight or fight mode was activated, it was 90% of the time fight. This wasn't an exception for me at school. At all. The kids new some of my home life too, so they knew that I was going to not respond well to what had happened given that it would be like that at home. They had seen part of it, after all (my mom had to pick me up one time and my sister had to come along...long story). One of the kids tried to warn her and explain why I had acted out the way I did, but the damage was done and I saw it as if I was at home and she was my sister. Given that a majority of my classmates had seen me respond to my sister in at one point or another, it didn't come as much as a shock to them as it did to my substitute teacher (given that they had seen it and they weren't the target). Sorry, I'm trying to explain this in the best way possible and it's kind of hard to look back on those times and explain it well. Not only are the feelings indescribable, but I almost put myself in the situation again when I remember it which makes me scatter-brained. So, because of the punishment, I had automatically put myself in the mode of \"I'm in danger and I can't let that happen\". Not only because of me, but my brain automatically linked my punishment with the other kids; if the substitute was willing to do that to me, who knows what it could escalate to if she did it to another kid? I couldn't let that happen! Though, of course, it wouldn't have, that's what it was like at home and just that little tiny smack brought me all the way back to that unresolved morning. But it didn't end well at all. Fortunately, my previous teachers knew all about it and were able to stand up for me if need be, but my principal also knew about it (it was a small school and my mom got involved a sort of outlet for stress). That substitute was pretty insistent that I was the one who was causing the trouble at my house if I acted like that, and a snarky comment of \"don't make accusations about things you don't know anything about\" was actually completely fitting; don't assume anything about my life if you have 0% of the story. Especially when my classmates, teachers, AND principal know about it while you don't. Gah sorry going on a rant here. I just get really worked up about this sort of thing and put myself back there when writing or merely thinking about it. I'm not usually like that (EVER), and it's not because of lack of punishment. It's not like I thought it was okay (I hated it whenever it happened), it's just that I couldn't help it; I was a child who was placed in an environment that was EXTREMELY unhealthy. I'll put a little warning at the top of this. Anyways, what I meant to get out of that was this: Other kids go into the same flight or fight mode and choose to fight when given a physical punishment due to similar experiences, whether it be a sibling like in my case, abusive parents, or maybe just a one-time event that happened; either way, results can be disastrous like the time I just mentioned. There was a time I was in fifth grade taking my first anti-depressant (Prozac) and it made me really gittery and made me act EXACTLY like my sister when I was mad. That was triggered by a physical punishment too, but I don't think it's necessary because: A. You get the point B. I was under influence of something that messed with the chemicals of my brain With that, though it wasn't mentioned a ton, I tried to show that being more kind rather than harsh about the act-outs was actually a much better response. Though I did get a sit-out in the hallway each time, it made me think of how I could try to avoid it. In fifth grade, they became much more frequent, partially due to too-severe punishment methods. Apparently, the teacher didn't think that trying a new method was a good idea even though the original clearly wasn't working... Gosh, I just ramble on and on and on. OKAY next point (finally): I agree that there should be separate classes for people with Autism, Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, etc., but sometimes it \"doesn't make enough of a difference\" for them to be sorted into these classes. Gosh, if my sibling were put in a normal classroom (as she almost was despite the extreme severity of her condition) that would have been a total nightmare. But, if someone with a mild case (but still known) acts out slightly, should they get a punishment? No, because they can't help it. In the case of normal kids, they will see that and a few will think it's okay for THEM to do because Susy isn't getting punished for it. Why should they? Again, sorry for the unnecessarily long explanation! I promise you that events like that almost never happen anymore. My past did seriously screw with my head a lot, but now I'm actually kind of thankful for it (weirdly and surprisingly). Yes, I'm still an oddball, but the effects are barely visible now so I act just fine unless someone targets my sister...I'm protective against the one I use to be against...isn't that weird how that works? I'm like that with a few others too. Anyways, enough about my weird habits. Hope your kids are doing great and their summer vacation time isn't driving you insane! Lol.",

            "premise": "I think it obvious that a child would not be introduced into a school without the parents being aware of any behavioural disorders or diabilities. What must be taken into account, is a vast majority of cases are attention seeking attempts; in this case, we are to isolate them. Of course, this is used today as a way of dealing with behaviour, but it seems unsuccesful in dealing with behaviour, as people think its cool to go against the system, such as gaining unnecessary ASBOs, or trying to impress friends or admirers. I find the most efficient way of dettering bad behaviour, is embarrasment. In Islamic counties, they use punishments, such as fingers amputated for stealing, public flogging for being abusive to higher authority or stoning for adultry. This is used as a detterance, not only to the person themselves, but to the general public also. It also makes an awareness on how foolish those individuals are, for trying to make themselves cooler, or more impressive. I am currently a sixth form student at a secondary school( high school in some cases), and i can see that younger years are getting \"cockier\" towards tutors. This is a observation of only a few years, whereas the scale we are talking is much longer. It is this point, where the point i made earlier on being abusive to authority, where corperal punishment should be reintroduced. Sure, children need to learn how to be independant without guidence, and need to learn from their mistakes, but isnt that what corperal punishment was for? Did it not show what will happen, if the individuals did make the wrong decisions? Like i said, corperal punishment showed the consequences of going against higher authority, children need to learn of these consequences, and experience them if they do attempt to go against that authority. As of the cases which include genuine behavioural disorders or disabilities, the school should know of these conditions; thus the right amount of discipline would be administrated.",

The corporal punishment directs focus on the major goal which is that hurting people is a bad thing; and in fact since corporal punishment is a form of hurt corporal punishment actually helps defeat the goal to make children understand that hurting people is a bad thing. 2)You said that \"You stated that the child would focus on the punishment and not on the reason they were punished. Then you took a leap and made the claim that they will not consider it bad behavior because they focused on the punishment.\". I didn't actually take a leap considering the fact that I posted several studies that support my claim and its conclusion. 3)Again I did not just state that corporal punishment causes children to become desensitized to violence; I posted proof that corporal punishment causes children to become more violent and more likely to commit a violent crime. 4)You make the claim, \"The older generation that was raised with corporal punishment show more respect for the individual and society as opposed to the child today\". I'd like to point out that you saying something is don't make it true. All you've done is put out a claim with nothing to support it. And now ill post some evidence that your claim is incorrect. The fact that crime rates have been steadily dropping ever since corporal punishment has been decreasing contradicts your claim. http://www.census.gov... Also states/countries with corporal punishment have higher crime rates than those who prohibit corporal punishment. http://www.census.gov... http://www.nationmaster.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... 5)I also would like to reiterate that I posted proof that corporal punishment does not work; I posted proof that it increases violent and bad behavior, and is detrimental to the mental development of children.",

            "premise": "In my opinion, corporal punishment is brutal and too severe a disciplinary action. Corporal punishment can often be very traumatic to the person it is inflicted upon. So much so that a child subjected to corporal punishment more often than not grows up to abuse physically not only his own family but other acquaintances as well. Thankfully, this practice has been banned in several nations and is a punishable offence in a few others. There are more humane ways of admonishing a child. Take for example grounding him or her. This leaves space for the juvenile to ruminate over his or her bad behaviour and even offers a chance for reformation. However, if a child is beaten up in order to drill in some moral lesson, there is a high chance the innocent will fall back on its lesson and commit a similar offence, leading to a vicious cycle. In summary, corporal punishment is detrimental to a child's overall growth and can impair his/her self-esteem and cause lasting damage.",

In my point of view, physical punishment should not only include hitting but should also include other kinds of physical actives; e.g running laps. In the modern society, as in more developed countries, Teachers will get in deep trouble for any corporal punishment towards their pupils, however, in many family, they still believe corporal punishment is the quickest way to punishment misbehaving child. If a child is about to preform a dangerous move, enforcing corporal punishment will make them remember better not to perform a certain activities in the future. Secondly, if verbal warning or shouting cannot stop the pupil misbehaving, physical punishment should take place. To argue your point on ruining the child teacher relationship, I believe as long as the reason of punishment was correct, it should not be any problem because there is a good purpose for the punishment.",

            "premise": "Seeing as how this is the final round of the debate, I'm going to wrap things up by giving a summary of my opponent's rebuttal, a review of what has gone on so far in the debate, and why the judges should vote for me in the considerations for who is the winner of this debate. There are now two reasons why my opponent has cheated in this debate and one reason as to why I didn't repeat the action that he did. My opponent has made an argument in the comment section, and while he asked several good debaters and the DDO president as to what he should do, it is still unfair that my opponent has made an argument outside of the bounds of this debate, outside of the regulations, the rules, the time constraints, all for the action of trying to sway the audience toward accepting his definition over mine. The DDO president is only charge of the rules that guide the site in general about conduct toward the other members, but outside of that, he/she has no control over the rules of this debate. If my opponent has something to say about my case, he needs to keep it here within the bounds of the debate he accepted and out of the comments section. Everything he wrote in the comment section has just been an unfair advantage against me, so for the sake of the integrity of this debate, I suggest to the judges to ignore anything he's written there. Not only that, but he mentioned himself that he asked for help from other debaters about his definition when in an honest debate, he shouldn't be turning for more than one person to help him with his case. While I'm here arguing my case alone, he's got more than one person helping him out in this debate, which is also an unfair advantage against me. My opponent says that I could've done the exact same thing, but I wanted to stay within the bounds of the debate in order to ensure an honest debate against my opponent, and I can assure the judges that I certainly didn't need the help of 5 or 6 or however many other debaters (and POTENTIAL JUDGES OF THIS DEBATE) to help me out with my own case. If I don't win the debate in the judges eyes, I certainly, at least, deserve the point for conduct in this debate. Most of my opponent's case surrounds his own definition of corporal punishment, which my opponent himself has said was not from a dictionary or a reliable source of any sort. My opponent attacks my case saying that I needed to provide my own definition just to be able to uphold my case, but if that condemns me in any way, that would also knock down his own case because his entire debate is centered around his own perception of what is corporal punishment, his own definition, and as I have explained to the judges in this debate, his definition is a very limited and narrow to fully encompass what corporal punishment is. Corporal punishment is not just spanking, but it can also be belting or hitting with a switch or slapping on the face. It encompasses that as well, and while my definition is more broad, still gives the determining factor as to what is abuse and keeps it distinct, and comes from a reliable medical source, my opponent continues to give this very limited, unofficial definition made by his own perception of what is corporal punishment as well as this strawman argument that I'm also placing in abuse as a part of corporal punishment when I made it clear the distinction between corporal punishment and abuse. Because of this fact, that pretty much knocks down the majority of my opponent's debate because his entire case was centered around this definition he provided, meaning that he was analyzing the wrong thing or very limited thing whereas my case encompassed the entirety of the definition. Probably the funniest part of the debate was where my opponent tries to mock my case where I mentioned that corporal punishment can lead to these effects, but in reality, he's making a strawman by saying that I'm somehow trying to prove that corporal punishment will always lead to these effects. I'm also arguing that corporal punishment can lead to these effects, and what my rebuttal was (which my opponent didn't really properly respond to) that because corporal punishment can at all increase the risk for these negative effects in the future, that makes corporal punishment's use immoral and something that a parent ought not use when the primary responsibility is to ensure the full security of his/her child. Just the fact that it can lead to these effects makes corporal punishment something that oughtn't be used. I have responded to his rebuttal against Sub 1a considering that I have spoken against his definition of this debate, and if you look back at his rebuttal against that point, you will realize that this was the main thing that he used: his own definition. If my opponent really wants to knock down my subpoint 1c, he's going to have to prove that all of the alternatives to corporal punishment are ineffective for use against children. What my argument was that there are so many alternatives to whooping a child that corporal punishment is not required. My opponent is very right when he says that not every punishment will work the same on every child, which is why there are alternatives that are effective and humane. Probably the most notorious of his case is his argument against Gershoff's study. My main response is that he makes this blanket statement against the entirety of my evidence posted in this argument, but the only thing he argues against is Gershoff. Even if my opponent is right and my evidence isn't 100% effective, that's okay, because I have 10 or 11 more studies that my opponent did not respond to entirely, and he's really going to need to make analysis on all of my studies in order to show that all of them are ineffective, which he can't do now considering that would be a violation of his own rules because he would be posting new evidence at the final round. So, at this point, extend all of my other evidence across the flow. As I have proven, corporal punishment is not the optimal mode of punishment against children, and considering that was the entire thesis of my first contention, I have indeed fully upheld my contention because I have successfully upheld my subpoints. My opponent really failed to make an effective argument against my second contention. It shows that he really does not have an understanding of the resolution because he keeps bringing this back to the US and himself when he says that he doesn't care about what the documents I've posted say until this country ratifies the document in question. Some questions to ponder: is my opponent the only parent in the world? Is the US the only country in the world? Does the resolution specify anywhere the United States? The answer to these questions is no. The document serves as a definition of what is human rights and is more universally accepted, and though the laywers in question are not child health experts, they certainly are experts at knowing what the rights of the human being are. So, since my opponent didn't really effectively respond to the main meat of my second contention, extend it across the flow. My opponent's rebuttal is very weak. He makes no real defense of his definition of corporal punishment, other than his unfair advantage in the comment section. There was no real point in the argument about parental rights other than the parent has to decide what is best for his child, but I have shown you that corporal punishment is not the best. My opponent analyzes the wrong thing in his third point as well. My opponent has no evidence linking corporal punishment to good of society in history and no analysis as to the amount of corporal punishment among society nor frequencies, so ignore that point. As for casual link, look at my rebuttals in 1a and 1b. Judges, you will vote for me because I was the most fair and gave you the most optimal analysis of corporal punishment as well as effectively tackled my opponent' entire case. Thus, you must vote PRO.",

            "premise": "It is inevitable that bad classroom behaviour will filter into life outside school. You only have to look at the crime statistics to see that crime has increased dramatically since the abolition of corporal punishment. Between 1981, when corporal punishment was legal and in 1997, after the abolition of corporal punishment, there was a 67% increase in crime (1). (1)http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/digest4/chapter1.pdf Additionally, the U.K.'s banning of corporal punishment is not attached to a propaganda website called nospanking.com and portrays a more convincing argument for reintroducing corporal punishment since it clearly documents crime statistics before and after the abolition of corporal punishment in schools. On the other hand, the opposing argument contradicts itself. How can you refute that the abolition of corporal punishment has not led to an increase in crime because of varying factors when the case that you cite to support your argument is so biased and overlooks a large number of factors- such as poverty, drop outs, consistent use of paddling, perceived fairness of paddling, credible or qualified teachers, etc. How can you realistically argue against a corporal punishment that has successfully been used for thousands of years in home and without to discipline children? It's worked for all this time and managed to create fairly decent, responsible human beings without traumatizing them. Pro-Spanking Research: A study published in the Akron Law Review in 2009 examined criminal records and found that children raised where a legal ban on parental corporal punishment is in effect are much more likely to be involved in crime. For example, in Sweden \u201cenlightened\u201d parenting seems to have produced increased violence later. \u201cSwedish teen violence skyrocketed in the early 1990s, when children that had grown up entirely under the spanking ban first became teenagers,\u201d Fuller noted. \u201cPreadolescents and teenagers under fifteen started becoming even more violent toward their peers. By 1994, the number of youth criminal assaults had increased by six times the 1984 rate.\u201d ... Margaret Gunnoe in 1997 published work showing that customary spanking reduced aggression, but it went largely unnoticed by the media because it contradicted mainstream opinion. Of course, we all know that aggression is often the main culprit in violent crime. ... Dr. Diana Baumrind of the University of California, Berkeley also found that children who were never spanked tended to have behavioral problems, and were not more competent than their peers. This supports the view that banning spanking would lead to an increase in crime. http://www.newsmax.com/US/spanking-studies-children-spock/2010/01/07/id/345669",

            "premise": "Contention I: My opponent claims that rape, kidnapping, and attempted terrorism do not cause death, and thus does not deserve a death sentence. However, this form of \"an eye for an eye\" judicial system does not hold up because of the intangible psychological effect involved. The main purpose of the mentioned crimes are to inspire FEAR in the victim, and this intangible (and yes, perhaps subjective) effect of the mentioned crimes must be taken into account. Which leads to the next point, proportional response. If current laws allow the death sentence for rape and attempted terrorism and life, then my opponents arguments are clearly not inherent. Secondly, my opponent's arguments contradict themselves.He first says against my arguments for the death of rapists, kidnappers, terrorists: \"1. No crime listed above results in death. The 3 I list are implied that it did not result in another crime, i.e. murder. Therefore, the death penalty would be too extreme of a punishment.\" However, He later says \"Proportionality is not legal equivalence\", taken in this viewpoint (and later on against my point of \"an eye for an eye\"). If proportionality is not legal equivalence, then why am I wrong in advocating the death penalty for these criminals? If you do not demand \"an eye for an eye\", why can we not go above and account for intangible costs and deal them the death penalty? The death penalty is the greatest punishment that we can deal out, and in the cases of the despicable acts of rape, kidnapping, and attempted terrorism, the death penalty is justified (and has already been embraced by societies around the world) Contention II: The CIA factbook does not account for other confounding variables. Simply stating a statistic without a scientific study can only be fallacious. As I have advocated, there may be NUMEROUS other reasons of why the crime rate is lower, all of which undermine my opponents argument. I'll even go farther and state that my opponent's statistic means NOTHING, due to the number of confounding variables and being an observational study rather than experiment (and for anyone who has designed experiments, one cannot draw cause and effect conclusions from an observational study) My opponent still has not provided a study that says corporal punishment is indeed inherently a effective deterrent for crime. Contention III: \"The key word is construed. Essentially, it is an opinion. Since the harshness of a punishment is subjective, we must look at Beccaria's proportionality part of the 8th Amendment. Link ym contention 1 to this\" Precisely, how is corporal punishment (i.e flogging, whipping ect) not harsh? Can we claim that it is the actually PLEASANT to be whipped and flogged? I think not. It is clearly intuitive that there is at least some harshness to the whipping or flogging of criminals. My opponent's link actually undermines his point, if the criminals' punishments do not have to \"an eye for an eye\" but merely proportional, can it not be that the death penalty should be used against them? As to my citations for the prison guard beatings, is it not PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT with the intention of PUNISHMENT/RETRIBUTION? So what exactly distinguishes from the corporal punishment except it is not carried out in a regulated place. The use of physical violence in this case is clearly forbidden, and thus should be used as a precedent against the use of PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT (aka corporal punishment). Let's assume that the beatings may not have been proportional, does that mean the precedent is suddenly null and void against punishments that are proportional? Clearly not, too many characteristics are shared by this case and what you're advocating to discount this. Contention IV: My opponent actually undermines his points here, he claims that \"would have less sentences with corporal punishment if it warrant. Obviously, we would not let a mass-killer out of jail.\" But is not my opponent argument precisely that the mass-killers and all the perhaps mentally unstable and dangerous people in society should be given corporal punishment in order to reduce prison sentences? I think it is intuitively clear that the label of a rapist, kidnapper or terrorist fits in the same category as a mass murderer. It is clear by such lists such as sex offenders and convicted rapists on the internet that society has a legitimate reason to exclude certain criminals. Furthermore, my opponent claims that it will serve as better deterrence; however, my opponent has not provided concrete proof of it (CITED STUDY FROM A SCIENCE JOURNAL). Since my opponent has the burden of proof, his warrentless assertion must be discounted. Secondly, is not life sentence and the death sentence(which exists for the crime my opponent has mentioned) not a good enough deterrent? Would you propose that we punsish them even though they are going to be in life for jail? Is this not cruel punishment? If we wanted a deterrent against such crimes, we could just expand the death penalty to include more of the crimes my opponent has mentioned, serving the deterrence purpose. Even more so, it would cut down on economic costs, since the cost of killing someone is still (assuming that we can make it quicker than today's process) is alot less than upkeep. MY POINTS: My point is not that society should not punish, we should not use anachronistic methods of inflicting intense PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT in order to remedy crime. As a highly developed civilization, our morals dictate that we use the most reasonable and painless methods of punishment while retaining deterrence and other consequences of punishment at an acceptable level. The infliction of pain undermines the moralistic foundations of a society. If my government is actively beating people, what's to stop them from torturing us later? Perhaps we are restricting rights when we send criminals to jail, but we're violating not only their HUMAN RIGHT (as opposed to civil right) and SOCIETY'S ACCEPTED MORALS in order to deal punishment to those who might otherwise not need them. We need to restrict civil liberties of people in jail because their actions have justified that, but we have no right to invade human rights. Secondly, we're going down a slippery slope of government violating our civil liberties. If the government can actively use physical punishment against criminals, what's to stop it from abusing this power or spreading it for the general populace? NOTHING. If we do allow corporal punishment, the fundamental civil liberties guaranteed to us by the bill of rights will be severely compromised. Thirdly, my opponent claims that corporal punishment would show proportionality. Why is it that the current system does not accurately serve PROPORTIONALITY, apart from the very subjective argument that the crimes do not fit the punishment? The definition you provided for proportionaltiy could very well include the death penalty under its wings, making any discussion moot. In conclusion, the existence of the death sentence and varying prison terms already remedy what my opponent has described as necessary reasons for corporal punishment. Not only do the current methods serve the purposes of punishment better, they're also on a higher moralistic plane. If my opponent wants to deter criminals from committing crimes, the death penalty is already there. If my opponent wants varying degrees of punishment, there are varying sentence lengths and different security level prisons. My point is that my opponent's arguments are essentially flawed because they are not INHERENT. Corporal punishment is by no means the only solution to providing proportional punishment. Last but not least, my opponent has not offered a single CLEAR and IRREFUTABLE piece of evidence for the existence of corporal punishment, as most his arguments are based on conjecture with no studies or citations.",

            "premise": "Many thanks to my opponent for engaging in this debate. Corporal punishment is the infliction of physical pain upon a person\u2019s body as punishment for a crime or infraction. Corporal punishments include flogging, beating, branding, mutilation, blinding, and the use of the stock and pillory [1].Pro begins the debate by stating corporal punishment is an effective crime deterrent. According to Pro, the threat of physical harm will prevent people from bad behavior. He says the impact of physical harm is immediate, whereas criminal records are intangible and imprisonment is not an effective crime deterrent.First, we should examine whether or not physical pain is an effective crime deterrent for serious offenders. Pro must submit empirical research to prove his case; the same goes for me. I'll begin by citing one study and include more if need-be. In 1937, the Cadogan Committee in Great Britain conducted a study to review the application of corporal punishment. The results proved that corporal punishment did not deter crime and was thus ineffective. As a result, the committee's recommendation was that corporal punishment be abandoned as a judicial penalty [2].Pro says the effects of having a criminal record are \"intangible\" or otherwise ambiguous / ineffective. On the contrary, a criminal record is incredibly problematic and can ruin a person's life. It can impact immigration status, voting rights, child custody agreements, employment, driving and other privileges [3]. If we are to accept that deterrence is one important aspect of the criminal justice system, we must consider that short-term punishment is not a good incentive for good behavior. On the other hand, a criminal record provides harsher consequences and would therefore (theoretically) be a stronger deterrent. The same goes for imprisonment which can last for years, vs. physical harm which would arguably be over within minutes. Consider the fact that crime was still widespread even when corporal punishment was more common. If corporal punishment was an effective deterrent, crime would not have been so rampant when it was utilized. Instead crime rates were not lower back when corporal punishment was implemented. That's because the causes of crime most often include poverty, parental neglect, low self-esteem, drug abuse, mental illness and gang affiliation. Would getting whipped or caned address the root problem of any of these issues? The answer is no. Throughout this debate, my opponent refers to corporal punishment in Singapore which is not inherently relevant to this discussion. Nevertheless, Pro says that corporal punishment should only be reserved for serious offenses, such as rape, robbery and illegal immigration. However the imposition of corporal punishment has never been fair or reasonable throughout history. Consider the fact that Pro says corporal punishment should not be applied to women or men over 50. Why should we believe that corporal punishment is only a good deterrent for men and not women? That does not make any sense, and it's hardly fair. In fact corporal punishment is/was almost never fair. In the past, the poor were likely to receive corporal punishment whereas the rich were not [4]. Even today we see the rich or elite class get away with certain punishments. Therefore we can assume the application of corporal punishment, even by Pro's proposed standards, would be problematic and unfair. In medieval times, victims were tortured for not believing the dominant faith of the country they lived in. They were whipped, deprived of food and disgraced all for the small crime of simply not believing in what the other person thought was right [4]. Considering even frivolous offenses are punished as legal crimes today, i.e. smoking pot, we can also assume people will still be physically harmed for minor infractions in addition to allegedly serious offenses. Every test done studying corporal punishment on children found some level of emotional problems, developmental problems and behavioral problems for subjects as both children and adults [5]. While one's brain develops during adolescence, it would be naive to assume one's experience and trauma of physical suffering would not affect them later on in life. Indeed, studies show that anger and subsequently violence are often a large part of a survivor's response to trauma involving physical pain and punishment [6]. Therefore, forcing criminals to undergo this type of traumatic treatment might increase their likelihood for violent crime in the future, even for adult criminals.While there is no objective standard of justice, Pro has not submitted why physical violence is a reasonable standard. The United Nations Human Rights Committee and other organizations have suggested that the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment under Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights could be extended by customary law to include corporal punishment [2]. Similarly Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights declares that \"no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" [2]. As our society evolved, we have found that other methods prove superior punishments than corporal punishment. As such we are striving for a more humanitarian way of life. Justice is about rehabilitating criminals to prevent future crime. But nothing about temporary physical pain addresses the problems that cause prime and repeat crime.

If the majority of administered corporal punishment was done incorrectly then the history of child protective services would be a whole lot more radical. Corporal punishment has been used by a majority of households and education centers for thousands of years until very recently. There will always be those who abuse the system, but that does not mean the system does not work.
