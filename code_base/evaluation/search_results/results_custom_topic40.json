According to statistics, in Illinois, there are about 20 wrong convictions a year. Would we really want to allow death penalty and allow innocent deaths? There is a Korean movie called \"Miracle in Cell no.7\" It is about a man who has a mental disability and is wrongly convicted of raping and murder. At the end, he gets executed because he wasn\"t able to tell the truth about his innocence. Do we really want innocent deaths? By allowing death penalty, we are allowing all the people who are wrongly convicted of crimes to die an innocent death? Should that be justified? The obvious answer is a no. Because I strongly oppose to the justification of innocent executions, I would like to prevent the allowing of death penalty.",

            "premise": "Pro has not responded to any of my arguments. This is a debate, and debates entail an exchange, not talking past each other and ignoring the other side.Now, on to the mesh of one sentence arguments...the American jail is not as hard as should be on certain prisoners for what they have done. 1) This is irrelevant. If jails should be harder, it only follows that the jails should change, not that the death penalty should be allowed. 2) Why are jails not hard enough? Please provide support. I think that if you have the guts to go up and have the nerve to kill someone then you definitely don't deserve to still be living and breathing on this earth its just not right1) I developed a lengthy argument last round which addressed the moral responsibility of individuals and the unjust nature of the death penalty. I invite Pro to read it.2) Pro only appeals to emotion. She doesn't make an argument. you need to learn from your mistakesUnfortunately, you'll find that when you try to use capital punishment to educate someone, their capacity to remember what they learned is greatly impared. it will also teach others to learn from what you have done and be warned that if you decide to take this path in your life there will be serious consequences like the death penalty Deterence is a contentious issue, so Pro cannot make an argument for it without providing outside research. In 2008, a survey was conducted on members of the prestigious Fellow in the American Society of Criminology. 88.2% of the experts do not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent. 74.7% say that research refutes the claim that death-penalty states have lower homicide rates than neighboring states without the death-penalty. In fact, death-penalty states had 42% higher homicide rates than non-death penalty states in 2007. [1] Also, in a 1995 national survey, two-thirds of nearly 400 police chiefs and county sheriffs responded that they did not believe the death penalty significantly lowered the number of murders [1]. \u201cOverall, it is clear that however measured, fewer than 10% of the polled experts believe the deterrence effect of the death penalty is stronger than that of long-term imprisonment\u201d[1] A study was conducted a few years ago by the prestigious National Research Council of the National Academies [2]. The study covered over three decades of research and concluded that there were three fundamental flaws in current studies on deterrence: 1. \u201cThe studies do not factor in the effects of noncapital punishments that may also be imposed. 2. The studies use incomplete or implausible models of potential murderers\u2019 perceptions of and response to the use of capital punishment. 3. Estimates of the effect of capital punishment are based on statistical models that make assumptions that are not credible.\u201d The conclusion of the study was that research is not informative about the effect of capital punishment on homicide rates and, therefore, should not be used to inform policy judgements. There have been a vast amount of studies regarding capital punishment and deterrence such as the 10 mentioned between 2004 and 2012 here [3]. The only thing we can gather from all these studies is that the effect of capital punishment on homicide rates can\u2019t be established, as the mentioned article concludes. There are, however, reasons why the death penalty might have very little deterrence or no deterrence at all. The first reason is the consensus of experts against deterrence. The second is presented below. For the death penalty to deter, criminals need to actively weigh the thought of execution to their potential crime. This is problematic; one, because executions happen so little in America and are applied so arbitrary that no one would believe they had much chance of receiving the death penalty. Also, murders are largely committed in the heat of passion, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or because they are mentally ill--little thought is given to the possible consequences. Those murderers in the minority, who plan the crime in advance, are counting on not being caught; they expect to avoid punishment altogether.[4]or harsher and stricter jails This debate has nothing to do with the debate.People need to take the blame for what they have clearly done and its not right to kill and innocent person and still live and eat and live your life when them and their families have to suffer for what you have done Correction: Live and eat and spend the rest of your life in prison. No one contends that murderers should recieve punishment. Pro has simply given no rational argument for why it warrants the death penalty. I've already given many reasons why the death penalt is unjust. Pro can't address any of my arguments nor even give one of her own.i don't know if you've noticed but your justice system has more sympathy for our criminals than our victims No, I haven't.Another good reason to have the death penalty is because when a prisoner's parole or escape can give the criminals another opportunity to kill another person again. The only way to stop recidivism is to execute every murderer, which no person wants, or life without parole, which is an alternative to the death penalty.Also have you noticed with all these prisoners here and known of them getting killed its taking up space and that's not realty safe.Seriously... The answer to our prison population IS NOT TO JUST START KILLING PEOPLE. And finally something we all have to pay attention almost everyday is our taxes did you know that we are paying to keep our criminals stuck in that jail place when it could be going to something a lot more useful that could actually help and benefit us.Pro obviously did not even attempt to read my case.Sources: [1] http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu...

Yes I would would want to get the death penalty because I would deserve it and I wouldn't live with myself These are reasons that the death penalty should be allowed 1).The death penalty was first instituted by God Himself in Genesis 9:6: \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.\" Man didn't invent the death penalty, so man has no right to abandon it. We live in an age when everyone is far too concerned with \"human rights\", and God has been practically ignored, as if He had no rights at all. Killers are to be killed, and God's will has not been fulfilled until our governing bodies have executed wrath upon those who have killed others. 2).God has actually promised to bless us if we follow His plan of using the death penalty? Notice Deuteronomy 19:11-13. The death Penalty also brings closure for the people who got seriously injured or loved ones who got killed, their families will get closure. \"Many in the survivor community feel like the death penalty offers a sense of justice being done. And that's what his sentence felt like to me. I hope it also brings closure to those who lost loved ones that day. There are, of course, many in the survivor community who feel that he should spend his life in prison and sit in a cell and think about what he did. I don't speak for everybody\". Anyways, it also stops from the person from committing another murder/crime. And they deserve what they get and it pleases the Lord. Thanks for debating me:)",

            "discussionTitle": "The death penalty should NOT be allowed",
            "conclusion": "The death penalty should NOT be allowed",
            "premise": "1. Self-Responsibility upon the Individual: Whose fault is it for doing the crime? The criminal for doing the action of causing a threat towards society. He or she is the one responsible for their own actions, and should suffer the consequences. My opponent could argue about the potential mistakes about the Death Penalty, but stated under \"US death row study: 4% of defendants sentenced to die are innocent\", it states that only 4.1% of defendants, that are executed, are actually innocent. That is, in fact, a small percentage compared to the prison population in the US. And, I admit, that it is sad that a \"mistake\" happens with the killing of an innocent individual, but why was that individual in prison in the first place? Following the argument of self-responsibility, it was his or her mistake to be in prison in the first place; otherwise their death would not come.2. Deters Crime: This is a common argument used on both sides of whether or not the Death Penalty does or doesn't deter crime, but I will prove that it does deter crime within society. Supported evidence, from the article titled: \"The Death Penalty Deters Crime and Saves Lives\", it says: \"Criminals are no different from law-abiding people. Criminals rationally maximize their own self-interest (utility) subject to constraints (prices, incomes) that they face in the marketplace and elsewhere. Individuals make their decisions based on the net costs and benefits of each alternative. Thus, deterrence theory provides a basis for analyzing how capital punishment should influence murder rates. Over the years, several studies have demonstrated a link between executions and decreases in murder rates. In fact, studies done in recent years, using sophisticated panel data methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder incidents\". To even further support the given evidence, state under another article titled: \"Do more executions mean fewer murders\", it states that each execution would help prevent at least 18 murders of innocent civilians. And also claims that the reason why it seems like the idea does not deter crime is because of how slow the executions take to get into effect. The article claims that if one murderer is executed instantly, it would prevent at least 1 murder of any civilian. So technically, the Death Penalty does deter crime; but the issue is how long it takes for the Death Penalty to take effect. In reality, the Death Penalty should be an instant action, instead of a long drawn out session when the final decision was made.3. Economically Beneficial: For this argument, let me please review the costs of the methods used within the Death Penalty. The cost for a Lethal Injection, stated under \"Methods of Execution\", is about $86.06. That is much cheaper than the most common method of the Electric Chair, which runs about $265,000. And as we know, technology is advancing within our society; and other methods for killing are being introduced. One example is that in a recent article from Ohio, a state that approves the Death Penalty, they are inventing new methods for it. The given example is the \"Robotic Arm\", where it decapitates the Criminal quickly and pain free. It also plays calming music so the Criminal is not suffering as much as compared with other methods. The pricing for the Robotic Arm would be expensive, but would be a one time buy. Some changes in machinery would be needed, but that is actually more economically beneficial than the other methods presented. As well as if we look at the costs, while a criminal is on Death Row, it shows that it is the result of costing more money, than actually saving money. Stated under \"Costs of the Death Penalty\", it states that the reason why people claim the Death Penalty is expensive is because of how long the execution takes. The prices, for trials and such, reach up to about 1 billion dollars. That is a lot, just to prove the \"innocence\" of a murderer!4. The Bible Agrees with the Death Penalty: Stated under both the Old Testament and New, God agrees that the Death Penalty should be used as punishment for ones crimes. From Genesis 9:6, \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\". This quote is simply referring to how many people put a focus more on human rights, than God himself; or if we do not want to get into a Religious argument, the consequence for a criminals action. Self responsibilty, or an \"Eye for an eye\". And to even further this argument, from Revelation 13:10, \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints\". Which simply means that if we have it, we should use it to bring justice amongst society.5. The Death Penalty Brings Justice: for this argument, I wish to present the definition of \"justice\". Justice is defined as:\"Just behavior or treatment\". Basicvally, bringing a balance a good feeling towards society. The Death Penalty fulfills this burden by murdering the person, for taking another innocent civilians life. Stated under \"A Just Society Requires the Death Penalty for the Taking of Another Life\", it says: \"When someone takes a life, the balance of justice is disturbed. Unless that balance is restored, society succumbs to a rule of violence. Only the taking of the murderer's life restores the balance and allows society to show convincingly that murder is an intolerable crime which will be punished in kind\". Simple enough concept, but many argue about human rights,insteadof arguing about the fact of a criminal taking accountability for his or her own actions. 6. Promotes a Better Environment in Prisons: Imagine the feeling of being a prison guard, going through the cells and possibly being murdered. It is a scary feeling, and as a society, we need to bring safety to the guards environment. How? By the usage of the Death Penalty, which eliminates all the threats of murders within the prison. Quoted from the New York Times article \"The Death Penalty can Create a Better Prison Environment\", it says: \"Surely the men and women who guard our prisons deserve society's respect, support and protection. The death penalty for certain crimes inside of prisons is one way of protecting them from being murdered on the job. The sooner we give them this, the sooner their ranks will grow to include more compassionate, better educated people truly able to reform the system at all levels\". Are we at the point of neglecting the safety of the innocent, to the criminals because of the Death Penalty being horrid? The Death Penalty would prevent the possible murders within the prisons environment. Under the document \"Mortality in Local Jails and State Prisons, 2000\u20132012 - Statistical Tables\", it states that in 2012 we had an 8% increase in murders within prisons, and is increasing as the years pass by. And most of these murders have occured within inmates who are on Death Row, and Mentally Ill Inmates. The percentage totaling up to 67%, which is a lot for an inmate about to get the Death Penalty. So once more, instead of taking the time to commence the Death Penalty; just do it when it is sentenced.7. Prevents Overpopulation within Prisons: Statedunder the article, \"The United States Has The Largest Prison Population In The World \" And It\"s Growing\", it states that within our country 1.57 million inmates are occupying any sort of cell. The most common crime, taken in 2013, involve physical harm. Stated under \"Criminal Victimization\", the highest number of crimes involve mostly any physical harm to the victim. Examples being rape, assault, or even murder; and the scary part is that at least 1/3 of the inmates are involved in this sort of crime. This is a high number for prisoners and needs to be reduced, hence the reasoning of why the Death Penalty should be used. The Death Penalty will lower the overpopulation of inmates, and actually have room for inmates that deserve to be in prison for drug abuse, and or other charges. As well as protect the more \"innocent\" of the inmates from the aggression of these violent criminals actions or influence. And also bring along more protection for the public. with the Death Penalty, we can lower the numbers of prison population!Given the arguments, we can see that the Death Penalty has its benefits towards our society.Sources: htp://www.biblebelievers.com...http://www.theguardian.com...http://www.washingtonpost.com...http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org...http://www.nytimes.com.../www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mljsp0012st.pdfhttp://www.bjs.gov...http://thinkprogress.org...http://www.heritage.org...http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu...http://www.vice.com...http://www.theonion.com...http://www.seattletimes.com...",

            "conclusion": "The death penalty should NOT be allowed",
            "premise": "For this round, and final round, I will rebuttal against my opponents arguments for the Death Penalty. I will do this by going in order from 1-10 for the arguments.1. Too Many Inocent People: In the previous argument, I brought up the fact of how the chances of a \"mistake\" is at a low. My opponent argues about killing an innocent individual for a crime that he or she has not done. I will admit its sad if something happens like this, but I must ask whose fault is it to me in jail in the first place? The criminal him or herself, which falls under my argument of \"self responsibility\". They made the decision to do the crime in the first place, so they should suffer the consequences. For mistakes that happen, it can happen any where. Take this for example, you are walking down the street and a driver hits you by mistake because of sneezing for one second. Its a mistake that took someones life, but does that mean we should ban drivers because of someone possibly getting killed by mistake? No, that would be idiotic; and it is the same scenario as the Death Penalty. Mistakes happen, but we move along in society. And my evidence still stands strong where the mistake is only 4%, stated under \"US death row study: 4% of defendants sentenced to die are innocent\". And my opponent even agrees that the number is low with the given quote \"The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences online on Apr. 28, 2014, estimated that 4.1% of death row sentences (1 in 25) were wrongful\".2. There is Racial and Economic Discrimination in Application of the Death Penalty: This is a common form of argument to use within the given topic. People can argue that it is \"racist\" for the Death Penalty, but I will prove otherwise. The evidence my opponent revealed is actually very ludicrous because of the high numbers, one number being 99% which is factually impossible, and not being able to find the evidence given my opponents sources. I, on the other hand, will provide evidence to prove that the Death Penalty is not racist or discriminatory. To prove that it isn't racially bias, given the link here: http://deathpenalty.org... is seen that 56.6% of whites were executed with the Death Penalty, than a combination of Latino's or Black's. That is very different, then my opponents \"ludicros\" number that he or she presented.3. It may be true that the Death Penalty can give publicity, but what is wrong with that? Stated under \"Media Influence in Capital Pumishment\", it states that the showing of the Death Penalty actually puts more fear into people, than encouragement. The Death Penalty helps show what not to do in society, and actually was said to \"cure\" up to 67% of people from commiting crimes. The highest being murder, so this disproves my opponents point. And so what if it is gettiong publicly noticed, people see the horrors of what can come if they do not become responsible with themselves.4. Because of time, i will quickly rush through these. Medical Doctors actually choose if they do or do not want to put the Death to someone. Stated under the Death Penalty website itself.5. Once more, self responsibility. If you don't want to get in trouble, than don't do it; and it is not hypocritical when someone takes the life of an innocent individual. Follow the saying \"An eye for an eye\".6. This is debatable about government havin too much power, but that is not the main focus on the Death Penalty. Just do not do the crime, once more!7. We both provided evidence about the Death Penalty being in the Bible. Some lines for, and others against. This can be a clash of evidence, but we would not get anywhere if we keep talking about the Bible for, or against, the Death Penalty.8. And there is another better alternative, don't do the crime!9. The cost for the Death Penalty is actually cheaper, the reason why it costs a lot is because of the pricing for trials. I brought this argument in the previous round, where we spend about a billion dollars a year for an ongoing \"goose chase\".10. Mentally ill people have a small chance of happening within prisons.Also to conclude the argument, my opponent neglects my argument about making the Death Row instant; and resolving mot of the issues witrh the Death Penalty.Sources (All): http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... http://www.capitalpunishmentincontext.org... htp://www.biblebelievers.com......http://www.theguardian.com......http://www.washingtonpost.com......http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org......http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org......http://www.nytimes.com....../www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mljsp0012st.pdfhttp://www.bjs.gov......http://thinkprogress.org......http://www.heritage.org......http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu......http://www.vice.com......http://www.theonion.com......http://www.seattletimes.com......",

Too many innocent people: \"The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences online on Apr. 28, 2014, estimated that 4.1% of death row sentences (1 in 25) were wrongful, a \"conservative estimate\u201d according to the authors and twice the number of death row cases that were actually overturned.\"This means that a large number of people in the long run are going to be killed wrongly - and think of all the people we wrongly killed in the past. What happens when the mistake is discovered after a man has been executed for a crime he did not commit? What do we say to his children? Do we erect an apologetic tombstone over his grave? What good will that do?2. There is racial and economic discrimination in application of the death penalty: \"About 99 percent of the death-row inmates are men. Of the 1,058 prisoners on death row by Aug. 20,1982, 42 percent were black, whereas about 12 percent of the United States population is black. Those who receive the death penalty still tend to be poor, poorly educated and represented by public defenders or court-appointed lawyers.\" This is a racist and sexist act that happens to frequently to be allowed.3. The death penalty gives some of the worst offenders publicity that they do not deserve: \"While the death penalty undoubtedly deters some would-be murderers, there is evidence that it encourages others\u2014 especially the unstable who are attracted to media immortality like moths to a flame. If instead of facing heady weeks before television cameras, they faced a lifetime of obscurity in prison, the path of violence might seem less glamorous to them.\" This gives the people who least deserve publicity, publicity that they earned by commiting a crime. What kind of message does that send to our country?4. The death penalty involves medical doctors, who are sworn to preserve life, in the act of killing: In 1980 the American Medical Association, responding to this innovation, declared that a doctor should not participate in an execution - it is AGAINST A DOCTORS' OATH. When doctors use their stethoscopes to indicate whether the electric chair has done its job, they are assisting the executioner - dosen't this go against everythign what being a doctor is about? Saving lifes?5. It is hipocritical: Why are we killing people for killing people? Why are we doing the same thing we are punishing others for doing? That is obsurd.6. The death penalty is an expression of the absolute power of the state; abolition of that penalty is a much- needed limit on government power: \"What makes the state so pure that it has the right to take life? Look at the record of governments throughout history\u2014so often operating with deception, cruelty and greed, so often becoming masters of the citizens they are supposed to serve. \"Forbidding a man's execution,\" Camus said, \"would amount to proclaiming publicly that society and the state are not absolute values.\" It would amount to saying that there are some things even the state may not do.\" We are always complaning how the states are given too much power - why should they have control over killing people also?7. There are strong religious reasons for many to oppose the death penalty: \"Mr. Viguerie wrote in a recent book, \"that Christ would oppose the killing of a human being as punishment for a crime.\" This view is supported by the New Testament story about the woman who faced execution by stoning (John 8:7, \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone\"). Former Senator Harold Hughes (D., Iowa), arguing against the death penalty in 1974, declared: \"'Thou shalt not kill' is the shortest of the Ten Commandments, uncomplicated by qualification or exception....It is as clear and awesomely commanding as the powerful thrust of chain lightning out of a dark summer sky.\" Even preists and strong religious figures are against it for clear reasons - why should we effect religions for others' wrong doing?8. There is a better alternative - life without parole: This sentence would make the criminals suffer every single day and be forced to think about what they have done. It is a more harsh sentence because they can not escape the negativity they created - they have to live with it each and every long, boring day. Killing the criminals is an easy way out for them - they will just think; \"oh, if I kill people who I hate, then I will die and not have to deal with it.\" Wouldn't that encourage more criminals to act? This would make crime rates increase.9. We pay many millions for the death penalty system: \"In 1995 the trials for three Washington County murder cases cost more than $1.5 million. One was sentenced to death. The two others, one of whom was found guilty of four murders, are not on death row. In 2000 a fiscal impact summary from the Oregon Department of Administrative Services stated that the Oregon Judicial Department alone would save $2.3 million annually if the death penalty were eliminated. It is estimated that total prosecution and defense costs to the state and counties equal $9 million per year.\" It costs much more to execute people then to provide for basic needs of life - why do we need to pay more money for people who did bad things?

Over all, when you compare all states without the death penalty, and those with it, those without the death penalty, on average, have a lower murder rate. There of course can be exceptions to this rule, such as Texas. Next my opponent used an article from daily signal. As you can read about here[10], they are known to have a strong right wing bias as well as having a \"mixed\" reporting record. Meaning, that some of the things they report on are simply not even true. Given that the article doesn't even cite the study they claim that they got the information from, it is very suspect.I thank my opponent for this debate, and wish them luck in future debates. To conclude, I believe that the reasons I mentioned above, how there can be innocent people who are given the death penalty, how the death penalty is more expensive(as my opponent conceded) and that life in prison without parole seems to be a better deterrent to murder than the death penalty, I believe it makes sense not to allow the death penalty.

So you said , \"The absence of death penalty is synonymous to crime rate increase Again, this is something that needs facts to support it. While in the next sentence you do provide facts, it doesn't support the idea that without the death penalty, there would be less crime. It merely talked about the crime rate over all. It doesn't show, for example, that crime is low or high because of the death penalty. In fact, statistics seem to suggest the opposite. States that don't have the death penalty have fewer murders occur in them than states with the death penalty[7]. Now, I admit that this doesn't suggest that the reason for the murder rate being lower is because of the death penalty. Correlation doesn't equal causation. For example, there could be other reasons why the states without the death penalty had lower rates of murder. Perhaps it is actually the other way around: maybe they chose to have the death penalty removed because they had such a low murder rate and saw it as unnecessary. Or perhaps there is some other cause of the murders being lower. Who knows? Nonetheless, a logical conclusion that can be made from the evidence is that life in prison without parole might seem to be a worse punishment than death. I mean, life in prison might actually be a worse punishment. Who wants to spend the rest of their life in prison? You'd probably want to commit suicide if you were sentenced to that, so death would be a relief. Now, that is a logical conclusion, what you offered is not a logical conclusion because you offered no data that showed correlation between the death penalty and amount of crime.\" Death penalty does lower crime rates and here is a quote. \" A more recent study by Kenneth Land of Duke University and others concluded that, from 1994 through 2005, each execution in Texas was associated with \"modest, short-term reductions\" in homicides, a decrease of up to 2.5 murders. And in 2009, researchers found that adopting state laws allowing defendants in child murder cases to be eligible for the death penalty was associated with an almost 20 percent reduction in rates of these crimes.\"(http://dailysignal.com...) This shows that it did in fact decrease and almost 20 percent reduction of crime rates. Yes lying is bad but the death penalty is a bigger issue than your personal life. Yes I must agree that it does cost more to use the death penalty than to hold them in prison . That's all I have to say for this round.",

            "premise": "First I would like to apologies for forfeiting one of the rounds. It was out of my hands. So let me start. Let us first picture a world without death penalty. Well, I see crime rates as high as ever, murders increasing everyday and innocent people not getting their rights back. Chaos roams the streets and people committing crimes to get money and in their heads they know that the worst that can happen to them is prison. For some prison might even be a relief compared to their living standards. So abolishing death penalty only encourages people to break the law and murder more innocent people. More gangs would form and assassinations increase because of the lower punishment received. Right now, some countries that have death penalty are very fragile. The only line between chaos and peace is death penalty. Some might say the cost of killing a criminal is not worth it. Well let me tell you one thing, is the cost of safety not worth it? Would you rather have a peaceful community and pay some extra taxes or would you rather pay less tax and live in a dangerous environment. One of the issues of death penalty is making a mistake in the trails. No system of justice can produce results which are 100% certain all the time. Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof. We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes. Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases. However, the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small, and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976. Therefore I believe that all the points provided by my opponent are weak and are not strong enough to outweigh the advantages to death penalty.",

The tax dollar statement meant exactly what I said; I have no problem with it. I am not saying everyone feels the same way, but the way you emphasizes on the word you're, meaning that you were talking to me specifically. By making this claim my opponent has volunteered to prove that all other nations and all other judicial systems are proof against error. In other words, he must now prove that no other nation, besides the US, cans wrongly convict a person of a crime. Since some of the other nations that allow the death penalty include Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia, it is safe to assume that errors have been made by other nations. Since he can not prove errors do not happen, my contention stands. If other nations are capable of making the same errors, then the same argument applies- innocent people are convicted and may be put to death, making the death penalty immoral. http://en.wikipedia.org... I have seen no websites saying that people would not rather be dead than miserable. The death penalty (LOL, not penilty LOL) costs more money than keeping the people alive. ~~~~Question for my opponent~~~~ Have you heard of the case where the guy Ted Bundy I believe, killed several people, and robbed banks, then asked a woman which state enforces the death penalty the strongest, she replied Florida, so he went there did the same thing, and pleaded guilty? That is proof that some people would rather be put to death than anything else. Also here is the definition of murder: http://www.merriam-webster.com... it looks like the definition would be \"to kill\" by looking at the top part, but it is \"Unlawful killing; especially by malice or force\" Why unlawful? Why should it be lawful to kill? If a man rapes your wife, should you be allowed to shoot him? If yes, won't the law go after you as well, if you were not on your property at the time? If no, then you have conceded that I am right, and the death penalty is an unjust punishment. Here is the definition of death: http://www.medterms.com... http://www.thefreedictionary.com... The definition of penalty: http://www.thefreedictionary.com... http://www.investorwords.com... Thus death penalty: http://www.answers.com... It makes since, but why if it is wrong for one person to kill, is it right for another, hence executioner: http://www.google.com...:*:IE-SearchBox&rlz=1I7GFRC&defl=en&q=define:executioner&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title Since one is not allowed to kill, then why should another? That is the question you should ask yourselves, as voters. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

            "premise": "I'll offer rebuttals to my opponent again: I will quote parts of their argument at times, which will be italicized, and then if the part I want to rebut is too lengthy, I'll just summarize it in bold.Now, I notice my opponent offered potential arguments that opponents of the death penalty would have in the first half of this round, and I see no need to rebut them, as they didn't really rebut them themselves. So, I will move onto the points that support the death penalty that my opponent offered. Death penalty costs the government less as opposed to life imprisonment without parole.This is a claim that needs evidence back it up. I claimed the exact opposite above, and offered a source. Here are two more sources that show the death penalty is actually more expensive than life in prison without parole[5][6]The absence of death penalty is synonymous to crime rate increaseAgain, this is something that needs facts to support it. While in the next sentence you do provide facts, it doesn't support the idea that without the death penalty, there would be less crime. It merely talked about the crime rate over all. It doesn't show, for example, that crime is low or high because of the death penalty. In fact, statistics seem to suggest the opposite. States that don't have the death penalty have fewer murders occur in them than states with the death penalty[7]. Now, I admit that this doesn't suggest that the reason for the murder rate being lower is because of the death penalty. Correlation doesn't equal causation. For example, there could be other reasons why the states without the death penalty had lower rates of murder. Perhaps it is actually the other way around: maybe they chose to have the death penalty removed because they had such a low murder rate and saw it as unnecessary. Or perhaps there is some other cause of the murders being lower. Who knows? Nonetheless, a logical conclusion that can be made from the evidence is that life in prison without parole might seem to be a worse punishment than death. I mean, life in prison might actually be a worse punishment. Who wants to spend the rest of their life in prison? You'd probably want to commit suicide if you were sentenced to that, so death would be a relief. Now, that is a logical conclusion, what you offered is not a logical conclusion because you offered no data that showed correlation between the death penalty and amount of crime.It is constitutional and does not violate the Eight Amendment which prohibits the federal government from imposing excessive bail, fines and cruel and unusual punishments, including torture.This appears to be a non sequitur. which is when the conclusion doesn't follow the premise. You can read about it here and determine for yourself if it was a non sequitur[8]. The reason this is a non-sequitur is because my opponent is using this as a reason for the death penalty, but it doesn't seem to support why the death penalty should be done. Just because something is legal, doesn't mean you should do it. Lying is also legal, but should you lie to your loved ones? Actually, thinking about it, this might be more of a circular reasoning. We're more or less saying whether the death penalty should be allowed(legal) and my opponent brout up the fact that it is legal as reason for why it should be legal. That's circular reasoning. Again, you can read about it here and determine for yourself if this is circular reasoning[9]. This might actually be considered both fallacies.Re: death penalty is justice because you're killing someone who killedI suppose I can't refute this one, but I believe the cons that I've outlined in my arguments so far: how there is a chance for an innocent person to be killed, how life in prison seems to deter crime better than the death penalty, and how the death penalty is more expensive to keep the life in prison outweigh this argument. What would you want the judge to say if you or a loved one got killed, or maybe your whole family except for you that no has to suffer from what happened? Please answer.You're asking the wrong person this lol. You're talking to someone who was sexually mollested as a child but protects the perpetrator and is good friends with the perpetrator now(weird I know, but I swear I don't have stockholm syndrome). I am a strong believer in forgiving people for what they've done and letting them go. To be honest, if I was president, I'd probably pardon most criminals out there. So, my answer should be obvious: I wouldn't want the judge to give them the death penalty if they killed all of my family. Rather, I'd require that they be given some sort of rehabilitation, perhaps therapy, and other techniques used on them to make them a productive member of society who would no longer have a desire to kill anyone.

            "premise": "This is a debate concerning the death penalty and as the side arguing against it, I would like to make the following points: 1. The death penalty is costly When I say costly, I mean that according to NBC it costs about 1.7 million dollars to execute someone. New Jersey got rid of the death penalty because it costed 4 million dollars per inmate and they hadn't executed anyone since 1963. Plus, inmates staring into the face of the death penalty are entitled to two lawyers which could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars alone. 2. What if they're innocent The fact that the risk of ending the life of an innocent person should not be permitted, Killing an innocent person is morally reprehensible, so why should our justice system allow that possibility to exist? By eliminating the death penalty we eliminate any chance of this happening. 3. Does the death penalty deter crime \"There's no credible evidence of deterrence,\" concludes John Blume, a law professor with the Cornell Death Penalty Project. (Excerpt from the Denver Post). There's no way to tell if a murderer was aware of a state's death-penalty status when the crime was deliberated, or what impact the knowledge had. (also from the same article). In, conclusion I believe I have shown the death penalty to be more of a hindrance than a help There's my argument(s) and I look forward to my opponent's rebuttals. (vote con)",

            "premise": "C1: The Death Penalty Removes the Possibility of Rehabilitation; The Rehabilitation Model Lines up with Science and Psychology No matter what the crime, and no matter who the perpetrator, rehabilitation is an integral part of the justice system. The rehabilitation model posits that crimes are significantly determined by the environment, social structure, and psychological influences. Grave crimes require perpetrators willing to commit such crimes. There are reasons why persons are willing to rape, kill, or torture--acts most people would feel repulsed in doing. Largely, these persons are the product of factors external to their will. The criminal may have experienced abuse as a child, grown up in economic hardship, fell into the wrong company. He may be sociopathic or suffer from a variety of mental disorders or illnesses. Not every offender matches these circumstances but there is always a source of behavior and grave crimes require out of the ordinary causes which will always enlighten our understanding on why certain people feel compelled to kill. Criminal law professor Ivana Bacik, argues that offenders are in need of help to change their behavior. The best possible solution would be to remove the social structuralism that produces criminals, but for those already a product of their conditions, sentencing should be tailored to rehabilitative help. Research that Bacik participated in discovered an apparent variation in sentencing depending on disadvantage. Defendants from deprived areas are 49% more likely to be given custodial sentences, than those from less deprived areas, [4] thus implying a relationship between communal deprivation and crime. There are numerous facts that provide evidence for a causal determinism in criminal activity. Precursors of criminal behavior can be detected in children as early as elementary school [5]. Genetics, disease, physical trauma, and nutritional factors play large roles in aggressiveness and a proneness to violence [1]. Moreover, \"some murderers show significant metabolic abnormalities in as many as six areas of the brain, several of which can suffer damage during gestation or birth\"[3]. It is more common for prisoners than the general population to have a history of traumatic brain injury. \"In two classic studies of 15 adults and 14 juveniles on death row in the mid-1980s, psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis found all 29 inmates had a history of traumatic brain injury\u201d. Some occurrences completely change the character of the person involved [2]. Criminologist, Professor, and author, Adrian Raine argues that there\u2019s a biological basis to violent crimes. \"Simply put,\" he says, \"if bad brains do cause bad behavior, if brain dysfunction raises the odds that somebody will become a criminal offender \u2014 a violent offender \u2014 and if the causes of the brain dysfunction come relatively early in life ... should we fully hold that adult individual responsible?\" [6] This all points to the fact that rehabilitation should be extremely important in our justice system while retribution and revenge have very little place. The death penalty ignores the plight of humans suffering the conditions of the environment they were born into and the uncontrollable issues that affected the way they act. While murder is no doubt heinous, the exact physiological makeup and the history of an offender alleviates much of the condemnation for the perpetrator himself. Pro may bring up examples that he may believe refutes my argument. For example, can a well-off woman killing her husband and heirs for his estate and riches really be given the same leniancy as those born into abusive families or are suffering brain damage? I would first argue that these types of cases are a minority, as shown. But more importantly, as with other crimes, all actions have a causal basis. There's no mental illness we can apply to the lady, but she's just as much as everyone else a result of factors external to her will--upbringing, genes, physiological setup, environment, and social and everyday influences. C2: The Death Penalty is more Costly Cases involving the death penalty are more costly than others due to murder trials being much more lengthy with the death penalty, litigation costs, extra security, and housing. The average cost of a federal trial in which the death penalty is being sought is $620,932 which is about 8 times that of a federal murder case not involving the death penalty.[8] The death penalty requires more tax dollars than life without parole in every state. For example, California could save $1billion over five years if they replaced capital punishment with life without parole.[8] Though cost in dollars is of much less importance than a person\u2019s right to life, the costliness of the death penalty brings into question just how practical it is. Significant sums of taxpayers money are going to time-wasting trials centered on the killing of persons, and we have to ask how it\u2019s worth the costs. C3: The Death Penalty is Unjust In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty violated the 8th amendment by carrying out cruel and unusual punishment [9]. In 1976, state governments pressured it back into use, but the reasoning still holds and the facts remain. The state has no legitimate authority to execute its citizens, no matter what the nature of their act. The death penalty is state-sanctioned murder. In certain situations, it is justifiable to kill, but never in the case of the sentencing someone to death. With the death penalty, there is always a choice--the criminal is safely in the hands of the state--the state has no necessary motive to kill, such as self-defence or preemptive strike. They can easily let the criminal live while also protecting society from him through life without parole, yet they choose to take away his ultimate position, his ultimate right. Moreover, the death penalty is not merely cruel because it executes people; the anticipatory suffering of the criminal is agonizing and tortuous. Albert Camus and Fyodor Dostoevsky both argued that the anticipatory suffering of the criminal probably outweighs that of the victim so that the death penalty\u2019s claim to retributive justice does not hold [10]. Criminals sentenced to death in the United States have to wait an average of 12 years, sometimes up to 30. Death row inmates typically wait years for their deaths almost entirely in their cells in solitary confinement. Healthy inmates often become mentally ill and those already sick experience severe deterioration in their condition [11]. This is easily cruel and unusual punishment and is, thus, unconstitutional via the 8th amendment. The state has a duty to act in the least harmful way possible--yet it gratuitously takes the life of those under its jurisdiction. A society that deliberately kills human-beings without need unequivocally does not respect life.

However, recent research on the topic has suggested that this may not be the case. A 2012 study conducted in Minnesota produced findings indicating that the death penalty likely does not serve to advance the healing process of the families of victims. This particular study represents the first of its kind to systematically examine the healing process of the families of victims when the death penalty has been given as a sentence. The results of this study indicate higher levels of physical, psychological, and behavioral health in victims\u2019 family members in cases where life sentences were given, as opposed to the death penalty, as well as greater satisfaction with the criminal justice system in these individuals.\" CHECK THIS FOLLOWING LINK FOR THE STUDY: http://discover.umn.edu...The study basically debunks everything you have just stated.(rebuttal for \"deterrence\"): You are basing your assumption about \"fear\" from one professor, so I will base mine off of multiple: \"H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article \"Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty?\u201d on the Huffington Post website: \"In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won't commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force...\" \"Michael L. Radelet, PhD, Sociology Professor and Department Chair at the University of Colorado-Boulder, wrote in his 2009 article \"Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates?: The Views of Leading Criminologists\u201d in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology: \"Our survey indicates that the vast majority of the world\u2019s top criminologists believe that the empirical research has revealed the deterrence hypothesis for a myth... 88.2% of polled criminologists do not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent... 9.2% answered that the statement '[t]he death penalty significantly reduces the number of homicides' was accurate... Overall, it is clear that however measured, fewer than 10% of the polled experts believe the deterrence effect of the death penalty is stronger than that of long-term imprisonment... Recent econometric studies, which posit that the death penalty has a marginal deterrent effect beyond that of long-term imprisonment, are so limited or flawed that they have failed to undermine consensus. In short, the consensus among criminologists is that the death penalty does not add any significant deterrent effect above that of long-term imprisonment.\"\"John Lamperti, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, wrote in his Mar. 2010 paper \"Does Capital Punishment Deter Murder? A Brief Look at the Evidence,\" published at math.dartmouth.edu: \"...[I]f there were a substantial net deterrent effect from capital punishment under modern U.S. conditions, the studies we have surveyed should clearly reveal it. They do not... If executions protected innocent lives through deterrence, that would weigh in the balance against capital punishment's heavy social costs. But despite years of trying, this benefit has not been proven to exist; the only certain effects of capital punishment are its liabilities.\" \"Tomislav Kovandzic, PhD, Associate Professor of Economic, Political, and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas, wrote in his 2009 paper \"Does the Death Penalty Save Lives?\" in Criminology and Public Policy: \"Our results provide no empirical support for the argument that the existence or application of the death penalty deters prospective offenders from committing homicide... Although policymakers and the public can continue to base support for use of the death penalty on retribution, religion, or other justifications, defending its use based solely on its deterrent effect is contrary to the evidence presented here. At a minimum, policymakers should refrain from justifying its use by claiming that it is a deterrent to homicide and should consider less costly, more effective ways of addressing crime.\" (http://deathpenalty.procon.org...) (rebuttal for \"recidivism\"): As you have stated in your first paragraph, \"the Death Penalty is only reserved for the most serious crimes.\" Lets pretend that the death penalty is illegal for this mindset. Now imagine this: the death penalty was just banned and a serial killer was suppost to be put to death a few days later - but he cannot now. The police would NEVER release him to the public again in fear of him killing more people - so they keep him in prison forever. Now back to reality, let that sink in. If the death penalty is only for the worst of the worst, then why, if the penalty did not even exist, would security allow those prisoners out into society again? The answer is, they would'nt/they won't. So save that argument for prisoners who are going to be released who are not on the death row or were suppost to be executed on the first place - and not for prisoners who will not be released anyway.

            "premise": "It's good to see my opponent returned in time for the last round. With no further ado, I will start rebuttals.Pro writes \"Let us first picture a world without death penalty. Well, I see crime rates as high as ever, murders increasing everyday and innocent people not getting their rights back. Chaos roams the streets and people committing crimes to get money and in their heads they know that the worst that can happen to them is prison. For some prison might even be a relief compared to their living standards.\"Just because you see it doesn't make it so. We have places without the death penalty, and they haven't descended into madness. Most rational people wouldn't want to commit crimes anyway, and the lunatics who do commit crimes usually end up imprisoned. I suggest rather than the death penalty, we increase the undesirability of jail. Everyone who is jailed should be forced to do hard labor at below minimum wage, the proceeds of which go to their victim(s) or the prison. This is far more profitable than killing them, as now they are working for their keep and then some.Pro writes \"So abolishing death penalty only encourages people to break the law and murder more innocent people. More gangs would form and assassinations increase because of the lower punishment received. Right now, some countries that have death penalty are very fragile. The only line between chaos and peace is death penalty.\"No it doesn't. You still get punished, and it's still not pleasant. No one likes losing their freedoms. For some, being locked in a tightly controlled prison for the rest of their lives is much worse than dying. If you're in a gang, you could face death regularly in gang wars, but being trapped until you die could be much much worse. 139 countries have abolished the death penalty, and they are not desolate wastelands, so it stands to reason that the death penalty is not the most effective method of keeping order.Pro writes \"Some might say the cost of killing a criminal is not worth it. Well let me tell you one thing, is the cost of safety not worth it? Would you rather have a peaceful community and pay some extra taxes or would you rather pay less tax and live in a dangerous environment.\"From a perspective of danger, I am not likely to be endangered by someone who is an inmate for life.Pro writes \"One of the issues of death penalty is making a mistake in the trails. No system of justice can produce results which are 100% certain all the time. Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof. We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes. Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases. However, the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small, and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976.\"I think a single innocent person being executed would be enough to deter me from the death penalty. If the government has the death penalty at it's disposal for eliminating people, it could easily use that power tyrannically. Pro himself conceded that no justice system is perfect, so why add to it a feature that lets you eliminate someone permanently? You could make a mistake.Vote Con.",

            "premise": "In this debate, I will address several main aspects of capital punishment (or death penalty; terms may be used interchangeably) in the United States. Before I begin, I would like to note that I am brand new to this site and I am excited to begin debating and put my opinions out there. So, be aware that I am certainly not the most experienced one here.Now, first of all, I would lie to provide a definition.Death Penalty - Execution of an offender sentenced to death after conviction by a court of law of a criminal offense. OR - Imposition of a penalty of death by the state.\"Death penalty\" and \"capital punishment\" are considered synonymous to some extent, but it should be noted that giving the sentence is not always followed through by the penalty itself.Source: Encyclopedia Britannica, Columbia Encyclopedia (6th edition), numerous other outletsTo follow this, I will present my argument:Morality - Before getting into the statistics and other arguments for the death penalty, the base question for this debate must be, \"Is it ever morally acceptable to end the life of another human being?\" To that, I have to say no. Personally, I believe that all forms of killing, especially that sanctioned by the state, is wrong. This argument is purely a moral one, based on how I was raised and how I choose to live my life. No matter what the circumstances may be, I believe that killing another person is unacceptable. The kicker here is that the government is actually sponsoring the murder of a convicted criminal. This means that the state takes money from taxpayers and uses it to end the life of a person. However, since killing is a crime, and the state kills someone, we are all guilty of killing. When we are guilty of killing, we also must be put to death. This the paradox of the death penalty, and you cannot avoid it.Before I go into deeper depth of the other facets of the death penalty, I would like to see my opponent address my points and then give further reason why they believe that capital punishment should remain as an option for some criminals. Topics to be addressed may include, but are not limited to: - the death penalty's use as a deterrent;- the legality and constitutionality of the death penalty; and- social, religious, and racial aspects of the death penalty.Round 1 may be for acknowledgement and clarifications, accompanied by preliminary arguments. In Round 2, I will address all of my opponent's points and present new arguments of my own if the need presents itself. Rounds 3, and 4 will similar. In Round 5, however, only closing points should be made. Burden of proof will be divided equally. Please remember to maintain a respectful, intellectual, and professional attitude.Once again, I am new here. As it is great to be here, I will admit that I am a little nervous to undertake my first debate. I thank you for your understanding.",

            "conclusion": "The death penalty should NOT be allowed",
            "premise": "Rebuttals(rebuttal for R1): 67% of prisoners on death row are not released. Where did you get that false fact from? Only a very small percentage are relased. The amount of people on death row who are innocent is 4/100 people. That number is less in prison itself. Life sentence gives prisoners the value of life. So, even if they were innocent (because every system will be flawed), they still will have the gift of life, and not death. 4% percent of people on the death row are innocent, 2.5% of people in a regular prison facility are innocent. The number is higher for death row - and that proves my point. And if there is clear evidence that someone on LWP is innocent, there will not be a need for a parole hearing, the prison will just set them free. (rebuttal for R2): As I have mentioned before, \"There is racial and economic discrimination in application of the death penalty: \"About 99 percent of the death-row inmates are men. Of the 1,058 prisoners on death row by Aug. 20,1982, 42 percent were black, whereas about 12 percent of the United States population is black. Those who receive the death penalty still tend to be poor, poorly educated and represented by public defenders or court-appointed lawyers.\" This is a racist and sexist act that happens to frequently to be allowed.\" Also, Several years after the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, a University of Iowa law professor, David C. Baldus (who died last month), along with two colleagues, published a study examining more than 2,000 homicides that took place in Georgia beginning in 1972. They found that black defendants were 1.7 times more likely to receive the death penalty than white defendants and that murderers of white victims were 4.3 times more likely to be sentenced to death than those who killed blacks.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...)(rebuttal for R3): If there were no death penalty in the first place, then the media woild not have to cover anything. Sure, the media does influence publicity on criminals, but that is only because the DP opens the door for such publicity. (rebuttal for R4): You make a good point. However, there are not many people who volunteer as excecutors. There is a reason why there are 3 people inserting needles and only one has the poison. There is a reason why 10 people are shooting and only one has the deadly bullet, because it is inhumane. And we all know that. Once when we can accept the deeper meaning of this horific practice, then we can move on from this negative punishment.(rebuttal for R5):While you made a good comparison, as I have mentioned before, \"It is hipocritical: Why are we killing people for killing people? Why are we doing the same thing we are punishing others for doing? That is obsurd.\" That is all I will say for this section.(rebuttal for R6): Once again - I cannot take your percentages seriously because you have not cited any evidence. And saying that one way is more fair then the other is opinionated, we are trying to only focus on the facts. I already explained my argument for this in my rebuttal for section 1. We are starting to go in circles so I will not repeat myself, basically, your R1 & R6 arguments are the same.(rebuttal for R7): Unfortunatly, nowadays we cannot seem to seperate church from state. How come topics like gay marriage and abortion were so hard to find an aswer to? Because our country cannot seem to ceperate the two, and the same will go for this topic.(rebuttal for R8): The same thing for people on death row, it does not always do justice because most cases are not taken seriously either. And ther reason for that is because sosciety looks at these people like animals so they do not hesistate to execute them. And what makes you think that criminals think more like regular people? Pleae siite evidence. Because, \"Hare estimates that about 50 - 75% of the prison population meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder but only 15-25% exceed the cut-off point for psychopathy.\" (https://www.psychologytoday.com...). If that is thinking like normal people to you then I dont know what to say. And as I mentioned in the first round, \" There is a better alternative - life without parole: This sentence would make the criminals suffer every single day and be forced to think about what they have done. It is a more harsh sentence because they can not escape the negativity they created - they have to live with it each and every long, boring day. Killing the criminals is an easy way out for them - they will just think; \"oh, if I kill people who I hate, then I will die and not have to deal with it.\" Wouldn't that encourage more criminals to act? This would make crime rates increase.\"(rebuttal for R9): But plea barganing at the end of the day is not the cost of ONLY THE EXECUTION. We are just talking about the cost of the EXECUTION ITSELF. That is not true. I will use various more websites to prove the cost is higher for the DP then LWP. \"Cases without the death penalty cost $740,000, while cases where the death penalty is sought cost $1.26 million. Maintaining each death row prisoner costs taxpayers $90,000 more per year than a prisoner in general population.\" (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...). \"The exorbitant costs of capital punishment are actually making America less safe because badly needed financial and legal resources are being diverted from effective crime fighting strategies. Before the Los Angeles riots, for example, California had little money for innovations like community policing, but was managing to spend an extra $90 million per year on capital punishment. Texas, with over 300 people on death row, is spending an estimated $2.3 million per case.\" (http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...). \" California has spent more than $4 billion on capital punishment since it was reinstated in 1978 (about $308 million for each of the 13 executions carried out) California spends an additional $184 million on the death penalty per year because of the additional costs of capital trials, enhanced security on death row, and legal representation. The study\u2019s authors predict that the cost of the death penalty will reach $9 billion by 2030.\" (http://deathpenalty.org...). (rebuttal for R10): Thank you for agreeing, but how can ammendments fix this? Where will we get the money to add such ammendments? And I provided many other reasons to go along so this is just the icing on the cake.I'm sorry, but the debating rules state that voters cannot take anything from the comments section and involve it in their votes. So your sources will need to be provided in your final round to count. Just trying to help.OVER TO YOU :) Citations: http://www.nytimes.com...https://www.psychologytoday.com...http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...;http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...;http://deathpenalty.org...;",

            "premise": "Rebuttals to opponent's arguments:It seems my opponent advocates the \"eye for an eye\" morality. What makes this morality superior? While they stated the golden rule, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense here. You wouldn't want to be killed if you murdered someone, right? So why should the murderer be killed when you, yourself, wouldn't want to be killed? Unless you're suicidal, you wouldn't want to be killed, so the golden rule would actually be reason against the death penalty. Now, as I said, what my opponent actually seems to advocate is the eye for an eye morality. To quote Gandhi \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind\". We would be no better than the murderer by killing them. My main arguments:1) The death penalty is more expensive than life in prison sentences. No matter what state you look at, lawsuits where the death penalty is the goal, are a lot more expensive, as much asmillions of dollars more expensive in some cases[1]. Over all, capital punishment is much more expensive than life imrisonment without the possibility of parole[2] 2) The death penalty is making us less safe. \"The exorbitant costs of capital punishment are actually making America less safe because badly needed financial and legal resources are being diverted from effective crime fighting strategies. Before the Los Angeles riots, for example, California had little money for innovations like community policing, but was managing to spend an extra $90 million per year on capital punishment. Texas, with over 300 people on death row, is spending an estimated $2.3 million per case, but its murder rate remains one of the highest in the country. \" [2] So, since resources and money is being spent on the death penalty instead of in other areas, it is actually making America less safe, not more safe.3) There are people who are innocent who get the death penaltyI consider it much worse to end the life of someone who is innocent of the crime. We don't have a perfect justice system, so we shouldn't be using extreme punishments such as ending the life of someone. It's estimated that 4.1% of those sentenced to the death penalty are innocent[3], but only 1.9% are ever discovered to be innocent after that they are convicted. How is the death penalty justifiable at all, when there is a chance for innocent people being killed? At least with life in prison without the chance of parole, there is a longer amount of time for us to discover new evidence that would make the person innocent. Once a person is dead, it wouldn't matter if new evidence arose that proved their innocent: you can't undo the death of that person. Sources:[1] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

            "premise": "There are many reasonable arguments against the death penalty. However, we are dealing with a life and death issue. When dealing with an issue of this magnitude I believe there should be great consequences. Statistics reveal that the death penalty is very costly. I think that when an issue regards human life all costs must be put aside. The actions that lead to the death penalty further justify the reason to put the aside the price. As a nation, the United States has a priority to stand by people and their rights. A nation that solely focuses on cost is a nation that does not have its priorities in line. Being a nation of the people, I think we must stand beside the victims and protect their violated rights. The 15th amendment states that \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\" (US Constitution). Simply, without the due process of law a person can not be deprived of their natural rights. This amendment stands alongside the victims. If a criminal is willing to interfere, break the law and deprive a person of their rights, I believe they should be punished to the maximum extent. If murderers do not value the rights of others, they should not be allowed to have those rights for themselves. Along with serving justice, the death penalty focuses on reasonable retribution. In order to be in consideration to earn the death penalty, a person must go to great measures to break laws. In the state of Texas to get the death penalty you must have committed a murder of a public officer, multiple persons, a person under 16 years of age and during a felony. Committing a murder in the first degree in Florida makes a person eligible for the penalty (Death Penalty Information Center). What it takes to be deserving of the punishment are the most ruthless and gruesome of crimes. The death penalty takes the lives of inhuman killers and law breakers. Not your everyday shoplifters and car thieves are prosecuted to receive the death penalty. Only the most extreme of criminals are eligible for the punishment. I believe that an extreme law breaker should be punished in an extreme manner. Jails and prisons are for people to be rehabilitated. Death is for those who commit the few and most dangerous of laws.",

Death penalty's are done in a humane way and is not as unusual and cruel as it looks. The prisoner is blindfolded and then executed. It is pretty much like putting down an animal. If animals can be put down why can't humans be put down? It's all the same. Both animals and humans that stand on this Earth is meant to die. By executing prisoners you only end their lives shorter but sooner or later they will die. Death penalty's should be done if you are to stop mass murdering or brutal killing of a man. As I mentioned in my previous arguments, without the death penalty, there will be no fear to kill and killing is what will happen if you don't create the fear. It will keep going until it can be stopped and unless you find a proper way to stop the criminals instead of execution, then you should keep the punishment. I thank the opposition for his argument and I hope l changed what you think of the death penalty",

            "premise": "Contention #1 Justice and Public Support The death penalty demands that justice should be attributed to the victims of the family. In the United States of America, the Death Penalty is only reserved for the most serious crimes, and somebody he commits such a heinous act, is subject to this punishment. Most Americans recognize this principle as just, as 60% of Americans still believe that the DP is appropriate for homicide. (1)Regarding the ethics, let me explain a bit further. When a criminal, commits homicide, he violates an major right that was mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, which is the term \"\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\". (2) When you violate the right to live, what moral right does the criminal have to live? Even though the victim and the victim's family cannot be restored to the status which preceded the murder, the Death penalty brings justice to the family. Contention #2 Deterrence The Deterrence Theory The death penalty in fact, does deter crime. According to sources provided by Isaac Ehrlich, currently a University of Buffalo Distinguished Professor of Economics, he figured that according to the deterrence theory, criminals are no different from law-abiding people. Criminals \"rationally maximize their own self-interest subject to constraints that they face in the marketplace and elsewhere. In other words, criminals will likely not commit the crime, if they feel the costs outweigh the benefits. (3) This theory serves as a deterence to crime, as a socioeconomic factor such as \"fear\" will keep criminals from committing addtional crimes. Several economists agree to this, regardign Issac Ehrlich studies, Professor Stephen K. Layson of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro reconfirmed his findings. Finally, according to \"Joanna M. Shepherd\", she concluding 3 factors after her studies. (4) First, each execution, on average, is associated with three fewer murders. The deterred murders included both crimes of passion and murders by intimates.Second, executions deter the murder of whites and African-Americans. Each execution prevents the murder of one white person, 1.5 African-Americans, and 0.5 persons of other races. Third, shorter waits on death row are associated with increased deterrence. For each additional 2.75-year reduction in the death row wait until execution, one murder is deterred. It is quite clear, that according to studies done by economists, and professors, The Detterence theory indeed does apply to also criminals, thus deters crime. RecidivismOne thing that the death penalty fulfills, is that it prevent recidivism from occuring. According to report published by th Bureau of Justice, it stats that out of 300,000 prisoners who were released in 1994, 67.5% of those criminals re-offended. (5) Out of those, 1.2% of those convicted of homicide were arrested for another homicide within three years of release.(5) These stats are quite high, as reoffending rates for homicide who re-offend between 6 months jump up to 12.5%. The only way to prevent these offenses from being commited again, is the death penalty. Even in jail itself, there is no gurantee that the criminal will not murder someone else. In another report by the Bureau of Justice, 2.1% of all deaths in prison, resulted from homicide. (6) This way, it is guranteed the death penalty would have saved lives.Trends of different states and other correlations. You can see here, in this particular graph, the Captial Punishments states are quite lower, compared to the Non-capital punishment states. Here is another interesting fact, when the death penalty was suspended nationwide from 1968 to 1976, the murder rate skyrocketed. By the time the the crime rate began to drop in the United States, those states with the DP actually witnessed a 39% larger drop in murder rates by 1998. (7) http://www.wesleylowe.com...; src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/2/1530/33374-1530-decvg-a.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.wesleylowe.com...; />And finally, another report done by the Bureau of Criminal Justice, shows that that when the execution rates were high, there generally were fewer murders. You can also see, during the 1960's and 1980's, when the death penalty was not used, murders skyrocked.

Even though they made an incredibly bad choice by committing a capital offense, they are still human and we must treat them as one. A Florida study found that states could cut costs by $51 million simply by eliminating the death penalty. A study by Columbia University Law School found that two thirds of all capital trials contained serious errors. When the cases were retried, over 80% of the defendants were not sentenced to death and 7% were completely acquitted. Not only is it expensive, but it also has had many errors.

            "premise": "My opponent claims that the Death Penalty \u201clowers crime.\u201dR1: Lowers crime\u201cA July 2009 study titled \"DO EXECUTIONS LOWER HOMICIDE RATES?: THE VIEWS OF LEADING CRIMINOLOGISTS\" by Michael L. Radelet and Traci L. LaCock, demonstrates an overwhelming consensus among criminologists that the empirical research conducted on the deterrence question strongly supports the conclusion that the death penalty does not add deterrent effects to those already achieved by long imprisonment.\u201d (1)Personally I find it hard to picture a drug lord deterred by the death penalty as it would seem more likely he die from his chosen life than our Justice system.R2: The Straw manMy opponent asks \u201cWould it be moral to let these felons free, and then have them commit the same crime over.\u201d This straw man\u2019s my position. No one is suggesting to \u201clet these felons free.\u201d I have proposed life in prison without parole.My opponent claims \u201cIt is more important to protect our society.\u201d Society can be protected without the death penalty. Life in prison without parole provides this without spending near as much and more importantly without the chance of killing innocents. The same cannot be said about the Death Penalty. C1 Right to lifeCon\u2019s response to this argument is weak and very brief. I do think that we should protect citizens. I have not argued otherwise. Con has not shown how the death penalty protects society anymore than life in prison. We should be protecting all peoples rights. C2 Innocents Con says \u201c18 is a small number.\u201d Really!? A small number. 18 people who were innocent of crimes that they were convicted of, sentenced and then put to death for something they did not do. This is unjust and easily avoided with life in prison. C3 Cost The source my opponent uses for her argument is from 1997. Mine is from 2011. The Death Penalty may have been a cheaper alternative twenty years ago. This is no longer the case as is shown by my source. C4 A reasonable alternative Con asks \u201cWhy would we sentence more people to prison.\u201d This is amusing as people waiting to be put to death already go to prison for quite some time. Besides it is not those convicted to life in prison that overpopulate our system. Those are drug offenders. Lowering or eliminating prison time for lesser crimes would vastly impact prison overpopulation much more than maintaining the death penalty. OverviewCon seems to think that abolishing the death penalty is equivelent to allowing felons to run free. This is not the case. I have proposed a reasonable alternative. Life in prison protects society without the possiblility of taking an innocents life. Life in prison allows security without paying as much. Life in prison is a superior option to the death penalty and thus the death penalty should be abolished.",

            "conclusion": "Should we have the death Penalty? (Con is against death penalty)",
            "premise": "Rebuttals: You stated that \"this is morally wrong as stated by the Bible in Exodus 20:13\" The passage states, \"Do not murder.\" However, the death penalty is not murder, but capital punishment. Murder is in cold blood, the death penalty is a punishment. Besides that, the Bible actually recommends the death penalty in passages 22:18-20 \"A sorceress may not be allowed to live. Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be executed. Anyone who sacrifices to any other God must be destroyed...\" This is the death penalty as punishment for their actions. Also Leviticus 20:2 \"...they must be stoned to death by the people...(for sacrificing their children to Molech). So as you can see, the Bible does not really say that the death penalty is morally wrong, but rather right. Now, my arguments. I. People do deserve to die. The death penalty Is only instituted for murder or (in rare cases) the rape of a child. Yes, this does unfortunately happen, and these people do deserve a death penalty. Allow me to call Alton Nolen to the witness stand. \"An Oklahoma man who allegedly went on an angry rampage last week after being suspended from his job at a food processing plant was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder and could face the death penalty for beheading a fellow worker with a knife, a prosecutor said. \"Alton Nolen, 30, is accused of killing Colleen Hufford, 54, and of stabbing and injuring a second co-worker, Traci Johnson, 43, at Vaughan Foods in Moore, Okla., on Thursday. He was stopped only after the company's chief operating officer, Mark Vaughan, who is also a reserve sheriff's deputy, shot and injured Nolen in his arm and abdomen with a rifle. Cleveland County Prosecutor Greg Mashburn said Nolen has been charged with first-degree murder. Mashburn said he might seek the death penalty in the case. He said Nolen would be arraigned after he is released from the hospital. Mashburn said Nolen, who had recently converted to Islam and has tried to convert some fellow workers, shouted some \"Arabic words\" during the attacks. He also said Nolen had \"some sort of infatuation with beheadings.\" \"It seemed to be related to his interest in killing someone that way,\" Mashburn said. \"Other than that, it seemed to be related to his being suspended earlier in the day.\"--USA TODAY This man was cutting peoples heads off. Of course he deserves the death penalty for this heinous crime. Also, Allow me to reference the horrible 21 Nazi War criminals in the Nuremberg Trials who were responsible for the death of 6 million Jews and other heinous War crimes. 11 received the death penalty.The Sentencing and Execution of Nazi War criminals. In November 1945, twenty-one men sat in the dock of a Nuremberg courtroom on trial for their lives. The group represented the \"cream of the crop\" of the Nazi leadership including Herman Goering, Hitler's heir apparent until falling out of favor in the closing days of the war, and Rudolph Hess, Hitler's deputy who had been in custody since parachuting into England in 1941. (A 22nd defendant - Martin Bormann - had escaped capture and was tried in absentia). Each defendant was accused of one or more of four charges: conspiracy to commit crimes alleged in other counts; crimes against peace; war crimes; or crimes against humanity. Specific charges included the murder of over 6 million Jews, pursuing an aggressive war, the brutality of the concentration camps and the use of slave labor. The judges represented the major victors in the war in Europe - Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. The defendants all proclaimed their innocence, many declaring that they were just following orders or questioning the authority of the court to pass judgment. The verdicts were announced on October 1, 1946. Eighteen of the defendants were found guilty while three were acquitted. Eleven of the guilty were sentenced to death by hanging, the remainder received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life.\"-http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com... If there was no death penalty, these crimes would go as \"20 years to-life imprisonment\" or go unpunished. The death penalty is a just punishment for those committing horrible acts. II. Conclusion. We should have the death penalty because some people deserve it and, contrary to your point, it is not morally wrong. The Bible supports it. By saying that the death penalty's morally wrong you are saying the bible is morally wrong. Obviously not! The Bible is all about strict morality! So we can conclude that since God commands The death penalty it is a moral practice. And for those of you who do not believe in God, look at the men that have received the death penalty! Horrible crimes were committed by them! They deserve the death penalty. We need to keep this punishment in practice so that criminals can get what they deserve! Good luck with your next argument Thadeus.",

            "premise": "I see your argument completely. I understand the point you are trying to get across. That criminals should be sentence to the death penalty, if they in fact commit murder. That is, in my opinion, barbaric. I do not believe one death should result in another, one sadness in another, one eye for another. That is a way of the past that we should abolish. The death penalty doesn't always JUST kill criminals. Innocent people are tried for crimes and may be convicted even if they didn't commit said crime. Then they are put to death. Now, not all people who are sentenced the death penalty are innocent, many are guilty of said crimes, but what crimes here are appropriate? You want statistics, here are mine: 7 countries have the death penalty for being gay (Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc...) Countries have the death penalty for rape, robbery, drug possession or trafficking, adultery, treason, etc... How about some of the inhumane ways it is carried out: Hanging Firing Squad Beheading Public Stoning to death This is the barbaric truth about what the death punishment is. And the fact is it shouldn't be allowed. No human should be subject to this. Life is valuable and should not be left to the hands of the judicial system to decide. My final argument is that mistakes are made. Innocent people are killed, and was it really worth it? All of those lives ended because you couldn't just settle for locking them up for life? http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org... http://www.youtube.com...",

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting. The death penalty is something I am very against. The death penalty is the lethal injection of someone who is found guilty of a crime, and I say that it is entirely medieval and unnecessary. I will put it to you, voters and opponent, in a simple way. When you decide to take the life of another human being, you are making the executive decision to not allow them to live any longer. For good reason, this is illegal. Morally, we should not be allowed to decide if anyone other than ourselves deserves to live any longer. In a state where the death penalty is legal, a jury is placed into that executive position. They decide on whether the defendant should live or die, should they be found guilty. They are put into a murderous mentality that can be easily corrupted. While a jury is the most logical choice in a democracy, their beliefs can stand in the way. Attorneys may not even have an influence on some, and therefore the death penalty is subject to bias. Another argument is the fact that it is not necessary. If I were to murder someone, turn myself in, and plead guilty, I would most likely get 25 to life. This is no joke, and it prevents me from being a danger to anyone in society. So why do we need to kill anyone? No one wants to die, and therefore will appeal the decision. An appeal will result in astronomical legal fees for the state and the defendant, lethal injection costs the state money, etc. This is pointless spending. A murderer, rapist, etc. who is found guilty is sentenced to prison for long periods of time, eliminating danger. Therefore, I ask my opponent this. What is the point of taking someone's life? Revenge? Power? There is no logical answer to this question. Lastly, from a moral standpoint, it does not undo the crime. It does not bring a murder victim back to life, it does not take the trauma away from a rape victim. While this is sad, it is true. It does not solve anything, and only provides false closure. In conclusion, the death penalty is a waste of resources and time. $2.3 million is spent per year on the death penalty, with the possibility of the defendant being innocent. I look forward to hearing your arguments. Thank you.",

            "premise": "My CaseMy opponent drops my first contention. This is devastating to his case as if a governemtn ought to repect the right to life then the Death Penalty ought to be abolished soley on those grounds. In response to my second contention, Con claims that people are put in prison for life falsly as well. While I grant that people are sometimes wrongly convicted, at least if we find evidence later that proves innocence a life sentence can be ended and the innocent can go free. Not so with the death penatly due to the lack of ability to give back a life that is already gone. Here again this contention stands as you cannot make a restitution for putting someone to death who was innocent as you can for life in prison. The third contention is largley untouched. Con cites what the cost of a lethal injection is but this widely misses the mark. This is due to the fact that the costs incurred in death penalty cases is not just the injection, it is the legal fees and process that must be gone through to get a death penalty conviction. She dismess my source as it is only from California, though she offers no counter examples. Thus the only example we have is mine. Thus, cost is still on the side of abolishing the death penalty. Con argues against my final contention by stating that life in prison allows oppertunity for people to escape. Firstly, escapes from prions are extrememly rare, further even if you buy this counter arguement it is outweighed by the risk of putting someone innocent to death. It is ammusing that my opponenet at this point argues that prisoners ought to be put to death to prevent them from going insane due to life in prison. I say amusing as the negative phychological effects to those on death row and those who have to put a prisoner to death are well documented. Besides, the overuling right to life outweighs the unproven and uncited chance that prisoners go insane from life in prison. Thus far, all four of my contentions stand. Con's CaseMy opponent claims that the death penalty acts as a detterent though has offered no source to back this claim, or show that the same detterence is not acheived by life in prison. She provides a quote with no source. As this stands it is merely an unsupported claim rather than an arguement. Con again tries to argue cost though misses the mark. Here is another source that shows that life in Prison in cheaper to the tax payer than a death penalty. (1)OverviewIt is clear that the death penalty costs more than life in prison. It is clear that life in prison is a reasonable alternative. In the case of somone wrongly convicted, a life in prison sentence can be reversed, the same is obviously not true when the death penalty is applied. Rember at least 18 innocent people have been killed by the state. Most importantly, the death penalty is a violation of a persons most basic right. The right to life. Clearly the death penalty ought to be abolishedSources(1) http://www.nbcrightnow.com...;",

            "premise": "There are many reasons to doubt the deterrent effect of the death penalty. For one thing, many criminals may actually find the prospect of the death penalty less daunting (and thus, less effective as a deterrent) than spending the rest of their lives suffering in jail. Death by execution is generally fairly quick, while a lifetime in prison can be seen as a much more intensive punishment. Moreover, even if criminals preferred life in prison to the death penalty, it's not clear that a harsher punishment would effectively deter murders. Heinous crimes often occur in the heat of the moment, with little consideration for their legal repercussions1. Further, for a deterrent to be effective, it would have to be immediate and certain. This is not the case with the death penalty cases, which often involve prolonged appeals and sometimes end in acquittals2. Finally, the empirical evidence regarding the deterrence effect of the death penalty is at best mixed. Many of the studies that purport to show the deterrence effect are flawed, because the impact of capital punishment cannot be disentangled from other factors such as broader social trends, economic factors and demographic changes in a region2. Other studies have even suggested a correlation between the death penalty and higher crime rates. States such as Texas and Oklahoma, which have very high execution rates, also have higher crime rates than most states that do not have the death penalty2. 1\u00a0Amnesty International. \"Abolish the Death Penalty.\" Accessed June 5, 2011.\u00a0 2\u00a0\"Saving Lives and Money.\" The Economist.

            "premise": "Hey Michael\u2014and once again I would like to challenge you to another debate on debate.org. Definition Death Penalty: death as punishment for a crime called also capital punishment http://dictionary.reference.com... Should: must; ought http://dictionary.reference.com... Illegal: Forbidden by law or statute http://dictionary.reference.com... Overview This debate will be about the death penalty. I shall be con saying that the death penalty should be illegal, for it is immoral. Pro will rebuttal and give statements on how the death penalty should be legal and that we should continue executing prisoners. The death penalty is rather pointless in my opinion because it costs us more money than the life sentence. The death penalty\u2014does it bring back the victim? No it doesn\u2019t. The death penalty rather than showing us to not perpetrate heinous crimes\u2014shows that us Americans kill one another. Structure of the Debate Round 1: Introductions, and first arguments for Con. Pro will show his rebuttals to my arguments and give his own arguments Round 2: Con will argue back and give more reasons. Pro will rebuttal to Con\u2019s claims and give his arguments again. Round 3: Same as round 2 Round 4: Rebuttal, and give your own personal reasons why the death penalty should be illegal or legal. (for both Pro and Con.) Round 5: Conclusion. Arguments The Death Penalty is a waste of money The death penalty is a pointless way to punish criminals in many ways. Rather than spend 137 million dollars a year on executing criminals, we should just put them into a life sentence. As said earlier\u2014137 million dollars a year is on executing criminals, but however putting them in a life-sentence will cost only around 11.5 million dollars a year. Life sentence can just be as agonizing as having the death sentence. Death sentence basically means that they kill the criminals, but having a life sentence means that they let the criminals rot in jail until they die. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... The Death Penalty is considered cruel and unusual The United States constitution prevents Americans from being killed in a cruel and unusual manner. Whether or not it\u2019s a decapitation, electric chair, gas chamber, or lethal injection\u2014it\u2019s barbaric to allow state-sanctioned murder in a crowd of people. There\u2019s no point in watching one being killed in an audience, so to say. My belief is that it\u2019s unusual for American\u2019s to be watching an execution happening in jail. The Death Penalty could\u2019ve killed innocent lives The third argument in which I will provide states that \u201cThe Death Penalty could\u2019ve killed innocent lives.\u201d For example\u2014Donald Paradis was sentence to death row in the 1980s for the assumption of him killing two people. After 21 years of hard work from his lawyers\u2014they proved that Donald Paradis actually did not kill the two people\u2014rather he hid the bodies into another place. In this website in which I will provide\u2014it states that they saved approximately 12 innocent people from death row.. 12 people that might\u2019ve been killed for no exact reason\u2014other than perjury from the jury. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... In conclusion\u2014the death penalty is pointless, immoral, and a waste of money. Vote Con.",

Society doesn't experience fewer murders, at least not any fewer than would be experienced if the murderer were confined to life in prison. So it is just the \"mental satisfaction\" of society for playing God and putting someone to death. I think this is perverse and the sign of a declining culture. Society can say to itself, \"We kill bad people,\" thus delineating right and wrong, but to no real benefit. This \"goodness\" is illusory. If the wrongful murder conviction rate was, say, 1%, and the penalty was life in prison, then those wrongly convicted could spend their time and energies reversing the decision and bringing the truth to light. In the end, even if they spent years in jail, they would have what was left of their freedom, and they most certainly should be able to bring suit against those who wrongly convicted them. Compensation could be made. But the death penalty is irreversible. It allows the state to cover up false convictions, since the condemned can no longer plead his case. The death penalty disposes of the problem and promotes sloppiness in the justice system. What would be an acceptable wrongful-execution rate? You say 1/1000 is acceptable. How about 1/100? How about 10%? 50%? 95%? Where is the line. The only acceptable line is 0%. The death penalty should be reserved for only those cases where the perpetrator admits to the crime or there is 100% irrefutable evidence (i.e. video documentation), AND the victims' families want the death penalty to be enacted. Otherwise, convicted murderers should be made to pay restitution and serve appropriate sentences, most commonly life in prison without the possibility of parole. Societal acceptance of the death penalty as an appropriate means of punishment only hastens the day when it can be used as a political tool to silence dissent. In the history of governments, has the death penalty ever been used by a nation and not ultimately applied to these political uses? I don't think so. Will the United States be the first country to not go down this road? I hope so, but judging from history and the current path of our government, I would say it's unlikely. Thus, I think the death penalty should be abolished at the federal level, and by the individual states.",

            "premise": "Thanks for the quick response Pro. Since my opponent has not posted any points for his side, and only posted rebuttals against my side, my following arguments will only consist of counter-rebuttals. Deterrence, CounterMy opponent states here that based on an assumption we can justify the death penalty. He seems to support this with the idea that there is no evidence to show that the death penalty doesn't deter. However I disagree, the fact that there is no evidence the death penalty deters is clear evidence that the death penalty doesn't deter crime. Until it can be statistically shown that the death penalty saves lives, we as a society cannot allow and cannot justify its continuation. A Moral Argument, CounterI've already explained my viewpoint, and really our two mentalities are matters of opinion, so all I can say is that it's up to the readers to decide which they agree with more. \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\" Mahatma Ghandi.[1]Getting the Wrong Guy, CounterMy opponent doesn't think innocents are wrongfully executed anymore, but his claims are un-sourced, and thus un-provable to the readers.Price, CounterMy opponent justifies the death penalty's excessive cost by saying the responsibility of the price is on the people who set the prices, not us who decide to keep killing criminals. Certainly, average people like you and me didn't set the price, but that shouldn't completely eliminate our accountability. The price may not be within our control, but whether or not we put money that could've been spent on schools into funding executions is in our control.Source:[1] http://www.quotationspage.com...",

            "conclusion": "should the death penalty be used in the united states",
            "premise": "Right I'd just like to clear up the confusion- I'm PRO, my opponent should be Con. Moving on. My value is Justice, which is defined as giving each their due. This should be looked at the standard because we are discussing the death penalty, which is a punishment, and thus since all punishments deal with justice, justice should be the value. The value criterion for justice is Proportionality, or having the punishment fit the crime. In order to give each his or her due, we must give criminals a punishment that fits their crime as this is the only way to give him his due. It would not make sense to give a murderer a $100 fine, as this punishment does not fit his crime, and thus is not just. Therefore in order to uphold justice we must look at what punishment will fit the crime. Contention 1) The very idea of murder constitutes the death penalty. By committing a murder, you are committing the most extreme crime against humanity and violating a person's right to life, and thus violating every single right they have. Additionally, their crime no longer affects the victim directly, but the entire populous as the crime breaks the moral codes that allow society to function. The government must view the crime as such and therefore must give a punishment that can fit it. However this cannot be done simply by restricting a person's movements through prison, because they violated all of the victim's rights. The only way to proportionally deliver punishment for the most extreme crime is by the most extreme punishment, the death penalty. Contention 2) Universialtiy. The renowned philosopher Immanuel Kant stated, \"Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\" Kant held the idea that each person has a free rational choice, and because the criminal has made the free rational choice to put forth a maxim stating that killing is allowed, then we must fulfill this maxim. The only way to achieve justice is to give the murderer what he believes should be the moral maxim, death. (((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((REFUTE))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))0 >>1) Financial Resources. My opponent states that financial costs should dictate punishment. However, this completely contradicts the entire idea of the United States. Firstly, it would be much cheaper to ship all the prisoners to Alaska and let them starve and freeze to death, however I doubt my opponent would want that. Secondly, this basically states that the system is flawed, not the death penalty. Look at the presidential election. Billions of dollars went into advertising, ect. for that election that could have gone to other things. Does that mean that electing our presidents should not be done? It would be cheaper just to appoint a dictator, however the idea of electing our presidents is allowed. Thus the death penaltyis allowed. >>2) Cruel and Unusual Punsishment. First off, the Supreme Court has ruled the death penalty to the states, and thus ruled it as Constitutional. Thus the Constitution itself, which gives the Supreme Court power to rule things constitutional or not has ruled the death penalty constitutional. Secondly, Kim Jong Il and other dictators kill INNOCENT people. We kill MURDERS to protect our society and uphold justice. There is a difference. >>3) Clogs Court system TURN this, if we spend so much time on these cases, this contradicts my opponents idea of killing innocents. Second, once again, as I stated against his first point, this just points to a flaw in the system, not the act. >>4)\"Eye for an eye\" First, there is a difference between Israel-Palestine and gang warfare. Both those things are fueled by hate. The death penalty is fueled by justice. Secondly, I agree we cant just say an eye for an eye, that's why we don't rape rapists and kidnap kidnappers. However at a certain point we must make the crime fit the punishment and the only way to do this with a murderer is the death penalty. >>5) It sends the wrong message TURN- we kill people who kill people because they killed someone! They have shown how they want society to be, and therefore they should receive what they have done. Also, every punishment does this according to my opponent. If someone steals a million dollars, or kidnaps a child, then we fine the person who stole and put the kidnapper in jail. My opponent would completely remove all punishment because all punishment does just what my opponent says makes no sense. >>6) Life sentences are more punishment. TURN- Wait a second. My opponent claims that the death penalty is barbaric, cruel and unusual, then claims that we should give them a life sentence, because its worse? This is an obvious contradiction. Therefore, if he is to state that we should give a worse punishment, then there is no reason not to give the death penalty. >>7) Other countries. The US should not act in such a way that other countries want us to. If other countries wanted us to withdraw our military forces from every other country(which by the way many do) should we? Of course not, this would completely blind us to any impending attack and thus strip us of defense. >>8) Jury members are reluctant to convict. TURN- in the situation where the prosecutor goes for a lesser charge, my opponent states justice won't be served. Thus he acknowledges that the death penalty is just. End of debate right here. Second, the prosecutor doesn't decide what the punishment is, only the charges, i.e. murder 1, murder 2. >>9) Family's Pain They will suffer either way, the trial will be emotionally draining either way. Also, the victim's family will suffer knowing that the kill is still alive after his actions. >>10) Possibility of innocents killed. My opponent even previously stated that they go through such a long appeal process meant to ensure no innocents are killed. Second, DNA testing almost completely destroys that possibility in modern times. >>11) Mentally Ill people may be killed. But my opponent ignores the fact that you can plead not guilty for reasons of insanity, when you will be examined by medical professionals. If you are found to be mentally insane, you will not be killed but moved to a secure psychiatric facility. >>12) It creates sympathy. First, this has no impact. What some people yell, a dozen others will think the opposite. My opponent offers no stats stating the majority of people thought Tookie should be saved, only the idea that a group of people did. Also, does this really matter? We can't let the popularity of each decision be the reason if its right or wrong; if we did slavery was right in 1700. >>13) It's useless. Far from it. By using the death penalty, you ensure that there will be no more victims from this murderer and justice is upheld. Additionally, I have no idea why my opponent is bringing the idea of anger, hate and revenge into this. The death penalty is about none of those, it is a way to ensure that the criminal is given his or her due.",

            "premise": "In response to Pro\"s argument, I will present two main points that will potentially negate the idea that the death penalty should be legal. First I will talk of the death penalty\"s effectiveness and lastly my main opinion on why we should get rid of the death penalty all together. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First off, I will address the common argument for supporting the death penalty. Some people tend to believe that the death penalty is effective in lowering crime rates, but I will prove why this is wrong. Although crime rates overall have been decreasing, it has no concrete relation to the use of the death penalty. According to FBI statistics from 2012 to 2013, the number of violent crimes had decreased by 4.4 percent (1). While this is an amazing thing for our country, the crime rates have decreased everywhere, even in states without the death penalty. Graph-> http://s3.amazonaws.com... (I am not sure if this link will show up since my others didn't, but it just shows the 15 states without the death penalty, and the 35 states with it). This map of the U.S. shows us that a large majority of the states have legalized the death penalty. So, according to many peoples\" arguments, these states should have lower crime rates, right? This isn't so. According to an article in the Huffington Post based on statistics gathered from the FBI, 8 of the top 10 most dangerous states in the U.S. are all states that have legalized the death penalty, with the highest being Tennessee at an average of 643.6 violent crimes per 100,000 people (2). Also, according to another article, the top 2 safest states in the U.S. are both states without the death penalty (3). Now let\"s look take a look at crime rates in other countries without the death penalty as well, more specifically, our neighbor Canada. When looking at the comparison of crime rates between Canada and the U.S., a startling thing jumps out at you, Canada\"s crime rates are significantly lower. The United States\" crime levels are 43% higher, the murder rate is 23 times more, the rape rate is 16 times more, and so on (4). While this doesn't truly prove that having no death penalty is more effective, it does negate the need for a death penalty at all. So, if the death penalty isn't helping lower crime rates (by scaring people into refraining from violent acts), then why do most people believe it should be allowed? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The question above takes me into my next point. The reason some people believe it should be allowed is for the simple fact that they hate the criminal for what he/she has done. And they wish to obtain revenge. Although this person has killed or raped/molested another human, that should not condone giving them a death sentence. Killing this human being will not bring back the person that they killed. It will not right their wrong. How, in any way, are we teaching people that murder is wrong if we turn around and do it ourselves? More often than not, life in prison is even worse for a criminal. If we restrict what criminals of capital crimes can do within a prison to working, sleeping, and eating (no Internet for criminals of capital crimes like many prisons have today), we may be able to work on crime like murder without losing our humanity. Also, like my opponent stated before, there are some cases where a criminal was actually found to be innocent after being put to death. Faults like these can be avoided if the death penalty wasn't legal. Likewise, if we get rid of the death penalty, our country will save money as well because cases involving the death penalty are often around twice as much money than cases involving a life-sentence in prison (5). The country must take action with supporting humane ways to deal with criminals of capital offense and must implement counseling for all criminals. We should also encourage classes in high schools across the country to bring awareness to crimes such as murder and rape, and why these crimes should not be committed. We need to bring awareness to these actions, especially since they are seen as socially unacceptable to talk about, so most kids will grow up to be mindful of how serious these crimes are. Instead of going blind to our wrath and using the death penalty, our country must work together to lower crime rates (granted there will ALWAYS be crime) without being hypocrites and condoning the killing of criminals of capital punishment. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In conclusion, the death penalty should be illegal because it doesn't decrease the rate of crimes, and killing criminals out of anger (and a want for revenge) will not support the idea that murdering is wrong, due to the hypocrisy behind the idea.

            "conclusion": "Death Penalty",
            "premise": "I will be providing six reasons as to why the Death Penalty should not be utilized.PriceThe drugs themselves that are used to kill the criminal are cheap, but the necessary processes and procedures leading up to the day of execution are extremely expensive. Death Penalty cases cost an average of 1.25 million dollars more than the average life without parole or other cases[1]. Some people may argue that while the cases themselves cost more, money is actually saved in the long-run, due to the fact that life without parole prisoners take up money being provided for by the prison system. This line of thought is incorrect. If we take the state of California for an example, we see that if they got rid of the Death Penalty, their prison system's expenditures would go from its current 137 million dollars to 11.5 million dollars, and in five years California could save a billion dollars[1]. These statistics show that the system doesn't start getting its money back over time, instead it just loses more and more of it. DeterrenceProponents of the Death Penalty often support their position with the idea that the Death Penalty deters crime. Often these claims go un-sourced, because there is little data to support this. Even when a study comes back saying that the Death Penalty deters crime, 88% of criminologists are un-swayed, holding the belief that the Death Penalty isn't a deterrent[2]. Here are some quotes, explaining their reasons for not believing in the Death Penalty's deterring capabilities, and some reasons on why the studies that support the deterrence theory are invalid in their findings and practices:Tomislav Kovandsic PhD\"Our results provide no empirical support for the argument that the existence or application of the death penalty deters prospective offenders from committing homicide... Although policymakers and the public can continue to base support for use of the death penalty on retribution, religion, or other justifications, defending its use based solely on its deterrent effect is contrary to the evidence presented here. At a minimum, policymakers should refrain from justifying its use by claiming that it is a deterrent to homicide and should consider less costly, more effective ways of addressing crime.\"[2]Jeffery A. Fagan PhD\"Recent studies claiming that executions reduce crime... fall apart under close scrutiny. These new studies are fraught with numerous technical and conceptual errors: inappropriate methods of statistical analysis, failures to consider all the relevant factors that drive crime rates, missing data on key variables in key states, the tyranny of a few outlier states and years, weak to non-existent tests of concurrent effects of incarceration, statistical confounding of murder rates with death sentences, failure to consider the general performance of the criminal justice system... and the absence of any direct test of deterrence.These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims... Social scientists have failed to replicate several of these studies, and in some cases have produced contradictory results with the same data, suggesting that the original findings are unstable, unreliable and perhaps inaccurate. This evidence, together with some simple examples and contrasts... suggest that there is little evidence that the death penalty deters crime.\"[2]Lethal InjectionThe lethal injection process does not provide the calm death that many of us are lead to believe. Lethal injection can cause excruciating pain[3][4]. This fact may not sway everyone, certainly, but for those of you who thought we were just killing these people, instead of subjecting them to torture before death, should consider this. Getting the Wrong GuySince humans aren't perfect, we will never be able to eliminate the possibility of making a mistake, and sending an innocent man to his death. While courts will not go back and admit they messed up, new evidence has come to light on several cases, one which concluded as recently as 2011, that innocent men were executed[5]. Proponents of the Death Penalty may claim that this won't happen anymore thanks to advances in DNA testing. To that I would respond that if you follow this link, not all of the new evidence found is related to DNA. Some of it is just new evidence from an unconsidered angle.And our courts have corrected 140 of their mistakes since 1973[6]. For those 140, that's all swell, but what about the people they missed? What about the mistakes they didn't catch? Retribution's LogicMany proponents of the Death Penalty believe killing a man who has murdered is the right thing to do, because of the 'eye for an eye' mentality. They say that it makes things equal. I agree with that, but what should be noted that we are also equally bad for doing this. If we stoop down to the level of a murderer to kill him, how are we any better than him? Because we say we are? A man murders because he thinks the victim should be dead. We kill the murderer because we think he should be dead. Both the system and the murderer are allowing their subjective viewpoints to determine their actions. When the Death Penalty is used, we do not have a moral high ground over a murderer, since we are behaving in the same way he has. Retribution vs PriceProponents of the Death Penalty often claim that it should be kept in place in order to provide retribution, and therein provide comfort and solace to the families of the victims. I could argue back and forth with my opponent about whether or not the Death Penalty provides solace to victims' families, but that is not necessary. The reality probably is that the results of the Death Penalty in that regard are varied. For the sake of this argument, let's pretend that revenge makes all families feel better. Look at the big picture. Refer back to my Price and Getting the Wrong Guy sections. Even if it makes families sad because they go without retribution, billions of dollars go back to the state if there is no Death Penalty. It is a logical sacrifice to make. A couple sad families in exchange for funneling millions or billions of dollars back into state education, road, or mental health services. Then, look at the fact that we can be executing innocent men. What is worse, risking the death of an innocent man, or leaving a couple families without retribution?Sources:[1] http://www.deathpenalty.org...[2] http://deathpenalty.procon.org...[3] http://www.amnestyusa.org...[4] http://www.motherjones.com...[5] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...[6] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...",

            "premise": "- The death penalty clearly isn't murder, but rather justice, because it isn't unlawful, and it is the administration of the law. + Justice is not the practice of law but rather making things right. Is arresting blacks for months for j - walking justice during the civil rights era? Is lynching Irish men for being too close to town justice? The death penalty is murder because it is kiling people. Essentially, it is revenge. Why is it fine for the government to kill a person for killing a person and not a person to kill anothe person. Whydon;t we let victims; families murder the murderer if your point is logical? - We don't use the death penalty to make the person scared, we use it to serve justice, and prevent anyone from ever doing what they have done again. + Life in prison keeps people out of society and the overcrwding of the prisons is not so serious of an issue that you have to kill off the criminals one by one so there will be more space. - We serve justice to make our country safe, not to make criminals pay for their crimes. If we wanted them to pay we wouldn't spend so much tax money on prisons. + Prisons make people pay BIG. Their whole life is not only taken away but allowed to live miserably. Prisons make our country just as safe if not safeer than the death penalty. - You state that you can be aqquited wrongly, but yet you don't deserve the punishment? That doesn't make sense. + I mean that you can be accused wrongly and then you will get murdered. People are released from prison for crimes they did not commit constantly. - Please show me where exactly in the Constitution it states that the death penalty shouldn't be allowed. + 8th Ammendment: Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. - Cruel-1: disposed to inflict pain or suffering Unusual- not accordant with usage, custom, or habit + To die is to make one suffer the realization of finality of life. The process of making somebody know that they will be murdered is cruel. The death penalty was not enacted until recently. You dont say where you got your definition. You could have defined these words. - The death penalty is used in a way which is quick, and painless, also it has been around for centuries upon centuries, and is not at all unusual. + Making somebody know that they will never live again is not painless. - We shouldn't take away the death penalty because it is used unfairly, does that mean we should take away prisons too? Economic status, and race can effect sentence time, and whether or not you go too, then should we ban colleges? The poor can't afford college, it is clearly unfair to them. Maybe what you meant to say was that the administration of the death penalty should be better regulated. + All of these things are reversible. You can release somebody from prison, give them parole, allow them into your college, etc but you cant give them life. - Being wrongly convicted is nearly unheard of with today's technology. + People can constantly be convicted from angry juries and DNA testing releases people constantly. - A criminal is also statistically proven to commit another crime. Do we really want repeat offenses by people who's first crimes were bad enough for the death penalty? + Show me the actual statistics. Prisons can hold people so that they never commit another crime. - We shouldn't let criminals get by just because it is expensive to serve justice. Educating people who aren't in the United States legally costs millions, but we still do that don't we? + Its an unecessary expense and illegals' education is necessary. - You have stated above that it is important innocent people don't get what they don't deserve, this is why we have appeals. + Appeals dont ALWAYS work. - Crimes worthy of the death penalty are much more than a painless lethal injection. + Not true. These crimes include rape and plain murder including: LETHAL INJECTIONS!!! - We don't kill people for the sake of the fact that they have killed someone, you have to do much more than just kill someone for the death penalty, and we do it to keep the public safe. + You keep making this point. Prisons keep people from committing second crimes. - We need to worry about the safety of the public, and serving justice, before we worry about foreign affairs. + Foreign affairs is safety of the public. Its our economy and how they feel militarily about us. Also, death penalties dont keep us any more safe than prisons. - We must think about the safety of the public, and what the victims families have been through. + PRISONS!!! PRISONS!!! PRISONS!!! - To add to my arguments I would like to note that the death penalty is used sparingly, and crimes punishable by death are far worse than just murder. If we don't give these people what they deserve, we are allowing them to live for free off of the peoples taxes, without getting what they deserve, and, in a sense, they get away with their crime. If someone knows that they can kill, and live to tell about it, the chances of them doing it are greater, putting society in danger. + PRISONS!!! You just said \"the death penalty is used sparingly\", translation: we dont use it often. its just an occasional barbaric murder!!!

            "conclusion": "The death penalty should NOT be allowed",
            "premise": "First counterargments round:Rebuttal for self responsibility: Self-responsibility should only be discusses when talking about crime as a whole - it has nothing to do with the death penalty individully. 4% is not a small number, think of the ratio (1 in every 25 people) and you will realize that if you took an average classroom amount of kids to jail for crimes - one of the kids in the class would be innocent. The criminals can be self-responsible for the crimes they committed by serving and taking a punishment for their actions - wheither death penalty is legal or not - the criminal will still be held responsible for his actions. So how would your point be relavent for this spacific topic since we are not discussing crime in general?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rebuttal for deters crime: But the death pentalty is murder itself - either way, the government is killing people; and it actually does influence crime rate. Take this chart for example: Deterrence: States Without the Death Penalty Have Had Consistently Lower Murder Rates Year 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Murder Rate in Death Penalty States* 9.94 9.51 9.69 9.23 8.59 7.72 7.09 6.51 5.86 5.70 5.82 5.82 5.91 5.71 5.87 5.90 5.83 5.72 5.26 5.00 4.89 4.95 4.72 Murder Rate inNon-death Penalty States 9.27 8.63 8.81 7.88 6.78 5.37 5.00 4.61 4.59 4.25 4.25 4.27 4.10 4.02 4.03 4.22 4.10 4.05 3.90 4.01 4.13 4.09 3.88 PercentDifference 7% 10% 10% 17% 27% 44% 42% 41% 28% 35% 37% 36% 44% 42% 46% 40% 42% 41% 35% 25% 18% 21% 22% As you can see, the states which prohibit the death penalty have lower crime rates then those who do. \"Indeed, 10 of the 12 states without capital punishment have homicide rates below the national average, Federal Bureau of Investigation data shows, while half the states with the death penalty have homicide rates above the national average. In a state-by- state analysis, The Times found that during the last 20 years, the homicide rate in states with the death penalty has been 48 percent to 101 percent higher than in states without the death penalty.\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rebuttal for economically benefitial: That is simply false - \"Cases without the death penalty cost $740,000, while cases where the death penalty is sought cost $1.26 million. Maintaining each death row prisoner costs taxpayers $90,000 more per year than a prisoner in general population.\" Also, \"Cases receiving a death notice are approximately $517,000 more costly during the trial phase, $147,000 more costly during the penalty phase, and $201,000 more costly during the appellate phase than a capital eligible case where no death notice was filed\u2026. On average, a death notice adds about $1,000,000 in costs over the duration of a case.\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rebuttal for Bible: Jesus taught believers to forgive: \"But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\" Mat. 6:15 the New Testament teaches Christians not to judge: \"Judge not, that you be not judged.\" Mat. 7:1 Paul taught believers to: Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse... Repay no one evil for evil... do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, \"Vengeance is Mine, I Will repay,\" says the Lord.\"Rom. 12:14, 17, 19 Jesus also stated: thou shall not kill. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rebuttal for justice: But that is hypocritical. We are killing people for... killing people! We are going against ourselves completely. We are saying to people: you cannot kill people or we will kill you (you cannot do it but we can). Dosent that give the government WAY more authority over human life then they should have? We can balance justice in other ways - life imprisonment is a MUCH harsher sentencing then being killed. In fact, more justice would be brought upon our citizens if we abolished the death penalty because, all criminals who would be killed before, would be rotting in their cells every day with no escape, thinking about what they did. \"More death-row inmates have been volunteering for their executions: Between 1993 and 2002, 75 volunteered for death, compared to the 22 consensual executions between 1977 and 1992. (Gary Gilmore, the first prisoner put to death after the Supreme Court reinstituted capital punishment in 1976, \"volunteered\" for his execution in 1977 because he did not want to live the rest of his life on death row.)\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rebuttal for better enviroment: Actually, it increases murder in prisons.Death Penalty Retentionist States vs. Abolitionist States (data from Bureau of Justice Statistics):\u2022 Between 2001 and 2007, states with the death penalty had considerably higher prison murder rates on average (4.25/100,000, with four of 38 states reporting no prison homicides in that time period) than those states without the death penalty (.92/100,000, with 7 of 12 states reporting no prison homicides).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rebuttal for overpopulation: Prison overpopulation is currently not an issue since not a lot of people are currently in prison. Think about it (1.8/314 million people are in prison) That is less than one percent of the population. So currently, we do not need to worry about overcrowding because every prisoner currently has a cell - and prisons currently are not struggling finding cells for prisoners. So why make this a concern when it is not? The government can always just build more prisons - why should we have to MURDER people instead of actually doing some work to build prisons and cells (even though they are not needed at the moment) they can save lives in the long run.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I also wanted to point out how imprisonating people instead of killing them stops them from doing crimes in the near future.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources:http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...;http://kgov.com...;http://www.theologyonline.com...;http://abcnews.go.com...;https://death.rdsecure.org...;http://listverse.com...http://www.commondreams.org...http://www.antideathpenalty.org...http://www.nodeathpenalty.org...",

            "premise": "REBUTTAL, EXECUTION OF INNOCENTSMy opponent brings the fallibility of man into play, citing the fact that innocents have most likely been wrongfully executed. He also cites courtroom bias as affecting the sentencing process. I feel that the answer to this is pretty clear cut. We should of course work to reform the system to lessen the amount of innocents that face execution, but at the end of the day, we need to look at this from a big picture perspective. What is worse, the death of one innocent, or the deaths of 74? Now I am not suggesting that the government pick innocents off the streets and execute them to prevent crime, I'm merely pointing out the overall good this punishment does. Of course we do not wish the innocent to be executed, but even when the mistake is made, it is very likely that mistake will prevent the deaths of many. My opponent claims it is the job of the government to protect the citizenry, and if this is the case, the Death Penalty is the way forward. It is not a pretty solution, but it is a better alternative when the other option is allowing the indirect deaths of 74 because we didn't want to be directly responsible for the death of one innocent. The execution of innocents is an unfortunate side-effect of the implementation of the Death Penalty, but it is in the interests of the greater good of the society that uses the Death Penalty.REBUTTAL, MONEY COULD BE BETTER SPENTThe speaker from my opponent's source does not tell us how many lives could be saved by taking the Death Penalty money and putting it elsewhere, probably because there is no evidence to support how many lives, nor is their much money (relatively) to be funneled back to other state services. This is continuing with my point that the Death Penalty is really not as expensive as it is often represented as. The price that the Death Penalty usually amounts to is like a grain of sand on a beach in comparison to the state's spending. For instance, in Maryland, each Death Penalty case costs $3M (previously cited). The state of Maryland will be spending over $8B this year[1]. So if you took the money from a Death Penalty case and put it back into the state's budget, you would be adding less than a percent to their available spending money. Far, far less than a percent. And that's not even taking to account that a life without parole case in Maryland is $1.1M (previously cited).I know the above is one example, but it merely there to demonstrate my point. Unless you're a state like California, you're unlikely to see that big of a jump in spending money if you were to abolish your Death Penalty. You could probably get more spending money (without indirectly causing the deaths of many innocents) by reforming your state spending in other areas, such as simple efficiency. REBUTTAL, PROPORTIONALITYMost of my opponent's case seems to be centered around the fact that many mentally ill or otherwise disaffected individuals have been executed. First, I'd like to lessen some of the hype my opponent has placed on the condition of those sentenced. In the arena of the mentally ill, only 4% of men ever executed were mentally ill[2][3]. And since according to my opponent's source the Supreme Court has outlawed the execution of the mentally ill, we no longer need to worry about that.Frankly, this case my opponent is making is only partially valid for the question at hand. If the resolution was, \"The Death Penalty needs reform\", then he would have a great point. Because that's all this argument of unfair executions warrants--a need for reform. If we have people who are addicted to substances, I agree, if they're not responsible for their actions thanks to the drug addiction, why should we hold them accountable? Instead we should check them into some kind of facility that specializes in drug addiction recovery. But the point is, you can do this without abolishing the Death Penalty. Deciding to abolish the Death Penalty over convictions of those you consider not responsible for their actions is like deciding to sell your house because you don't like the front door. Just change the front door! Keep the house! If you look at the numbers of those who are saved by the Death Penalty's implementation, we can view these executions as necessary. Perhaps it wouldn't be 100% 'right' to execute a poor person because they killed someone, but if it reduced murders, and the fall guy is a murderer, how can you say that it is an overall wrong thing to do? For everyone of these men executed, 74 are saved.CONCLUSIONIn the end, it comes down to the greater good. Even if the justice system fails in some way, executing someone you don't think deserved it, think about what the 74 who are saved deserve. This is not about what the criminals deserve, it is about what the public deserves.

            "premise": "I look forward to a great debate! Good luck to my opponent!The death penalty should be done away with because there is an alternative to that: Life in prison. Here are some of the costs if the alternative is not taken:- \"The study estimates that the average cost to Maryland taxpayers for reaching a single death sentence is $3 million - $1.9 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case. (This includes investigation, trial, appeals, and incarceration costs.)\"[1]- \"Once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made\"[2]However, if the alternative is taken, if an inmate is later on proven innocent, it can be; He can be released from prison.Some of death penalty's advocates claim that it is a detterent to all crime. However, as recently stated by the General Assembly of the United Nations, \"there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent value of the death penalty.\"[3]There not only is no conclusive evidence to its detterent value, but logically thinking, criminals know that their life is over. Thus, they just make the last of it and commit more crimes while they can.Most of society support death penalty, yes. However, that does not instantly mean that the death penalty is effective. You have to logically think it yourself AND hear out the opposition. The resolution is affirm.

            "premise": "Since I have already discussed about Death Penalty's crime deterrence, it is time to focus on its capability to retribute and rectitude. I will also disprove its being unconstitutional and other things.RetributionAccording to Budziszewski, \"Deserved punishment protects society morally by restoring this just order, making the wrongdoer pay a price equivalent to the harm he has done.\u201d [1] When a person performs a crime, it unsettles the society's order. Therefore, death penalty simply rebuilds order to society and modestly punishes the criminal for his crime. Retribution also gives justice for the victims and their families, revenge per se, but without malice. For this reason, it proves the simple definition of retribution.RectitudeFor the abolitionists, they say that the government has no right to take the life of a person. However, according to Immanuel Kant (among other philosophers), \"a society that is not willing to demand a life of somebody who has taken taken somebody else's life is simply immoral.\" This has rebutted all other claims about having this as immoral. The criminal isn't killed inhumanely as all of the states that has this use lethal injection because the U.S. Constitution's 8th amendment states that they shouldn't practice cruel and unusual punishment. No one is calling this unconstitutional. \u201c\u2026No system of justice can produce results which are 100% certain all the time. Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof. We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes. Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases. However, the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small, and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976\u2026The inevitability of a mistake should not serve as grounds to eliminate the death penalty any more than the risk of having a fatal wreck should make automobiles illegal\u2026\u201d Steven D. Stewart, Prosecuting Attorney.And, the criminal's race or economic class is not relevant. If you're guilty, you should receive the right punishment. It is said that poverty creates criminals and there is more chance that they will receive this. However, Ernest van de Haag says:\u201cPunishments are imposed on persons, not on\u2026economic groups. Guilt is personal. The only relevant question is: does the person to be executed deserve the punishment? Whether or not others deserved the same punishment, whatever the economic or racial group, have avoided execution is irrelevant.\u201d [2]In 2002, there were approximately 1,526 people killed in 31 countries, and 3,248 people that were receiving this in 67 countries. Plus the 81% of executions in China, Iran, and the USA. [3] That data is just for 2002 and as the population grows, the figure also grows. Therefore, it is helpful to lower down the number of inmates on death row. \"Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.\" - Dudley Sharp [4](1) http://www.orthodoxytoday.org...(2) http://www.pbs.org...(3) http://www.cbsnews.com...(4) http://www.prodeathpenalty.com...

I reserve the right to make new contentions in future rounds. Contention 1: Costs Too Much [1] The government spends millions of dollars paid for by the taxpayers, just to try to get a person killed. This is, to put it simply, a waste of money. It costs much less money to keep people convicted of high felonies locked up under maximum security, and it would also create jobs in security. Contention 2: Risky People are often released from Death Row through DNA evidence that previously was unavaliable. [2] \"In the U.S., as of June 2002, 108 people including 12 death row inmates, have been exonerated by use of DNA tests.\" This means that the death penalty has most likely killed at least one innocent person. Keeping people under maximum security would allow for the release of a person later discovered to be innocent. The death penalty, however, once delivered, cannot be repealed. That should do it for now. Good luck to my future opponent. 1. http://www.deathpenalty.org... 2. http://www.aclu.org...",

            "premise": "Yes people don't believe it but you have to have faith but that's besides the point. I My next claim | this is what you would say. \\/ There are more pros to the death penalty than cons. Yes people can get wrongly executed One of the arguments of opponents of death penalty is the inevitability of sending innocent people who are wrongly accused to death row and eventually execution. In relation to free will, some criminals are suffering from mental illness or are having clouded judgment at the time of the crime.Opponents contend that there are instances where people commit pre-meditated crimes and are aware of what they are doing. However, it does not discount the fact that crimes can also be committed out of passion or extreme anger triggered by a situation which makes an offender act on impulse. There are also those who are suffering from mental illnesses and are not taking medication which can lead to them committing offenses they have no control of. It is an added cost to the government and taxpayers\" money, With the argument that life imprisonment with no parole is more expensive, opponents say that in general, the government spends more taxpayers\" money in handling cases of death row inmates. This is due to the length and complexity of trials, the number or defenders to be hired and the overall process. They contend that there are two trials the state will spend for. One is for the verdict and another for the sentencing, not including the number of appeals that will be submitted while keeping the convicted prisoner inside maximum security. Death penalty is a form of revenge, While proponents say that imposing capital punishment is a form of retribution, that is, to punish who has committed a crime, opponents argue that it is revenge. For the latter, to avenge a crime committed to another individual may be understandable but killing someone for murdering another person is also unconstitutional. It is crime in itself that is only masked by the term capital punishment and in truth, only continues the series of violence. It is a platform that is anti-poor and discriminatoryand Those who are death row inmates and sentenced to death are mostly based on racial discrimination as evidenced by a high percentage of inmates being African-American and members of the minority. Moreover, accused individuals who are poor are mostly the ones who get the death penalty for the reason that they lack the finances to seek for great and powerful defense attorneys. They don\"t have the money to pay for good defense. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is my info -Death penalty costs the government less as opposed to life imprisonment without parole.Proponents say despite expenses incurred by the government from imposing capital punishment, death penalty is still cheaper compared to the costs of life without parole. Although there is no contention that the cost of the former is high, life imprisonment is accumulatively higher given the expenses for food, health care and other costs of sustaining the lives of incarcerated individuals serving life. -It deters would-be criminals to commit felonies and Advocates of death penalty cite examples on how imposing the death sentence or abolishing it have affected crime rate. According to a study conducted in the late 1960\"s, there was a 7% crime rate increase on the years when this law was abolished. On the other hand, fewer crimes were committed with the increase in number of inmates in the death row who were executed each year. Proponents say that these figures clearly indicate the efficacy of capital punishment on deterring crimes. - The absence of death penalty is synonymous to crime rate increase.As reported by time magazine, an estimated 2,000,000 people in the United States have been victims of crimes, from assault to murder. With insufficient laws to address this problem or the lack of teeth in these laws, criminals become careless and bolder to commit heinous crimes because of the leniency in punishments and loop holes in the justice system. For these reason, there is a need for death penalty. -It is constitutional and does not violate the Eight Amendment which prohibits the federal government from imposing excessive bail, fines and cruel and unusual punishments, including torture. Advocates of death penalty say that the pain associated with the execution of a death row inmate is not improbable. Even the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the Eight Amendment challenge which stated that the drug used to render the criminal coma-like unconscious before injecting the lethal drug is not capable to do so completely. The Supreme Court was firm on its stand that any method of execution definitely will inflict some pain and states with capital punishment have already adopted more humane methods to carry out executions. -Death penalty is a just punishment for crimes committed against the rights to life, freedom and safety of victims. It is the right of an individual to live peacefully and be free from harm. Unfortunately, crimes like murder, rape and assault are committed by perpetrators who have no regard for life and property of others. Since they violate other people\"s lives, it is but fair that they are brought to justice and suffer the fate they rightfully deserve. People who are for capital punishment also talk about free will wherein an individual is given the right to do things in his or her own volition and he or she is responsible for his or her own fate. All of this shows that it is constitutional, and it would make the victim get peace or have freedom. What would you want the judge to say if you or a loved one got killed, or maybe your whole family except for you that no has to suffer from what happened? Please answer.",

            "premise": "To explain the idiotic forfeit, my mom stole my computer which forced me to forfeit. Sorry about that. Give my opponent the conduct point. 1st, just because most Americans are pro-death penalty does not mean that we should do what they say. 139 countries having abolished it after using capital punishment for 10 or more years compared to 58 nations actively using it today. Just because the people agree with something does not mean it should be allowed! This is just an example which does not have to be true: If the majority of the people think that mosques should not be allowed to be built in all circumstances, does it make what they said right? This is a huge problem! People assuming that whatever the majority of the people believe, it's always right and that we should do what they say. 2nd of all, the concept that it deters crime does not account for many things. How does capital punishment save lives? Is my opponent honestly saying that because the USA allows death penalties that it prevents crime? Crime is the greatest in the USA even though the USA have the death penalty and executed the 5th most people in the world recently. Many people are not affected by the death penalty as to see that it depends on what kind of crimes they are but many people would rather be able to gain money, drugs, revenge, or something addicting by doing a crime even though of the risks. They don't think of the consequences but they just do it without thinking or considering the death penalty. Just because all of the people that you have said believes that the death penalty deters crime can not beat back the 87% of expert criminologists who say that the death penalty does not help deter crime at all and the 88% of the top criminologists who say that the abolition of the death penalty would not have any significant effect on crime rates. Also For 2010, the average Murder Rate of Death Penalty States was 4.6, while the average Murder Rate of States without the Death Penalty was 2.9. Also all of the top 10 states with crime all have the death penalty. It's also not biased in the size of the state rather per 100,000 people. In 2008, 14 states without capital punishment were either at or below the national homicide rates. So all of your supposed \"facts\" in this contention are all wrong because they can't beat back all of these points that I have been showing to you. Also there can be and there has been wrongful executions. As many as 39 people in the U.S. have been executed from 1992 to 2004 because of the death penalty. 138 death row defendants were released since 1973 because of wrongful convictions and withheld papers. That is extremely unfair because of costing one's life just because of the death penalty. Even being in jail because of a misjudgement is better than being executed in the case of a misjudgement. Plus the death penalty is racially biased. 77% of death row defendants are executed for killing a white person but half of the victims are black. . I have so many more points I would like to make and also go into detail about many of them but I have to move on to the other contentions. 3rd of all, the death penalty doesn't actually give any closure to victim families. Sure, the victim's families may hate the defendants and want to hurt them but the death penalty doesn't actually help them feel any better. Let's take a look at Achilles when he lost his best friend Patroclus in the Trojan War. He was dissatisfied with all of the slaughtering of the Trojans and the torturing and killing of the killer Hector but was still empty until the day that he wept for an entire night with the killer's father. Sure, loss of friends and family members will always be a sad thing but the killing of the murderer doesn't necessarily put back what the people close to that victim have lost. The families will never totally recover and revenge by the death penalty is from the government is not going to put an \"ending chapter to this mess\". I also ask my opponent to tell me how many murderers in jail until they die have escaped and haunted the family. Also about releasing killers, would you give me some facts please? I have made my point that the death penalty has no significant effect and will never put an \"ending chapter to this mess\" on the people close to the murdered person. 4th of all, is justice served if he has to live in jail for the rest of his life? Yes! Justice is not better served by death penalty than living in jail for the rest of your life. Death is getting executed but life in jail till death is everyday torture knowing you will live the rest of your life in a cell. I would say life in jail till death serves justice better than the death penalty because if you die, you die. No more suffering, pain, hardships. None of the bad things or good things. But life in a prison cell until death is torture for many years to come. 5th of all, if God doesn't tell us to do the death penalty why should we do it. The fist two verses are from the Old Testament which is specifically God the Father wanted the Israelites to use capital punishment because there was no other way to do it. If you disagree with that statement, I bet you $10 (not $10,000 like Romney but $10 like Gingrich) thats you won't be able to find another way to punish a murder or death that is not capital punishment during their time which is an estimated to be after Ahmose and before Assyrians and Babylonians take over Israel and Judah. Also few people would use the capital punushment as the Old Testament says such as doing work on the Sabbath, false prophecy or making false statements about a woman's virginity. In the 3rd verse, it clearly doesn't mean a literal meaning. It means that Christians must not use their freedom from the Old Testament religious Law as an excuse to violate the civil law. We must obey civil authority, which is instituted by God, because of fear of punishment as well as conscience. The principles set forth by Jesus and the apostles restrict punishment to only that which is necessary to protect society and rather than giving. Jesus taught great principles for us to apply in our lives, rather than specific laws. Thus, his failure to specifically condemn slavery, capital punishment and many other evils should not be interpreted as approval of capital punishment. I see the mercy He showed to the woman caught in adultery as His rejection of capital punishment. However, Jesus never specifically repudiated capital punishment. Even if you want to go by the Old Testament which is totally irrelevant, the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:13 says \"Though shall not kill.\" The original Hebrew word ratsach, translated as \"kill\" or \"murder\" could refer to either killing in general or unlawful killing (murder). This is only if you want to argure the irrelevant way. 6th of all, \"it is constitutional\" is not a good reason. The Constitution has been changed so much and is always debated about if a part is correct or not. Just because our current law says that doesn't mean that it's right. If a country's \"constitution\" says that slavery is allowed, is that right? There are many flaws in every country's laws and this is one of them. 7th of all, the death penalty costs and diverts much more resources from genuine crime control and more expensive than alternative sentences. Death penalty is not at all cheap but expensive. The death penalty does cost a lot and may be more than life in jail but it depends on the time. Death penalty costs a whole lot on a one time event, life in jail costs a little every year so that is why death penalty is more expensive because it's a one time event.I have negated all of my opponent's contentions and have made my own points in the crowded rebuttal of my 2nd contention.

This makes the punishment inhumane and unconstitutional. 3. There is no solid evidence to prove that the death penalty deteriorates crime rates. So what is the point? If anything, it is an easy way out. 4. 1/7 people executed are innocent, why take the chance? 5. The cost of the death penalty is much greater then it would cost to give prisoners/victims life imprisonment. I will await for your rebuttals and then pose a counterargument against such rebuttals.",

Unless Given poison like from frog snake(yes considered drug) then should death penalty be in forced, because thats trying to murder. all people are close to one another 1 guys knows this guy that knows that guy ect. there going to get hurt also for what being nice and giving someone something. anyone in possesion of DMT are called instantly for death penalty no court. and there still yet to find one thing wrong with dmt. what if it was in your pocket someone had you hold on to it. and your found with it you will die and cant say idk what it was or your holding on to it you die.",

Con also didn't rebut many of my arguments, as is apparent in the previous rounds. Again, I hope to have shown that the death penalty should not be abolished.

However, the death penalty is used to make sure that very dangerous criminals are not allowed to kill innocents in society again. Also, the method used in the death penalty is very carefully tested to make sure it is painless and quick. Currently, the method most used is lethal injection, which is relatively humane. A commonly used drug is sodium thiopental, which is used as an anesthetic when given in lower doses. At a lethal dose, the prisoner would not feel anything (1). Again, the death penalty is only used in spare cases, and so should be left as an option of last resort. (1): http://listverse.com...",

They deserve to lose their life because they killed innocent people. If murderers get a second chance than most potential murderers will still commit murder. Giving murderers a second chance does not deter future murders. If murderers get a second chance than some of them might commit murder after they get out of prison. Some people do commit a crime again after they get out of prison. The government shouldn't take the risk of that happening. The government should keep inncocent people safe by making sure that murderers lose their life instead of getting a second chance. The government should only use the death penalty when there is clear evidence of murder. This way innocent people will not get the death penalty. There are other ways to lower murder rates and other punishment could be more effective:I agree that teaching moral values will prevent people from commiting murder but that's not the only way to do it. The government should also prevent people from commiting murder by making the punishment is a lot worse. There are studies that show that the death penalty deters future murders. The studies are described in this article. http://www.washingtonpost.com... the death penaty may not have an effect on the murder rate but abolishing it would not deter future murders. If the death penalty is done in a painful way than it will deter murder by even more because more people will be scared to commit murder. Why would anyone want to get killled in a painful way? The way they should use the death penalty is by shooting the murderer with a gun. The key to lowering the murder rate is teaching moral values and scaring potential murderers by using harsher punishments.Murderers could have killed murdered intention of destruction:If the court is not sure if the murder happned by accident, for self defense or intentionally than they should not give the defendant a punishment. The court should get clear evidence and find out if the muder happened intentionally or not before they give the defendant a punishment.Conclusion:It was a pleasure having this debate with you. The voters will vote for the person that did a better job debating. Good Luck on your last chance to argue.",

Also, if these criminals were allowed to return to society, they would pose the risk of threatening more people, therefore under the util framework the death penalty would be permissible.\"Life-time imprisonment does not allow criminals back into society, also. ---The ultimate question is not whether or not a criminal deserves to die, but rather: Should the federal government be allowed to kill those whom it finds culpable? What suggests that the federal government, or, to be more specific, a representative of the government (i.e. a judge, who imposes the sentence) should be the arbitrator of life and death? There is no objective standard for the judge to go by, so the results of one trial can vary from one case to another; on both extremes of the spectrum, one judge may give a lenient jail sentence, while the other can impose the death sentence.

            "premise": "My opponent has decided to use the bible as justification for the death penalty. I will point out 2 problems with this:1) The Bible is not trustworthy or reliableThere are hundreds of contradictions in the Bible, even the creation story in Genesis 1 and 2 don't match up. For a list of contradictions in the Bible, here is a source for that: [4]I will point out just two of the many contradictions:, Genesis 1:25-27 reads:\"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"While Genesis 2 reads:\"And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.\"As you can see, the order in which God created animals differs from when he created mankind in these accounts. In Genesis 1, the animals were created first. In Genesis 2, Adam and Eve(who are believed to be the first humans by most Christians) were created first. A second contradiction is here:In Mathew 18:3, Mathew 19:14, Mark 10:15, and Luke 18:17, it is suggested that to enter heaven you should like a child. Yet, in 1 Corinthians 13:11. 1 Corinthians 14:20, and Ephesians 4:14, we are told we should not be like Children. There exists many more contradictions which you can look at in the source I provided.Thus, with this many contradictions, it should be clear that the Bible is not a trustworthy source of information. It should also be noted that there are thousands of Christian denominations: this is likely because of the many contradictions in the Bible: some Christians choose to believe one thing, while others choose to believe something else the Bible says. Neither are exactly wrong, because for the most part, what almost every sect believes in is likely supported by the bible, but what they believe in is also contradicted by the bible elsewhere. If the Bible was not contradictory, I'm sure there would be fewer Christian denominations and interpretations of the Bible.2) The new Testament tells us the old testament laws were fulfilled, and contradicts what my opponent suggestsIn Mathew 5:17, it is stated by Jesus himself that the old testament laws are going to be fulfilled by him. Now, I grew up as a Mormon and while in this sect, I was taught that this meant that the punishment for these laws are fulfilled by Christ, and people no longer need to be punished for breaking these laws, if they seek Jesus in their lives. I feel like this is a common view of most Chrisian sects: that you no longer need to be punished for not following Old Testament laws so long as you rely on Christ. Next, there are many examples where Jesus tells people not to punish people for breaking old testament law, such as with the adulteress woman in John 8. He says \"Let he who is without sin among you, cast the first stone\". In old testament law, a person who commits adultery would be stoned to death. Well, Jesus essentially told them that they can't and shouldn't stone the woman. If there was a murderer in the New Testament that was brought to Jesus in the same Fashion, just based off of what we know about the Biblican Jesus, he would have likely said the same thing. Thus, I believe my opponent has not offered a strong argument in this round in favor of the death penalty. Additionally, it would only appeal to those who are Christian or Jewish. And probably not even those who are Christian since they believe in the New Testament in a way usually of what I said about it. Sources:[4] http://skepticsannotatedbible.com...",

            "premise": "Sorry for the late response. I've been busy for the past few days.C1: DeterrenceThe Death Penalty serves as a determent to criminals.There is a relationship between the death penalty and murder. The deterrent effect of the death penalty helps to save lives, ultimately resulting in the overall prevention of the loss of human life [1]. Multiple studies that have occured over time have demonstrated that the death penalty saves lives [1]. Several professors of Emory University found in a 2003 nationwide study that each execution, on average, results in 18 fewer murders [6].A 2006 study found that each execution results in five fewer homicides [7]Shorter waits on death row is connectted with increased deterrence. For every 2.75-year reduction of the time a death row inmate has to wait, at least one murder is deterred. C2: Bargaining ChipThe Death Penalty provides leverage and allows prosecutors to use it as a \"bargaining chip\" to obtain guilty pleas and plea bargains [2] [3]. The criminal justice system is sped up by the DP, which helps to prevent backlogging. Research has shown that 90% of cases in the US are resolved by plea bargains, with the guilty party admitting to all or part of the offenses charged in exchange for reduced/lenient charges [4]. This showsOne example is the case of 12-year-old Zina Linnick's disappearance. Even a remote threat of using the death penalty could give enough of an incentive for a person to confess [3].Another example would be serial killers Robert Yates and Gary Ridgway. The confessed due to the threat of the death penalty [3].Without a doubt, the death penalty allows prosecutors to get information quicker. This can even possibly save lives - such as revealing the location of an abducted person about to die.C3: AccuracyDNA testing and other modern forms of forensic science have allowed us to eleminate all doubt or suspicsion towards a person's guilt or innoncence. DNA testing helps to effectively prosecuting the guilty and protects the innocent [8].Furthermore, a jury of twelve have to unanimously decide that they have no doubt that the defendent is guilty in order to sentence a person to death. [9]C4: PopularityGallup polls have shown that the majority of Americans support the Death Penalty. Our goverment is based on a republic, and a republic at its heart, is ruled by the majority.Gallup polls reveal that:1) There is a consistant trend of the majority supporting the death penalty being used in cases where the guilty party is convicted of murder. In 2011, 61% supported the DP while only 35% was agaisnt it.2) Even over time, the majority of Americans believe that the Death Penalty is used not enough.3) The majority of people believe that the death penalty is currently being applied fairly.4) Furthermore, there is a tendency that most people believe that the Death Penalty is morally acceptable. 65% of people believe it is right, while only 28% believe it is wrong.5) OVer time, people have constantly shown that they believe when choosing between the death penalty and imprisonment for life (without parole), the death penalty should be used.The Gallup Poll(s) can be found at my 10th source.Sources:[1] http://www.heritage.org...[2] http://sentencing.typepad.com...[3] http://www.thenewstribune.com...[4] http://www.thecrimereport.org...[5] Joanna M.

            "premise": ":/ My opponent has forfeited.Hopefully this will be a fun debate.==Arguments== C1: DeterrenceThe Death Penalty serves as a determent to criminals.There is a relationship between the death penalty and murder. The deterrent effect of the death penalty helps to save lives, ultimately resulting in the overall prevention of the loss of human life [1]. Multiple studies that have occured over time have demonstrated that the death penalty saves lives [1].Several professors of Emory University found in a 2003 nationwide study that each execution, on average, results in 18 fewer murders [6].A 2006 study found that each execution results in five fewer homicides [7].Shorter waits on death row is connectted with increased deterrence. For every 2.75-year reduction of the time a death row inmate has to wait, at least one murder is deterred.The Emory group used nationwide data from 1960 to 2000,and discovered that 91% of the states had higher homicide rates after they suspended the death penalty [11]. On the other hand, 70% of the states had homicides decrease after the Death Penalty was put back in place [11].Furthermore, a study, from the Wall Street Journal found that the death penalty saves 74 lives by stopping possible murderers in the next year [12].C2: Bargaining ChipThe Death Penalty provides leverage and allows prosecutors to use it as a \"bargaining chip\" to obtain guilty pleas and plea bargains [2] [3]. The criminal justice system is sped up by the DP, which helps to prevent backlogging.Research has shown that 90% of cases in the US are resolved by plea bargains, with the guilty party admitting to all or part of the offenses charged in exchange for reduced/lenient charges [4]. This showsOne example is the case of 12-year-old Zina Linnick's disappearance. Even a remote threat of using the death penalty could give enough of an incentive for a person to confess [3].Another example would be serial killers Robert Yates and Gary Ridgway. The confessed due to the threat of the death penalty [3].Without a doubt, the death penalty allows prosecutors to get information quicker. This can even possibly save lives - such as revealing the location of an abducted person about to die.C3: AccuracyDNA testing and other modern forms of forensic science have allowed us to eleminate all doubt or suspicsion towards a person's guilt or innoncence. DNA testing helps to effectively prosecuting the guilty and protects the innocent [8].Furthermore, a jury of twelve have to unanimously decide that they have no doubt that the defendent is guilty in order to sentence a person to death. [9]Furthermore, the death penalty has nearly a 99.6% rate of accuracy.A person's average wait on the death row is 20 years [13]. This gives more than enough time for organizations such as The Innocence Project to determine whether or not they truly are guilty.C4: PopularityGallup polls have shown that the majority of Americans support the Death Penalty. Our goverment is based on a republic, and a republic at its heart, is ruled by the majority.Gallup polls reveal that:1) There is a consistant trend of the majority supporting the death penalty being used in cases where the guilty party is convicted of murder. In 2011, 61% supported the DP while only 35% was agaisnt it.2) Even over time, the majority of Americans believe that the Death Penalty is used not enough.3) The majority of people believe that the death penalty is currently being applied fairly.4) Furthermore, there is a tendency that most people believe that the Death Penalty is morally acceptable. 65% of people believe it is right, while only 28% believe it is wrong.5) OVer time, people have constantly shown that they believe when choosing between the death penalty and imprisonment for life (without parole), the death penalty should be used.The Gallup Poll(s) can be found at my 10th source.[1]http://www.heritage.org.........[2]http://sentencing.typepad.com.........[3]http://www.thenewstribune.com.........[4]http://www.thecrimereport.org.........[5] Joanna M.

            "conclusion": "Death Penalty",
            "premise": "I will answer each of your arguments in the order you posted them. Murder-1: the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought Justice-c: the administration of law The death penalty clearly isn't murder, but rather justice, because it isn't unlawful, and it is the administration of the law. We don't use the death penalty to make the person scared, we use it to serve justice, and prevent anyone from ever doing what they have done again. We serve justice to make our country safe, not to make criminals pay for their crimes. If we wanted them to pay we wouldn't spend so much tax money on prisons. You state that you can be aqquited wrongly, but yet you don't deserve the punishment? That doesn't make sense. Please show me where exactly in the Constitution it states that the death penalty shouldn't be allowed. Cruel-1: disposed to inflict pain or suffering Unusual- not accordant with usage, custom, or habit The death penalty is used in a way which is quick, and painless, also it has been around for centuries upon centuries, and is not at all unusual. We shouldn't take away the death penalty because it is used unfairly, does that mean we should take away prisons too? Economic status, and race can effect sentence time, and whether or not you go too, then should we ban colleges? The poor can't afford college, it is clearly unfair to them. Maybe what you meant to say was that the administration of the death penalty should be better regulated. Same as above. Being wrongly convicted is nearly unheard of with today's technology. A criminal is also statistically proven to commit another crime. Do we really want repeat offenses by people who's first crimes were bad enough for the death penalty? We shouldn't let criminals get by just because it is expensive to serve justice. Educating people who aren't in the United States legally costs millions, but we still do that don't we? You have stated above that it is important innocent people don't get what they don't deserve, this is why we have appeals. Crimes worthy of the death penalty are much more than a painless lethal injection. We don't kill people for the sake of the fact that they have killed someone, you have to do much more than just kill someone for the death penalty, and we do it to keep the public safe. Same as above. We need to worry about the safety of the public, and serving justice, before we worry about foreign affairs. We must think about the safety of the public, and what the victims families have been through. To add to my arguments I would like to note that the death penalty is used sparingly, and crimes punishable by death are far worse than just murder. If we don't give these people what they deserve, we are allowing them to live for free off of the peoples taxes, without getting what they deserve, and, in a sense, they get away with their crime. If someone knows that they can kill, and live to tell about it, the chances of them doing it are greater, putting society in danger. You seem to have focused on cost, fairness, and morale example, but these aren't even caused by the death penalty, and you have forgotten the real reasons for the death penalty, the safety of the public, and justice.",

            "premise": "Argument 1: The Deterrent Effect \"If we execute murderers and there is in fact no deterrent effect, we have killed a bunch of murderers. If we fail to execute murderers, and doing so would in fact have deterred other murders, we have allowed the killing of a bunch of innocent victims. I would much rather risk the former. This, to me, is not a tough call.\" - John McAdams The death penalty's purpose is to dissuade criminals from performing crimes, the knowledge that a death penalty exists often deters criminals from performing a crime. The decision to murder, rape or steal is often based on the reward and the punishment, some people might decide that a life sentence is not so bad and proceed to perform a crime, however man fears nothing more than death, it is in our genes, we do not want to die. Statistics show that the average murderer often pleads guilty in court, they will readily receive the punishment, as long as it is not death. If the death penalty is practiced, criminals will know that they will face execution if they perform a large enough crime, therefore they will be less likely to do it. In short the death penalty should be legalized because it helps save innocent lives. For example in 2005 capital punishment was abolished in Mexico, since then, Mexico has become an epicenter of murder, kidnapping, and drug wars, people sentenced to prison often escape due to the fact that if they do not break any other laws while escaping they are not charged for anything and no extra time is added to their sentence, which is under the assumption they are even captured. If the death penalty was in place people will think twice before committing a crime, as they cannot come back after they have been put to death. Crime rates are also increasing dramatically over the last half century millions are being killed and will be killed because our \"justice system\" is not working. Millions have already been killed and will be killed every year. According to Time Magazine, there are 2,000,000 people beaten in the United States. Some are knifed, shot, or assaulted. Crime growth has been going up in the past because of too much leniency going hand in hand with the increased rate of people being victimized. There are many loopholes devised for offenders, and because of that crime rate has increased drastically. Between l960 to 1968 crime rate increased 11 times. More and more people are being murdered, raped, assaulted, kidnapped, and robbed, etc. (Isenberg, I., 1997). However there are no loopholes to the death penalty. Argument 2: Repeated Murders A lot of the time the words: \"A sentence to a prison prevents a criminal from doing any harm\" does not keep its word. Some statistics supporting this evidence are that more than 500,000 crimes were committed by people who have already committed a crime in a single year - and around half of those were committed by \"career\" criminals, each with more than 25 previous offences. 1,800 domestic burglaries, and almost 3,000 thefts, were committed by convicted burglars, while 650 violent offences were carried out by people previously convicted of violent crime. And 1,200 sex crimes were committed by known sex offenders. Of the 134 dangerous or sexual offenders charged with a serious further offence last year, 26 were managed with regular multi-agency public protection meetings, other figures showed. Three of these were assessed as posing the highest risk to the public and eight serious case reviews were ordered after the offenders went on to kill or rape, or tried to murder or rape, despite being monitored. Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements panels, which include police, councils and other Government agencies, were set up to manage the risks to the public from dangerous criminals after they leave prison. Life sentences do not stop repeated murders from happening as well Andrew Dawson, George Johnson, Ernest Wright, David Cook and Desmond Lee were all allowed out on licence despite getting life sentences. Some even killed again within weeks of being released from prison. Andrew Dawson was given a life sentence in 1982 after admitting the murder of a 91-year-old Henry Walsh in his flat at Ormskirk, Lancashire, stabbing him a dozen times with bread knife. Within weeks of his release in 2010, he stabbed defenseless John Matthews and Paul Hancock to death in separate attacks, before leaving their bodies in their bathtubs in Derby. The 51-year-old told police he felt an 'urge to kill' before knocking on the men's doors in the block of flats, where he also lived, and hacked them to death. How does the death penalty affect this? Simple, the death penalty will prevent these repeated murders, to not institute death penalty is to allow the 250\"000 crimes, each committed by people with 25 previous crimes, to go by. Should we simply allow this to go on, or should we take action against it and institute the death penalty. Argument 3: Safety is Utmost Although the death penalty does risk the chance that it will accidentally kill an innocent man, by killing a murderer we have prevented the death of other people, this is supported by argument 2, if a murderer given a life sentence, they will most likely kill if the chance arises, an example would be licensed leaves, as they can not be punished any more. The death penalty would remove the chances that a murder would kill again, and the death penalty could also serve as a warning to people in life sentences, telling them that there is a higher punishment, one that they cannot come back on. If letting a person die means keeping more people safe, then we should let the person die. People that want to kill have means of doing so, and we they do they often kill many, many scenarios involve people killing ten or more. The average citizen does not have a mind or intentions to become a killer or being falsely accused of murder. What he is worried about is being a victim. The number of repeated murders in this world is far, far more than the number of repeated murders. Thank You",

If the government is stating that murder is a crime, then how is the death penalty excused? One cannot instate a law about murder being illegal, yet committing that same illegal action to sentence another individual. In this case the government only proves to be a group of hypocritical officials. Religion should not be someone\u2019s characteristic or moral standing, and should not be a person\u2019s essence for their perspective on deciding an individual faith in prison. The understanding of life, punishment, and the justice system stated centuries ago, by almost 40 men, would not be the same understanding of it now. The bible, God, or any form of entity one chooses to refer to for moral standing, should not be the only source for deciding the faith of someone\u2019s life. If one commits a crime that is so cruel to humanity, the punishment should proceed as life in prison. Science should not be investing time and money to learn waya to make the death penalty \u201cless brutal\u201d, but how to make life longer fr humanity. Criminals are criminals, and they should spend time in jail or prison, based on their crime. There is no science needed after declaring someone is guilty, because the citizens of the this country pay their taxes to keep these criminals behind bards, not in caskets.",

            "premise": "I want to thank my partner for presenting this debate. Considering the very stern time limits, I will resort to re-using some of my old talking points. Please forgive my lack of creativity. The death penalty cannot be trusted to be inerrant; because it will always be administered by imperfect humans. Humans make mistakes. Among these mistakes cannot be the accidental killing of innocents - brought about by our allowing ourselves to become destabilized by rage. It must be a hard and fast rule that our society and culture do not accept the killing of innocents - even if we are quite certain that we aren't doing so. We are human, and we make mistakes. These mistakes are bound to occur, inevitable, and so we must not apply fallible human understanding to this irreparable and irreversible act. My concern is whether or not maintaining the death penalty is safe to operate \u2013 for law abiding citizens who must live nearby such a system. I have shown examples of how it is not. Further, I am not convinced that it can ever be corrected and reformed to offer society the assurance that innocent persons will not suffer death or the loss of loved friends and family as a result of operating the death penalty. I maintain that the failure rate of the death penalty safeguards, if applied to a private company or even an entire industry, would be unacceptable to the public. I argue that rage is the main motivator, the main \u201cselling point\u201d for the death penalty industry \u2013 but that this is inadequate to justify allowing it to continue to operate. \u201cI was mad at a serial killer, so I killed your little brother, who did not do anything wrong, but I still want to keep killing serial killers, so I will continue accidentally killing little brothers in order to get revenge on serial killers\u201d is simply not a valid argument.On the other hand, the same argument that suggests that it is unsafe for society to allow serial killers to be paroled due to the possibility that these offenders may kill an innocent person - is exactly my argument against the death penalty: it kills people who do not deserve to die.My argument, therefore:1. The death penalty is unsafe for the law-abiding public, due to inevitable mistakes made by the penal system2. The death penalty is irreversible, mistakes cannot be corrected 3. The fact that our society will ineveitably kill innocent persons as we make use of the death penalty is unacceptable",

            "premise": "\"Lol you argue what is happening now. Also it was implied the current system is used in this debate.\" My opponent has failed to explain why any kind of death penalty should be abolished. My opponent did not specify before the debate started that the topic of death penalty was only limited to its current use in the United States. My opponent wishes to make known of his intentions AFTER the debate started. I find this to be an irresponsible condition opposed upon me by my opponent because I accepted this debate only on the conditions of which were supplied at the time of acceptance. At the time, I was accepting the position of 'Pro' for A death penalty. Notice how neither the title of the debate nor anything written in the comments section before the debate started includes anything specific that says \"Resolved: The current death penalty system instituted in the United States should be abolished\". I am within my bounds to be arguing for a death penalty, not THE death penalty. In this case, I would like to supply some definitions: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Death - a permanent cessation of all vital functions : the end of life [1] Penalty - 1. A legal sentence. 2. A punishment for violating rules of procedure. [2] Punish - to subject to pain, loss, confinement, death, etc., as a penalty for some offense, transgression, or fault: to punish a criminal. [3] Voluntary - done, made, brought about, undertaken, etc., of one's own accord or by free choice: a voluntary contribution. [4] Recidivism - the act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after they have either experienced negative consequences of that behavior, or have been treated or trained to extinguish that behavior. [6] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The definition of a death penalty can be construed from the definitions above as a legal sentence subjecting a person to death. My stance on the subject of a death penalty is that a death penalty should remain in the United States, but it should be entirely different than the current death penalty. A decision to undergo the death penalty should be a voluntary choice made by a convict who would have the option of life in prison or death. I have no doubt that a portion of criminals sentenced to life in prison would rather opt for the death penalty than a life sentence. This is evident by the fact that a large number of murder-suicides occur in the United States in which after a person commits murder, they take their own life. The source and evidence for this argument is listed in the first round of the debate. R1: Cost \"SO your \"the defendant chooses\" is false. The judge in the end chooses, defendant just gets to plea to try to weaken the sentence.\" It is most definitely not false. In a voluntary death penalty, the defendant WOULD be able to choose. Remember, the argument is not about the current US death penalty, but is about A death penalty. So it is the trial itself under the DP that is expensive. That is what I have said all along. A voluntary death penalty would eliminate the bulk of the cost that it takes to execute a criminal because the legal appeals process which costs the most money would be eliminated. The appeals process exists because convicts who are fighting the state do not want to receive the death penalty. The people who would fight the death penalty in the future would not be sentenced to the death penalty in a voluntary death penalty, they would be sentenced to life in prison, therefore eliminating the appeals process in death penalties that costs the most amount of money in the current death penalty in the US. Also you concede that the DP costs more. I stated that the current death penalty costs more. A voluntary death penalty would cost so much less than the current death penalty, and would cost less than life in prison simply because the costs for food, health and shelter would amount to $0 after the criminal is executed. The states would actually save $1.5 million in living costs per convict if the convict opts for the voluntary death penalty over life in prison [5]. R2: The death penalty does not deter crime. The act of deterring crime is not the primary purpose of creating and enforcing rules for punishing lawbreakers. Fantastic. Then if deterrence isn't a major issue in deterring crime, then why are you debating that the death penalty doesn't deter crime if any other form of punishment isn't made to deter crime either? If the sole purpose of rules of law aren't even made to deter crime, you have just defeated your own argument. You make it seem that deterrence is a negligible issue. R3: The DP infringes international law. I agree with your statements on the current death penalty. But not all death penalties would violate this law. A voluntary death penalty would allow a convict to have more personal liberties than the current death penalty and a convict would also have the right to life or death based on his choice. R4: Risk of executing innocents I fail to see how an innocent person would want to opt for death under a voluntary death penalty. Even so, it's a person's right to life or death and a government shouldn't be infringing on 'international law' that you cite in this debate because it would infringe on liberty of the person to govern their own body. R5: Death sentences are racist and unfair \"Lol you argue what is happening now. Also it was implied the current system is used in this debate.\" Like I said above, I am arguing for A death penalty, not the current death penalty. You did not specify that as a condition of the debate when I accepted the debate. Therefore you MUST convince the voters that the United States would be better off without a death penalty, and I am convincing the voters that the United States would be better with A death penalty. Notice that the topic is simply 'Death Penalty' and that you did not provide any additional information to what your resolution was for the debate. Therefore I am obligated to argue within my bounds, and my bounds are that I am arguing for a Death Penalty in the United States. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In conclusion, the United States would be better off with a voluntary death penalty than without one at all. - It would be cheaper than life imprisonment by saving 1.5 million dollars per inmate. - It would give the convict the right to make a decision on their continuation of life. - It would eliminate the possibility of the criminal from being released back into society and committing recidivism. Voters: Because the debate resolution later admitted by my opponent was not provided at the beginning of the debate, I strongly urge you to base your decision on who convinced you more on the argument that a death penalty of some kind is better or worse than any kind of death penalty at all. I hope that after reviewing all of the debate, you make the right decision and vote Pro! :) Sources: 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://en.wiktionary.org... 3. http://dictionary.reference.com... 4. http://dictionary.reference.com... 5. http://www.heartsandminds.org... 6. http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "premise": "Hello all. In this debate, I will present several key arguments in opposition to the institution of capital punishment, or the death penalty. I will specifically refer to the situation in the United States.I believe the death penalty is a stain on American society. It shows that we are not as morally or fiscally concerned as we should be. I will attempt to show this with these three arguments.I. The Death Penalty is UnjustThe job of our government should be to eliminate injustice to promote prestige and a morally concerned society. However, with the existence of the death penalty, the government is failing to live up to this role. My argument to prove that the death penalty is unjust is as follows:Definitionsrevenge: the action of inflicting hurt or harm on someone for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands. (Google)just: based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair. (Google)Argument1) The death penalty is based on revenge (as defined above).2) Revenge is immoral.3) Therefore, the death penalty is immoral. (From 1, 2)4) The death penalty is unjust. (From 3)On Premise 1The death penalty is based on revenge, as it is inflicting death upon criminals that inflict pain and suffering on others. This revenge is instituted by the federal/state governments (I am referring specifically to the situation in the US in this debate).On Premise 2Revenge is widely considered to be immoral. The premise of revenge is to inflict near, identical, or even excessively more pain than the criminal caused the victim, and that is just escalating the amount of immoral action (think Gandhi's eye-for-an-eye principle).On Premise 3The death penalty, because it is based on an immoral principle (revenge), is an immoral practice.On Premise 4As 'just' includes the condition of moral fairness and righteousness, the death penalty can be concluded to be unjust.II. The Death Penalty is ExpensiveThe process of capital trial, containment on death row and eventual execution is more expensive than keeping the criminal in prison for life, as proven in numerous surveys. [1] This is clearly unfair for taxpayers, who end up paying a lot more than they would otherwise (if criminals that would be indicted of capital punishment would instead be sentenced to life in prison, the cheaper and more moral answer).III. The Death Penalty Does Not Deter CrimeCountless studies have shown that the existence of capital punishment as a penalty for serious crime does not add on to the deterrence effect of prolonged time in prison. Another study has shown that there is no correlation between the death penalty's institution and the murder of police officers.In fact, in states without the death penalty, there are lower rates of crime. Therefore, it is clear that the death penalty does not deter crime or add any sort of effectiveness to the fight against crime. [2]---------------------ConclusionFor all these reasons, it is clear that the death penalty should be abolished. First, it is clearly an immoral principle and should be treated as such; it is wrong for our government to institute a principle against basic morals. Second, the institution of capital punishment, capital trial and containment on death row awaiting execution costs substantially more than life in prison. Third, the death penalty is not shown to deter crime, or have any effect on the murder of police officers or the crime rate, in fact, states that have abolished the death penalty have lower rates of crime.It is resolved that the death penalty ought to be abolished.---------------------Sources: [1] http://deathpenalty.org...;[2] http://deathpenalty.org...* Both of these sources are credible and are publications of veritable studies and data compiled by professionals.",

            "conclusion": "The Death Penalty Should Be Abolished",
            "premise": "By abolishing the Death Penality, these criminal would have to suffer in prison. By being given the death penalty, the criminal does not suffer, only their family does. Although ending these criminals life would be better for the safety of innocent humans, the criminals basically have the easy way out. The only suffering that the Death Penalty causes is simply the pinch of the needle, due to the \"Lethal Injection\", and the wait while being on deathrow is all the criminal has to deal with, suffering wise. By abolishing the Death Penalty, the criminal does not get to \"pay time for the crime\" he/she took part in. I feel that these criminals should be subjected to life in prison with no parolle, therefore they suffer in there and have no chance of getting out to live freely as if they were innocent. In addition, if these criminals lived the rest of their lives in prison, it would ensure that they could commit no more crimes against innocent people. Also, perhaps a \"criminal\" was wrongly convicted and is sentenced to the Death Penalty, now because of the legal system and a misfortunate case- this poor, innocent person is being executed and their family has to suffer while the actual criminal lives his/her life freely. This Death Penalty can also be thought to be against \"Pro-Life\" views and beliefs since it is ending a person's life, very similar to an abortion (1). Religiously speaking, the Death Penalty goes against one of the Ten Commandments, since the Sixth Commandment states \"Thou Shall Not Kill\". Although this \"killing\" is ultimately politicly correct since the person committed a crime, it is not religiously correct according to the Sixth Commandment (2). Not only does the Death Penalty go against the Sixth Commandment, but it goes against God by the Law deciding when this person is to die. In the past 36 years, since the Death Penalty was brought back in 1976, over one-thousand people were executed, and over three-thousand convicts in thirty-six different countries are awaiting their execution (3). The Death Penalty does not help the suffering family of the victim's family, especially the long, anticipated wait of deathrow (4). In addition, the cost for all these executions are far more costly than keeping them in jail (4). Although the thought of death and the Death Penalty may be scary to some, crime rates have not decreased due to this horrible \"punishment\" (5). In my opinion, the death penalty is an absurb and unreasonable punishment for the horrifying crimes these criminals perform. Therefore the Death Penalty should be abolished. I am completely against the Death Penalty and Pro-Suffering for these criminals by living the rest of their lives in jail. 1- http://usliberals.about.com... 2- http://www.christianhomesite.com... 3- http://articles.cnn.com... 4- https://death.rdsecure.org... 5- http://www.antideathpenalty.org...",

In many cases when the crime is severe, such as mass murder, the criminal deserves the death penalty. By giving the criminal the death penalty, we deter future criminals, reducing the crime rate. Also, if these criminals were allowed to return to society, they would pose the risk of threatening more people, therefore under the util framework the death penalty would be permissible.",

            "conclusion": "Death Penalty",
            "premise": "Starting off round 2 i would wish my oppenont good luck as well and its an honor to have this debate with my opponent. \"death penalty is not over rated or barbaric why should a family lose a innocent loved one and mourn the loss while a killer should continue living with a roof over their head and three meals a day\" our justic system is messed up, when you speak of \"why should a family lose an innocent loved one and mourn the loss\" what we as a society is that were quick to point fingers, so when i stated in the last round is why bring more hurt and pain in the air yea its sad that a killer has to kill an innocent the family is hurting tears are falling, pain is growing, but why put them to death and build up more pain for the other side of the family, he now not the murderer in the matter of the death penalty now hes the victim, and were the murderers everyone who keeps the death penalty alive. As for the 3 meals a day in our prisons in America we the people vote for all that, why do you think allot of people go back to prison or jail its like home, you get your showers, your meals, a roof over your head like you said. In other countries prisoners don't even get that they rot like in china cell mates are only allow 2 meals a day no showers and they get beat, and everything, china right now has the worse prisons in the world, other countries have worse prisons and justic systems then us. Other countries has the death penalty banned most of them, and even the countries who have the death penalty up rarely uses it. We just need harsher prisons, give people life with no porale or anything, if you do that they live but die slowly rotting. thats our justic system were to soft in our prisons, even boot camp for the marines are way more tough then our prisons, and justic system. now getting back to the death penalty, the death penalty does violate the bill of rights, something society we as a people voted for, the \"cruel and unusaul\" clause in the bill of rights is violated in the bill of rights. 2) The financial cost to us tax payers of capital punishment cost several times more then keeping someone in prison. 3)We as a Society needs to pull away from the \"Eye for an Eye\" (revenge), if we ever want to advance in life and grow. 4)It does send the wrong message to not only our youth like i said: why kill people who kill people to show killing is wrong. 5)It is useless and that it doesn't bring the victim back to life. allot of people that were up for the line of the death penalty more then half are innocent, some jury members if it involves putting someone to death will most likely push for the death penalty. i not going to go to religious yet. the death penalty has any one ever heard of the saying two wrongs don't make a right, well what justic is there when someone is put to death by state there is no justic, last time i checked murder is murder, just because its under state jurisdiction to put a person in the death penalty for killing that doesn't erase the fact that the state just killed. So we ask ourselves did any of the leaders get put to death when we killed thousands and thousands of people by allowing us to bomb japan in WW2 all the innocent lives who died for no cause, had no reason to die, children, women, men that had nothing to do with the war, weres the justic to that. We do all the killing to protect our country but if you put a person on the death penalty just cause he killed, then we put millions of innocent lives on the death penalty that had no reason to die children, etc. even some of the people who are put on death role is innocent, eight people got put to death then later after they got the death bed were found innocent. when you speak of not being barbaric the death penalty is, how is it not? despit the revenge way. If you really think about it the death penalty is an excuse to get revenge on someone, and thats a barbaric way to think that revenge can solve many peoples problems in life. If people really wants to spend almost 2 million dollars just to put one man/woman to there death people we do not even know innocent or guilty then take that risk, its us as a society who gives the money to put innocent and guilty people on death role, they just convict them the day they do die. Have you ever seen the movie Green Mile its based on a true story, if you seen it when you watched it were you angry because an innocent man got put on the death penalty, who were the real victims of murdering, it was the guards the people who came an watched him die, the people who all payed millions to just put one man to death, they killed not him. Even if he was the killer end the end after his death were now the murderers. Did God say it was ok to kill in any way God was all against that, I never read were it states in the bible that its ok to decide when someone dies. God only has that right, if we pick when someone should live or die thats an act of playing like we are divine like God. Last time i check i believe only one God exists (unless your a different religion everyone has there own believes so don't take any thing personal i apoligize if anything is personal just making my argument so forgive me in the end) Right before Jesus died he yelled out to his father in heaven \"Forgive them father for they don't know what they do\" and we do not know what we are doing, we do not understand why people kill, we do not stop and think what made him do it or ask questions. We all are murderers we all killed, becoming a murderer do not mean to go out and kill no we could think death wish people to death, I know in God eyes that consider murder so we ask for forgivness, so when death penalty is involve looks like there won't be a human left in our country, wishing people to death is like killing. Do we all get the death penalty then since murder can go for many different forms. I now will like to wish my opponent good luck before i end my turn.",

            "premise": "I believe the death penalty is not the best way to solve all crimes but in some cases like mass murdering or kidnapping or something else. I do think that killing someone is not the first solution but if they get to live they should at least have some harsher punishments besides just jail because its not that bad. But the main reason i think the death penalty should be allowed is because if someone decided to do something as evil as a mass murdering they shouldn't just go to jail for a life time and get it over with it because its just not fair the American jail is not as hard as should be on certain prisoners for what they have done. I think that if you have the guts to go up and have the nerve to kill someone then you definitely don't deserve to still be living and breathing on this earth its just not right you need to learn from your mistakes and it will also teach others to learn from what you have done and be warned that if you decide to take this path in your life there will be serious consequences like the death penalty or harsher and stricter jails. People need to take the blame for what they have clearly done and its not right to kill and innocent person and still live and eat and live your life when them and their families have to suffer for what you have done. It also gives closure to the victims families who have suffered so deeply because of your cruel actions, and also i don't know if you've noticed but your justice system has more sympathy for our criminals than our victims. Another good reason to have the death penalty is because when a prisoner's parole or escape can give the criminals another opportunity to kill another person again. Also have you noticed with all these prisoners here and known of them getting killed its taking up space and that's not realty safe. And finally something we all have to pay attention almost everyday is our taxes did you know that we are paying to keep our criminals stuck in that jail place when it could be going to something a lot more useful that could actually help and benefit us. Overall i do agree with the death penalty but if there we some law that were to be passed that made the jails a bit more stricter and made them suffer more them i would also agree with that as well . Some people may call that mean or getting eye to eye which is also not the best way to solve things and i agree and here your point but its also not fair haven't you ever lost a loved one and if so just imagine the reason they died is because guy was just feeling angry and decided to kill someone that night and its also not only that is just that someone who had the mentality to do something like that clearly needs to get their facts straight and on the right track.",

If our friends are killed and raped, we can be saddened, we can be angered but this should'nt dictate our decision because our emotion is not always right, it can be wrong We should be slow to anger, we should'nt let anger control our justice system,we should look at the outcome and be open to the things or people that are affected. If we know killing is wrong we should'nt do it, if we know we're hurting somebody, don't do it. Criminal won't learn anything in death penalty and only cowards will fear death penalty Murder (illegal killing) will be lessen but not the killing and violence for the government participates in it using capital punishment. The continuation of death penalty means another death of an innocent for the government accepted the risk of it while using a flawed system. Hanging is cheap but morality can't be determined by cheapness, money should not be ruling our decision. Lethal injection is never humane, killing is never humane but it can be less and more cruel yet it is always cruel. Killing an inmate is injustice, killing is never justice, killing for someone else (victim) is not acceptable , being cruel is not okay, killing someone is not fine. It's not because of what the criminal had done but who we are, all who kill is a killer, now that the government kills they are a killer just like the people they are punishing. They kill somebody who kills somebody, the government is not innocent because they don't do what innocent and humane people does, they do what the criminal does. We can deter without death penalty ,if jail isn't working then lock the inmate from head to fingers from there the inmate cannot move and rehabilitate them severely to make them compatible in society so the issue here is death penalty's morality and you have to justify killing.",
