            "premise": "Tablets should replace textbooks for many of reasons. One of the main reasons is because almost everything in today's society revolves around technology. Moving material from print on paper, to a .pdf file seems like a smarter choice with the way technology advances. We continue to progress and advance in technology, we also continue to obtain new information about other things around us. With a tablet not only do we help the students, we also help the environment.Now for the factional information:The average tablet consist of storage space between 8 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes. If a student gets an 8 gigabyte tablet they have 6 gigabytes for user content. This gives the student the ability to hold 80 applications, leaving additional space for at least 10 movies, or 800 songs, or 6,000 books. (http://www.ehow.com...). So when the devices is finally set up the student should have his or her texts books for each class, and have plenty of space left over for notes, and anything else the school permits them to have on their devices. You've also eliminated the amount of textbooks and paper work needed to be printed off for the school. Plus E-textbooks on tablets cost 50% to 60% less than the average textbook (http://www.electronista.com...).Tablets also help students learn more information in a shorter amount of time. Not only is it helping the student prepare for a world surrounded by technology but it is teaching students to use their most efficient source of information According to the US Department of Education and studies by the National Training and Simulation Association students who have technology-based information learn the information given anywhere from 30% to 80% faster than average (http://www.fcc.gov...).You can now take the floor. :P",

            "premise": "Tablets and eReaders are useful learning augmentation tools, but their use does not supersede textbooks.Thanks to my opponent for initiating the debate. I will first provide some general scope for the debate. I will then rebut my opponent's contentions, before demonstrating conclusively that digital tablet devices should not replace textbooks.Scene-settingThe world is becoming more digitised, and this is a phenomenon we should embrace. My opponent has provided the most common of the arguments put forward by those who feel that the replacement of textbooks is warranted, for example, environmental concerns, storage capacity and the speed of learning.In my view, as will be demonstrated, none of these are sufficient to warrant the replacement of textbooks, and the arguments are disingenuous and do not represent the facts. Further, my opponent has presented a false dichotomy: the employment of tablets does not necessitate the removal of textbooks.RebuttalsEnvironmental concernsDespite claims that the reduction in paper consumption means that tablets are better for the environment being highly prolific, they are entirely false. Tablets are far worse for the environment than textbooks(1).- Trees are renewable and the vast majority of mainstream textbooks are produced from sustainable forest paper- The gargantuan surge in demand for tablets (iPads, Kindles and other eReaders being the worst offenders) has lead to the overfilling of landfills, requiring more to be built.- In the US, these products represent a meager 4% of solid waste...but this translates into 70% of the nation's toxic waste(1).- They are made almost entirely out of non-renewable, toxic resources, such as cadmium, mercury and lithium. An independent media organisation determined that books are, by an absolute mile, far better for the environment than eReaders and tablets(2).For further reference, this site aggregates a plethora of detailed information which has examined the pros and cons of both printed books and tablets, all of which determine that books are far superior on scores of environmental management(3).Storage CapacityIn a cruel twist of fate, it is in fact the storage capacity that is one of the biggest downfalls. All that capacity provides space for games, and invariably kids will end up on Facebook and YouTube. This is not an issue with textbooks. While schools have the option of putting filters, firewalls and browsing restrictions on the tablets, kids will invariably trick every successive patch with third-party software and proxy servers - I certainly did it! Speed of learningThis is a very interesting topic, and one which I will address strongly in my arguments, so to save from repeating myself, I'll address this below instead of here.Arguments againstThe following will constitute my argumentation phase for this round:1. Reduction in memory retention due to oversaturation of data.2. Breadth of knowledge without depth of knowledge - more information, less understanding.3. Decreased ability to perform serial searching; increased dependence on parallel searching4. Effects of excessive artificial backlight/screen exposure on sleep (especially in children).5. Writing notes down by hand from textbooks leads to better memory retention than typing digital notes.6. Fewer distractions.1. Due to technology, our memory is deteriorating(4). This is due to increasing dependence on the ability to look up data at any time; an inherent product of this is this subconscious interruption of thoughts: \"Why should I remember when Australia was settled, if I can just Google it when I need to know it?\" The result is poorer memory retention. Quick and easy access to information is making our learning and memory worse, not better(5).2. Linking into the above contention, reduced working memory capacity and reliance on technology is meaning that we learn things across 5\u007f in %ad range of topics; however, we do not learn things deeply. This results in a lack of fundamental understanding and a prevalence of cursory, superficial knowledge. Technology is causing our thinking to become scattered and disorganised(6).3. Parallel and serial searches are two components of attention(7). Parallel searches occur when an item 'pops out' and requires little effort to find in a group. In this case, the items are maximally different. In a serial search, most of the items have to be looked through, until you find the item you're looking for (find the letter 'O': 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000o0000000000000000000000000000000 - in this instance, it doesn't 'pop', so you only stop searching through the items0\u007fAn independ07%\u007fyou find the item you're looking for). For example of parallel searches (that do just 'pop out' to varying degrees - note that the bottom panel is contentious and the resolution makes it more difficult than it otherwise would be): Given the CTRL + F function (or analogous device-specific control) available on technology, our ability to perform attention-captive searches has been depleted. Searching for items actually helps us to remember information (you're more likely to remember a word that you look up in the dictionary rather than when you ask someone what it means) because concept-association. When looking up information in a book, all of these attention-specific and memory-priming functions are preserved.4. Artificial light is causing sleep disorders, and this is especially prevalent with tablets(8). Further, it has been demonstrated to be even more dangerous in children. Do we really need to be adding even more screen time for kids? They're already getting large doses at home and they're also getting smartphones younger and younger. Textbooks are a good way of ensuring a certain amount of no-screen time during the day.5. Writing things down by hand, instead of note-taking on tablets, leads to better memory retention(9). This means smarter kids! This is obviously the most important outcome.6. While you're reading a textbook, there's no way to check out the latest pin-up girl, browse Facebook or watch cat videos. All of these things are great to do, but not while you're trying to study! Having textbooks and some blank sheets of paper leads to focused, attentive learning. Noting down the things you can't find the answers to then continuing with your work and looking them up later is the most productive way of learning. Otherwise you stop to Google something every five seconds and never get any work done.Summarily, eTextbooks can be a useful additional learning tool. However, they should not replace textbooks. Textbooks are better for the environment, are better for our brains and memory, are better for children's sleep patterns and are less distracting. In addition, of people who had used both books and eBooks in the past 12-months, 81% of respondents said reading to a child from a paper book was a superior experience when compared with digital readers and tablets(10). The same site finds many pros for eBooks; however, on balance, it finds that the cons outweigh the pros, and that textbooks are superior.Textbooks should NOT be replaced entirely by eBooks.___________________________(1) [http://livinggreenmag.com...](2) [https://www.smartairmedia.com...](3) [http://www.ecolibris.net...](4) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com...](5) [http://www.internationalmanofmemory.com...](6) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk...](7) [http://www.homepage.psy.utexas.edu...](8) [http://www.abc.net.au...](9) [http://www.lifehack.org...](10) [http://tablets-textbooks.procon.org...]",

Pro has said that tablets make things easier for students, but has not explained why or how. As such, his case does not stand. Now let me get to my first point. Tablet usage negatively impacts student performance; students may become distracted by games, websites, and videos while using a tablet. While software can be used to \"lock down\" tablets, there inevitably would be a tech savvy kid who has found a way to bypass said software, and said method could spread all around a school. Tablets are also more costly than textbooks. They need electricity and maintenance. They take away money from the school budget that could be spent on training teachers or evaluating the curriculum's effectiveness.",

            "premise": "I thank you for this debate once more my esteemed opponett.I like tablets more than textbooks for 3 reasons:1. They are lighter and easier to carry to lockers and carry through the halls than textbooks2. They can do more than textbooks can to teach students3. They are more advanced for an advanced age.I give you from another reputable source, 6 reasons for tablets rather than textbooks1. Tablets Are the Best Way to Show Textbooks http://rack.2.mshcdn.com...; data-url=\"\"> http://rack.2.mshcdn.com...; data-micro=\"1\" /> Tablets are cable of offering enhanced ebooks featuring images, video and audio. These elements are impossible to include in print or in a standard ebook. Read about music? No thanks, I'll follow my auto-advancing sheet music as the audio plays. See a picture of Martin Luther King, Jr. as I read his \"I Have a Dream\" speech? I guess that's fine, but with one tap of my finger, I'm watching it. The result is a more integrated learning experience, which is more engaging for students. This isn't the future \u2014 this is today. By allowing students to highlight text, take notes in the margin and access a dictionary directly within the book itself, tablets are matching (and in some cases, surpassing) everything that a traditional book \u2014 print or digital \u2014 can offer. 2. Classrooms Are Ready for Tablets Though tablets are a recent phenomenon, many students in high school and college have been using smartphones for years, and are already well-acquainted with touchscreen technology. Because they\u2019ve become so accustomed to using these devices, students are increasingly expecting to use them in the classroom setting. When classrooms don't implement what has now become \"everyday\" technology, we\u2019re doing students a disservice. Additionally, students \u2014 and consumers in general \u2014 are becoming more comfortable using tablets for advanced tasks. According to a new Nielsen survey, 35% of tablet owners said they used their desktop computers less often or not at all now, and 32% of laptop users said the same. Most tellingly, more than 75% of tablet owners said they used their tablet for tasks they once used their desktop or laptop for. While tablets can\u2019t totally match laptops in terms of functionally (yet), they can get today\u2019s students most of the way there. 3. Tablets Fit Students' Lifestyles The appeal of tablets to a college student is obvious: They\u2019re thin, lightweight, and spring to life without delay, making them much easier to take to (and use in) class than a laptop or netbook. Longer battery life means that students don\u2019t have to worry about carrying a charger with them. Forgot what the professor said at the end of class about the mid-term? Launch Tegrity, tap the lecture and replay it in just seconds. That's faster than texting a half-dozen classmates and waiting for what might be an inaccurate response. 4. Tablets Have the Software to Be Competitive http://rack.2.mshcdn.com...; data-url=\"\"> http://rack.2.mshcdn.com...; data-micro=\"1\" /> Some of the most innovative software around is being developed specifically for tablets. In addition to the thousands of exciting educational apps available, tablets are fully compatible with online teaching and learning platforms, such as Blackboard, which are becoming the norm at colleges and universities. In fact, tablets\u2019 current shortcoming \u2014 limited multitasking \u2014 could be their greatest asset in education, as it forces students to focus on one task at a time. 5. Tablets Integrate With Education IT Trends Cloud-based solutions have become ever more popular with colleges and universities, which are looking to deliver synchronized experiences that are device agnostic. Tablets align well with this trend, given their portability and options for constant connectivity. With tablets and cloud-based systems, students can work anywhere on campus and make sure that their work is saved in a central location and accessible from all of their devices. They also don\u2019t have to pay for computing power that they no longer need. 6. Tablets Are Becoming More Available One of the primary reasons that tablets have been slow to penetrate the higher education market was their limited availability. Apple\u2019s supply chain issues and the difficulty that some Android tablet manufacturers have faced in getting their products to market have made it difficult for schools to get serious about adopting. As these issues are resolved over the coming year, expect to see more and more tablets popping up on campuses. Lower price points will make tablets even more appealing to colleges and universities. For close to a year, Apple went virtually unchallenged in the tablet market. Increased competition should drive down prices. The wave of tablets introduced at CES in January is just the tip of the iceberg. With dozens to hundreds of offerings, many based on Google's open source Android OS, expect price points to fall quickly just as they have for laptops, smartphones and HDTV sets. Heck, Apple's original iPad can be had for as little as $349 if you get the timing right and don't mind a refurb.Source: http://mashable.com...",

Schools will not have to constantly purchase new hardware, software, or new physical copies of textbooks. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that \"too many students are using books that are 7-10 years old with outdated material.\" Tablets are especially beneficial for subjects that constantly change, such as biology or computer science. [2] When you update an e-textbook it will take less than an hour when ordering a textbook it can take up to a week. 3.People Read More Students who own tablets purchase and read more books than those who read print books alone. The average tablet-owning US student reads 24 books per year on a tablet compared with 15 in print for those who do not own a tablet. [3] According to a survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 30% of e-content readers (including 40% of those under age 30) say that they now spend more time reading than they used to due to the availability of e-content. [4] 4.Weigh Less Print textbooks are heavy and cause injuries, while a tablet only weighs 1-2 pounds. Pediatricians and chiropractors recommend that students carry less than 15% of their body weight in a backpack, but the combined average weight of textbooks in History, Mathematics, Science, and Reading/Language Arts exceeds this percentage at nearly all grade levels from 1-12. [5] According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, during the 2011-12 school year more than 13,700 kids, aged 5 to 18, were treated for backpack-related injuries.[6] 1.Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), \"National PBS Survey Finds Teachers Want More Access to Classroom Tech,\" www.pbs.org, Jan. 23, 2012 2.Federal Communications Commission, \"Digital Textbook Playbook,\" (2.55 MB) www.fcc.gov, Feb. 1, 2012 3.LearnStuff, \"Graduating with Technology,\" learnstuff.com, Aug. 17, 2012 4.Kathryn Zickuhr, \"Younger Americans' Reading and Library Habits,\" libraries.pewinternet.org, Oct. 23, 2012 5.Thomas Adams, \"Textbook Weight in California: Data and Analysis,\" California Department of Education website, Apr. 14, 2004 6.Mary Elizabeth Dallas, \"Overloaded Backpacks Can Injure Kids: Experts,\" nlm.nih.gov, Aug. 26, 2012",

Hopefully my opponent will return for their next round. _____________ - Textbooks don't require batteries, a Wi-Fi connection, or special storage conditions other than 'not wet'. This makes them more durable in terms of use. People in remote areas without power or internet deserve the ability to learn and have access to information. - This characteristic also makes textbooks better for long-term storage. The rapidly escalating obsolescence of technology means that attempting to store data long-term requires regular upgrades and maintenance. In the case of servers, it is also expensive and requires cooling towers, full-time staff and infrastructure. Books don't have this problem. We have found books throughout history that haven't been cared for, and do not require firmware updates or attempts to backwards-build the technology used to make them in order to gain access. Although archives do typically use filtered air and have numbered shelves, this and the staff are pretty much the extent of the costs involved. - Provided they are secured in a bomb-proof shelter, books are invulnerable to attack; no technological/cyber warfare can shut them down. They can't be hacked. And if you give one to every person or airdrop them in, then they're untraceable. - Great for zombie apocalypses. - Smell delicious.",

            "premise": "Handheld technological devices including tablets are associated with a range of health problems. Handhelds contribute to Computer Vision Syndrome, which causes eyestrain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes, according to the American Optometric Association. People who use mobile devices more often have a higher incidence of musculoskeletal disorders associated with repetitive strain on muscles, including carpal tunnel syndrome, neck pain (\"text neck\"), shoulder pain, and fibromyalgia. Using tablets is more expensive than using print textbooks. Implementing tablets in K-12 schools requires purchasing hardware (the tablet) and software (the textbooks), building new wi-fi infrastructure, and training teachers and administrators how to use the technology. Implementation costs for e-textbooks on iPad tablets are 552% higher than new print textbooks in an average high school. Lee Wilson, a prominent education marketing expert, estimated the annual cost per student per class with tablets to be $71.55 vs. $14.26 for print textbooks. Tablets have too many distractions for classroom use. Students may pay attention to apps, email, games, and websites instead of their teachers. 87% of K-12 teachers believe that \"today\"s digital technologies are creating an easily distracted generation with short attention spans.\" Four-fifths of students aged 8 - 18 multitask while using digital media. People who read print text comprehend more, remember more, and learn more than those who read digital text. The brain interprets printed and digital text in different ways, and people generally read digital text 20-30% slower than print. According to Pulitzer Prize winning technology writer Nicholas Carr, peer-reviewed studies show that reading hyper-linked text may increase the brain's \"cognitive load,\" lowering the ability to process, store, and retain information, or \"translate the new material into conceptual knowledge.\" Many students do not have sufficient home internet bandwidth to use tablets. Students \"need home broadband to access digital content and to complete Internet based homework,\" according to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, but about a third of Americans \" 100 million people \" do not have broadband internet at home. A 2010 FCC survey found that nearly 80% of K-12 schools reported broadband connections that were \"inadequate to meet their current needs. My resoures are... http://tablets-textbooks.procon.org...",

Text books can hold, books, homework, tests and quizzes, yet would completely remove all the added weight that a student must carry daily. E-textbooks on tablets cost on average 50-60% less than print textbooks. According to a 2012 report from the Federal Communications Commission, K-12 school districts spend more than $8 billion per year on textbooks. E-textbooks can save schools between $250-$1,000 per student per year. Tablet prices also continue to drop, making them increasingly affordable. Tablets cost on average $489 in 2011, $386 in 2012, and are projected to cost $263 in 2015. Thank you",

I believe that textbooks are a waste of paper, many students are careless with them, and so they damage the book by drawing on the pages or ripping them out. But when that happens it renders the learning abilities of other students, because they are running the book. But if we were given e- copies of textbooks students would not be able to ruin them and since this is the 21st century almost everyone has tablets, laptops, I Pads and even phones. That would save so much paper from having to cut trees meaning that there would be a higher chance to stop global warming. Also, these textbooks could be sold for funds for schools so they could buy more technology for their students, or maybe for outdoor utilities like basketball nets, balls, grass, etc. how is this cost effective? It is because most students have devices for pleasure to play games and to do work. So now we know that people already have it for themselves right, well see on most devices you can download e-books meaning that you could download a textbook if you had one. So, it would also be easily accessible anywhere. So, for example, if you were away from school you could learn the exact same things that your peers were learning just at home. That is why I believe that E-books should replace Textbooks",

            "premise": "Hi, thank you for your response. 1) Now I will discuss the differences between the ease of use between an e-reader (a common device with electronic versions of books, newspapers, magazines, etc.) and a textbook. In 2011, Alex Thayer of the University of Washington conducted a study for academic purposes on e-readers. Each pupil was given a Kindle DX loaded with books in the fall. By the time spring came along, almost 40 percent of the students had stopped using the reader. Why? Usability issues. Although the Kindle allows one to annotate books as you read, three quarters of the students in the study still used paper to take notes. The students also found it difficult to locate information found in the text while taking tests or completing assignments, reports (etc.) Part of the problem, says Mr. Thayer, is that e-readers don't allow for \"cognitive mapping.\" This is the process of using cues to recall where you saw the information in the first place. With textbooks; images, bold writing, and subtitles can be easy cues when looking back on particular details. However, navigation and search functions are very poor features on most e-readers. 2) Student Health Tablets contribute to eyestrain, headaches, blurred vision, and bad posture which often increases the excuses available for students not doing their homework. However with textbooks, these type of symptoms are rare. 3) Distractions Although many find features (such as a dictionary or a clock) on an electronic reader very useful, they are also distractions. It's like having your favorite dessert in front of you at the dinner table with guests over. Not only is it tempting but very distracting to just take the food for yourself. With an electronic device in place of your textbook, you may be tempted to surf the Internet or watch non-school-related videos (etc.) instead of focusing on your schoolwork. All this makes an impact on the education you receive.",

            "conclusion": "Laptops/Ipads should not replace notebooks and textbooks in school",
            "premise": "CASE:Laptops/Ipads should replace notebooks and textbooks in school ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ PrefaceI would like to first start by thanking my opponent for accepting this debate because the topic in question is one I had always wanted to debate with someone. I wish him good luck for the upcoming rounds in this debate._________________________________________________________________________________________________________-And with that said I will directly skip to my contentions for the case. Laptops are lighterIt\u2019s an obvious fact that laptops are much lighter than a bunch of textbooks and notebooks. Children from their initial stages of education are forced to carry a heavy load of textbooks and notebooks. Carrying such heavy load on their shoulders damages the spinal cord over time and in extreme cases may lead to severe physical deformities in children.[1]Growing numbers of children are developing irreversible back deformities because of the weight of the bags they carry to school. Half of all children suffer back pain by the age of 14 and doctors are reporting a rise in cases of spinal abnormalities in pupils, including disfiguring curvatures known as scoliosis. Overloaded school bags that are up to double the size of those carried ten years ago are contributing to this surge. Health experts say children risk long-term and ultimately permanent damage if they regularly carry more than 15 percent of their body weight over their shoulders. The charity BackCare claims many youngsters are carrying as much as 20 per cent of their weight to and from school, and some up to 25 per cent.If children are getting back problems so young then there is the potential they will have it for the next 70 to 80 years, which leads to an enormous physical and emotional cost [1]All the notebooks and textbooks required for various subjects that a student is supposed to carry can easily be replaced by a single laptop thus avoiding any of the above mentioned problems.It is Eco-FriendlyAnnually 30 million trees are cut in the U.S alone to make books. Most of these trees that are cut down come from un-farmed sources. Globally, 70 per cent of the 335 million tons of paper the world uses each year comes from natural, un-farmed sources. In Canada, the UK's biggest source of pulp, 90 per cent of its output comes directly from its ancient forests. When trees are cut down in such a manner, not only do we lose them but in addition we disturb the fragile balance in the eco-system that had existed between the trees and other living organisms that had habituated in and around the area of these trees. We are in an age where most of our natural flora and fauna are already being wiped out to accommodate the growing population, at this stage we simply cannot afford to bring down more trees for the sake of paper used in notebooks and textbooks when a more feasible alternative is available.VersatilityTextbooks get outdated quickly and schools have to dig out more cash to purchase up-to-date textbooks. With laptops, textbook publishers and teachers would be able to edit and update the information more easily on electronic copies of text. Teachers now would be able to select certain pages of workbooks to use online, instead of buying whole textbooks that in most cases we barely use half of. Up to date information would easily be at our disposal in a click of a button at practically no charge at all. It is also easier and faster to search up knowledge on laptops unlike in textbooks where you would have to spend a lot of your time and energy to dig up the correct information you were looking for. Moreover, having a single laptop is far more convenient compared to having multiple notebooks and binders. If students do all their homework assignments on the laptop, then there will be no more \u201cI forgot it at home\u201d excuses, unless they forget to bring their laptop and why would they forget to bring it if it was one of the only things they were required to bring?[2]No Prejudice based on handwritingDifferent people have different handwritings and some are good while some not. Research has shown that different handwriting styles have an effect on how a paper is graded and the marks a student receives.[3] From a teacher's perspective, poor handwriting may reflect to them as a lack of interest or understanding. Whether they realize it or not, teachers evaluating or judging papers with bad handwriting tend to get frustrated and biased. Laptops remove all such problems and students will now be judged for the content and matter they present and not on their style of writing.Laptops are cooler than textbooks and notebooksEven though something being cool is subjective it is unarguable that laptops are more fashionable and stylish than any textbook or notebook can ever be. No normal student would disagree that he would rather be found with a laptop than a bunch of textbooks. Laptops can be used in the darkThough this necessarily isn\u2019t a strong pragmatic argument it is still an added advantage of laptops over textbooks and notebooks. There are numerous free softwares available in the internet that can enable you to reduce the brightness of your computer screen beyond what is possible by its hardware.Nelson PIRES screen dimmer : http://www.nelsonpires.com...Pangolin screen Brightness: http://www.pangobright.com... This argument confutes CON\u2019s assertion about laptops causing eye strains and uncomfortabilities. The brightness of laptops could be reduced to such scales that they practically emit no extra brightness at all. Rebuttals:Here I will be addressing to the assertions made by CON that were unrefuted in my main arguments.(note: I have indicated CON's statements by using italics and underlining them)who said they wouldn't be playing when in class as wellThere are a plethora of free softwares available for both ipads and laptops that limit and monitor the activities a user performs. With these softwares it would be a cakewalk for the school authorities to prevent students from playing in class.PeekTab Tablet Monitoring Software: http://www.peektab.com...Windows Server Monitoring Tool : http://www.manageengine.com...Ipads and laptops are a lot more expensive than ordinary textbooksYes this is so. But the expense is only one time unlike notebooks and textbooks where you have to replace them annually. With that said, the expenditure involved in buying notebooks and textbooks for the whole of a student\u2019s education will more than likely be balanced out with the onetime expense involved in buying a basic laptop and furthermore, with all the added advantages that laptops bring that I have mentioned in my arguments even if it doesn\u2019t balance out it is definitely worth the extra sum involved.Addendum:Now that my main arguments have been covered I\u2019ll now move on to firmly establish why laptops can and should replace notebooks and textbooks by showing a real life example where this was actually done.The school district of Huntsville, Alabama has recently implemented laptops and iPads into their teaching. They installed a multitude of security measures to protect the laptops from malware and a filter so students will not be able to peruse Facebook or play Minecraft during school hours. To prevent laptops from being stolen, they installed computrace to trace the laptops in case of theft. Students paid a usage fee of thirty-five dollars which is less than ten-percent of the full price for a laptop. At the end of the school year, only two computers were lost and none were stolen.[2]This without any doubt goes to prove that laptops/ipads can successfully replace notebooks and text booksSources:1: http://www.scmp.com...2: http://dublin.patch.com...3: http://www.ehow.com....",

            "premise": "Greetings. Looking forward to debating with you today. I shall list my points after each letter. A. The world is constantly changing as time progresses. This equals more technology developing and becoming more prevalent. B. First there were textbooks, Now there are iPads, Tablets, Laptops etc things of that nature. As time changes, Us humans must become accustomed to things. C. It is now the time for tablets generally speaking. This means certain things will become easier, Such as -- students don't have to worry about carrying a lot of heavy textbooks. Tablets will be easier to handle and it would be much easier for teachers/instructors to distribute as learning tools for the students. D. There may be some old textbooks meaning torn out pages, Students scribbling all over the pages with inappropriate things on them perhaps and things of that nature. E. Reading online is just the same as reading from a text book. Nowadays students are tech savvy. We are always on our phones -- I say we since I am a college student. So with that being said, Tablets would work in their favor as opposed to modern textbooks. In closing: Tablets are easier to use, Easier to distribute, More convenient and lighter than a textbook so it will be easier carrying it around. It's better than to flip through tons of pages just to get where you need to be. Plus as I said in point A, More and more technology is playing a big part in society and we must adapt to them. I am now done with my response. Thank you.",

            "conclusion": "iPads should replace papers and books in schools.",
            "premise": "Firstly, I would like to express my anger in losing a very long-written argument by clicking one stupid button. Okay, let's try this again. After researching the subject, I am beginning to see that this debate is a bit unspecific. Firstly, much of the current controversy has been about replacing textbooks in schools, and not necessarily all books as your title suggests. Also Pro didn't specify whether this applied to college, high school, or all schools. I will have to assume we are discussing all schools. A. Convenience Pro first gives reasons that the iPad is convenient, hence he prefers it to non-digital supplies. The iPad has previously been used at the college level with mixed feelings from the students. I would like to point out that not everyone shares his preference of the iPad or finds it convenient. In fact, in a study it was found that 75% of college students preferred traditional textbooks in which students can highlight and write notes. [1] Girls especially were found not to prefer textbooks... I'm not sure what that means. B. Cheapness Pro suggests that it is cheaper to invest in iPads than textbooks. In a 2008 study of public schools in Kentucky it was estimated that the cost of textbooks and supplies totaled around $44 million. The cost per school was around $988 for textbooks and supplies.[2] That is less than the cost of two iPads which I believe start at $499. To provide iPads to all the students in that school, in that state, or even in the country would be an enormous sum. And what happens if a student damages their device? Is the student's parents required to pay $500 for a new one? Which brings me to my next point, the inconveniences of the iPad. 1. Durability The main difference between an iPad and a textbook that Apple and other companies cannot avoid is the event of dropping the device. I drop my textbook often and at worst a page is bent. I then promptly flatten it out. If I run into that kid who can't decide if he's going to the left or right and my iPad is knocked from my hands, the screen is broken to bits. Or consider if someone has a less reliable tablet other than a Mac and it crashes\u2013it is a computer after all. Each case requires a hefty sum either from the student, the parents, or the school. 2. Digital Books Consider the differences of stealing a printed book and a digital book. A digital book can be stolen much easier and with little or no consequences as demonstrated by the music industry. After computers came along, stealing music became as easy as pressing a button. If books are digitalized, online piracy is a real possibility. This is not in the best interest of many book writers and publishers. 3. Libraries You suggest that iPads will someday entirely replace books. This would render public and school libraries useless. A digital library would make no sense\u2013why would any book be bought if it could simply be downloaded off the library for free? Since this doesn't work, libraries would have no purpose. Thus, books could no longer be borrowed for free. Each book would have to be purchased unless it is public domain. It follows that many resources will be more expensive for students who need to do research. Lastly, Pro mentions saving trees. The beautiful thing about trees is that they grow again. We may conclude that while the iPad has its purposes, it should not replace the printed books used in schools. We can also be sure that the printed book will retain its importance in society despite the benefits of the iPad. [1] http://www.mediabistro.com... [2] http://finance.ky.gov...",

            "premise": "I will now state some advantages of having a textbook. 1. Learners: Visual Learners (the majority of the student population): Studies have shown that people using printed textbooks actually extract more from the content in front of them than those who use tablets or e-books. With textbooks, a visual placement of information is obtainable. Unlike a tablet, using a textbook is simple. For example, if I need to highlight, annotate, or circle different words to help me sufficiently absorb information, it's easy to snatch a pen or pencil nearby and make notes. However, with a tablet, I cannot fulfill my need to understand better the information. I cannot be as well-organized as I want to be. Just to mark something on a tablet, I would have to change tools (or even tabs). By then, I'd definitely lose my train of thought. Never-ending scrolling can be tiring and weary. Plus, words on a tablet have different fonts and sizes which take away from the overall learning experience of an individual. Kinesthetic learners: In addition, the newer textbooks are allowing students to write their answers, responses, and take notes inside their textbook. There are many students which value the kinesthetic traits of a textbook. Feeling the textbook, highlighting in it, and turning the pages allows kinesthetic learners to understand better the lesson. 2. Penmanship Textbooks encourage students to write and take notes while reading. Although tablets have apps in which you can take notes in, the lack of writing with a pencil and paper will eventually disrupt a scholar\"s handwriting. (Yes, I know you can take notes on a separate paper but isn\"t it kind of hard to organize physical notes with online lessons?) Anyways, most kids spend their free time on electronics so when exactly will they practice their penmanship? I have many friends who have really bad handwriting due to lack of practice.",

Are you sure that every school in every part of the world can afford to replace textbooks, which they used for decades, with high-tech equipment like iPads and PCs? Impossible! The world is not as advanced as what you painted it to be! Most importantly, I am talking about the fluidity of education. which is serving students of different needs with different things. You see, my counter-policy for replacing textbooks with iPads is using both iPads and textbooks. I bet you will say,'Why can't we only use iPads since they are so advanced,\" Well, my answer is that not all students are fit for an all-technology way of education. Maybe some people, like you, can self-study and do your work on the iPad without help, but not everyone studies like you. Some students need special attention, teachers could help them by textbooks, of course, but imagine an iPad trying to explain a hard question to a student who has thinking difficulties. The solution to these problems are being more fluid in the way of teaching. Both iPads and textbooks can cater to different students, but a combination of these two is what an advanced, high-tech world should be like.",

            "premise": "From the looks of it, the BOP would either be on PRO or would be shared. Nevertheless, I will begin with my arguments against this claim that I am strongly against. \"1, Is inconvenient for the students whoever needs to transfer to different classes during the short time of break.\"I'm not so sure where you are from, but it takes quite a long time for teachers to assign specific textbooks for students to be able to use. This being, your claim that it is \"inconvenient\" to use is rather doubled-sided and therefore can so far be considered to be invalid. Within my school, all of the textbooks that are the same, the school will put on a code on it (with numbers or other characters), in so identify that book as being itself. Once a student borrows that textbook, there name will be marked down onto a records sheet to show that that specific textbook is being borrowed by that student. Having one big textbook, suitable to be used for the entire year, will make this tiresome process a lot simpler and a lot easier for the teachers AND students. \"2, This kind of testbook usually costs a lot of money, because the is thick, good-paper-printed, and too many coulour printed, is the waste of trees and earth energy.\"If there is a textbook used for the entire year, it will most certainly be cheaper than two textbooks for the entire year, therefore, your argument here is invalid and needs to be reconsidered. For most textbooks, there will be a hardcover on the front and the back, and other pages with credits, and references to people and companies that were part of the production of that book. One big textbook for the entire year will save those pages, energy and money in comparison to two or more smaller textbooks to be used for the entire year. \"Is threaten for others and users safty. Sometime, when you are careless, you might hurt yourslef or others badly with those chunky books . It can even be used as a tool to hurt and flight with other people.\"Be realistic, who could possibly hurt themselves from holding onto a large textbook? A single large textbook that they use should be held firmly within your hands, or otherwise within your bag if you have enough room there. If you drop the textbook, it shouldn't hurt your feet as students are required to wear protective leather shoes to schools as part of their uniform (at least in Australia they are). Anyway, that would only apply to extremely large textbooks that have hard covers, which I think wouldn't be only for one year, but many years to come. As for the part that a large textbook can be used as a tool to hurt and flight [suppose it is FIGHT] with other people, once again, be realistic. Who can of immaturity would it be like to use a textbook to fight with another student. As well as that, considering the textbook is larger, and therefore heavier, it is once again, a double-sided argument. A smaller textbook, with fewer pages, would be lighter, and therefore easier to hurl at the person you are trying to attack. A lighter textbook used to attack another student is:1. Fast to deliver the blow as it is lighter than a thicker textbook2. Not as energy consuming because it is, once again, lighter Arguments:A larger textbook can be a good source for revision. Say for example, you have completed the first half year, and you have had a half-year based textbook that must be handed in, in replacement for the second half of the year textbook. With that textbook gone, you will no longer be able to look through those lessons that you may have forgotten. If your notes aren't clear, and you want to refer to the textbook that you USED to have, what do you do? With a larger textbook, that can be used for the entire year, is more efficient because you are constanly able to revise through all the work you have done throughout that entire year, just from one book. A heavier book will give you a stronger body Yea, pretty obvious isn't it? If you hold onto a heavier textbook when you are walking to and from school (or uni or other education-related places), you are more or less excercising when you are holding onto that heavy textbook of yours.

            "premise": "Thank you for your response.I'm going to go back over that last round then point something out that applies across the debate.1) LearnersMy opponent here doesn't really provide any sort of evidence concerning the highlighting usage of a tablet.I beg to differ. I had an app called iAnnotate in high school for my iPad, which had a very easy control panel where I could click on a pen or a marker or a highlighter and mark all over my text, and I didn't have to worry about it bleeding onto the next page. It was faster and easier than using actual highlighters and such in my textbook.Aside from the above point, my school did not let us mark in our textbooks unless it was pencil and we erased it at the end of the year. So while it may be different at other schools, not all schools have the benefit of marking in the textbook, meaning that eBooks are a better option on two levels.Aside from that, lots of e-readers require you to make the motion flipping a page in order to switch pages meaning we still get the same benefit here.And my opponent attacks fonts saying that it distracts from learning. I'm not sure what my opponent means. Some people need bigger text in order to read clearly, something that can't be adjusted in a textbook. I need my opponent to further explain why font is such a negative when it comes to learning.2) PenmanshipWell to be honest, penmanship is becoming less important by the year, but my opponent did make a flawed argument here as well.I'm getting the feeling that my opponent is forgetting that eBooks are almost exactly like textbooks. That means you can have the eBook out along with a pencil and paper and take notes while referencing your eBook. There's no signficant harm here.Now allow me to address some other things that are on my side:1) Just a few more benefits of eBooks:- Tablets are light meaning that instead of carrying around 50 pounds of books and school supplies, you can just carry a 1 pound tablet and school supplies, which allows your backpack to last longer saving the students money.- Tablets do not require a forest to be cut down, while making the paper for all the textbooks in the US will require cutting down a signficant number of trees. Trees take a long time to regrow, and they give us oxygen.- The fact that we avoid cutting down trees saves us money on textbooks which can ultimately make them cheaper, which saves school's money.- The resources on the Internet or within the tablet enable students more than a textbook and paper.- Most businesses heavily rely on electronics, so having students learn how to do work on an electronic device before getting a job better prepares them.Anyway, that's all for now. 2) Dropped points Now allow me to address the debate. My opponent has dropped all of the points before round 3, meaning that he conceded the entire debate up until round three. So all of the arguments before round 3 now work for my side along with my arguments in round three. My opponent has a chance to make rebuttals in the last round.Thank you for reading.",

Also, the school would have to take lots of time to put parental controls on that, or else students will use it for something other than work and the teacher won't notice. In school with textbooks, teachers will notice if there is an electronic device is pulled out and will take it away just to make sure they stay focused on work. Having iPads would be time-consuming and expensive. There is also schools that have gone 'paperless', but they are private because kids choose public schools so they don't have to pay fees, like for an iPad.",

            "premise": "It would improve a student's life significantly the everyday weight will be removed, you dont need artifitial light to see students also spend hours on searching for definitions and words witch will only take seconds with the notepad also it can hold thousands of 'pages'withou the need to chop down 1 tree when you use the notebook there is also no need to buy pens and pencils glue or booksalot of students suffer from back injurys thanks to the heavy bags they need to cary all the time alot more can be mentioned but this is the top phew,Every year, students in school develop back problems due to carrying the overbearing weight of school textbooks in their book bags. The heavy, lagging weight of a backpack often causes long-term health issues and back pain for students. Aside from notebooks and binders, students also have to carry pencils, pens, and spare paper. The average high school student\"s backpack weights between ten and twenty-five pounds, while the average laptop weights between three and eight pounds. A study directed by Brandon Macias of UCSD\"s Department of Orthopedic Surgery decided that students often carry backpack loads of twenty-two percent of their body weight when it is only recommended to carry fifteen at most. While laptops are still expensive, ranging from 250-700 dollars each, the price of a single laptop compared to the cost of multiple textbooks is considerably less on the school district\"s wallet.1) They are WAY to HEAVY. (Second graders shouldn't have back problems and scoliosis.) 2) They CONSTANTLY need to be UPDATED. (Electronic textbooks can be updated easier and can reach the students almost instantly.) 3) Textbooks are made of TREES. (Just think of how many trees could be saved by using tablets or laptops.) And there are kids with back and arm pain from carrying to many books to their next class for 2 classes later only because their locker is not by them but if you have a laptop that is all you need only because you can make seperate folders for each class and the teacher can email you the assignment and you can type in the answers then print it or email it back to them.People can type better on tablets, handwriting would not matter. Better prepared for life. Textbooks can get worn out. Can't lose homework. Pads take up less space. Saves paper and Ink cartridges. No pencil sharpening. 1000's of apps. Dictionary on board. It would be a lot less space taking than desktop computers.",

            "premise": "The benefits of tablets in schools: Extending learning iPads and other mobile devices are extending learning beyond the classroom walls by moving with the student from the classroom, to the library to the home. This provides the flexibility and opportunity to continue learning where and when the student chooses. A vast library of resources With thousands of apps, students and teachers have instant access to a wealth of information from experts in their fields. For example, Khan Academy has a variety of high quality lecturers on a range of curriculum subjects and the Encyclopdedia Britannica app allows you to explore an array of knowledge in an easy to use digital format. Reducing printed material and books iPads are being used to reduce the need for heavy textbooks and the production of reams of printed material. Digital content can be updated continuously and has the ability to include hyperlinks and videos. It can also potentially offer financial savings on textbooks and materials. Improving STEM skills The use of apps and gaming techniques in the classroom can aid understanding of complex concepts and the development of science, technology, engineering and maths skills (STEM). According to the Department for Education, two of the largest studies in the UK looking at ICT\u2019s impact on attainment have found there are statistically significant positive relationships between the use of ICT and achievement in these core areas. Engaging the hard to reach Technology is seen as increasing students\u2019 confidence and motivation by making school work more enjoyable. A student\u2019s attitude and involvement in learning changes as it is considered as fun and not regular education. Preparing students for the workplace The ability to confidently use technology in the 21st century is a necessary skill in most workplaces. Using digital tools on a daily basis in schools will further develop the learners\u2019 abilities to use the technology they are likely to encounter in their future careers.Source:http://westwoneducation.co.uk...;",

            "premise": "I will answer each point breifly, then continue to refute the points my opponent has brought upon me. FIRST: This is fine, let us assume schools have certain obligations. SECOND: I agree with my opponent once more; he must now prove that DVDs, PDFs etc. have unique benefits that outweigh textbooks. However, my opponent DOES NOT assert the problem that arises when the students simply cannot afford a laptop. In the status quo, a laptop is viewed as a luxury item for teens, most parent would be upset if it suddenly became a requirement for them to fetch out $400-2000 on a school laptop. http://www.geeks.com... <--- Cheap laptops; but not necc. the most reliable. http://www.blaptops.com... <--- the average laptop is $1000 THIRD: Replace doesn't matter. FOURTH: This is where we continue to disagree. My argument is simple. CDs and laptops eventually run out of battery and die. They are more prone to scratches and other defects that do not/can not occur in a textbook. Sure, a textbook may have ripped pages, or may be defaced; this only means that \"schools ought to issue legible textbooks\", not replace them with cost-ineffective, unreliable digital mediums. I'd like to offer a FIFTH point: Distractions. Laptops are extremely dangerous. When I open my laptop for studies, I generally fall straight onto facebook, myspace or other social networking sites. We know that teens are addicted to these sites however when we give them a laptop with internet access, they are susceptible to viewing these sites and not doing homework. My opponent may respond by saying the internet CAN be blocked or etc. but this is outside the scope of the topic. He cannot fiat that in EVERY instance, or even MOST instances this will occur. So we must take this into account as a disadvantage. http://www.time.com... ___________ My opponent's points: FIRST: Certainly I cannot deny the ease of use when compared to a textbook, however this does not outweigh how unjust it would be for a low-wage student to be forced to purchase a laptop, or be responsible for a rented laptop that his family cannot afford. The \"ease of use\" argument is further outweighed by the fact that distractions are inevitable. Just as \"easy\" as it is the copy and paste a sentence; the student can log onto his Myspace account and not even get to his actual assignment. We have had textbooks since schools were first created, it is certainly not that much of a hassle to continue its usage. The costs outweigh this benefit. SECOND: Here my opponent asssumes a few things: 1) The student will not harm a laptop 2) The student would not misplace it. 3) If you give a person something nice they will attempt to take care of it. He precedes each of these statements with remarks like, \"it is obvious that...\" \"its common sense that...\" etc. However, these statement are intentionally misconceiving. Allow me to show you how these statements are invalid: FIRST: \"The student will not harm a laptop\" My opponent does this as a comparaison. However, it is highly unlikely that a students would regard their laptop like its gold. Laptops break all the time, this is an undeniable fact (check the link) ALL laptops break eventually, and we cannot assume that a teenager has the ability to keep them in perfect condition for a year. http://consumerist.com... My opponent continues by saying after 5 years a textbook is ruined. Sure. Let us assume that this is true, we can purchase another textbook for $50, however laptops only last three to five years according to cnet.com Senior editor Matt Elliot. And I ensure you it will cost more than $50 to replace that laptop. http://reviews.cnet.com... SECOND: \"The student won't misplace it.\" Essentially, insofar as the first point has been taken out respectively; this point doesn't matter. But, to entertain the point: We have ALL lost something valuable unintentionally. I, personally, have lost a laptop on my shuttle at a local airport. And I have a friend that lost her backpack while camping last weekend. We all lose things, my opponent cannot fiat otherwise. THIRD: \"If you give a person something nice they will attempt to take care of it.\" Have you ever given a teen something? If you have you know that this point is blatantly incorrect. If you haven't allow my these videos to explain: http://www.youtube.com... <--- I know, he's a baby, but still, you get the point. http://www.youtube.com... <--- These are teens. I think this wraps things up. In summary, I have proved that the laptop alternative is distracting, dangerous, economically unfair, and economically undisireable. I have also shown you that my opponent's advocacy is either outweighed, or untrue. For these reasons it would be logical to vote in my favor, CON. Thank you for your time and consideration, Protagoras (is back)",

            "premise": "Firstly, I would like to thank Pro for putting this debate up. It's not bad at all for a first debate, quite good rather, but I am confident that after the voters finish reading my final arguments the winner will be clear. 1. I have another source on a similar study that suggests that, instead of iPads, students prefer textbooks that they can \"mark up and highlight to aid in studying.\"[1] The main point here is that students prefer textbooks, thus, since Pro cannot refute this, iPads should not replace textbooks in schools. Also, Pro believes print books will become nothing more than antiques, but this is unsubstantiated and probably false. 2. Pro concedes that \"the risk of stealing is higher in digital media.\" The reason it is not currently prevalent is due to the fact that the demand for eBooks is low. Once eBooks are widely purchased, we will likely see a similar case to that of the music industry. 3. IPads tend to break easily. The fact that I can drop a book from a building and it\u2019s still readable while an iPad would be crushed to pieces is a fact that Apple or any other company cannot escape. Pro has no answer to this, and Pro argues that these devices should be distributed to youths. Until an unbreakable iPad is created, schools should certainly not invest in them in the way proposed. 4. Pro points out that the devices need not be iPads nor particularly expensive. Pro proposes a reader specifically designed for schools, however, there is no such device currently that fits this description. 5. \u201cA common feature on many eBook stores is a trial copy, which is an abridged sample of a book available for free.\u201d Personally, I do not want an abridged version of select books to complete my research. This is not an alternative to borrowing books. The example of video stores is irrelevant, as video rental stores are not libraries. 6. Blind people cannot use iPads. Pro contends that books will \u201cend up in antique shops.\u201d I don\u2019t think there is any evidence for this claim. While iPads and the like certainly are useful, they cannot replace the printed book. Books have existed for thousands of years; they are the simplest and most reliable devices for reading. It is not as if we are replacing cassettes which were only around for a short time. An over-reliance on technology can be dangerous as well. I am not against iPads\u2013they are brilliant devices\u2013but they should be seen as simply a different way to read, not the only way to read. I think from all the arguments I have presented, it is safe to conclude that iPads should not replace books in schools. Thank you, that is all I have. [1] http://www.risoprinter.com...",

            "conclusion": "Schools ought to replace textbooks with a digital medium.",
            "premise": "thank you for accepting so quickly. Rebuttles 1. Yes a school is an inanimate thing, but that doesnt mean it cant be obligated to do something. My car ought to run and my shoes ought to fit. They are not living, yet it is something that they should do. Just because the school cannot assume the role of a living thing does not mean you cannot specify what it should or should not do. 2. It is true that in the resolution there was no specific reference, but refering to the word \"ought\" in the resolution i do not have to bring specifics into the argument. Let us assume that for this instance \"digital medium\" refers to but is not limited to DVDs and PDF files. In order to defend this i mearly have to prove that it would be in the best interest of the school and those influenced by such establishment to make the switch. 3. The dispute over the word \"replace\" is not really needed. DVDs were made to \"replace\" the VHS, but that doesnt mean that you can use DVDs and only that. Many things are created with the intent to \"replace\" things but that does not mean you still cannot utilize the other (older) objects. CDs do infact scratch but do books not rip? I have come across pagesthat have been defaced, spines that have broken and other issues that occur with books but that doesnt mean we have to go back to story telling. 4. Oh reliability, how you and technology go hand in hand so well. For this point alone i would like to assume that the digital media is on a laptop strictly for example. Now the average laptop battery last about 5 hours, that quite a long time. Not to mention there are power outlets located all around most school for charging of such items. If these were not reliable why would they be so accepted into mainstream society? Saying that a computer is not reliable is a silly fact, because if people didnt find them to be so we would still be hand writting our thesis papers and drawing our magazine adds. Throughout time these machines have become increasingly reliable, seeing as how you are looking at this now and your computer has not crashed yet has to prove that your computer is reliable. Now onto my own points 1 Ease of use 2 Cost effective 1. What is easier, looking for hundreds of pages to find a specific quote, of typing the portion of the quote you know into a search bar? Im sure everyone would agree that you will save time and energy by simply doing the computer search. What about viewing multiple pages that arent right next to eachother, you can do that without having to use multiple books if you were infact on a compter. There are obviously things you can do on a computer that you cannot physically do with a textbook, such as highlight specific portions, manipulate text and discover passages with ease. It is undeniable that a digital book is much simpler and lighter then a full sized text book. If the type on the page is too small on paper you have to hurt your eyes squinting, but on the computer it is a thing of the past when you can simply enlarge text files to suit your needs. 2 On to the cost of such a system, yes initially it may seem a bit pricey, but how much did your school pay initially for the textbooks it has? At an average of $50 per book the cost seems to add up quite quickly. You have to replace a textbook every, say, five years because students do not take care of such things. They get misplace, ripped, torn, thrown, burnt drawn on and the list goes on. Its obvious that if you were given a computer you would not harm it because it is important, useful and just cool to have. The odds of misplacing it rather then a book would be like comparing misplacing a skateboard over misplacing your car, its something that is extremely unlikely to happen. Its common sense that if you give a person nice, they will make an attempt to take care of it. As well as that my opponent argues that you will have to spend money on such technology ( ie digital books) but that isnt the case. Currently all books supplied by my school come with a disc, on that disc is a virtual copy of the book. In cases like this it becomes an effective solution because you no longer have to pay just to have a digital copy of such thing. I look foward to new point from my opponent rather than attacks on the resolution itself, thank you.",

            "premise": "Thank you for that responseI'm going to rebut my opponent's case.1) Cognitive mappingActually an eBook can do the exact same thing my opponent describes, because the eBook is written exactly like a textbook. Meaning that the textbook benefits still exist with an eBook2) HealthE-readers weren't even damaging to eyes 5 years ago.\u201cThe new LCDs don\u2019t affect your eyes,\u201d Mr. Taussig said. http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com...Allow me to explain why this is true, so you don't have to go digging through all that evidence to get to my point (although you can find the paragraph by hitting ctrl+f then copy and pasting the quoted text into the little box that appears).So anyway, the evidence basically says that the lights in a screen update the image every 8 to 10 milliseconds while our eyes update the image every 30 milliseconds, meaning that the screen looks constant to us. So it's essentially the same eye strain as staring at a piece of paper, except that you can adjust the text to make it easier to read.As for the color of the screen (the only thing that will really cause an sort of aches), Kindles are generally designed so that the books on there will appear in a soft light warm hue as opposed to the bright blue light a computer usually has. It basically looks like the pages of a book and causes the same amount of eye strain (I don't know about you, but I've gotten several headaches from reading my textbooks. That's just going to happen to people regardless).Screens have improved since then, meaning that we're fine to read off of screens.3) DistractionsThis is where we need to start testing the teachers. Put a teacher in front of a video of a bunch of students. Three of the students are staring at their tablets and not typing. The rest are constantly looking back and forth between the board and their tablets.Ask them which ones are taking notes.Ask them which ones are watching March Madness.If the teacher cannot figure this out, that teacher no longer qualifies to teach.My point here (and maybe I was a little too sarcastic about it) is that teachers can tell if a student isn't paying attention pretty easily. Teachers can tell if you're day dreaming or half asleep. They can tell if you're playing games on your tablet.Thank you.",

And its probably gonna hurt me in the long run.\" \"videos spoon feed on information, while pictures take a lot of cognitive thought to understand. even though it would be hard at first, if you learn it from a picture, you will understand it more fully.\" \"think you have great reasons, everyone on this side and the other one but really the tablets need to be the one's seen in classes!\" \"If a student breaks a tablet, it could take a while for a technician to fix it. It also takes a lot of money to fix a bunch of kid's tablets. Also, some students take advantage of tablets and play games during class. A lot of student learn better by reading things out of a book, so if we take books away and use tablets then those students can not learn the way that is good for them.\" \"I'm not happy about the costs involved with our district going digital. Each student will be given a tablet/laptop device. Grades 4-12 will take them home each night. In the contract we are \"required\" to sign, it states that the parents are responsible for the cost of the device is damaged. The device they purchased will cost us up to $600 if damaged, according to the district. I have three kids still in the public system. When questioned about the eye strain, headaches that may occur, the district's response is \"that's a valid question\", but gives not answers. The kids that have to take home the devices will be targets for theft. It was announced in the local paper that every student will be taking home their device (4-12). There are plenty of people in our area that will take advantage of that and I believe backpacks will be stolen off of kids backs. I know my kid tosses his backpack and I've seen plenty of others at the school do the same. I'm all for technology in the classroom. I don't believe they should take them home. I believe that technology should be used as a supplemental tool and not the main device for learning or teaching.\" http://tablets-textbooks.procon.org...",

            "premise": "Thanks for the debate. I could use a more light-hearted debate. First of all, they can't do everything on tablet computers until the school orients their education around them. Say, for example, if a kid at school one day has to take his iPad to school, on which he will read 5 articles, 1 chapter, take a practice quiz and a test. He then brake it on the way to school, which is extremely likely to happen. It could get broken during bullying, playing, accidents (I've personally seen many Apple products ruined by liquid damage), or just blatant acts of stupidity. What happens now? At best, he'll have double work the next day after his iPad has been replaced. Tablet computers aren't cheap, and kids wreck things, especially electronics. The main objection I have to is, is if our government pays for the tablets to give the kids. That's one more expense that our government shouldn't have. Also, kids will use them for non-school activities, which will cause distraction, and therefore, they won't learn much. A teacher can't tell if a kid's using his iPad to read the preamble to the constitution playing angry birds, or watching porn. There are methods that are used to try to prevent kids from misuse of the tablet, but they are usually very restrictive; not allowing the kids to do things that are useful. In some cases, they're not restricting enough. I've never seen any such method that is just right. Now for the showstopper argument. On ANY ANDROID OR ios device, these restrictions are easily bypassed. There are many known cases of children doing exactly this. I could find multiple ways for bypassing every known restriction system, and already have for the ones I've encountered. \"Almost immediately after receiving their new school-issued iPads this fall, students in Indiana and in California (and probably elsewhere) managed to bypass the security on the devices, \"hacking\" them for \"non-schoolwork\" purposes: listening to music, checking Facebook, surfing the web.\" (1) This website does mention that they think that it's good that the children are doing so, however, as I said before, they will not learn what they are at school to learn by bypassing the restrictions. I have to say that what they did was hardly \"hacking\", I believe that what they probably did, was a simple reset, which requires nothing but the iPad and a computer with iTunes. There are other ways that they could have bypassed without even accessing a computer though. Once one kid bypasses his tablet PC (and it will happen), bypassing will go viral. If a kid sees another kid do it, he'll research how to do it, ask the other kid how to, or bribe him. This kind of thing does happen in schools. The most reasonable solution, is if the schools had specially designed OSs to go on their tablets, but this would not be worth the effort or money. Is carrying books really an issue? Its another activity that will give them exercise. Books are easily replaceable, tablet PCs are not. Tablet PCs require configuration, books do not. Tablet PCs require fixing, books do not. Modern tablet PC configurations focus on online material, which makes them more of a problem than an aid if the power or internet blacks out. Kids would still have to carry their tablets. Transportation puts tablets at great risk, and these tablets would be in transit at least five days per week. When tablet PCs work, they would save work, but they don't always work. Tablet PCs also have bright displays, which wear out eyes much more than books. Even if the kid doesn't get his tablet PC bypassed, it can be distracting to be exploring the various features of the tablet. I know this from experience. I look forward to your response. 1: http://www.theatlantic.com...",

            "premise": "Thank you for providing me with such a vulnerable and painstakingly bias topic. My specialty. Commence the deconstruction. My opponent's argument is quite simple, he wants schools to replace textbook with a digital medium. This is wrong on multiple levels: FIRST: \"Schools\" are inanimate. One cannot assign a moral, nor any other type of obligation to an inanimate object. For example, saying \"my teddy bear ought to protect me\" assumes the agent is a rational being, insofar as it is not, the statement does not make sense, hence invalid. This means that I have sufficiently invalidated the topic, thus you are to vote con. http://pilliod.net... SECOND: \"Digital medium\" has no concrete meaning until assigned. Therefore, due to my opponent's inability to clarify this term it is left in its ambiguous, nebulous nature. Hence, a digital medium could just a DVD. So, unless the student can afford a DVD player, less fortunate will continue to be unable to assume a proper education. Let's assume the school passes out free DVD players, the cost inefficiency will not make up for any benefits gained. Thus, you can negate on this level insofar as my opponent does not specify which types of digital mediums he can use. http://www.businessdictionary.com... THIRD: \"Replace\" implies permanent banning of the aforementioned necessity. What this argument is that his advocacy implies that we ought to not use textbooks and only use digital mediums. The bad effect of this is that we need a back up in the case of a malfunction on behalf of the digital device. Say perhaps the CD scratches; this is a common problem. Thus, you negate the topic to the extent that my opponent's advocacy is not desirable. http://www.merriam-webster.com... <-- The third definition primarily. FOURTH: \"Digital medium\"s are not as portably reliable. \"Reliability\", we all hated that word when we got our first car, but when we saw that hot pontiac stuck out on the side of the rode, we were proud of our Toyota Corolla. What I mean by this is that, unlike the digital medium, the book is not going to run out of battery, or have glitches. Thus, you are going to negate because I have proved it less reliable. http://www.businessdictionary.com... http://discussions.apple.com... HENCE, you vote CON insofar as the PRO is advocating a less cost-efficient, reliable, and desirable device. Also, take into account the inherent problem within the topic that it is logically invalid. For these reasons I urge you to dismiss my opponent's advocacy. I also reserve my right to bring up new arguments in my next speech. Thank you for your time and consideration, Protagoras (is back)",

There are thousands of educational apps vying for the attention of teachers and pupils. Here are just some examples that are proving popular with iPad users in the classroom: The Poetry App Listen to poems by Eliot, Larkin, Frost, Plath and a dozen others read by well known performers. Also allows pupils to write, record and share their own poems. Digimap A seamless and fully searchable digital Ordnance Survey (OS) map of Great Britain. Historical OS maps can also be viewed, enabling pupils to see how landscapes have changed over the past 120 years. The Elements: A Visual ExplorationA \u201cliving\u201d version of the periodic table. Pupils can view more than 500 rotatable 3D images of the elements, together with a huge amount of detailed information. Described by Stephen Fry as, \u201cAlone worth the price of an iPad!\u201d ShowbieAllows teachers to assign, collect and review pupils\u2019 work, then provide detailed feedback, either individually or collectively, using annotations, text notes and voice notes directly on to pupils\u2019 documents.And also, Tablets only take 4 weeks to repair on average, and if the school has enough money like mine does, then you can get a loaner tablet easily.Source: http://www.telegraph.co.uk...thank you so much for this debate, my friend, we had a good debate didn't we?

I would just like to address a few issues.1) eBooksAlmost every updated scholarly source including publishers of textbooks are coming out with or have come out with e-texts for their material. The teccnological situation in America would make it extremely easy to implement the usage of eBooks across the nation.They can be downloaded or printed, they read exactly like a textbook (which seems to be my opponent's only concern), and they usually come with other resources like powerpoint slideshows and even tutorial videos for classes that require it.2) Internet resourcesGetting information from paper sources at a library is difficult for most people. Getting research from the Internet is easy. It's actually really easy. This makes it easier to find information in class for required research or out of curiousity when you have free time. If you don't believe me, type any question about something you may have to research here: www.google.com3) Wifi failureIt is true that wifi sucks sometimes. However, if schools innovated to using technology extensively for academic purposes, all technology would innovate along with it, partially out of sheer capitalism and partially out of necessity. When a need arises that a business can fix, that business is all over trying to make the best solution possible. This kind of movement could greatly improve internet servers and connection nationwide.4) Cost benefit analysis.1 cost and 3 benefits.Thank you for reading.",

            "premise": "Every year, students in school develop back problems due to carrying the overbearing weight of school textbooks in their book bags. The heavy, lagging weight of a backpack often causes long-term health issues and back pain for students. Aside from notebooks and binders, students also have to carry pencils, pens, and spare paper. The average high school student\"s backpack weights between ten and twenty-five pounds, while the average laptop weights between three and eight pounds. A study directed by Brandon Macias of UCSD\"s Department of Orthopedic Surgery decided that students often carry backpack loads of twenty-two percent of their body weight when it is only recommended to carry fifteen at most. While laptops are still expensive, ranging from 250-700 dollars each, the price of a single laptop compared to the cost of multiple textbooks is considerably less on the school district\"s wallet. Textbooks usually cost around a hundred dollars or more, yet the information gets outdated quickly and schools have to dig out more cash to purchase up-to-date textbooks. With laptops, textbook publishers and teachers would be able to edit and update the information more easily on electronic copies of text. Teachers would be able to select certain pages of workbooks to use online, instead of buying whole workbooks that we only use half of.",

            "premise": "Your argument is slightly repetitive, which forces me to be also. The benefit loss ratio tips heavily in the direction of loss, as students can abuse steal, or break their devices. Devices also cost a fortune, and schools are not just made of money. The average school has 700 students, and buying 700 tablets for each, even with education discounts from the supplier are provided. Additionally, I provided stats already for plagiarism and cheating rates, along with facts from the Department of Education. Technology facilitates this kind of misconduct, and despite all the benefits tablets may pose, in the ling run, they will end up being a problem. And I\"m sorry, If it takes you \"hours\" to find a word in a damn dictionary, I think you might consider going back to the drawing board on your life. Furthermore, technology is NOT A RELIABLE RESOURCE, as it is more susceptible to fraud and error. And if you think textbooks are fragile, what does that make a tablet or device? Now for some new material. Its not a one time cost for tablets. What do you think it costs for support for such devices? The average repair cost for a nook or kindle is 100$. Listening to how you spoke of multitasking, I assume you mean a higher quality device, which is even more expensive. This repair process is even time consuming. What if a student needs a tablet they broke, but cant access it because it is getting repaired? Another way technology poses itself as a liability. Leading on the health side of things, users of electronic devices are 10x more likely to have fibromyalgia and skull muscle disorders. Some of these disorders include shortsightedness (which is a muscle disorder) and neck problems. It can also screw with your sleep cycles as well. Screens cause the brain to release cortisol, a hormone the increases conductivity between neurons. This results in active thought rather than sleep, and sleep deprivation is a massive problem among young adolescents. So you decide, the voters, whether tablets are worth it or not ;D.",

Parents also say that when they carry their books it not only hurts them but stops the children to growing a right posture. \"Children theses days are growing up slouching and not walking straight.\" Humberto states. On Debate.com many adults say that iPads cost less money than two textbooks, and can hold many more.\"From Phoenix University textbooks for young adults courses are over $700 dollars for just one book.\" Elizabeth states \"Before I could begin to take my classes I had to have the books, and now I have to finish paying them off in the next five years.\" Young adults spend lots off money on school loans or textbooks alone for over at least five years. Christy has been in school loans since she finished college at the university of Phoenix many years ago. Students from Saint Justin Martyr school also state that iPads save way more trees than having textbooks constantly made, because of age.A paperback textbook takes at least a quarter of the trees leaves. Even though we find leaves all over the place we only use fresh tree leaves for books.iPads also help save trees, and helps boost our environment from becoming a waist land of man made items, or causing global warming to worsen.In conclusion iPads should be used instead of paper textbooks.",

            "conclusion": "Schools should switch to using e-books",
            "premise": "Honestly, I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say here. Are you saying that every student would have their own personal eBook, or are you saying that eBooks would serve as textbooks (ex. a Science class needs 30 textbooks, so instead, they have 30 eBooks with the textbook downloaded on it)? Either way, it makes no sense to switch over. If eBooks replaced textbooks on a one to one basis, in each individual classroom, it would still cost more than a textbook. The average eBook costs about $200. That's more than a textbook, that costs around $70 to $140, which is a figure you gave. Plus, to download the textbook on the eBook would cost even more money. I already talked about why personal eBooks for every student wouldn't be rational. Here are some reasons from my Round 1 post. \"Another reason why it wouldn't work is because it would be more confusing for the kids. When the kids in a certain classroom need a new book downloaded, they would most likely have to give their eBooks to their teachers who would download it overnight. However, they may need another book for homework that night that is on their eBook. It would be somewhat chaotic.\" \"Another reason why it wouldn't work is if a kid broke it, it would cost more money. Let's set up two scenarios; One is where a kid has 4 textbooks worth $100 each, and the second scenario, is where a kid has an eBook worth $150 plus the 4 textbooks on it worth $100 each, a total value of $550. If the kid from scenario 1 breaks one of his textbooks, that's only a $100 fine. However, if the kid from scenario 2 breaks his 1 eBook, that's $150 to replace the eBook, plus the $400 to re-download all of the textbooks that were downloaded on the other one, a total fine of $550. That's a difference of $450, and considering today's economy, that is a lot of money.\" You said that schools can buy a license so the books can be copied onto each eBook when necessary. Well, how much money would that cost? That's just another extra charge that you wouldn't need to pay with regular books. Same thing goes with the charging docks. You don't need charging docks on each desk with textbooks. Your argument about no longer losing textbooks is invalid. A student could still lose an eBook. The difference? More books would actually be lost if an eBook was lost than just 1 textbook. If 1 textbook is lost, that only affects one class. However, if an eBook is lost, you lose all of your books for all of your classes. You argument about nobody wanting to steal books anymore is also invalid. A student could steal an eBook just the same as a student can steal a paper book. Same thing goes with putting graffiti on the product. A student can and might graffiti an eBook the same as a regular book. Here is something you stated in your last argument. \"Dead-tree books can be destroyed in all the same ways as eBook readers.\" I didn't say that eBooks are easier to destroy than regular books. But it would cost more to replace an eBook than it would a regular textbook. Your figure for how much a textbook costs was $70 to $140. An eBook averages at about $200. Plus, to replace all the books on the eBook would cost possibly a few hundred dollars more. In today's economy, some families only make a few hundred dollars a week, so that's not a small amount of money at all to replace school material. In conclusion, it's more money for the school, more money for the kids. Why waste money?",

            "conclusion": "This House Believes That Schools Should Give Their Students iPads",
            "premise": "My opponent has mentioned factors such as eye strain, cost, breakability and writing. Out of these four main factors I agree with one - eye stain/dry eye. Yes, I agree electronic devices are the way forward. There will no long be books in the next century, so therefore I think students and these generations now have to train themselves to conquer this dry eye syndrome. As far as cost, the school could pay 60% of the price and then the students/parents pay the other 40%. This makes the price drop considerably. That is what they have done in my school and it works a treat! Regarding the breakability of the tablet, I agree to some extent. But schools should also install 'anti-drop' iPad cases therefore whenever students drop their devices, they are protected. Again, this is what they do in my school. Here are another 30 reasons why iPads should be given to students! 1. Apps - With over 65,000 education apps designed especially for the iPad and growing, just about every subject, learning style and grade level is covered.ipads in the classroom, education apps for the ipad, school wireless networks, An example of just one app is Nearpod. Nearpod allows teachers to deliver various types of content from quizzes, videos and info slides directly to the students devices. Those students can then send their work and/or responses back to the teacher which is stored on the teacher\"s account to be reviewed later or downloaded as a .pdf report. This kind of interaction is only possible because of the iPad. 2. \"82% of all web traffic generated by tablet devices is from iPads.\" 3. \"8 out of 10 teachers say their students want tablets (most of which is the iPad) in class.\" 4. The three largest publishers, producing 90% of all textbooks used in schools are all partnering with Apple to sell digital versions. 5. 86% of students believe that tablets (like the iPad) can help them to study more efficiently. 6. Over 8 million iPads have been sold to educators worldwide in 2012 alone! 7. 60% of faculty thought that students were more motivated by lessons that used the iPad than lessons that did not. 8. Improving literacy - Using even the simplest features of the iPad such as the voice recorder, are helping to improve the fluency of students.ipads in education, ipads in the classroom, school wireless networks, 9. Creating and Sharing Demonstrations - By using the iPad and Airplay, teachers can demonstrate a procedure once, record it and then play it back on a larger screen for students to view and discuss. 10. Interactive textbooks - with apps such as iBooks Author, students and teachers can create interactive textbooks featuring 3-D graphics, videos, and the ability to take notes. It has increased the level of learning through interaction and participation. 11. Battery Life - Clocking in at right around 10 hours the new iPad Air definitely has plenty of legs to get through the school day. 12. Mobility - iPads were built to be mobile, they are light, powerful and with the right case durable too, but they do require web access. (Its critical to make sure your wireless network can support iPads before bringing them on-board.)ipads in the classroom, ipads in education, school wireless networks, wifi companies, 13. Bandwidth - iPads require tons of bandwidth so again, before rolling them out you will need to make sure your school\"s wireless network has the required bandwidth in place. 14. Ease of Use - This might be subjective but overall iPads seem to be extremely easy to use right out of the box. Apple has given the iOS a very streamlined, organized feel; you have everything you need, and it works! 15. Security - Apple has arguably created the most secure operating system available on mobile devices. Downloading apps is more secure and iOS provides great systematic protections for multiple devices.mobile security solutions, mobile device management, school wireless networks, 16. 802.11ac - I know, I know, the new iPad Air doesn\"t have 802.11ac but it does have very solid 802.11n and MIMO (multiple in, multiple out). 17. 75% of students agreed that the iPad enhanced their learning experience. 18. A research study, conducted in Auburn, Maine showed that students in Kindergarten who were using iPads scored much higher on literacy tests than students who were not. 19. Social Networking - While some believe social networking to be counterproductive and a distraction, the fact of the matter is that it is a dominant form of of communication with students today. Educators today simply need to be creative when using social as a learning tool. Sharing ideas and coming together around topics of interest can be a powerful way to interact with students. It is also very important to develop and help students understand how to be responsible with social. 20. Video - this is almost a no-brainer. The iPad like many mobile devices is a master at bringing video into the education environment. using video on the ipad for education, ipads in the classroom, wifi service providers, school wireless networks,Through YouTube and various apps, video lessons and even video chat (face-time) can create interaction and creativity on another level. 21. Grading papers - thats right teachers, there is an app for that too! 22. In the United States alone over 2,300 school districts are using iPads in the classroom, and growing. 23. 55% of students say they wish their instructors used more simulations or educational games. Using the iPad the options are almost endless and are only limited to our imaginations. 24. Benefits Students with Disabilities - By using the touch screen capability students who lack motor skills can actually watch their finger move and write directly on the screen, this greatly improves their fine motor skills. Students with autism are naturals when it comes to using the iPad. Jeremy Brown a highly active and involved teacher for autistic elementary students finds great promise in the iPad and its touch technology. He has estimated that nearly 80 to 90% of his students with autism experience tremendous results when using iPads. 25. Personalized Lesson Plans for Students with Disabilities - The iPad allows teachers to easily and creatively tailor their lesson plans for each student based on what that student needs.ipads in education, how ipads help students with disabilities, school wireless networks, There are hundreds of apps specifically designed for students with special needs that teachers can use to enhance the learning experience just by using the iPad. 26. They\"re Light! - It seems that each year growing up I had more and more books to carry. With iPads all of those books can be carried and accessed digitally; the days of heavy books may be coming to an end\" 27. Environmentally Safe - iPads save on paper big time. Everything from handouts, tests, presentations and textbooks can now be delivered to everyone by the iPad. 28. Budget Friendly - You no longer have to replace old textbooks, digital updates make this cheaper, easier and faster. Teachers also don\"t have to worry about damaged or lost books as well, all of this saving big bucks in the long run. 29. Speaking \"their\" Language - Students these days use tablets and mobile devices from an early age, some as early as 1 or 2 years old! By the time they are in school it\"s second nature to use a tablet or mobile device. ipad in the classroom, ipad in education, wifi service providers,The iPad will keep their attention and resonate with students by aligning with how the new mobile generation wants to learn and communicate. 30. Ready for Tomorrow - Students today need to be technology literate. iPads and tablets play a huge role in preparing our students for college and eventually their careers. As educators we must develop these necessary skills safely and responsibly as soon as possible. (courtesy of http://www.securedgenetworks.com...)",

            "premise": "Secondary school students should be allowed laptops. It will benefit them in many ways; one of which is that it makes their high school lives so much more convenient. It is easier to be organised if you have a laptop with you; instead of hurriedly searching for missing notes or lost pages in a textbook or lined paper, you can simply save the file on your laptop, and never lose it again. Laptops are great for saving paper; a major issue in modern society, because as we all know, paper originates from trees. This property of laptops makes it easier and much more environmentally friendly to do things such as hand in a school assignment. Instead of taking the time to print out 20 pages of a science experiment report (this wastes a lot paper) and giving it to the teacher in person, students can simply send the assignment to the teacher electronically, who can read and mark it. Laptops can also be used in order to replace textbooks with a PDF file of that textbook, which can be stored on a laptop (this happens at my high school and at many others). This will greatly benefit the student, because the load they need to carry around becomes much lighter, which will benefit their back.",

To further clarify my original statement, this debate is on the level and types of technology that are appropriate for a secondary level classroom, not whether it should be in the classroom at all. I do believe that technology is not just important, but imperative in today's society. It is true that the majority of students have access to cell phones (smart phones), tablets, and computers from a very early age. Unfortunately, the primary purpose of this technological use outside of the classroom is for social media, pop culture consumption, and gaming. The reason this is unfortunate for educators, parents, and the children is because these educational distractions are also available on any internet enabled device students use in a classroom. Textbooks do not have extra distractions, need login info, or run out of batteries. E-readers and tablets have all of these issues. Not only do tablets cease to function as anything more than a paperweight without power, but they are more expensive than textbooks. Since school budgets are often quite limited, it is not common to have a 1-1 tablet ratio but having enough textbooks for students is rarely an issue. Even if a school used tablets and e-readers to present information for students, including digital textbooks with enhanced learning tools, the school still needs to pay for textbooks, and textbook edition updates. Having tablets only seems to increase the cost of classroom materials, and increase the electricity usage (and carbon footprint by extension) for the school. I agree with opponent's point about the possibilities of visualizing the inner workings of a molecule, or biological cells and systems, and with the use of virtual reality it almost reminds me of the kinds of activities the fictional Mrs. Frizzle led on The Magic School Bus cartoon. Fanciful, entertaining, and also not necessary for student understanding. Teachers can present the same content, with the same levels of student understanding, using an overhead projector, blackboards, and textbooks as a teacher using Powerpoint, SmartBoards, and tablets. Students are going to be bringing their phones to school, and we can not monitor what is being used on them without looking over every shoulder all the time. The ease of app switching, and the prevalence of popup notifications, makes it inevitable that students will be off task if they have access to these devices during class time. The alternative of giving students devices with lockout restrictions is only a temporary stopgap. I've seen the hacks they use to access sites that are not allowed. One example among many is YouTube. A network firewall prevents any computer connected to the school's internet from accessing YouTube directly. It does not limit the use of Google Translate, which has an imbedded mini-browser, which they exploit to watch any YouTube video since the main browser shows they are only on the Google Translate website. Technology can definitely enhance learning, and like any tool, can be used properly or grossly misused. I maintain that the effort to monitor and control misuse often outweighs the small benefit for the current usage in classrooms.",

Text books take up too much space and are expensive and heavy, and while they have been used for decades they are just too impractical for our generation. If we just give students their own iPad or provide them before class we could save a lot of time and money. I usually place my math text book in my locker and it just becomes a hassle to have to go back to my locker and pick it up. I think now we are starting to convert to using iPads and the era of text books is fading and while textbooks might be beneficial to some students I think the majority would prefer iPads. Also having a touch screen could boast some benefits over traditional text books in the sense that kids could work on the actual iPad versus using a work book and so on.",

Some teachers also allow music to be played from their computer or classroom radio. Students can learn much more from their textbook than they can from their phone or tablet. My school has laptops for each student to carry around and take home to use for homework. A lot of the teachers use the system 'Angel' for homework and notes. So, the only time we can get our laptop out at school is to get an assignment from there. In conclusion, cell phones should not be permitted in schools. They are a big distraction to the students while they are supposed to be learning.",

            "premise": "In my many years of attending school, I have always found it much more convenient to read eBooks instead of paper books, to type essays rather than write them by hand, and to not have to carry heavy stacks of textbooks around. Technology makes schoolwork, as well as office work, easier for two main reasons: convenience and cheapness. We all have done it in our lifetimes. We have forgotten folders, lost documents, and misplaced stationery every once in a while. An amazing advantage of computers is that they compress large amounts of information into small sizes. Some computer disks and flash drives can store entire volumes of Shakespeare's works within a couple inches. World Book Encyclopedia is now available on the Internet, when before it was available in large books at the library. iPads don't require pencils, papers, books, or any other office supplies. Compressed information results in a lower chance of misplacing something and an easier time trying to find a specific document. Furthermore, iPads are faster and more productive. The average typing speed of a regular human is around 25 words per minute. Many professional computer users type up to 50 words per minute, and others can type even faster. At such speeds, lessons go by faster and more content can fit into one school semester. Additionally, iPads fit well within the budget of many schools. Digital copies of textbooks are much easier to access and are much more affordable to purchase than print copies. Backpacks and lockers would be rendered obsolete. iPads also save trees, as they cut down on waste products from paper. In conclusion, iPads are the ideal system of organization in schools and offices. They are convenient, in which much information is stored in small sizes and kept together in one place, and cheap, as digital information is now becoming more affordable than print. As evolution continues to rock the modern world, digital devices will become more and more reliable. Someday, they will entirely replace print books, and hopefully, that day will come soon.

            "premise": "\"Kids graffiti on books since it is hard to look through every page and find every scribble, making it an \"easy way to be rebellious\". Only an idiot would graffiti on an eBook because it is easier to be caught doing it.\" This is a statement completely driven by opinion. You don't know if a kid would or would not graffiti an eBook because it's easier to see than books. I know people that vandalize bathrooms, desks, tables, etc. in our school, and the vandalism is very \"easy\" to see with those things. One thing I know for certain is whether I am drawing/writing something offensive or vulgar on a book or an eBook, I can do it with just 30 seconds of time, and so could every other kid that wants to. \"Carrying many heavy books over a long period of time is bad for one's health, and some schools even check the students for posture because of this! They would save money if they didn't have to hire the doctors for the day (where I'm from there aren't any school nurses). Bad posture is not a good thing to have. It can cause worse problems (such as a bad back or even collapsing) later on. The only possible health concern with an eBook is eyestrain, and that is only if the reader uses a backlit screen (most eBooks have a paper-like screen).\" You haven't provided proof that carrying too many books at one time will cause bad posture. Besides, you stated in your argument that eBooks cause eyestrain. So, we're going to a product that \"causes\" health problems (textbooks) to a product that...causes health problems (eBook). I don't see how that is an improvement, even if carrying a lot of books causes health posture. Your tree argument doesn't quite add up. Textbook/book paper is just as recyclable as toilet paper and cloth napkins. Paper is paper, it's all recyclable. So, when a school wants to get new textbooks, they buy the new textbooks, and the old ones go to be recycled or donated. Paper isn't necessarily going to waste when it comes to textbooks. \"If each textbook cost $90, and each student requires 5, that's 90x5 = $450 to supply 5 textbooks that have a lifespan of about 4-7 years. An eBook reader costs 100 dollars, and it should have a lifespan of 4-7 years or so (same as a textbook), and the textbooks should be free or cheaper for the school because the school will have a license. (Let's say the school pays 700 dollars for a license to download the book onto e-book readers without having to pay for every download). That's 100 dollars per student, plus the licenses that apply to the whole school. The higher consequences of a broken e-book may actually be a \"deterrent\" that prevents students from losing the eBook reader or scribbling on it, and risks of dropping it can be minimalized by using a rugged casing purchased at the store. A rugged casing can cost about 60 dollars, which is about the same as what most people spend on book covers (each book cover costs $3 x five books a year x 4 years = $60)\" Once again, that's $100 for the eBook, $700 for the license, and $60 for the cover. That totals to $860. That's much more than the 5 textbooks that you estimate to be $450. Plus, the cost to download each individual book would send that cost even higher. Here's a link to an eBook download store. These books still cost money to download, unlike what you have stated in your argument. (http://www.ebooks.com...) To conclude this debate, eBooks would be more expensive than textbooks and eBooks wouldn't be any better than textbooks. That makes a transition from eBooks to textbooks pointless, a waste of time, and most importantly, a waste of money.",

It is especially important for 8-year-olds to have phones because they have a tendency to get lost, and if they need some one to pick them up from school or sports it can be very helpful. If they need help from friends on homework they can text or call them. :)",

In \"Why Homework Does More Harm than Good\" by Etta Kralovec of Pepperdine University, she talks about how homework doesn't help students at all. http://colleague.pepperdine.edu... Homework disrupts a students young life. Instead of \"learning things from their parents, they are at the table completing unfinished school work.\" She claims. After loads of research, I can agree with the above statement. Homework puts so many things on hold in a child's life. The necessary life stills that you just cant learn from a textbook are not there for a lot of kids these days due to over working from the school system. I think spending more time in school would be a better solution. This would eliminate the need for homework, and give families that time to spend with there children. Instead of school starting at 8:30 per say, let it start at 7:30 or even 6:30. This would be a much better for both families and teachers.",

Keeping this in mind, textbooks leave only minimal examples of the learning material and they tell you to do the rest based on this knowledge. More times than not, there is a twist. They give you some of the required basics and ask you questions that get much harder from then on. The textbook won't tell you how to expand this knowledge but only test you and you will get an answer to check if you were right. What students really need is a more interactive and visual sense of education. Textbooks are not right for that.What students need is a solutions manual to the hardest of questions where it explains all the neccassary steps to achieve your solution. Tutors everywhere know that textbooks over complicate things and actually, so do most teachers, which is why they don't rely soloely on textbooks. This means there is much room for improvment.Let's conclude, Tutors don't like textbook, Teacher's aren't too fond of them and students would be better off learning in a more interactive visual way which has been proven many times to be more beneficial than texbooks.",

            "premise": "The Japanese government is not forcing schools to teach Japanese history in a way that whitewashes the Japanese record in World War II. In Japan the Ministry of Education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available. Schools are then allowed to select their textbook from a list of seven or eight textbooks that have been approved both by the ministry.[1]\u00a0By making this choice schools are exercising their freedom of speech in deciding what should be taught in their classrooms. In the case of the New History Textbook (Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho) not a single state run junior high school adopted the textbook resulting in a mere 0.03% of junior high school students using the textbook.[2]\u00a0By contrast China\u2019s textbooks and their misrepresentations are mandatory.\u00a0[3]This shows that when the Japanese people are given freedom of information on the issue they exercise this right responsibly.

            "premise": "While tech can be great, it also has its weaknesses. For one, its not available in all schools due to the funding needed to find 700+ tablets and/or computers. And if everyone cant have them, then who gets them is the question. Two, while tech makes things easier, that\"s not always for the best. According to plagiarism.org, In the US alone, 59% of high school students admitted to cheating on an assessment or paper in 2014, and 39% admitted doing it more than once. With the increase in tech availability, Summarized by the United States Department of Education, the numbers rose to 62% and 43% for both stats in 2015. The correlation proves that technology can be and is being abused in school environments. No matter how many restrictions and rules you put out there, there will always be ways to circumvent them. Addressing your point on backpack size, that is a simple fix that doesn't need any introduction of technology. Introduce lockers, which I\"d like to point out nearly all schools have, and extend the passing periods to motivate students to utilize their lockers. To compensate for the loss of education time, simply extend the school day to match the passing period extension, which should be no more than 20 minutes or so. Third, I think its safe to say tech is a pretty big liability for school work. Cloud networks have been known to crash, and internet access can be lost, deleting progress on, say, an essay. If the work is stored internally on a drive, devices are fragile, and if that device is damaged or destroyed, you just lost all your work for school. Sure, get a case you might say. But who will buy those? The school? Certainly not. The students? Maybe, but there are sure to be those who lose them. And talk about theft. There will be students and outside factors who will steal and vandalize such devices for personal gain, and that can cost the student or the school a fairly hefty expense if it occurs multiple times. Besides, schools should be spending their funding on getting better classes and staff, increasing educational standards and scores, not gimmicks that do more harm than good.",

            "premise": "Thank you for the debate. I will start by addressing each of your points in order. 2. TO TEACH RESPONSIBILITY I do not believe that teaching responsibility regarding technological devices should fall on the educator who is there to teach on a certain subject. In regards to cheating, I feel this is the greatest threat with the use of mobile devices. They have the potential to undermine the process of examination and proof of knowledge/understanding. They are simply too easy to hide and too easy to use with incredible accuracy. 3. TO AVOID DOUBLE STANDARDS School staff may require their devices to do their job. Students do not need their device to be successful students. Textbooks and other materials are provided during classroom sessions nullifying the need for cell phones regarding information since an alternative medium is provided. 4. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY Forgetting homework or a calculator is not an emergency. In regards to a threat or shooting, there are more accurate and reliable ways for this information to reach the parents. Many schools implement procedures that aim to keep the students and staff hidden in the event of shooter or physical threat from an individual. If a student has a cell phone that rings, flashes or otherwise draws the attention of the assailant, it can have serious consequences. 5. AS LEARNING AIDS If the school would like to use devices as learning tools, I think tablets are a better alternative. They can be set to block the internet without authorization and the apps can be selected and tested by an administrator before hand. Further, the screen resolution is better, the screen is bigger, and the performance is faster. 6. TO MAKE DETENTION MORE BEARABLE Detention is a form of punishment for behavior. It is not meant to be enjoyable or something a student should look forward to. 7. TO KEEP STUDENTS HAPPY You provided a source to a study that is not directly linked to the debate. I will skip this segment for now.",

            "premise": "\"Its a proven fact that students don't learn as comprehensivly from text books in this day and age as they use to.\"I disagree. In fact there is a lot of evidence suggesting that textbooks are the best way to teach course material since they literally provide guidance of what to teach, how to teach it, and gives examples for students to help learn the concept. The books are written by the most experienced people in the field of work the book is geared towards as well so textbooks are still a great tool to learn new material from. Therefore, even if the pro's unsupported claim that learning is down from the past, it can still be concluded that the learning is still at pretty high levels. http://www.coursecrafters.com... \"textbooks leave only minimal examples of the learning material and they tell you to do the rest based on this knowledge.\"And if you still have problems, thats what the teacher is for. So whats the problem here?\"What students really need is a more interactive and visual sense of education. Textbooks are not right for that\"Those are just your own opinions though. There are studies that show that students still prefer textbooks over anything elsehttp://bevswiki.pbworks.com... (Jump to Conclusion)http://dl.acm.org...\"Let's conclude, Tutors don't like textbook\"Unsubstantiated opinion\"Teacher's aren't too fond of them\"Thats just false, teachers who are just starting out teaching rely almost entirely on textbooks to teach a class. http://www.teachervision.fen.com...\"students would be better off learning in a more interactive visual way\"You havent specified what a 'more visual way' even means....\"which has been proven many times to be more beneficial than texbooks.\"Yet youve given no sources implying that such a bold claim is even remotely true......1000 characters.",

            "conclusion": "Schools should switch to using e-books",
            "premise": "The school will give an eBook reader to each student, and books are downloaded for each class. More expensive readers cost 200, but a Kindle or similar reader would be in about the same range as a textbook. And remember, there is more than one textbook. If each textbook cost $90, and each student requires 5, that's 90x5 = $450 to supply 5 textbooks that have a lifespan of about 4-7 years. An eBook reader costs 100 dollars, and it should have a lifespan of 4-7 years or so (same as a textbook), and the textbooks should be free or cheaper for the school because the school will have a license. (Let's say the school pays 700 dollars for a license to download the book onto e-book readers without having to pay for every download). That's 100 dollars per student, plus the licenses that apply to the whole school. The higher consequences of a broken e-book may actually be a \"deterrent\" that prevents students from losing the eBook reader or scribbling on it, and risks of dropping it can be minimalized by using a rugged casing purchased at the store. A rugged casing can cost about 60 dollars, which is about the same as what most people spend on book covers (each book cover costs $3 x five books a year x 4 years = $60) Kids graffiti on books since it is hard to look through every page and find every scribble, making it an \"easy way to be rebellious\". Only an idiot would graffiti on an eBook because it is easier to be caught doing it. Carrying many heavy books over a long period of time is bad for one's health, and some schools even check the students for posture because of this! They would save money if they didn't have to hire the doctors for the day (where I'm from there aren't any school nurses). Bad posture is not a good thing to have. It can cause worse problems (such as a bad back or even collapsing) later on. The only possible health concern with an eBook is eyestrain, and that is only if the reader uses a backlit screen (most eBooks have a paper-like screen). Then there is the tree argument. Trees are being cut down and turned into worthless paper faster than they can grow back, and even though we should be in a digital age, we use more copy and notebook paper than ever before. We are often told to reduce use of paper by using recycled TP and cloth napkins, but rags are unsanitary and recycled TP irritates the buttocks. Instead, we should get rid of paper in a place where we would BENEFIT without it, that is, textbooks. Finally, there is the benefit of being updateable. Many kids are taught wrong, outdated knowledge because it costs so much to print new textbooks (even if it is just a section on how Pluto is no longer a planet). Since 2000, five new elements have been discovered and researchers are finding the truths about history. Many things once thought to be right have been proven wrong. It would cost less to update a textbook or textbook section on an eBook than it would be to kill more trees and print new books. The school pays less, and the kids get more accurate information. Of course, the transfer from trees to technology will be somewhat gradual, at first allowing kids to rent e-readers and then phase out books completely, and it may cost more at first, but the benefit outweighs the initial cost.",

            "premise": "Hello, I accept your challenge. While switching to eBooks sounds like an okay idea based on what you have presented, there are just as many reasons why we shouldn't switch over. First off, eBooks not only require the actual eBook Pad, but also, additional payments for every book you buy, which is equal to the current market price anyway. So, schools would actually pay more money. Another reason why it wouldn't work is because it would be more confusing for the kids. When the kids in a certain classroom need a new book downloaded, they would most likely have to give their eBooks to their teachers who would download it overnight. However, they may need another book for homework that night that is on their eBook. It would be somewhat chaotic. Another reason why it wouldn't work is if a kid broke it, it would cost more money. Let's set up two scenarios; One is where a kid has 4 textbooks worth $100 each, and the second scenario, is where a kid has an eBook worth $150 plus the 4 textbooks on it worth $100 each, a total value of $550. If the kid from scenario 1 breaks one of his textbooks, that's only a $100 fine. However, if the kid from scenario 2 breaks his 1 eBook, that's $150 to replace the eBook, plus the $400 to re-download all of the textbooks that were downloaded on the other one, a total fine of $550. That's a difference of $450, and considering today's economy, that is a lot of money. So, those are some basic points on why it would be a complex transition to the eBook that shouldn't really be attempted.",

Wachter\" has extensive experience writing textbooks for 25 years. http://www.coursecrafters.com...;Sounds like textbook related to me?...Sorry to sound repugnant, I didn't mean to say you didn't know what you were talking about.I was trying to emphasize the fact that more visual and mental interaction involving simulations was more efficient than textbooks.So your alternative to reading boring text in cheap textbooks is to have students read the same kind of boring text on computers and expensive gadgets? No. Instead of boring text. There are sets of tutorials and mathematic extraction methods that can be easily transferred on to USB sticks so everything learnt at school can be just as effective as home. For example, instead of the traditional textbook method where everything is taught in an out of date manner.We have the technology to finally update that style into something more productive.When I say extraction methods, I mean you get a sin or cos graph and you are told straight away of what you get if you find the deravitive, and then the second and also third deravitive. What happens when they equal zer, and finally what happens after they equal a real number. We could then apply this into many problem solving scenario in new ways we've never done before.Having to take the textbook around everywhere will also be in the past. Lastly, the same software can be used for the entire board which increases the budget for this software by a minimum of 8 times thereby increasing chances drastically. This rules out expense therefore everyone can enjoy the future together without worry.Thanks Vote Pro!",

            "premise": "I know I may be going off topic but just because technology has more information than a textbook doesn't mean that it should be used! Yes students may prefer to have new technology at school but it's not all about learning; the effects they have on health can be quite significant. The problem is, your just thinking about the learning. Granted, learning is the primary purpose of schools, but health and socializing are important as well. Textbooks may be perceived as boring but they do have information and cost less. More importantly, as beneficial as technology is, it can drastically affect concentration levels to the extent that students writing and communication are hindered. Your just focussing on the information technology has, but really, as long as a textbook contains all the information needed, students learning is fine. How you say 'technology' makes me think that you would like a variety of different devices obtained in school ( quite an ambiguous term). With this in mind, mobile phones and other devices may be overused and used when they shouldn't be...like in class. Despite the fact that you claim games would be blocked, students may be tempted to linger on the internet doing things they shouldn't be doing. This leads to addictions and students losing focus. Additionally, students are very easily distracted and in class, their minds are somewhere else as they are constantly thinking about the internet and technology. Technology wouldn't be used in every lesson, so the ability to think in class (without technology) is imperative. Should you sacrifice concentration in class, health worries/doubts and people skills (maybe) for more technology that costs money and serves the same as books? Admittedly technology is useful and offers something different to textbooks but health wise textbooks are better; and adding to that, it can create addictions and can lead to concentration levels being affected. You cant just think about learning.Not too much technology should not be allowed at school ( excluding your computers that most schools have) as the reasons for why they're bad outweigh the reasons for why they're good. Health is very important and as for cyber bullying, you cannot take it lightly. To answer your question, I would rather be abused on the internet but thats just me. Some people might prefer to be abused in front of people so that the abuser would look bad. You can't underestimate cyber bullying, it is a big problem.",

There are sets of tutorials and mathematic extraction methods that can be easily transferred on to USB sticks so everything learnt at school can be just as effective as home.\"So on top of the ton of cash its going to take to even get these magical computers and programs into schools, now schools are going to give all students USB's to transfer whatever work they have done at school to take home, and im guessing now those families are also going to have to pay out of their own pocket for the same expensive as hell software.....And this makes the whole thing easier how again?\"We have the technology to finally update that style into something more productive.\"But we clearly dont have the funding, and you have yet to provide an argument for how we would get around that since schools can barely afford to have textbooks in the first place...\"Having to take the textbook around everywhere will also be in the past.\"An easier solution would be to have a set for students to have at home and a class set for them to use at school... Not to spend a sh*tload of money that nobody has on a computer software system that has no evidence suggesting it would even be more efficient then textbooks to begin with.
