            "premise": "What you state is easily dismissible. Instead of arguing the economic benefits, you argue political drawbacks. As of 2013, the United States has lead the world in Corporate Tax percentage, which is set at 39%. Our tax rate has not changed in a matter of 2 years, with regard to corporate tax. [1] On a ratio with our GDP, Corporate Taxes amount to 2% of our 18 trillion GDP, which amounts to $360 billion. While we pronounce ourselves to be the most Capitalist nation, we impose heavy taxation on both our businesses and general income. Incorporation in Canada, which is famous for it's high taxes and government spending in relation to population, is easier and cheaper than incorporation in the United States. Our corporate tax is not only a burden but it is also a deterrent to future companies. I myself am working for a company made by American citizens but incorporated in Canada, due to their lower tax rate and fees. The main debate on Capitalism is that we get to keep our profits, if accumulated legally. The profits of companies are accumulated legally, and they deserve to keep those profits, regardless of moral implication. The main argument that many opponents of a lowered Corporate Tax create is that we cannot afford to lower it, which we most certainly can. Instead of professing about an increase in tax or a stability, we should decrease spending on par with a decrease in taxes. An overall incentive to incorporate in the United States will not only create an excess of jobs, but it will bring in an incredible amount of money. It is much more beneficial to tax 15% to 100 people, rather than taxing 39% to 50 people, as eventually, that number will decrease. Our current ideology is that instead of lowering taxes and fees, we will raise them as to create further burdens on the corporations that remain. Rand Paul, a ideologically Libertarian Republican presidential candidate stated that we have an excess of $2 trillion overseas, that we could bring into the United States if we lowered the Corporate Tax. \"My objection, then, is that it is not even clear that the public has any interest in incentivizing investment into the private sector.\" The public has no say as to whom may or may not invest into the private sector. It is not up to the collective decision of a public entity to dictate how and who invests into which specific private market. Most companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google, have public stocks, which enable all willing parties to hold stocks in that specific company. The private sector rarely benefits from public education. Most private sector jobs require a higher level education, which is in most cases provided by a private university or college. You seem to believe that taxes are collected and then distributed randomly. Each tax pays of each part of the government or public platform. This debate does not center over the complete abolishment of Corporate Tax, but instead centers around lowering this specific tax. Due to safety in investing in the United States, paired with a significantly lower Corporate Tax, we could bring in a great amount of companies as well as private sector jobs, and eventually make even more money in taxes than before.

            "conclusion": "Corporate Tax Should be Lowered",
            "premise": "Your main argument encompasses the negatives of a lower Corporate Tax paired with the ability to create loopholes in taxation and end up paying very little either way. In this debate, I never stated that we should keep these loopholes. This is strictly based upon the assertion that corporate tax is entirely too high, and that we should lower it. Evidently, lowering corporate tax, making a much simpler tax code, and then creating a conjunction in which no company under any circumstances can skip taxation, would create a much better system. In the end, a nation that focuses on free trade would slash the corporate tax rate completely, and keep it at a stable 0. If government also cuts their own spending, this would be easily affordable for the United States. On a competitive level, however, we do have the highest corporate tax rate among other industrialized nations. Whether many of our own companies pay this amount is up for another debate, but the stable fact is that we have the highest corporate tax. We definitely should focus on closing up loopholes, but paired with a lower tax rate, as these loopholes are the only reasons why the remaining corporations have stayed in our nation. There are many benefits to a lowered corporate tax rate: 1. Cutting the corporate tax rate will promote higher long-term economic growth. 2. Cutting the corporate tax rate will improve U.S. competitiveness. 3. Cutting the corporate tax rate will lead to higher wages and living standards. 4. Cutting the corporate tax rate will boost entrepreneurship, investment, and productivity. 5. Cutting the corporate rate lowers the tax burden on low-income taxpayers and seniors. 6. Cutting the corporate rate will lower the overall dividend tax rate and taxes on capital. 7. Cutting the corporate tax rate can attract foreign direct investment (FDI). 8. Cutting the corporate rate would lead to lower corporate debt and reduce the incentives for income shifting. 9. Cutting the corporate tax rate can reduce compliance costs. 10. Cutting the federal corporate rate can help the states compete globally.[1] You have also stated that corporations benefit from publicly funded organizations, such as roads, education systems, police officers, etc. Evidently, this is true. The argument here is that corporations could do the same in other nations, but people could not. In order to have safety, the government must devote funds to public organizations, which pairs with corporate likeability. Making an argument centered around the complete obliteration of the corporate tax without the complete deletion of tax loopholes will ultimately fail. For one to make an argument such as this, that person will ultimately need to understand the reason as to why there are lobbyists and tax loopholes. Our high tax rates ultimately effect corporations, and cause them to ship both jobs and capital overseas, into nations such as China or India that have much lower tax rates and much easier loopholes. Instead of basing our ideas on the general morality of corporations, which does not exist, we would create a comprehensive tax system that eliminates deception and incentivizes corporate investment. Being a Libertarian, I oppose all taxation plans, but I see most as realistically needed for the government to properly function. In the case of business, there should be little to no taxes, including both income and corporate tax. Business is based upon profit, and the desire for more profit, which people associate with the term greed. A government created legislation that undermines this desire for profit will be met by a dissociation of that profit base and relocation to a less restrictive nation, such as China and India. The three largest expenses of a corporation are wages, taxes, and supplies. As supplies and wages are necessary for the continuation of the company as well as employees desire to work in said company, removing those would be unrealistic. On the other hand, a relocation of taxes, whether based upon net revenue or net profit, would drastically impact interest of corporations as well as ability to function on a larger scale. You have previously stated that many corporations do not require a higher level education, which is wrong. According to the following source [2] (Link will be stated below), our job sector\u2019s need for education has increased dramatically throughout the next 40 years. In accordance with this information, your argument creates the illogical fallacies that state funded education is required for these corporations to function. This may be true if you take in account the entire world, as there will be nowhere else for the corporations to go, but in the matters of the United States, which is our debate\u2019s primary focus, state funded education will benefit the people more than the corporation. While you may believe that tax cuts will benefit the corporation more than the people, it is still clearly evident that lower taxes always equates to more incentive. We would effectively eliminate all need for tax lobbyists and special interest if we created a comprehensive tax system, or got rid of corporate tax all together. A small fraction of our government spending is created by corporate tax, which only alienates corporations and creates a disparity between economic centers in their need for unlegislated competition. In accordance with your previous statement, most of these retail jobs are held by the least educated in our society, and whether they are uneducated due to the governments failures or due to their own laziness and lack of willpower is up for discussion.

Because recession is such a general term, let me narrow to the part I'm trying to show you. You make an important point that taxes are lowered if they relocate overseas, especially to China or Japan. This is actually a problem for the economy, it's not a good factor that can lead to better economic growth like you say it does. Globalization itself isn't a problem at all, but if jobs or capital were to be shipped overseas then it would be devastating for OUR economy while only one economy benefits. Corporations do this to avoid corporate taxes, and take their business somewhere that doesn't normally have corporate taxes like we do. And if corporations have had lower taxes than they have 40-50 years ago (which is somewhat true), then why are they shipping jobs overseas? Because they're not low enough. And why is this such a big deal? Because the more money made, the higher the tax rate is and corporations make a lot of money. The IRS reports that since 1988, the tax rate per income began to fluctuate and people with lower incomes started to be taxed at a higher percentage than those making more (to this day). They got tired of this, and since then began to relocate to countries with cheap labor and low or no taxes. Since the late 1980s, this caused a whole range of economic problems which can be obvious when seen. It's no coincidence that the countries that we owe trade deficits with are the ones that corporations decided to relocate to. As for my sources, did you not see the entire article filled with 10 benefits of lower corporate taxes? And what \"program\" are you talking about? And yes I do agree with the long-term health of the economy, which means that we have the same goals. We have different theories on how to meet them however, and if taxes were lowered the government would actually be making more profit because more people would make demands. It's simple math. If the tax rate was 8% for a candy bar, only 1 person would want to buy it. But if the rate was 4% then 3 people would want to buy it, so the government would be making 4% more if the taxes were lower. http://www.google.com... http://www.americanprogress.org...",

            "premise": "Thanks to tcow2970 for initiating the debate.Opening statement will be short, as the nature of the debate demands that pro must uphold the proposition that Taxes were indeed *excessively high* prior to tax reform. Government SpendingOver several decades, overall spending as a percent of GDP has followed a positive trend, as noted by reference [1]. That being said, to supplement such increased levels in spending, we either (a) raise taxes, or (b) accept higher levels of national debt. Option b) is undesirable because long-term debt does play into the devaluation of US treasury bonds, which would eventually reduce the ability to defecit-spend your way out of a recession. Thus, we are left with option a). Suggestions could be made to decrease spending, but such discussion is outside of the scope of this debate.Effectiveness of Reducing Corporate TaxesAs I am not intending to prove that lowering the tax is effective, but rather that the taxes prior to the tax cut are not excessive, I am not required to advocate for any specific position. Instead, I intend to question the impact a reduced tax rate will have on the general economy. Commonly it is said that lower taxes often produce a 'trickle-down effect' - that is, essentially when corporate taxes are lowered, they are better able to finance the cost of a larger number of workers at higher salaries. However, such logic has never actually been verified in practice. It is also important to note that corporate income taxes aren't fixed at the 35% number often thrown around by Republicans. The corporate income taxes rates also follow brackets. [2].References[1] https://blogs-images.forbes.com...[2] https://www.thebalance.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "conclusion": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "premise": "Thank you AdamCass, I will quote my opponents arguments and try to refute each one individually. 1.\"With this interpretation, it is only fair that this 'legal citizen of the United States' pay tax. Corporations, as much as they would like to, cannot only have the better side of the deal.\" My opponent argues that corporations are \"guaranteed the same rights as a natural citizen\" and thus should pay taxes as a citizen would. I think that this argument falls apart under close examination. It makes sense that a corporation would have the right to \"use\" the roads, because what this means is that the owners of a corporation have the right to employ somebody to use the roads. Since all the owners of the corporation and the employees all have the right to use the roads, it makes sense that they still have this right when they call their arrangement a \"corporation\". Because all of the members of a corporation individually pay tax for these services, it does not make sense to require them to pay a second layer of tax through their corporation. But even if you disagree with this point, there is still good reason to reject my opponent\"s argument. First, one foolish policy does not justify another, so if corporate personhood is a foolish policy, and it is the justification for corporate tax, the solution is not to keep both, but to get rid of both. Second, if you believe that a corporation is a \"'legal citizen of the United States\"\" then \"it is only fair that this 'legal citizen\"\" pay the same tax as any other legal citizen, that is, the income tax. If you believe that a corporation should pay tax just like any other citizen, then the argument should be to apply income tax to corporations, not to have a separate tax system just for corporations. 2.\"Corporate taxation contributed to 10% of US Federal government revenue in 2013, over $234 billion. This is a substantial amount of money, money that goes into education, health, infrastructure, the military and many other key areas of government spending, all of which rely entirely on such finances.\" Certainly, an enormous amount of money is generated by the corporate tax, but as we have already demonstrated, corporate tax is simply not the most economically efficient way to raise revenue. That is, the harm to the economy cause by generating an additional $234 billion of income tax revenue would be less than the harm inflicted by the $234 billion generated by the corporate tax. (As I explained in Round 2, this is largely due to the mountains of additional and unnecessary paperwork that having two separate tax codes creates) Even better than increasing the income tax would be creating a new tax on a currently unused revenue source such as natural resources. To summarize, all of the public services currently funded by the corporate tax could receive the EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING, AT LESS HARM TO THE ECONOMY, if the corporate tax were abolished and replaced with a better method of raising revenue. 3.\"Furthermore, the competitive nature of retail and industry in this country, between corporations, practically force prices down to as low as possible. The removal of a corporation tax would be unable to in any means lower or reduce overall prices dramatically enough to impact someone's back pocket.\" This is simply not true. Corporate tax is between 15% and 35% in the United States. [1] Given the enormous level of consumer spending, even a tiny reduction in the prices of consumer goods would dramatically affect people\"s back pockets. Competition does drive down prices, but the lowest possible price is made higher by the corporate tax. If a profit margin is too low, investors are not interested in starting new companies or investing in existing ones. Also, if corporate tax were abolished suddenly, it is very likely that many CEOs would keep dividends at present levels, (levels shareholders are already happy with) and use the extra income to reinvest, pay workers more or lower prices. (Companies would have an incentive to do this to attract customers) For years under the direction of Steve Jobs, Apple paid no dividends to owners of Apple stock. However, even in what I think my opponent would consider the worst case scenario, the absurdly unlikely situation that prices would not be lowered and wages would not be raised, Americans would see 15 to 35% increases in their retirement portfolios. Those worried that increased corporate profits would dramatically enrich the already wealthy could propose a similarly dramatic increase in the top marginal tax rate. 4.\"Furthermore, the United States is in a chaotic fiscal climate. While debt and deficit continues to restrict the ability of the United States Government to deliver various services in a climate of fiscal austerity, the removal of a major revenue raiser would only further impact the budget. If the government, like you suggested, were to instead raise income taxes and abolish/lower corporate tax, this would have a direct impact on the American middle class, through additional taxation.\" First, it is entirely possible to raise the tax rate on the rich but not on the middle class. But more importantly, my opponent ignores the fact that corporations receive nearly all of their income from the poor and middle class in the first place. The idea that abolishing the corporate tax will lead to class problems is ridiculous. When middle class people own stock in a corporation, and middle class people spend money buying things from that corporation, after paying workers (mostly middle class) the money is returned to the middle class stock holders. Thus, no money has left the middle class. When rich people own stock in a corporation, money is transferred from the middle class to the rich, but this can easily be offset by taxing the rich. A higher income tax rate on the rich directly burdens only the rich. The corporate tax burdens the rich, but also burdens middle class shareholders and consumers, and also creates unnecessary paperwork. 5.\"Also, I agree that not all corporations are large, wealthy multinationals. The law and the US tax code recognizes this. In the United States, there are many different types of business ownership/entities, which are recognized under federal and state law. For example, a small business in Wyoming classified as a sole proprietorship would be taxed differently to a multinational corporation based on Wall Street. The corporate tax system is flexible in that respect, and larger more affluent corporations are taxed higher than smaller businesses.\" First, a sole proprietorship is not a corporation. The corporate tax applies only to corporations, not sole proprietorships or partnerships. This illustrates another of the corporate tax\"s shortcomings. The (single) owner of a sole proprietorship that makes $100,000 per year will pay a different tax rate than a person who owns 50% of a corporation that makes $200,000 per year, despite the fact that their shares of their businesses\" incomes are exactly the same. In fact, in nearly all jurisdictions, the owner of a $100,000 per year sole proprietorship will pay a LOWER tax rate than someone who owns 1% of a $200,000 per year corporation, because the corporate tax is higher than the tax on sole proprietorships. This is obviously a grossly unfair arrangement, and it is the inevitable result of having a separate tax on corporations. 1 http://en.wikipedia.org...",

The concept has existed before. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon came up with the the hypothesis of scientific taxation that lower rates generates higher revenues for the federal government. When the rate is higher, economic expansion and production is discouraged. In this case we are talking about the wealth of businesses who will grow less with a higher rate because they have to move more capital to taxation. When the tax rate is small, more capital is used on the business itself. The business grows and there is more corporate profits. More profits means more revenue for the corporation and that means more revenue for the federal government through a lower tax rate. Companies Move OverseasPfizer, the largest drug maker in the US, recently announced that it is moving its legal address to the UK because of the lower corporate tax rate. It is likely other businesses will the follow. The UK corporate tax rate is set to approach 20% by 2015. The current US corporate tax rate is 35% and that is a 15% difference for their profits. The US needs to lower its corporate tax rate in order to keep more businesses and gain more for the United States. As simple 10% cut from 35% to 25% puts on level with other nations. This will increase the competition of the American economy. At the same time, eliminating loopholes allows us to get more revenue from them.Sources1.

            "premise": "There is an important distinction to make between the tax rate for publicly traded companies and the actual percentage amount they pay. The disparity is due to tax loopholes such as off-shore banking and a host of other maneuvers performed by corporate lawyers. Even if these loopholes were closed through legislation, I disagree that the corporate tax rate should be lowered. There are two fundamental lines of reasoning behind my objection. The first is based on empirical observations, the second with philosophical issues about growth. Both of course are interrelated. Like private citizens, the private sector benefits from public goods such as public education, publicly owned and operated infastructure, general law and order maintained by police, and various federal agencies, especially in maritime contexts. The integrity and efficiency of these public goods would suffer if corporate tax rates were lowered, and this in turn would cause business costs to rise. If corporations tried to shoulder these costs themselves, for instance through privatized security, their ability to remain solvent would diminish. In general, the costs of doing business would increase, and those costs would be passed onto the consumer. Corporations also benefit from social welfare funds in ways that are not always obvious. Many retailers and restaurant corporations do not pay their workers a living wage. As a result those workers are forced to seek assistance from the government through such aid programs as food stamps. The taxpayer is effectively subsidizing the costs of maintaining a workforce for many corporations. Some of the societal benefits stand in direct conflict with the interests of the corporation. For instance, federally funded advocates of environmental defense and consumers rights must maintain freedom from the machinations of the corporation in order to do their job. The second aspect of my objection is theoretical, that is it has to do with the determinations of concepts. (I don't want to sound condescending, it's just that in mainstream discourse there is usually some confusion about the distinction between the practical and theoretical spheres.) Corporations are not free agents; that is, they cannot, by definition, self-legislate. I mean this in the descriptive, not normative, sense. The concept of a corporation demands that it profit; it must answer to shareholders, and all other considerations--whether ethical, aesthetic or even legal--are subordinate to this demand. That means that the costs of growth are always ultimately translated into dollar amounts. Likewise, the benefits of growth, strictly speaking, can only be reflected in dollar amounts. Of course, they can be translated once again into societal benefits of all sorts, but that is a matter of interpretation that lies beyond the calculus of corporations. This is partly why, for instance, from a legal point of view, a corporation's liability is limited to its investment. My objection, then, is that it is not even clear that the public has any interest in incentivizing investment into the private sector. I only say this because it seems to me useful to also bring into question some of the grounds on which the claim is being made. Thank you, and I look forward to your response.",

His argument has no substance at all and only includes baseless conjectures which somehow add up to why corporate taxes should be lowered. Corporations pay significantly less in taxes today than they did 50 years ago due to increased globalization and offshore subsidiaries which allow them to essentially avoid corporate taxes. http://www.cbpp.org... As my opponent is attempting to say that corporate taxes should be lowered because it would benefit the economy, yet he has offered nothing to support this resolution. I await his logically structured arguments, and compelling evidence for why corporate taxes should be lowered. I agree that lowering taxes in general is always going to increase GDP if government spending remains unchanged, however this will ratchet up the national debt via larger deficits ultimately leading to higher borrowing costs and more painful taxes later. Quantitative easing will likely end this fall. This will (and already partially has based on bernakes recent comments) ratchet up interest rates and quickly make debt payments extremely costly You can see based on yield curve history rates are already rising and will dramatically rise when the program ends. http://www.treasury.gov... Bernake has already said that debt will be a huge long term drag on the economy. http://www.youtube.com... In the short term lowering taxes on anyone/anything will benefit GDP. However I believe my opponent will agree that long term health of the economy is of far greater import.",

            "conclusion": "American Corporate Tax Rates Were Too High Before Tax Reform",
            "premise": "\"The American People are not under taxed, the government in Washington is overfed.\" It is because Ronald Reagan pinpointed the issues with the overtaxing in America I believe that the corporate tax rates (before the tax cuts) were too high. To hopefully convince everyone viewing this debate I provide some points. First, we had some of the highest tax rates in the world NPR News in 2017 found the claim that the United States had the highest corporate tax rates in the world to be \"generally true\". There are even some instances in which corporations pay upwards of 50-60% of their profits. If that doesn't scream borderline socialism / government abuse, I don't know what will. Second, the super high tax rates cause international outsourcing The Balance in 2013 found that United States companies have 14 million employees overseas in jobs that could be employing Americans. Why? Because of my first point that corporate taxes are the highest in the world. Congressional Democrats from the ways and means committees reported that at least 47 major corporations have moved overseas in the past decade alone. Those are millions if not billions of dollars and thousands upon thousands of jobs. How do we bring them back? Lowering the corporate tax rate. Finally, outsourcing jobs causes unemployment which leads to more crime This is a pretty self explanatory point, but the example I will be using is the rust belt. The place that used to be the manufacturing hub of America but is now a crime ridden ghost-town. Places like Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh all used to be flourishing economies in America that were known for being vibrant and industrial revolution havens. Now, due to the outsourcing of jobs, their unemployment has skyrocketed and their crime rates have skyrocketed. Thanks for reading! Format for debate 1. Opening Cases 2. Responses to opening cases 3.

            "discussionTitle": "Progressive Income Tax",
            "conclusion": "Progressive Income Tax",
            "premise": "The reasons why a progressive income tax is a good idea is because it is: A fair tax system Reduces Income Inequality - Healthier Society Increases Government Revenues Enhances the Economy and Opportunity C1: A Fair Tax System [1] The progressive tax is the most fair type of tax system, because it takes into account the purchasing power of an individual after paying taxes. With my sample of rates, the less well off get to keep much of their income. This is economical and fair. Consider the three main economic groups, the poor, middle class, and wealthy. Poor: This tax system taxes the poor lightly. This leaves the poor with much of their purchasing power. However, since the poor spend much of their income on necessities, they are still able to afford them. Plus, since the poor have a higher propensity to consume, they stimulate the economy. Middle Class: The tax system taxes them not too heavily either. They can still spend much of their income after taxes, and much of this income is put back into the economy as consumption for necessities and comforts. Wealthy: The wealthy make much money already. They have the lowest propensity to consume, and therefore do not spend that much of their percentage of money on consumption, but rather they save and invest. The reason that they pay a larger percentage of tax revenues is because they are rich already. The top 20% of citizens own over 85% of the total net worth of the USA. It isn't inaccurate to also say that the top 1% owns double the net worth of the bottom 80% of Americans. [11] The rich pay more, but they don't pay much more percentage-wise, or pay less [10] than others. So don't complain that they already pay much, they can definitely and morally pay more. In fact, the top 400 taxpayers last year only payed an average of 18.11% in taxes. This isn't fair. [10] Analysis: With a progrssive income tax, economic demand can be stimulated by reducing the tax burden on lower incomes while raising the burden on higher incomes, allowing still more income to be collected, while the rich will not reduce consumption because of their already vast wealth. C2: Reduces Income Inequality - Healthier Society The progressive income tax (P.I.T.) reduces income inequality, which has been reported to have a number of societal benefits, such as lower homicide rates at all income levels. [2] With a steeper progressivet tax, income inquality decreases. Plus, Richard G. Wilkinson, an economist, has said that societies with more equal distribution of incomes have better health, fewer social problems such as violence, drug abuse, teenage births, mental illness, obesity, and others, and are more cohesive than ones in which the gap between the rich and poor is greater. [3] C3: Increases Government Revenues The progressive tax increases government revenues. The rich pay their fair share, while their purchasing power is still not affected, while the less well-off can spend more in the economy, and stimulate it because of their high consumption rates, which then improves tax revenue, and the higher consumption fuels a stronger, broader prosperity. Tax cuts for the rich does not create jobs, and if it happened to, it would still be in the national interest for more revenue for the government instead. [5] The rich don't create jobs like the middle class. Companies create jobs, which requires consumption. A progressive tax fuels consumption in multiple ways. With more income, the rich aren't going to create jobs. They just invest and save. This doesn't create jobs. To quote multimillionaire Henry Bloch (co-founder of H&R Block): (about tax cuts for wealthy creating jobs): \u201cThat\u2019s so baloney,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cRich people don\u2019t create jobs. Companies create jobs.\u201d\u2026\u201dYou probably pay a higher rate than I do\u2026 and yet my income is probably many times what yours is,\u201d Bloch said to FOX 4 Reporter Rob Low. [4] C4: Enhances the Economy and Opportunity The American taxpayers have paid for our nation's infrastructure. The rich just get rich off of what the previous taxpayers have paid for. They owe the taxpayers of this great nation a great deal, and should be paying it back, by paying their fair share. If they don't, people in the future will not have as much as an opportunity to climb the economic ladder as [the rich today] have. [8] ----Infrastructure Spending Government spending is an investment. It is your payment to live in a civilized, modern nation. Your taxes, as well as the taxpayers of the past, have paid for the infrastructure that we all -- especially the rich -- use. The highway system, the medical establishment, the communications system, airline system, space program, education system, the Internet, the national defense, consumer protection, public health care possibilities, the GI bill, Social Security and Medicare, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and all other assets we have come from the wise investments our parents and that we have made. What is does------The progressive tax system I have laid out in R1 shows the rates Loopholes are ended. All people pay, because we all benefit from this nation's infrastructure. Tax reductions are cut, and some such as the mortgage deduction are lowered, so the lower rates are substituted for some instead. The Affects of P.I.T.------With higher taxes on the rich, consumption is fueled for the middle and lower classes, improving the economy. Opportunity, coming in the form of a stronger economy and a vibrant infrastructure, is more prevalent. Also, the rich who got rich from the taxpayers pay some of their fair share, will still remaining rich. Rich Tax Cuts Don't Create Jobs! [4] [5] [6] [7] [11]The middle-class and the poor, through their consumption, create most jobs. If you give a rich person hundreds of thousands in tax refunds, they will save or invest with it. Companies expand and hire more with more demand, not more supply. [1] Conclusion: A progressive tax system improves consumption, fueling the economy. Tax deductions are removed, and higher taxes on the rich are instituted. The higher taxes on the rich improves society in many different ways, including better health and ethical standards. The rich pay their fair share, while remaining rich. The vast American infrastructure is fueled for later generations, and for ourselves, and we, as well as later generations reap the improved economic benefits. It is justifiable, fair, and makes broad prosperity, instead of prosperity for the few, which has created only large deficits and higher debt. [7] It is the better system. It is a modern, moral system. It is fair, proven, and needed. Vote Pro ***Plus, a Flat Tax is regressive, and obviously a regressive tax is regressive.

Both theoretically and realistically, more money in the hands of the corporation would equate to more incentive for growth. The biggest argument that you lack to argue against is growth. Growth is the ultimate factor when looking at a corporation as well as any business entity, including a nation itself. All is subjected to growth or to stagnation. If you close these loopholes, then all corporations have to pay 35% tax rate, which is preposterous. Democratic Socialist nations have a lower tax rate than that. On the other hand, if loopholes are closed, but you evidently lower tax rate with it, then growth will occur. Unless we can compete with the laws of other nations, that many companies invest in, such as China or India, or even Switzerland, (low taxes in Switzerland) then we can attract more. This nation has safety as well as protection, and risk for investment is not high. In the end, we have 2 trillion in liquid assets overseas that we could bring back by lowering this tax rate. The point of government is not to take profits from people. I am also looking at this from a political sense, since I do believe that taxes lack constitutionality, and that the government's job is not to be authoritative and levy high taxes upon people, as it does not require this money, since it should not spend much in any sense.",

            "conclusion": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "premise": "1) \"I would argue that limited liability does not have as many economic benefits as usually claimed, and that it is a terrible idea, and should be done away with...\" Limited liability is fundamentally important for a corporation to operate effectively. It has become apparent to me that my opponent, while claiming he wishes to 'help corporations thrive' wants to strip them of all of their privileges, which ironically would cause greater damage to them than the corporate tax ever could. I wholeheartedly agree that there should appropriate regulation of corporations to ensure that they are socially accountable, and the corporate tax DOES THAT. On one hand my opponent wants to 'free up' corporations by removing the corporate tax, yet on the other hand he wants to axe many of the fundamental aspect of corporatism, which would be far more devastating to the economy than the maintenance of such a tax. 2) \" Again, corporations are made up of individual people. If one thousand people are able to do something as a corporation then they can do the same thing when they do not legally register as a corporation.\" This is a logical fallacy. Such a process, of loosely tied individuals operating on a large scale without being incorporated, is very rare. Almost all operations of such a scale, with such an impact on infrastructure, can only be achieved with the systems in place with business structure, of which are obtained through incorporation. To your example of the 'dump truck' business, what you fail to recognize is that 500 businesses with 1 dump truck each would NOT BE LOCATED IN THE SAME PLACE. A corporation with 500 dump trucks would be placed in the same location, collectively. Therefore, it creates a localized strain on the infrastructure. Again, your hypothetical example fails. 3) \"I am unaware of any shopping centers, manufacturing plants, or offices that are built for corporations by the government.\" Of course the government doesn't construct the buildings, but they are typically forced to construct the infrastructure around such a venue to compensate. For example, the construction of a large stadium by a private organisation would require a revamp, and expansion, of the roads around it. The government would pay for this. This occurs everywhere, from shopping centers, to airports, to stadium, to residential estates. The governments must invest in the services surrounding a private venture, therefore further proving the necessity of the corporate tax. 4) \"MY OPPONENT OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT THE UPPER AND UPPER MIDDLE CLASS ARE ALREADY PAYING THIS AMOUNT OF TAX THROUGH THE CORPORATE TAX.\" Calm down, and again that is false. You are now contradicting what you previously said, \"shareholders of corporations are from upper class, middle class and the poor class\". So, obviously, the Upper and Upper Middle Class are NOT paying the same amount in corporate tax. If you compensate the removal of the corporate tax with the implementation of an income tax on the wealthiest Americans, they would ultimately be paying MORE tax than before, because originally revenue raised from the corporate tax came from all classes, as you said. 5) \"States that wanted a share of the profit from its natural resources could implement a tax on natural resources.\" But why do this when there is a perfectly good corporation tax to raise such revenue? In makes no sense, you want to remove one taxation measure and add dozens more, which would obviously create a more complicated tax code and have a much more negative impact on the economy. - It is inherently clear that the corporate tax is a fundamental measure of taxation. To remove it is both pointless, will harm the economy and will reduce the accountability of corporations. To suggest that somehow removing the corporate tax, and then raising the income tax elsewhere will carry economic benefits is ludicrous. Such an action would have a harsh effect on consumer spending, and would lead ultimately lead to the reduction in revenue raised by the government, because claiming income as 'corporate income' would be easy to achieve and evade taxation. My opponent's arguments have predominantly been based on logical fallacies. His desire to strengthen the economy by removing the tax is pointless when he suggests to remove corporate privileges such as personhood and limited liability. In a nutshell, the corporate tax works, and to remove it and place other taxes is a pointless measure and would ultimately cause more issues than what it would solve.

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The USFG should adopt across-the-board tax cuts for individual and corporate tax brackets",
            "premise": "C1) We should reduce the corporate tax rate Having a competitive tax system is increasingly important in a globalized economy. Globalization means firms wishing to invest capital in a region can be easily encouraged\u2014or deterred\u2014if taxes increase or decrease. High corporate taxes discourage investment and reduce economic growth. America has the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the developed world at 39.1%.[1] This is 14.3% higher than the OECD average of 24.8%. The harmful effects of high corporate taxes are visible in our economic system. Johansson et al. has a paper published by the OECD investigating the impacts of different types of taxes and economic growth. The paper found that corporate taxes, followed by income taxes, are the most detrimental to economic growth. The study found that a 1% shift of tax revenues from income and corporate taxes to consumption and property taxes would increase GDP per capita by 0.25 \u2013 1% in the long run.[2] Johansson also found that statutory corporate tax rates of 30 to 35%, which the US now surpasses, reduces investment by 1.9%. To quote Johansson, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate would \u201clead to particularly large productivity gains in firms that are dynamic and profitable, i.e. those that can make the largest contribution to GDP growth.\u201d The reason for this is because many of the firms that are productive also rely on retained earnings to pay for their expansion. Tax cuts would increase the amount of retained earnings and increase prospects for future firm expansion. Another OECD paper by Jens Arnold confirms the findings of Johansson and concluded that corporate taxes \u201chave the most negative effect on GDP per capita.\u201d[3] Economists Young Lee and Roger Gordon, using a dataset with 70 countries and a timespan of 27 years, have found that a ten percent cut in the corporate tax rate would increase economic growth by one to two percent.[4] The biggest problem with having the highest corporate tax rate in the world is that it reduces our international competitiveness. Incentives matter, and taxing labor and capital simply means that the incentives to make more of it decrease. If a country has a significantly lower corporate tax rate than we do, it is our companies and workers that suffer. The current corporate tax rate caused companies to shift $50 billion away from the United States to countries with lower corporate taxes.[5] Despite our high corporate tax rate rayr, we do not have much to show in the way of revenue. Economists Alex Brill and Kevin Hasset have found that the revenue maximizing corporate tax rate is 26%.[6] Any corporate tax rate above 26% would decrease revenue. This is not surprising as the average OECD corporate tax rate is 24.8%. As international businesses can relocate to a location where taxation is lower (which means more profits), having a tax rate far above the OECD average would deter potential businesses from entering the country. This means a smaller tax base. Brill\u2019s and Hasset\u2019s study is supported by basic cross sectional data. In the US, corporate income tax revenue makes up 2.2% of our GDP; for the OECD, that number is 3.4%.[7] Despite having the highest corporate tax rate in the world, the percent of our corporate tax rate revenue to our GDP is over one percent lower than the OECD average. This confirms the Brill and Hasset analysis that current corporate tax rates are on the far side of the Laffur Curve. Studies claiming that corporate tax cuts do not cause growth have no solid foundation. Owen Zidar, who opposes tax cuts for the rich, finds that tax cuts for the middle class cause economic growth.[8] It is well accepted that tax cuts for the middle class would increase consumption and cause growth. Luckily, corporate tax rates do cut taxes for the middle class. According to another study by Zidar, workers receive 35% of the benefit from corporate tax cuts.[9] The literature says tax cuts for the middle class cause growth, and corporate taxes benefit the middle class; it seems illogical to claim corporate tax rates would not help the economy. The Zidar estimates are a bit on the conservative side. The CBO has found that \u201cdomestic labor bears slightly more than 70 percent of the burden of the corporate income tax.\u201d[10] Economists from the National Bureau of Economic Research have found that workers of unionized industries carry 56% of the tax burden from corporate taxes.[11] A tax cut would bring a huge benefit to middle and lower class workers. C2) Reduced income taxes cause growth Lower income taxes cause growth; yes, even for the rich. It is well accepted that tax cuts for the middle class cause growth, so I assume the majority of this debate will revolve around tax cuts for the wealthy. Taxes for the wealthy make up for the majority of our revenue, and it is only the top quintile of incomes that actually pay significantly more to the government than what they cost (e.g. they pay more taxes but use fewer social services).[12] Using tax revenues as a proxy for tax rates would work out pretty well. The following graph, using local tax revenues as a proxy for local tax rates, compares tax revenues to growth rates. Here is the data: There is a clear and strong correlation between lower tax revenue and faster GSP growth. According to the data, 40% of the variance in growth rates at a local level are determined by the tax burden.[13] This data does not include severance taxes or growth related to oil and gas. This is because merely having an abundance of resources could interfere with the results. While defending tax cuts we must look at the 1980s. I will defend Reaganomics responsibly. You think tax cuts in the 80s were the cause of the rapid growth during that decade? They weren\u2019t. Federal Reserve policies must be credited for that. But that does not mean the Reagan tax cuts were a failure\u2014they were a great success. The benefits from the tax cuts were long term; they increased innovation and heavily contributed to the growth in the 1990s a decade later. According to the American Enterprise Institute, \u201cReagan\u2019s economic legacy is inextricably interwoven with the Information Revolution that the IBM PC helped kick off. His message of competitive markets, entrepreneurial vigor, and minimal regulation found a willing audience in an era of rapid technological change, where innovation was opening new opportunities seemingly every day. \u2026 [T]he changes Reagan championed in the tax system fostered innovation and entrepreneurialism even as they encouraged the development of venture capital and investment in human capital.\u201d[14] His policies allowed businesses, which may not have been created due to high risks from a terrible tax code, to come to fruition. Tax cuts do not benefit us in between each business cycle; tax cuts take years for the benefits of increased investment to show up. Reagan\u2019s tax cuts didn\u2019t cause mega growth in the 80s, but it caused growth well past his term and beyond. The example of Reaganomics\u2014that tax cuts take time to kick in\u2014is confirmed by peer-reviewed literature. A study by economist Robert Reed argued that \u201ctax policies take time to work,\u201d and that when the effects kick in, \u201ca negative relationship between taxes and income growth emerges.\u201d[15] When we increase taxes, it takes time before the negative effects fully take hold\u2014the reverse holds true. More progressive tax systems lower economic growth. A progressive tax system means the wealthy pay more than the poor; the larger the gap between the amount the rich pay and the poor, the more progressive a tax system is. When a tax system increases in progressivity, meaning the rich pay more taxes, there is less growth. A Philadelphia Federal Reserve study observed that \u201ca decrease in tax progressivity did lead to higher growth \u2026 differences in tax code across countries could explain up to a two and half percent variation in economic growth.\u201d[16] The negative effects of high taxes, even on the wealthy, has been confirmed by studies by the Mercatus center as well as the American Economic Association.[17-18] Reducing tax rates on the wealthy would promote more economic growth. C3) Revenue As I showed in the case of corporate taxes, we could reduce the corporate tax rate by over 10% and increase revenue.Income taxes are a different story. Depending on how a tax cut is crafted, tax cuts may or may not pay for themselves. If the marginal rate was extremely high, reducing it to a moderate level would reduce deficits. There are always Laffur curve effects, so the changes in revenue could be exaggerated by a static analysis. This is not to say that all tax cuts pay for themselves. Despite revenue losses, tax cuts would still increase GDP growth. If we reversed the 2012 4% hike in taxes, revenues would only fall by $14 billion, but GDP would grow by 0.43%.[19] In fact, revenue maximizing policies would be detrimental to our economy as a whole.[21] Instead, we should focus on reducing spending alongside tax reductions. Sweden, for example, reduced the top marginal rate by 20% in the last recession, but they also prevented going into debt by reducing welfare spending. Countries that successfully reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios find that spending cuts rather than tax increases are a better way to fix the problem without reducing economic growth.[20] Spending cuts can increase growth. According to a research paper by the Mercatus Center, \u201cfiscal adjustments on average reduced debt-to-GDP ratio by 0.19 percentage points of GDP in a given year. GDP grew by 3.47 percentage points in total, which is 0.58 percentage points higher than the average growth of G7 countries.\u201d[20] I am in favor of reducing spending alongside tax reductions. Reducing the corporate tax rate would increase revenue\u2014abolishing the corporate tax rate would have little effect on our budgets.[22] http://bit.ly...;",

            "premise": "Dismissing something easily says more about the one dismissing than about what's being dismissed. It seems that you didn't even read the objection but instead had a prefabricated response ready. I'm here to learn about the arguments surrounding these important policy issues. From your response to the objection, it seems that you're here to do something else. And that's okay of course, but let's actually try to start the debate. First, there is the empirical aspect of it, which requires calculations and some guesswork about what corporations might or might not do given a change in the tax code. Second, it necessarily involves interrogating the meaning of a corporation, since we are referring them to discrete revenue and expenditure categories that are different from private citizens and non-profit organizations. You are wrong to say that I am arguing \"political drawbacks\" instead of economic benefits. We are debating political economy--that point at which they intersect, to put it into academic terminology. It is useful at times to distinguish economic calculations from policy, but to fail to see how they inform one another distorts the bases on which these kinds of decisions must be made. First, I will address the empirical aspect of the argument. Then I will respond specifically to each of your points. As I indicated in my objection, the question of raising or lowering the tax rate for corporations cannot really be approached without consideration of the fact that many of the richest corporations do not pay anywhere near the going rate. According to the Government Accountability Office, the average corporate tax rate is only 12.6%. http://money.cnn.com... A report from the Citizens for Tax Justice found that 30 of the biggest 280 corporations had no federal tax liability whatsoever. http://www.nytimes.com... The argument that lower tax rates will keep business in the U.S. ignores these disparities. The assertion becomes more ridiculous if we ask just what the tax rate should be. Those thirty companies that completely dodged the tax system through offshore maneuvers have no incentive to bring business back into the U.S. no matter how low the rate is. If we still entertain illusions that the global market will somehow correct this, we can refer to this study: http://www.cfr.org... and this http://www.wsj.com... Nor are corporations to blame for the fact that they dodge taxes. Which indicates the significance of my second point. It is misguided to try to blame corporations for being greedy, and the recent attempts to publish CEO pay as a way of shaming these great disparities in wealth are rather pointless, because as I said above, all considerations for a corporation are subordinated to those of the bottom line. The issue, as you said, is not whether to abolish the corporate tax altogether. The rate reflects the societal costs of protecting the public from the inherent abuses of corporate activity. Now, that is a difficult calculation to make because many of those costs are integrated into a whole web of public and private institutions. In an obvious way, this means that the corporate tax rate needs to contribute paying for the SEC, FDA, EPA and all the hosts of other agencies out there whose job is to protect the public good from the undesirable results that occur when a corporation does precisely what it's supposed to do, that is make money at all other expenses. The argument that lowering the rate will incentivize business investment ignores the complexity of these costs. That is what I was getting at in the first part of my argument, which your rejoinder ignored. Corporations rely on able-bodied Americans to buy their goods and to supply them with labor. It is this complexity that maybe gave you the mistaken notion that I thought tax revenues were distributed randomly. My understanding of it is that there are three metrics on which the rate is decided: 1) equity, which evaluates how the tax rate is distributed across individuals taxes 2) efficiency, which tries to address potential distortions in the decision-making process due to tax burdens 3) competitiveness, which is, admittedly the most vague of the three--but it has to do with maintaining rates that are comparable to those of other nations with similar GDP. It is the third that seems to be your best shot for arguing the tax rate should be lowered. Yes, it is vague, but it is a problem only because we do not tax pure profits, as explained here (p. 16-17 specifically) http://www.fas.org... You said that while \"we pronounce ourselves to be the most capitalist nation, we impose heavy taxation.\" Well, people pronounce a lot of things all the time--but if we mean by \"most capitalist nation\" that we are or should be engaged in some kind of free market laissez-faire system, completely free of public oversight, then you are mistaken. The so-called free market has already demonstrated that, left to its own devices, it is patently destructive and fatal to human interests. We have known that for more than a hundred years. In any case, that is a historical point which we can take up if you'd like. Nor do the present facts justify characterizing taxation on business as heavy, when compared with other industrialized nations. According to the findings of the CRS report mentioned above, the U.S. statutory rate is the highest, but the effective rate is the same as other OECD nations. In fact, the U.S. \"collects less in corporate tax revenue relative to Gross Domestic Production (GDP) (2.3% in 2011) than the average of other OECD countries (3.0% in 2011). \" As for your remark that the public has no say about investment in the private sector, yes, of course. But you missed the point. The issue is not dictating investment--it's that we have good reason to question simplistic narratives about growth, narratives that come from the financial industry and corporations that consecrate growth and try to convince us that it is an undeniable good. Lastly, you said that \"[t]he private sector rarely benefits from public education. Most private sector jobs require a higher level education, which is in most cases provided by a private university or college.\" That preposterous statement is not the sort that will become any less preposterous by looking at the numbers, no matter how you spin them. For one, it's way too sweeping. Also, there is a huge part of the private sector that requires no level of higher education--nearly all the workforce of restaurant and retail industry, including the folks that make your burger or ring you up at the Walmart, nor their managers, known as middle-management, and a whole host of other working people on whom the private sector relies for the delivery of its goods and services. But more importantly, it is a gross distortion to separate the actual functioning of the private sector from the interests of the public good. Yes, there are specific occasions when such a distinction is required--for instance in legal contexts--but if decisions are to be made about political economy, we must find a perspective that understands how they interact.",

            "premise": "Thank you AdamCass. It is important to remember that a corporation is not a single entity, but a group of people. When a corporation is taxed, the tax burden falls on all of the customers, employees, and shareholders of that corporation. Corporations handle enormous amounts of money, but their balance sheets add up to zero. Every cent of income that a corporation receives from its customers is spent either paying workers or other business, reinvestment, or paying dividends to shareholders. In order to pay taxes, a corporation must either reduce investment, hire fewer workers, pay its workers less, charge customers higher prices, or pay lower dividends to its shareholders. While it is tempting to believe that corporations are sole property of the super rich, this is not in fact true. A single corporation can be owned by thousands of people, and everybody with a mutual fund is a partial owner of an enormously \"wealthy\" corporation. Corporate tax decreases the dividends that are paid to people (many of them retired) who own a small share of that corporation. Taxes on \"rich\" corporations are advertised as checks on the wealthy, but the reality is that they often hurt middle class and poor people (consumers, workers, and retirees) as well as the rich. A tax on very high incomes or large fortunes is a far more effective way of taxing the wealthy, and does not directly harm the middle class or the poor. All taxes cause some harm to the economy, but the corporate tax is especially (and unnecessarily) harmful. If a government that did not have a corporate tax were to raise the the existing income tax rate, this might be economically unwise, but it would be much better than establishing a corporate tax, because creating a corporate tax would create even more tax paperwork. (The time and money spent on tax paperwork is not insignificant in our byzantine tax system) Abolishing the corporate tax would streamline and simplify the tax code even if the change were accompanied by raising the income tax rate. (It could also be argued that taxes on businesses are more economically damaging than taxes on consumers, but this is not universally agreed upon by economists) Ironically, the arguments in support of the corporate tax rest on the fallacious idea that a corporation is a person, the idea that a corporation is a single, colossally rich, monolith, rather than a group of people, many of whom are middle class and poor.",

            "premise": "My argument is not based on any moral grounds. We have both agreed that, from the point of view of the law, the corporation is fundamentally an amoral entity. My objection is based on the following observations: The first is historical. The corporate tax rate has in fact been lowered over the past forty years. During that time, wages have stagnated and wealth has been redistributed from the middle class to a small handful of wealthy individuals. The causes for this redistribution are several, but it is clear that governmental policy favoring the rich has played a major role. For instance, deregulation of the financial sector and international trade agreements (NAFTA and TPP) figure most heavily into these changes. My objection is, secondly, based on my skepticism regarding the mystical faith in free markets to keep their operations in the U.S. Taxation, as we both have agreed, is only one part of the calculus that determines how a corporation will run itself. To simply lower the rate without closing tax loopholes would constitute a rise in the real amounts corporations pay to the federal government. What reason do we have that they would bring their business back to the U.S. if such a raise in the rate is imminent? That said, there are a number of more informed ways of going about fixing the corporate tax rate. One is to base it on the disparity between CEO pay and the average worker's wage. (A bill like this is being considered in the California state legislature.) That of course won't fix many of the problems, but it is a step in the right direction. The broader point is that the taxes a corporation pays is the only way for the public to maintain its interests against those of the corporation. Occasionally, those two interests coincide, but history teaches us that often they do not. You may believe that you are looking at this issue from a strictly political point of view, but observe the sorts of categories you are deploying when you say that if the government did not spend so much money, it would not have to levy taxes on people. The government represents the public good independent of the drive for profits that sits at the heart of the corporation. Both government and corporations are comprised of people--but from a legal point of view, they are essentially different. The corporation is bound to profit for its survival, against the interests of the collective. As we both agree, that has nothing to do with any moral judgment. The government, on the other hand, depends on other activities for its legitimacy. On a whole, it spends as much as it needs to spend to maintain the interests of the diverse population it represents.",

National corporate tax rate: 30% Tax rate decreased by 1% for every 50k people employed. 1% taxes taken returned for every 50k people employed. 20% minimum tax floor. (Most companies hire less than 500k people anyway.) Small business recognised by sba 50% of taxes taken returned. This is to not treat small business unfairly by taxing them 30% instead, by returning 50% of the taxed income, it's effectively 15% taxes for the small business. This is essentially a form of trickle down economics but to get the tax cuts you must first help the middle class by hiring more. This should drastically cut unemployment and not drop the taxes too low as to not have a federal budget.",

If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households \" over 50% \" from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, \"I win,\" those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each. 2. All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets \" 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% \" instead of the current seven. This new tax code eliminates the marriage penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II. 3. No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America\"s tax rate one of the best in the world. 4. No family will have to pay the death tax. You earned and saved that money for your family, not the government. You paid taxes on it when you earned it. \"",

            "conclusion": "Tax Rates",
            "premise": "Higher tax rates on the wealthy will reduce economic growth. The literature on taxing the rich and economic growth is quite weak. There are studies purporting to look at this question, but they are often little more than looking at a historical correlation between tax rates and growth, which is simply not a very sound research method as it ignores other factors that have larger impacts on growth among other reasons. First, we have evidence that higher tax rates in general have a negative impact on growth. An overview of this literature is available the sources. The Tax Foundation chronicles these sources [1]. We also have evidence that higher tax rates are responsible for the relative decline in hours worked in Europe relative to the USA, which has contributed to Europe being less productive [2]. Second, we have the evidence that more progressive tax rates harm economic growth. An example of some of this evidence is in the sources [3]. Finally, we have the evidence on how the behavior of rich people changes when taxes are changed. The evidence suggests that the behavioral responses are significant [4]. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that higher tax rates reduce economic growth in general, more progressive tax rates reduce economic growth, and rich individuals have quite large behavioral responses to changes in taxation. This is important as the main channels through which high tax rates harm economic growth are on the supply side rather than the demand side. Entrepreneurship is one of the central drivers of economic growth [5]. After all, entrepreneurs are necessary to continually innovate in a constantly changing economy. Unfortunately, highly progressive taxation decreases entrepreneurship. This is simple to imagine if one looks at two men who both have a job that pays $200,000 and a potentially good idea. Both men pay 20% tax rates on their $200,000 income and, if they are to pursue their idea, they would be forced to give up their job. The difference is that one man lives in a country with a flat tax regime of 20%. The other man lives in a supposedly \"fairer\" society where the first $200,000 are taxed at 20% but every dollar after that is taxed at a punitive 80%. This would dramatically lower the chances that this man would become an entrepreneur. This is a rather extreme example, but the logic applies to any progressive tax regime to varying degrees. Not surprisingly, there is strong evidence that progressive taxation has a negative effect on entrepreneurship [6]. High tax rates discourage productive behavior such as investing, working, and taking risks and encourages unproductive behavior such as tax avoidance. The evidence provided in the sources suggests that this effect is quite powerful and makes a meaningful difference in the economy. It's also important to note that wealthy individuals are more able to change the composition of their income so they can more easily avoid taxes, which is why they have such high elasticities of taxable income [4]. There is a widespread belief that taxes on the richest 1% are low. This is simply not the case. It seems that this perception is based entirely on anecdotal evidence. There is no doubt that some rich people pay low tax rates, but, as a whole, the richest 1% pay quite high taxes. The CBO estimates that, in 2013, the top 1% paid an average federal tax rate of 33.6%, compared to 18.1% average for all quintiles [7]. This does not include state and local taxes which, according to reasonable estimates, add another 6% or so to the average tax bill of the top 1% [8]. In total, this suggests a tax rate of around 40% on average, with some higher and some lower. I find it very hard to argue that one's \"fair share\" is more than 40%. Admittedly, this is a bit subjective because everyone has a different belief system about what is fair, but I think the fact that wealthy individuals already pay almost 35% of their income to the federal government and 40% to all governments would come off to most reasonable people as, if anything, too high, especially when realizes that the wealthy are already paying a higher tax rate than other classes. The practical problems with raising taxes on the rich have already been discussed, at length here. I also believe there is a moral element to this debate. Do we really want to live in a society where nearly half (or over half) of somebody's income is confiscated by the government? I certainly don't. America was founded as a free nation, with free enterprise at its core. One of the key tenets of free enterprise is that the government sets no limit on wealth. It is understood that taxes are necessary to pay for basic services and such, but I think it is hard to say that people paying 40% of their income in taxes are not paying their \"fair share\". No, raising taxes on the wealthy, at this point, would bring us to a place with tax rates that are better described as \"confiscatory\" than \"fair\". Confiscatory tax rates on any class or group is totally contrary to the moral core of the USA. Raising taxes further on the wealthy would be a moral and practical mistake. 1. http://taxfoundation.org... 2. http://www.economics21.org... 3. http://business.pages.tcnj.edu... 4. http://www.economics21.org... 5. http://www.nber.org... 6. http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu... 7. http://www.cbo.gov... 8. http://www.itep.org...",

            "premise": "First, I will provide rebuttals, then explain a counterplan. The Act is clearly not bipartisan. Every Republican US Senator voted against it, even moderates including Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins who voted for Obama's 1st stimulus. Payroll tax cuts are a not very efficient way to cut taxes. \"It would simply exacerbate our debt problems in my opinion\" according to Congressman Paul Ryan. The payroll tax cut is simply another gimmick because it is temporary and demand sided. We had tax incentives similar to these in the first stimulus bill. It was promised that unemployment wouldn't go over 8%. Instead, we've had the longest streak of unemployment since the great depression. These tax gimmicks and temporary tricks don't work. The enormous cost of fixing our roads is exactly why the federal bureaucracy shouldn't be involved. At $2.2 trillion, we can't afford to spend all that money. The infrastructure bank would fix very little, and pork-barrel politicians may divert funding to useless \"Bridges to Nowhere.\" Infrastructure projects from the previous stimulus haven't fixed anything: you mention all the deficiencies: so what makes this new stimulus plan, with even less bipartisan support, any better? 1. Good tax cuts are a solid venue to economic growth. But they need to be focused on those creating the jobs. Demand-side tax cuts are temporary gimmicks. 2. You say that this spending will \"revitalize public schools.\" School spending has increased enormously and class sizes have gone significantly down, but test scores haven't improved. This is because teachers unions are preventing common-sense accountability measures. We need private schools so we can experiment and find the best ways to teach our children, not spend money we don't have and call it \"investment\". 3. We don't need to spend federal government money at all on infrastructure. The Dulles Greenway was built entirely by private investment. If we streamline regulations to building infrastructure(these regulations are required for all projects, whether public or private), the conditions of our roads would improve because companies want to improve the quality of roads because they are bad for business. 4. Unemployment benefits do make people lazy. People applying for unemployment benefits had employment, but unemployment benefits can cause people to become couch potatoes. The lure of a paycheck for doing nothing can be too much for ordinarily hardworking people. According to JP Morgan Chase, unemployment benefits increased the unemployment rate by 1.5%. Unemployment benefits often are higher than minimum wage jobs, discouraging people from accepting perfectly good entry-level occupations. 5. We do need teachers, firefighters, and police officers, but too many government employees does crowd out private investment, even if they serve a valuable purpose. It would be great to rehire them, but that money will dry up eventually and those people may be fired again. The beauty of a private sector job is that it provides a permanent job for a person at no cost to the taxpayer. 6. School spending should be directed at local levels. The federal government has an innate tendency to waste money, but the innovative local governments can do more with less. 7. These construction jobs will go away when the money dries up. The projects may not even be finished. I am saying that lowering the corporate tax is a better way forward than another stimulus, considering the first one failed. 10. There is a reason employers discriminate against the unemployed during a recession: the best, most-competent people usually don't get laid off. Of course, employers could also see through other credentials that an unemployed person got unlucky. But more regulations leads to a higher overhead for business which leads to less jobs to go around. 11. The top 1% pay 41% of the taxes. They have paid enough. Requiring the top people to pay more is simply class warfare. Half of Americans don't pay federal income taxes. Big government liberals can bribe these people to vote for them, and then steal money from successful people so they can buy votes. In a recession, the WORST thing we can do is raise taxes. It crowds out private investment. My counterplan is simple: -Eliminate the corporate tax($191 billion less revenue) -Streamline regulations(no cost, most likely net increase in revenue) As former governor and financial expert Gary Johnson said, eliminating the corporate tax would create millions of jobs by itself. This would cost much less than the Obama plan, which many are skeptical if it would create any jobs(even liberal estimates say it would only lower the unemployment rate by 1%). We need to CREATE jobs by promoting economic freedom. My opponent never explained how this act is different than the first stimulus. If the 1st one didn't live up to predictions, why will this one? For all these reasons, I urge a Negative ballot.",

            "discussionTitle": "High Tax Rates Hurt the Economy",
            "conclusion": "High Tax Rates Hurt the Economy",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. I argue that high tax rates do hurt the economy. I will employ both theoretical and empirical support for this assertion.Why High Taxes Hurt The Economy?Higher tax rates hurt the economy because they discourage productive behavior. If labor taxes were to be higher, then labor would be less desirable relative to leisure. This is because the higher taxes on labor would reduce the reward for labor. This would reduce the incentive for people to choose work over leisure.The same is true of capital taxation. If the government were to tax capital higher, the potential reward for successful investment would be reduced. This would then reduce the level of investment. Reduced investment leads to less capital reinvestment, less new jobs, less new equipment, and lower productivity. These higher tax rates would also reduce the potential reward from entrepuenership. This would mean that higher taxes would lead to less new businesses and less entrepeunerial ventures in the economy.Furthermore, taxes also deeply distort economic behavior. When tax rates are higher, the value of tax deductions are much higher. When the tax rate is 80%, there is more reason to try to avoid taxes through deductions than at a tax rate of 40%. This leads to many misused economic resources.Right now, our tax code has a full deduction for employer provided Health Plans. Due to this, 59% of Americans are on Employer Provided Health Plans. This has led to extreme distortions in our Health Care System, as it kept patients from buying individualized Health Care Plans.High tax rates also encourage tax dodging. Billions of dollars go to tax lawyers to help people avoid taxes. These are wasted resources that could go to more productive uses. If tax rates were lower, there would be less incentive to use resources to avoid taxes, meaning that more resources would go towards more productive ventures.Finally, high tax rates in one country, particularly high progressive tax rates, typically lead to a many companies and high skill workers emigrating to lower tax countries. This leads to job loss in high tax countries (as some corporations move to lower tax countries, brining jobs with them) and productivity loss, as some of the most productive and innovative members emigrate to lower tax countries.Empirical Evidence on High Tax Rates and Economic GrowthEmpirical Evidence generally supports the notion that higher tax rates reduce labor supply, and, therefore, economic output. Nobel Prize Winning Economist Edward Prescott looked at the difference in labor supply between the G-7 Countries and found that different tax rates are responsible for almost allof the difference in labor supply between countries: \"Americans now work 50 percent more than do the Germans, French, and Italians.' This was not the case in the early 1970s, when the Western Europeans worked more than Americans. This article examines the role of taxes in accounting for the differences in labor supply across time and across countries; in particular, the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. The population of countries considered is the G-7 countries, which are major advanced industrial countries. The surprising finding is that this marginal tax rate accounts for the predominance of differences at points in time and the large change in relative labor supply over time.\" These results go a long way in showing that high tax rates do, in fact, reduce labor supply over time. Another common result in empirical studies is that the Corporate Tax is particularly harmful to growth. This is a common result found in numerous studies from the OECD, World Bank, Joint Comittee on Taxation, Oxford, and a number of reputable independant economists.These studies typically find that high corporate tax rates reduce investment and entrepeunership. On top of this, high corporate taxes typically send corporations to lower tax nations.High tax rates also tend to correlated with lower growth rates. One empirical study on this was published in the Cato Journal, which, after controlling for numerous factors, found that high marginal tax rates have significant negative impact on growth in US states: \"This article explores the impact of tax policy on economic growth in the states within the framework of an endogenous growth model. Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of taxes on economic growth in the states from 1964 to 2004. The analysis reveals a significant negative impact of higher marginal tax rates on economic growth. The analysis underscores the importance of controlling for regressivity, convergence, and regional influences in isolating the effect of taxes on economic growth in the states.\"This study is not an exception to the rule. There are numerous studies finding that taxes have a negative impact on economic growth (look at links to see numerous other studies).Conclusion Based on both these theoretical and empirical facts, I conclude that taxes have strong negative effect on the economy.Sourceshttp://en.wikipedia.org...(for Prescott study on Taxation and Labor Supply) http://www.minneapolisfed.org...

Also, how can you attach this growing inequality to tax rates? Correlation does not equal causation. What I'm getting at here is that the rate of economic growth should not be the primary concern of an economy. The primary concern of an economy should be to serve the needs of the majority of the people. A nations economy must serve people, not the other way around.But increasing economic growth is good for everyone, is it not? If you raise taxes, businesses are less productive and lay people off, so their minimum wage is $0. Someone cannot possbiyl be happy without a job, can they? Also, when businesses are productive they provide good products to use, such as iPhones, at lower prics. Otherwise they raise their prices to cover the taxes. letting the rich get richer decreases mobility. Mobility simply means movement between socioeconomic status. America should be the land of opportunity and this rising inequality is squandering it. Where is your evidence for this? This is only anecdotal. real-estate prices become inflated. There's only a limited amount of land but those who are getting immensely rich buy it up. In the process, real estate prices rise for everyone else. Inflation of real-estate prices? I've never heard this before. Evidence? countries with lower inequality tend to be the happiest.\"Released Monday, the 2013 World Happiness Report ranks the happiest countries around the globe, with Denmark, Norway and Switzerland leading the pack.\" - huffingtonpostDenmark, Switzerland, and Norway all have a significantly lower Gini Coefficient (measure of income inequality) than the U.S.Evidence? You didn't cite a sourc.e Also, prove to me that raising taxes will decrease income inequality. I think it will make everything worse because rich people will lay off poor people. Have a poor person ever given you a job? I don't think so. Also, there is a diminishing marginal utility per dollar earned as income rises. It would be incorrect to assume that $1 to a rich person gives him the same amount of happiness that same dollar could bring a homeless person. Proof? Rich people use the money to invest not consume, so this thesis is fundamentally wrong.The tax on the top 1% of rich people should rise enough to stop the income gap from widening.How much more would you like it to rise? They're already paying about 40% of their income. What's enough?. . . the headline figure has everybody outraged: 95% of income gains since 2009 have accrued to the top 1%.\"http://www.businessinsider.com...... That's because of the Federal Reserve pumping money into the system so this is financial wealth. You cannot link that to tax cuts. I'd also like to point out that all of my arguments have been dropped at this point.",

            "discussionTitle": "Corporate Tax Should be Lowered",
            "conclusion": "Corporate Tax Should be Lowered",
            "premise": "It seems then that we are in agreement about the untenability of altering the tax code without addressing the tax loopholes. My point is that when it comes time to actually fix a rate, we will be only grasping in the dark so long as those loopholes are closed. We are also in agreement about the amorality, or moral neutrality of corporations. As you mentioned, the main costs of a corporation are wages, supplies, or means of production however broadly construed, and taxes. Lowering the tax rate and closing loopholes will actually result in an effective tax raise for many corporations. So why would they return their operations to the U.S. if the reform measures you are seeking only address taxation? My point about the welfare measures the corporation receives on behalf of the taxpayer, e.g. in the form of slave wages, indicates that lowering the tax rate alone is not sufficient. It is here instructive to take a brief glance at the historical development of the corporation. (Hegel discusses it in an interesting way in The Philosophy of Right, but that is maybe too far afield.) It is a historical fiction to think that corporations emerged in a free market and then only later came under the burden of government regulation and taxation. From the inception, the interests of the corporation were facilitated by government policies. There are countless examples of this, but the most pronounced is perhaps the railroad barons at the end of the nineteenth century. So it is too simple a dichotomy to present the government on one side and the corporation on the other. This is why, for instance, Roosevelt warned against the military-industrial complex, and it is still vividly relevant today in the Middle East. In light of this, your alleged benefits to a lowered corporate tax rate can be seen as wishful thinking of fallacious supply-side economic theory. Yes, a lower tax rate might raise wages, might boost incentive, attract foreign investment, eradicate poverty, end war, save the polar ice caps from melting, help us colonize the moon, make us beautiful, rid us of all evil, and so forth. I'm not trying to be sarcastic--it's just that these are the perennial and familiar promises of the proponents of free-market economy that have not materialized, even as the system has increasingly favored corporations since the sixties. The most clear indication that a lowered tax rate is not advisable or desirable is that the rate has in fact incrementally lowered for over the period of the past forty years. Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed, completely independent of CEO performance. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... There is a lot of mystical beliefs about the invisible hands that will guide wealth into the nation and keep business in the U.S. but there are no reasonable historical tendencies to justify this thinking. There are two principal reasons for this: 1. The intimate interactions of corporate interests and governmental policy have created a situation of pronounced inequality, and have effectively redistributed wealth to the top one percent. 2. The corporation, by its very nature, tends toward either implosion or monopoly. The public was compelled to intrude upon the free activity of the corporation because that activity threatened its collective good. I appreciate your Libertarian views--even though I usually find myself in general disagreement, the Libertarian wing of the Republic party is, in my modest estimation, the only one that is self-consistent and philosophically and economically astute. But let me for a moment broaden the perspective. I don't judge negatively people who desire profits, and I agree with your implication that to associate the desire for profits with greed is not all that useful. But not all values are moral values. We can still admit that the corporation is essentially amoral and still talk about its ethos, its system of values. I mentioned above that one of these is the fundamental translation of various kinds of activity into exchange value. In the same sense, not all work is labor. The corporate system reinterprets growth, time, work, nature, and even political engagement financially. Corporate taxation is the imperfect result of this necessary translation. I only have about ten minutes left, so let me just give one easy example of what I mean here. A mining corporation--e.g. the Pebble Mine Company up in Alaska--goes into a place, digs the minerals out of the earth, then moves on when those resources have been exhausted. From the corporations point of view, the land is nothing more than the ultimate dollar amounts that will be made on the market. But land is something different than that--it gets left behind, and has been altered irrevocably. The toxic tailings ponds that every mine leaves behind last forever. (Cf. the spill in Durango right now.) No matter if the tax rate were twice what it is, there is no way to recover that land. The same goes with fracking--the toxins that are pumped into the ground will last millennia. So it is not as simple as just saying that corporations benefit from infrastructure and public safety--it is that they translate the world, both the human world of activity, work, time, and the natural world as monetary values. Taxation is therefore the only way for the corporation to legitimately participate in the system. It might seem as though I'm changing my fundamental objection--but these latest remarks are bound up with what I've been saying from the start. Either way, I'm learning a lot from this discussion and look forward to your response.",

Not to mention, raising taxes on the rich would prevent money that would have previously gone into creating new businesses or investing in new ones, thus creating jobs, would be gone. \"The rich in America obviously have lots of money, but there are simply not enough of them to fund the president\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u201a\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds preferred level of spending.\"\"They find that tax increases tend to reduce economic growth, stating that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u201a\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\"tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u201a\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd as \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u201a\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\"an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real GDP by almost three percent.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u201a\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd: http://american.com.... \"Importantly, any meaningful increases in taxes from personal income would have to come from lower and middle income families, as 90% of all personal taxable income is generated below the taxable income level of $35,000.: http://www.devvy.com.... Decrease taxes, help the economy. Tax 2 (The National Retail Sales Tax): Again, I will split this up into two points. First Point: Raising the National Retail Sales Tax right now will kill economic growth. This has a more profound effect during a recession than raising the income tax does. This charges people extra to help the economy! How silly is that? If we raise the sales tax, the Government would be in essence encouraging people not to buy, and therefore, not to help the economy! \"This tax increase would take over one billion dollars out of the hands of North Carolina working families and put it back into government coffers.\"\"They seem to forget that the sales tax affects everyone, and has a greater impact on working people and senior citizens on fixed incomes. Everyone loses more money if we raise the sales tax, including those who are unemployed.\": http://www.beaufortobserver.net.... Second Point: The sales tax is exteremely unnecessary expect in extreme inflation periods. The sales tax is unneccesary even in a normal economy because you are still penalizing the consumer for shopping. Why would you do that? That is what keeps the economy afloat. Decrease taxes, help the economy. Tax 3 (The Payroll Tax): I will split this into two points. First Point: The Payroll Tax is extremely unneccesary. Most of the revenue drawn from the payroll tax goes back to them in later years through social security, but in small amounts. Social Security should be to the choice of the worker. If the worker does not want social security in later life, than the Federal Government should not forceibly take his money to fund a project that he or she does not even want. It is not the Government's Obligation, Job, or Duty to make people save. That is the individual's decision, and they have the right to choose for themselves. Second Point: A cut of the payroll tax is good for small businesses. \"You have to spend money to take advantage of that tax credit, but if a small business is thinking about expanding, it provides more certainty for them to schedule an expansion or upgrade.\": http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com.... Small business has taken the brunt of the recession's fury, and an increase in the payroll taxes would make the financial and economic situation even worse. In fact, cutting them would help the economy in many ways. Tax 4 (Property Taxes): I will not go in to much detail on these taxes, but they are even more unnecessary than the top three. Why would you tax someone on the amount of land they own or the inheritance they receive? Especially the inheritance taxes. I mean the poor receive inheriatances too. It' is not just the rich. \"It (property taxes) doesn't work so well when it is used to redistribute wealth on a grand scale. \": http://www.tax.com.... \"The tax (the estate and inheritance taxes) also is very expensive to comply with. A 1992 National Tax Journal study found the compliance cost was $1 for every $1 raised. Combining these costs with the reduction in output it causes, it is clear the estate tax is a burden on the U.S. economy.\"\"The estate tax makes it difficult to make economic decisions and results in unintended consequences, the burden of which falls primarily on the lower and middle classes. Rather than giving in to the politics of envy, we should have a tax structure that encourages innovation and saving. That is how the poor will become wealthy.\": http://www.mrc.org.... The main reason for these taxes is to tax the rich even more. Which one, I have proven will worsen the economy, and two, these taxes don't just effect the targeted rich. Tax 5 (Excise Taxes): At first, they seem like a good idea to deter alcohol, smoking, and other bad habits. But when looked at closer, the same effect is going to happen as the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s. People are going to start selling \"tax-exmept\" alcohol and cigarettes underground, which will just one, increase crime, and two, have no effect on the usage of alcohol and cigarettes whatsoever. Also, why is it the Government's job to discourage bad behavior? (I mena stuff that is not illegal). Why is it the Government's job to stop people from drinking or smoking? If the people are dumb enough to do those things, than they should suffer the consequences. Is kind of a tax is unconstitutional because the Government is stepping over it's bounds. Tax 6 (Corporate Taxes): These taxes have the same effect as taxing the rich. They kill the economy. If an economy is trying to recover from a recession, than a decrease in income and sales taxes coupled with a decrease in corporate taxes will not only allow consumers to buy more, but it will allow producers and distributors to sell more to keep up with the increasing demand. Taxing profit is bad enough. Taxing the entire business is terrible. Why would you tax a business that is making a loss? And taxing profit is preventing the business from re-investing the profit back into the business to increase wages, fix equipment, and produce more. \"Corporations should NOT be taxed. This is beneficial to the corporation, consumer, economy, and government tax revenue.\"\"If taxes go down, product prices go down (Think Wal-Mart). Corporate taxes are where the consumer gets reamed. Every purchase you make, you are paying corporate taxes.\": http://visiontoamerica.org... benefits of no corporate taxes are simple. No taxes mean cheaper COGS, which mean cheaper goods and services for the consumer. Cheaper goods and services for the consumer mean your money goes further and you can purchase more. The more you purchase, the more products need to be made, which eventually requires corporate investments and employee hiring. Eventually, you have more business generated for corporations which eventually lowers prices to stay competitive, higher employment which means more spending in the economy, and lastly a higher tax revenue from the larger economy and increased employment.: http://godfatherpolitics.com.... Tax 7 (The Gasoline and Carbon Taxes): Raising, or even having, a Gasoline Tax makes the price of Gasoline already higher than it should be. Gasoline could be a lot lower if the tax was gone. Now of course, the goal of these taxes is like the excise taxes, so that people will use less gasoline. But one, we do not need them right now, and two, they don't work. \"Raising the gas tax would heap yet another burden on New Jersey residents and employers already struggling to afford to live and do business here.\": http://www.politickernj.com.... Now the Carbon Tax will fail. It will not discourage people from using Carbon. But the real big one is the taxes on business using carbon and coal in production. This will yet again hurt the economy due to lower production. And this system of Carbon taxes does not even work. \"Fear of dangerous Global Warming from man-made CO2 is dissipating with more recent scientific evidence and exposure of much bias, exaggeration of dangers and neglect of benefits of warming in existing scientific consensus. Any warming from CO2 is likely to be a harmless < 1 Deg Celsius by 2100. Higher predictions are only computer model speculations, arguably due to the modeller's confessed ignorance of natural climate cycles.\" \"Even if CO2 were dangerous and we reduced it successfully in Australia or even globally, there is no physical evidence that it would have a significantly beneficial effect on climate.\": http://www.nocarbontax.com.au.../. Taxes in General: I have shown on several occasions that most taxes are either unnecessary, worthless, or harmful to the economy. They need to be cut to help the economy and to help business.",

            "conclusion": "Flat Tax Rate",
            "premise": "1. The Current system needs reform The need for tax reform is growing stronger every day. A large part of the tax code is outdated and based upon principles established in the 1930s and 40s, and since then the economic conditions have changed. Even in the 1960s many called for reform due to the complexity of the tax code. The tax code was 900 pages long, administrative regulations were hard to understand, and court cases continued to add unnecessary complexity to the tax code [1]. The current tax code imposes rates which are very high and biases against investment. Complexity remains an issue today, 50 years after some of the early calls of tax reform have ended. The layers of complexity discourage investment. When all of the taxes up, \u201cinvestment returns face a tax rate of almost 54 percent \u2026 That high rate raises the hurdle rate that investors require before making certain investments since they are concerned with their after-tax returns for taking the risk. Therefore, many potential investments fall short of meeting the mark and thus go unmade. The effect on families is the same as when pass-throughs invest less: fewer new job opportunities and forgone wage increases.\u201d [2] Entrepreneurship is essential for our economy. Businessmen must weigh the costs and benefits whenever they make an idea and contemplate selling it. If the tax burden is too high, many breakthroughs will not become a reality because the cost of the tax burden outweighs the benefits of the product. Thirty years ago under the Reagan administration the government did overhaul the system, reduce rates, close loopholes, and cause economic growth. But this was not enough. Congress over time has re-added complexities and has ruined the progress previously achieved. Tax reform needs to (1) lower rates and broaden the tax base, (2) end double taxation, (3) reduce complexity, and (4) cause growth. 2. A flat tax does everything tax reform needs to do (1) There are two main tax rates. The first is the marginal income tax rate for the rich at 40%. The second is the one for the middle class at 30%. The Heritage Foundation has suggested a 28% flat tax, lower than both of the aforementioned rates, which means tax rates would be reduced for everybody under the flat tax system [3]. The flat tax would keep the EITC which both liberals and conservatives support as it reduces poverty--especially for single mothers [4]. Lower tax rates are widely accepted to reduce income tax evasion, so the base would be broadened. (2) It would end double taxation. It would be a single tax. (3) It would reduce complexity. There would only be two tax credits. Three deductions. Things under the current law would be grandfathered in as to reduce economic strain during a transition and avoid major legal issues. Saving would be tax exempt until used for consumption. \u201cThe New Flat Tax offers tremendous simplification for individuals and businesses; it provides much greater transparency so that taxpayers can be more confident the taxes they pay are in line with those of their neighbors, and so taxpayers can be more informed about the true costs of government. [5] (4) The most comprehensive study on the issue suggests a revenue neutral--which the New Flat Tax plan is--flat tax would create economic growth in the USA. [6] 3. Russia A similar experiment was done in Russia. Russia already had low taxes with 28% being their max tax rate (like under the Reagan administration), but they lowered their income tax to a flat 13%. The International Monetary Fund, although unable to find a supply side effect from the tax, was able to find that more people paid the tax and that revenue increased as a result. [7]In Russia, a flat tax provided more revenue than a progressive tax! Other researchers did find a supply side effect, noting more hours were worked and it was easier to find jobs. Not only did revenue increase, but the jobs market thrived as a result. [8] A final study on the reform found that there was more tax compliance\u2014so more revenue\u2014but also that productivity increased. [9] The flat tax in Russia was a huge success, and was far superior to the liberal progressive tax they had before. 1. http://taxfoundation.org... 2. http://www.heritage.org... 3. http://www.heritage.org... 4. http://www.cbpp.org... 5. http://www.heritage.org... 6. http://www.frbsf.org... 7. https://www.imf.org... 8. http://ftp.iza.org... 9. http://www.voxeu.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Taxes on the affluent should be increased.",
            "conclusion": "Taxes on the affluent should be increased.",
            "premise": "You claim that \"[federal] government revenue had [sic] been at 19.5% of GDP since the 50s.\" That is untrue. The post-WWII average of tax revenue is 17.7 percent of GDP \"\" projections of revenue for 2013 by the CBO place it at 16.9% only. In 2009, tax receipts amounted to 14.8 percent of GDP, the second lowest in recorded history. Kent Conrad was correct: tax revenues are at a 60-year low. The important point to not is that the reason that revenues are projected to climb \"\" to 18 percent of G.D.P. in the coming year \"\" is a function of the \"fiscal cliff\" tax increases and economic growth. Both of those claims undermine conservative ideology, though. Raising taxes should shrink revenue, they claim. Why then has the nonpartisan CBO estimated that it will continue to increase to 19.1 percent up to 2023? The answer is: we haven\"t met the downward-sloping portion of the Laffer curve. In fact, revenue would maximize at a top effective rate of 68.7%, significantly higher than even the top marginal rate now (39.6%), and certainly higher than the rates that the affluent actually pay. As I\"m sure you now, many of them pay significantly less than middle- and lower- income individuals because they either earn their income through capital gains, are able to receive special loopholes, etc. The best example is oil subsidies -- roughly $40 billion \"\" which Republicans continue to defend. As I stated earlier, Mitt Romney paid roughly 14% on millions in income. Paradoxically, the \"47 percent\" whom he criticized pay higher percentages of their incomes than does he, for they pay sales taxes, payroll taxes, user fees, state and local taxes, property taxes, etc. In the wake of welfare reform of the 90s, pushed their by a Gingrich-led Congress, their lives have been even worse. Add to that the record levels of income inequality \"\" the fact that CEOs now earn about 380 times the wage of an average worker, relative to 42 times in 1980. And their pay has increased since the crash, while median incomes have decreased \"\" in fact 93% of the gains of the economic recovery went to the top 1%. Which brings me to my next point: you mentioned corporate welfare. Why would you presume that I support corporate welfare? Do you oppose it? Excellent. You\"ll agree, then, to cut oil subsidies. You\"ll agree with Ronald Reagan, Art Laffer, and me that capital gains should be taxed as ordinary income. You\"ll support eliminating farm subsidies to affluent corporate farmers \"\" which the Republicans voted to fund at the same time they slashed food stamps by $40 billion. Do we have an agreement? If your answer is yes, you\"ve just conceded the debate \"\" that\"s raising taxes. If you cannot support those measures, you cannot rightfully say that you\"re opposed to corporate welfare. If your argument is that we should take Mitt Romney\"s idea and \"broaden the base and lower the rate\" then I have a few questions for you: what specific loopholes would you cut? Will it be revenue neutral, independent of dynamic scoring? Would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for tax cuts for millionaires \"\" which, by the way, the CBO claims is the only plausible way for the plan to be revenue neutral? Also, explain to me how that will create jobs. Are you claiming that some people are able to pay virtually nothing, while others pay significantly higher rates? If that\"s the case, wouldn\"t raising taxes remove from these companies their incentive? To me, that sounds like a case for targeted tax hikes \"\" that some people will continue to produce even with higher rates, while others may be more recalcitrant. That\"s the essence of my argument. But I agree with the economic research \"\" and with people like Paul Krugman, who look at the data and argue that the rate at which we would find ourselves in trouble is around 73-80%. Just as a slight increase in the minimum wage would not be cataclysmic \"\" and would not shed jobs \"\" slight tax increases to the tune that I\"m advocating will not, either. Your next factual inaccuracy was: \"If business had more money and less regulation, they could produce cheaper goods.\" This claim hinges on the notion that companies are suffering from a lack of productive capacity, and that rates are on the downward sloping portion of the Laffer curve. That\"s inaccurate, though: I pointed out that revenues as a percentage of G.D.P. are at historic lows, that C.E.O. pay and corporate profits are at all-time highs, that the stock market is doing great, and in my last post, that taxes for the affluent are at near all-time lows. Allow me now to prove to expand on that latter point, and prove it. First, I\"d like to credit the compilation of the following points to former U.S. Secretary of Labor, and Professor at UC Berkeley, Robert Reich. He argues \"\" as I have \"\" that tax rates are at historic lows \"\" that the rich are paying a lower rate than they have at any time in the past half-century. Before the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, the top tax rate was 70% (and 91% under Eisenhower). Yet, in spite of credits, deductions, exemptions, and so forth, wealthy people paid about 52-56% of their income in taxes. Because many affluent individuals derive their income from capital gains, they end up paying even less. The grandest point, though, is that the affluent can afford to pay more right now. You argue that tax cuts will hinder business profits, and thus lead to less employment, lower wages, higher prices, et al. These are assumptions \"\" which even a very rudimentary microeconomic model would dispel, for even they account for the fact that companies will absorb some of the tax. In a lot of cases, they\"ll absorb all of the tax \"\" e.g., meta studies demonstrates that raising the minimum wage would create jobs because it would create more demand. But there is a point, yes, where it would hinder job growth, just as there is a tax rate \"\" around 73% -- where companies would lose their incentive to invest and to hire. But we\"re nowhere near that point: the top 1% have amassed about 20% of total income. The 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans combined, while the top 10 percent of households take in half of national income, instead of the historical average of a third. At the same time, the average income for the bottom 20 percent of households has fallen by approximately 3 percent since 1979, says the Census Bureau. This is in spite of nearly doubled productivity over the past 30 years -- wages have flatlined, and in most cases declined. But during the three decades following WWII, wealth inequality was far less severe, and the economy boomed as a result. Why? Because it remains true that the rich would be better off with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than a larger share of a stagnant economy. And without a way to spur demand, without consumers to purchase their goods and services (and thus to employ executives, for without demand, they\"d be out of business), they\"d be out of luck. I don\"t think we agree on this very simple point: that government can work. Yes, it wastes money; yes, it does things we don\"t like (wars, drones, etc). But how about defense services, public education, infrastructure, research, air traffic controllers, meat inspectors, and police and fire forces? Not only are these things critical to our survival, but many directly employ people, which sets off a multiplier effect (the famous Keynesian multiplier \"\" which we can discuss more later) which leads to more demand, higher wages, more employment, etc. That is the essence of a vibrant economy \"\" not wealthy people saving most of their money, or even spending it on luxury goods (buying a Tesla, for instance, is not going to employ millions of people who are out of work). They have more money, and therefore for each additional dollar they earn, their marginal propensity to save is much higher than their marginal propensity to consume. This is untrue for the workers I have delineated earlier, who spend nearly all of their incomes because they have to in order to survive. Surveys from business leaders are unanimous that the problems they\"re facing are not overtaxation or overregulation \"\" but lack of sales. Finally, I would dispute your claims \"\" and would ask you to provide specificity \"\" that tax cuts lead to job expansion. I\"m almost out of space, so I can\"t go through each separately, but consider this: a Congressional Research Service study, which Republicans tried to conceal, holds that tax cuts are not correlated with growth in savings, investment, and productivity, but are with increased income inequality. That\"s true of the 80s \"\" where the bulk of the \"growth\" in the US came about amid 11 consecutive tax increases and an exploded Pentagon budget. Even Thatcher implemented a sales tax that was disastrous for working families. And following Kennedy\"s tax cuts, top marginal income tax rates were at 70%, and corporate taxes at 48%. Do you support that? Which brings me to my next point: I\"ve proven to you that tax cuts don\"t raise revenue, that you can not directly connect a tax cut to growth, and that income inequality is a threat. How do you justify them? How do you pay for them? Or do you support austerity measures, such as those in Europe, which are hindering any type of recovery? Your points about times that it has worked are quite vague and inconclusive, so I\"d ask that you more thoroughly justify your points. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... http://www.factcheck.org... http://money.cnn.com... http://www.epi.org... http://www.foreffectivegov.org...",

            "conclusion": "RESOLVED, The United States should abandon the current tax system and adopt a flat tax rate of 10%",
            "premise": "1) \"The US goes bankrupt\" http://en.wikipedia.org... The US government takes in 2.6 trillion dollars from taxes (98% from taxes). Most from Income taxes and large additional chunks from corporate. Assuming your ten percent is income and corporate (some advocates of flat taxes insist on only income to avoid double taxation) then because the bulk of that is paid at a rate of 35-33% you'd be cutting the tax take home of the government to about 1/3rd. But, let's just say half for the sake of calculations. That means the government is going to take in 1.3 trillion. Assuming ofcourse that there are still social security and corporate taxes. The spending in 2008 was 2.9 trillion with an additional .6 trillion for the wars. So the 1 trillion dollar deficit will instantly increase to 2.3 trillion dollar drain. If we shut down the government for the most part we could drop that to a 400 billion dollar deficit with a complete cut of all discretionary spending (lowering us to the 1.78 trillion of mandatory spending) and closing down (the department of defense, education, urban development, homeland security, energy etc.). This is on top of the 10 trillion dollar hole we are already in. We'd be bankrupt. ---- The Reagan years were marked with the end of the recession and a massive increase in spending which tripled the national debt. It started the ballooning of the national debt. Kennedy's cuts came at a time of growth as well. However, Clinton's tax hikes came at a time of growth too and the revenues also skyrocketed. Whereas Bush's massive tax cuts came at a time of growth and the economy tanked and all of the surpluses turned to deficits. And oddly, he did the same thing Reagan did. It's almost like there's no pattern at all. The fact that a low tax rate brings in shell companies doesn't mean there's jobs there. It means there's a P.O. Box there and a lot of money on paper being taxed there to avoid paying taxes. It isn't a massive influx of business, it's a scam that the US hasn't done away with. The vast majority of people can take a standard deduction and enter their W-2s. You don't get in trouble for misunderstanding the tax code, you really have to be a jerk or obviously intending to defraud them to get any trouble at all. Your claim that if you lower the tax rates then tax cheats will stop cheating the system. I have another idea, let's make it so they can't cheat the system anyway. Sure you can cheat the system to save yourself 3 million dollars, but it's not worth it for 1 million. There's no actual evidence that tax cheats cheat less at lower tax rates. There's every indicator that the tax rate and GDP have everything to do with tax revenues. The tax cuts you suggest happened during times of economic uptick when the revenues were going up. However, right now we're in a pretty bad recession (though hopefully at rock bottom now). \"The economic booms were unrelated? ...my opponent says that when Clinton raised taxes on the rich there was a surplus. But this simply does not have the backing of a pattern like my point does, for example George Bush passed a record number of tax cuts and still did not have a surplus.\" You first question my claims that the economic booms were not caused by the tax cuts (in some case the tax cuts were caused by the booms, we tend to lower taxes when we can). Then you note that the Clinton tax increase and surplus and Bush tax cut and deficit don't fit your suggested pattern. Ofcourse they don't fit your \"pattern\", there is no pattern. Tax cuts don't lead to increased revenues. \"There are other companies besides American ones who can invest in America.\" The US economy is larger than most of the rest of the G8. With the exception of China and Japan there aren't that many large multinational non-American companies. And those in China and Japan are already here! Oh, and what is Japan's corporate tax rate? 30%. -- In short, 10% will collapse the government, the government is the largest employer and will dutifully collapse the economy that is, at present, almost stabilized. The tax code isn't that hard to follow and doesn't require a lawyer. Most small businesses do perfectly fine filing their own taxes. Taxes are hard to figure out so let's bankrupt the US government. -- Most of my argument thus far has been pointing out that the number you gave is too low. Let's not rest on just that. You are also proposing a huge tax hike on the poor. The poor in this country at present make less than $20,000 a year, and you will be directly taxing them $2,000 dollars. At present they pay less than nothing. Not only do they have no tax burden but they often collect the EIC and other credits. You will be wiping that out and forcing them to pay 10% of their income to the government. This is a massive tax hike to the people who can afford it the least. While at the same time you'll be giving a massive 25% tax cut to the superrich. So the Bill Gates of this country gets billions of dollar of tax cuts while the average Joe living paycheck to paycheck is going to be hit the hardest. -- Massive tax cut to the superrich, massive tax increase on the poor, and you bankrupt the country.",

            "discussionTitle": "Instituting A Flat Income Tax In America",
            "conclusion": "Instituting A Flat Income Tax In America",
            "premise": "You've got good points, thank you. I will provide a rebuttal for all three. Rebuttal 1) My opponent begins by saying that is unfair to take a greater percentage of the money of rich people, in comparison to the percentage taken from lower income people. I do not dispute that rich people are productive members of society, nor do I dispute that it is unfair. I will say that it is necessary however. I say this because there are two evils to weigh against each other, and one must be chosen according to acceptance of reality. The first evil is what my opponent brings up in his first point, that the rich lose a greater % of their wealth, compared to other levels of income. The other evil that must be considered is the evil of taxing the poor to the point that they cannot handle it. It is completely unfair to allow either of these evils I have mentioned, however, reality dictates that we choose the lesser evil. The evil described in my opponent's first point is the lesser evil, because the rich are more financially able to deal with the evil than the poor are. The poor would be taxed to the breaking point by a flat tax, through necessity of providing the government funds(my opponent has a point to counter this, which will be defended against later in my argument). So, to summarize, the burden must fall somewhere, and though it is not fair, through decent treatment of our fellow man, the burden must be placed on the rich. Why? Because they can handle it far more safely than the poor can. Rebuttal 2) My opponent is not incorrect in saying that a flat tax would be simpler. Very few things are all wrong or all right, and neither is the idea of a flat tax. While there are many things wrong with it, this is not one of those things. However the right must be weighed against the wrong, and if that is done, I believe we can all see that this benefit does not outweigh the disadvantages. Rebuttal 3) My opponent's third point is his best, in my opinion. He says that a flat tax would reduce the tax on the rich, and consequently lower the price of the products their companies sell, and give them more money to invest into expanding their companies, and thus providing more jobs. He also says this increase in jobs will make up for the loss in government funds which would occur through the cut on taxes on the rich. I shall split my rebuttal into three parts to counter his arguments. A) The Idea of Lowered Product Prices I do not believe it is incorrect to say that lowering taxes on the rich lowers the cost of the products they will sell. Obviously this will be nice for whoever is buying their stuff. For instance, if the owners of McDonald's suddenly got $60,000 more than they did last year, and were able to cut their burger price from $1 to $.85, and did so, I'd be happy about that. However, if I'm dirt poor, getting fifteen cents off on my lunch is not going to be a significant help if I'm losing $1338.75 more than I usually do per year. Lower prices would not assuage the pain caused to the poor by the tax hike that would occur under a flat tax. B) Richer Rich People=More Jobs Additionally my opponent argues that the rich having more money would lead to them expanding their businesses, and thus creating jobs. If a flat tax were to be instituted, this would probably prove to be true. The unemployment rate in America is 7.8%[1]. Some of these people would receive low income jobs from big companies. My chosen example of this company and worker relationship is McDonald's. If the owners of McDonald's were to have their taxes dropped by 15%, they would no doubt hire more people. The average yearly income for a McDonald's worker is $28,000, and the low/high range is estimated at $18,000-$36,000[2]. All of those numbers fall under 15% taxation, with our current system. So, if a flat tax were to be instituted (continuing my theoretical rate) the rate would be 25%, and companies would be able to hire more. The people they would hire, who would usually be taxed at 15%, would now be taxed at 25%. And for anybody who had a job with these big businesses before the flat tax, and before the expansions, would have their incomes lowered. In summary, the flat tax would create low income jobs for a portion of the 7.8%, but would lower the value of all the low income jobs, due to the tax hike that would come. A portion of the unemployed would have their lives improved, but the entirety of people with lower income jobs before the flat tax would have their lives degraded. If this wasn't a flat tax(and it was just a tax cut for the rich), and there was no tax hike on the lower income, then this wouldn't be an issue. There are better ways to create jobs for the unemployed, ways that won't hurt those who already have low income jobs. C) Job Creation=More Taxpayers Lastly, my opponent says that the jobs created by owners of companies who have received tax cuts will create more taxpayers, and more than make up for the money lost by the government when they drop taxes on those earning $400,000 or more by 15%. I have two statistics that I will use to refute this. [3]The median income of Americans: $41,650 per year, and [4]that the median income falls under the third lowest tax bracket. That means that one half of Americans will receive a tax cut, and one half will receive a tax hike. The half that receives a tax hike makes less than the side that receives a tax break, and yet Pro asserts that the lower half will be able to make up the difference, because more jobs will be created by rich business owners, even though these will be lower income jobs. In summary, the kind of jobs and incomes created will not be enough to make for the four tax brackets (all with wealthier people than the bottom three) that will receive cuts. Even though there may be more tax payers on the bottom half, their lower incomes cannot possibly be greater than that of the tax break that the richer half will receive. Lastly I'd like to note that I agree with my opponent on the fact that tax cuts on the rich would be beneficial. However I disagree with him over the flat tax because while it would help the rich, it would do damage to the poor(despite lowered prices and some additional jobs), and this is what makes a flat tax not worth it.

            "conclusion": "The government should cut taxes for everyone",
            "premise": "In a perfect world, taxes could be cut for everyone and government spending could also be reduced without anyone being affected by it. However, this is not a Utopian society, and the problem with this plan is that it can't be done while maximizing morally positive outcomes. My opponent has set forth a hypothetical economic cycle contrary to all historic fact. His plan relies on big business being the backbone of the US economy, without bearing the brunt of the weight. In this round, I'll work backwards through his 5 expectations.5. \"Businesses will hire more employees because they will have more money.\" By business owners, if I were to adhere to his previous statements on how the wealthy should receive more of a tax break because of their vested interest in creating more jobs, my opponent is talking about the wealthy. Being that he didn't provide a criteria for wealthy, I assume my opponent means the richest 1%. The underlying ideology behind his 5th contention, supported by his previous 4, is that the 1% is giving us money. The contrary, is the truth. Between 1980 and 2005, more than 80% of all new income in the US went to the top 1%. [1] Along with the increasing gap between social classes, they have been experiencing the lowest tax rate in 30 years. [2] The result is obvious, there simply isn't enough federal government money to fund our operations and we have an increasing debt. As illustrated by political comedian Bill Maher, \"Say 100 Americans get together and order a 100 slice pizza. The pizza arrives, they open the box, and the first guy takes 80..\"When taxes are higher, our economy does better when it comes to GDP & employment rates. Don't want to take my word for it, how about the Bureau of Labor Statistics with bureau economic analysis? Exhibit A: 3/4. \"As businesses are making more money they will pay more tax dollars. Government revenue will increase in result of businesses paying more tax dollars.\"As stated above, a combination of their income growth and their tax rate show that when they are experiencing the highest corporate profit total/average of all time [3], we are still at an unemployment level of 7.9%.[4] Though it has decreased from its peak, it is not nearly enough to justify the claims made by my opponent. To refute this point,Exhibit B: 1/2. \"People will have more money because of the tax cuts and they will spend more. As people spend more money businesses will make more money.\"Ah, now my opponent is onto something. I, too, accept the proposition of tax cuts for the middle & lower class of the US. They're taking the biggest hit of the recession, and are struggling the most. Tax cuts for the middle & lower class by 5%, tax increase on the top 3% by 3%.My opponent's conclusion paragraph1)\"The wealthy should get a 10 percent tax cut because they will spend more money, invest more and the ones that own a business will hire more employees in result of a large tax cut\" The wealthy already have gotten a tax cut from the previous administration. They hoarded the money, and didn't increase jobs-- Unemployment increased over the last 10 years. 2)\"The wealthy should get the largest tax cut because they create most of the jobs in this country.\"Somehow, the wealthy have all been established as the business owning \"Job Creators!\" The top 1% of US citizens make $380,354/year.[5] There are 314,809,366 people in the US [6]. 1% of that number is 3.1 million. As clarified by the presidential debates, 97% of all business owners fall below 250,000/year. Out of the 29 million businesses in the US, 26 million don't count. That leaves one million business owners, to 2 million other people. My guess is that they're filled with famous athletes, famous actors, and reality TV stars such as, \"The Situation,\" from Jersey Shore-- some job creator. These people are no more the job creators than the lower class is the working class. Only few create jobs, 97% of which don't even qualify to get their taxes raised (or count as the top 3%/wealthy), and all social classes work. 3)\"Finally they should cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax, Alternative minimum tax and capital gains tax. To make up for these large tax cuts, the government should cut spending by as much as they cut taxes and eliminate tax deductions and exemptions. This tax plan will create many jobs and result in additional government revenue.\"How much would these tax cuts cost the US government, & where would the federal government cut spending to make up for these losses?In conclusion, I'd like for the audience to pay close attention to my opponents inability to dictate where the tax rates would be decreases specifically, where the government would cut their spending to match the decreases, and how that will effect the overall economy. There's nothing wrong with debating tax cuts/increases in theory, but when you expand to federal cuts you have to specify which of the programs you intend to take the hit because it has to do with how probable it is.

            "premise": "Let me respond to the rebuttals and provide a final statement. We DO live in a different era than the \"Work Together\" era. Bipartisanship itself is not bad, but it's important to understand that all this \"bipartisanship\" has brought us to a $14 trillion debt. Now, it is vital to get serious about cutting spending and reducing tax rates on job-creators. We can't increase revenue with payroll tax cuts because they are focused toward the poor. They won't have to pay taxes on their extra income because they don't pay income taxes. If we cut corporate taxes, that extra money will go to creating jobs, which means more people will pay income tax. \"The infrastructure banks have done exceedingly well\"-which is exactly why you said our infrastructure is failing, right? And roads haven't improved since the first stimulus. The National Bank can be used to fund bad things. $3.4 million was wasted on crosswalks for turtles before: http://abcnews.go.com.... Who says it won't happen again? This won't help our roads, but it will plunge us deeper in debt. It takes time to get roads built with the litigation process. Sometimes, a bureaucracy blocks construction after millions of dollars are set aside. I'm saying that there are better ways besides the payroll tax. And eliminating the corporate tax and cutting individual rates would cost less than Obama's stimulus. In my plan, we make up the lost revenues because all the money is injected right into the private economy to create jobs. These employees will pay payroll and possibly income taxes, making it cost less than expected. You told me to refrain from using words like \"fear-mongering\". But you never addressed any of my evidence. Private schools do have teacher's unions, but they don't have the same kind of power. A principal can simply fire a teacher at any time for any reason. There are also some big Catholic schools, and they also do well with less money. I was referring to dollars per student. The infrastructure bank does route to private companies, but it goes through a bureaucracy first that isn't good at determining which projects will actually help our economy and improve our infrastructure. Let's divide the work into states and localities, so our infrastructure will be better. Then, we unite and succeed. I said that corporations could band together. They can work together toward a common goal too, not just government. Here is my evidence about unemployment benefits increasing the jobless rate. It even comes from a left-wing news website: http://www.huffingtonpost.com.... The Rahn curve explains that when government gets too big, the private economy grows less. http://www.heritage.org... But the money will dry up, and more appropriations will be needed so the construction employees will keep their jobs. So the $3 billion price tag means $300 billion in a century. The rich don't hoard their money-they invest in it to create jobs. And there are very few billionaires-your plan would also hurt people who earn $250,000 a year-which is not wealthy in many parts of the country. Some form of socialism may be OK as long as it is predominantly capitalist, but telling the rich to pay more when they already pay so much in taxes is a hard line into socialism. Yes, all countries have a little socialism, and frankly, they'd be better off if they had a lot less. The Democrats were the ones who promoted subprime mortgages. Payroll tax cuts are too inefficient and won't grow the economy quick enough for it to be worth it. All in all, the American Jobs Act is another partisan piece of legislation from the Community Organizer in Chief. Let's get working on real economic growth, not short-term gimmicks. I urge a negative ballot.",

            "conclusion": "Replacing the Current Tax Code With A National Sales Tax Will Reboot the American Economy",
            "premise": "The complexity of the current United States tax code and the current tax rates place an excessive tax burden on almost everyone from the individual taxpayers and small businesses to billionaires and large corporations. The excessive tax burden robs the consumer of purchasing power and businesses of capital that could be used to expand their operations. For the sake of narrowing the debate, I will focus my opening statement on how the current tax code affects individual taxpayers (families, students, etc.) and how replacing the current tax code with a national sales tax will empower them to play their roles in rebooting the American economy. The income tax data that I use will come from TaxRates.org (http://www.tax-rates.org...) and covers the 2014 tax year. In the 2014 tax rate schedule, I have identified three income groups for unmarried taxpayers and two groups for married taxpayers with a total household income. I will examine each in turn, beginning with unmarried taxpayers. The first group that I have identified are taxpayers who earned between $9,075 and $36,900 in 2014. These taxpayers are students who are trying to work and go to college at the same time, new college graduates who have taken entry level jobs to gain experience and pay off their student loans, and lower blue-collared laborers. The marginal federal income tax rate for this bracket is 15%. Therefore, a taxpayer in this category making $20,000 per year will need to pay $3000 in federal income taxes. After factoring the cost of living expenses, a person in this tax bracket is left with very little discretionary income, which will limit their upward mobility in the market. The second group that I identified were the taxpayers who fell between $36,900 and $89,350 in income. The people who fall into this category can be small businessmen, middle class professionals such as accountants, teachers, etc., and middle class blue collar laborers such as plumbers and electricians. The marginal federal income tax rate for this bracket is 25%. Consequently, a taxpayer who earns $65,000 per year will pay $16,250 in taxes. Finally, the third group that I identified were the taxpayers who fell between $89,350 and $186,350 in total income. These people include the lawyers, the doctors, and the tech experts who provide the services that make our lives function so smoothly. They will pay a marginal federal income tax rate of 28%. Someone who makes $100,000 per year will pay $28,000 in federal income taxes. In summary, the three examples I used will pay $3000, $16000, and $28000 respectively in federal income taxes. However, what if we replaced every federal tax with a simple 13% national sales tax and compared it solely against the results of the study on the income tax (ignores other taxes levied by the federal government). Assuming that the taxpayer spends every dime that they earn, the three examples I used would pay $2600, $8450, and $13000 in federal taxes for 2014. However, most individuals don't spend every dime they earn so the actual tax burdens would be on the lower end of these numbers. What effect would a national sales tax of 13% have on the economy? Consumerism drives the American economy. With more money to spend, the American consumer would be able to afford more. Many individuals would save their money to make purchases that they wouldn't have dreamed of under the current income tax structure. The subsequent rush to buy would spark an economic revolution in the American economy. Prices would drop as people demanded a larger quantity of goods and services. Businesses would expand to meet the greater consumer demand and would create more jobs. Consequently, everyone's standard of living would be improved. Afternote: This is my first debate on here. I look forward to hearing the arguments that my opponent will present. I greet him/her in advance and wish them good luck.",

            "premise": "Let me offer my rebuttals. Some concepts of the bill may be bipartisan, but the bill is not. Also, we live in a different era then we did in the \"Work Together\" era in politics. We have a $14.6 trillion national debt. It's extremely important to be very careful when spending any kind of money because that money will be debt for our children to pay off. We don't cut revenue with all types of tax cuts. We would with payroll tax cuts because 47% of Americans pay 0 income taxes, so the extra income earned would result in a revenue cut. Eliminating the corporate tax would increase revenue because it boosts foreign interest in the United States to start up companies. Payroll tax cuts are simply short term gimmicks: demand-side tax cuts simply won't do enough to help the economy to justify the mammoth cost of hundreds of billions of dollars. The infrastructure bank would fix very little because, while a few projects may have a return on their investment, most will fall flat. There is also a massive amount of possibility for corruption with an Infrastructure Bank, particularly with a crony capitalist/socialist like Barack Hussein Obama at the helm. See the massive Solyndra loan scandal. Money could also be wasted on things like crosswalks for turtles, just like what happened in the 1st economic porkulus package. There is also so much litigation required to start up a road project that we would still have declining roads, even with the interest bank. We could spend nearly all of the money and see nearly no roads built. Infrastructure spending only nets the return when the roads get built. Getting through a federal bureaucracy makes that more difficult. Even the Infrastructure Bank will probably still have walls of regulations and hurdles. I said that GOOD tax cuts are a solid venue to economic growth. Cutting the payroll tax isn't a particularly efficient way to cut taxes to spur growth. It's much better to have PERMANENT tax cuts on corporations. We have the highest corporate tax in the world, and it's a necessity to bring that down so we can become more globally competitive. The payroll tax is demand-sided and is not very efficient. There are much better ways to spur economic growth: repeal Obama's disastrous, job-killing legislation and regulations, lower taxes permanently on corporate and individual income tax, and create an environment hospitable to business in all ways. School spending has recently been cut, yet test scores haven't declined rapidly, as fear-mongering liberals have claimed. We spend $200,000 per public school classroom. This is enough-private schools do much better with far less money. It's not a money problem, it's a union problem. Catholic schools often get a fraction of the money public schools get, yet they aren't breaking down. This is because the money is better spent in the private sector. States and localities are better suited for infrastructure projects. The sheer enormity of the problem and the giant bureaucratic mess we have in DC are the reasons why we need to split up the projects: divide and conquer. I am not saying that a particular company would have an interest. However, companies could band together because good infrastructure is good for all the business. While the cost of repairing all the roads is expensive, the problem is certainly not extremely drastic. Studies indicate that unemployment benefits increase the jobless rate by about 1.5%. They don't make all people lazy. Your father is conscientious and cared about the value of work. However, many people will succumb to take a government handout because it is the easy way out. We would be better served if these people were working. Also, some people make more money off of unemployment benefits than a new, minimum-wage job they could take. This increases the jobless rate. Too many public officials in general means too much government spending. Too much government spending does crowd out private investment? Don't believe me? Look at a graph of government spending growth as a percent of GDP and private sector growth as a percent of GDP. You see an inverse relationship. States and locality receive the money, with a host of bureaucratic control and red tape. When the money dries up, the construction companies won't have the incentive to hire the workers because they no longer receive money from the government. Of course. you could pass another stimulus bill containing more construction spending, but this would add to the deficit. If the companies would still hire them after the money dries up, then we wouldn't need government money for those jobs in the first place. Yes, sometimes businesses do go bankrupt. In this case, employers can see that they actually were valuable to the company using various metrics. Businesses have a free-market incentive to hire the best employees. \"Excessive millions\"-this phrase sounds extremely socialist. The rich EARNED their money. Many started out poor and worked their way up. They give a lot of their money to charity and still work very hard. I don't think we should have class warfare. Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. But he pays a lot more in taxes. The bill includes tax cuts, but also raises taxes on the rich, those who create jobs. We shouldn't be taxing the job-creators and redistributing it to everyone else. That is socialism and does not belong in this great nation. Eliminating the corporate tax-$191 billion, about 1/3 the cost of Obama's plan. Countries with more economic freedom have better quality of life, more income, less corruption, and better environments. The Democrats single-handedly destroyed the economy by encouraging the subprime mortgage fiasco: \"Everyone has a right to own a home.\" -I am just saying that estimates for the 1st stimulus were faulty. It said that unemployment would stay below 9%. It didn't. Can we trust these new estimates about Obama's new stimulus from the same folks? I think not. We need real change, not more taxes and spending. I urge a Negative Ballot.",

            "conclusion": "Implement a Flat Tax w/ Standard Deduction",
            "premise": "Thanks to Valladarex for suggesting this topic and for agreeing to debate me. I\"m looking forward to a spirited discussion.In this round, I will briefly outline what I see as a series of fair and equitable adjustments to the U.S. Tax Code. In Round Two, both my opponent and I will go into greater detail and advocacy for our basic plans.The United States Tax Code as currently constituted reflects a series of political compromises. This has made it complex and unwieldy, but it also has the virtue of reflecting a balancing of political interests through the democratic process. My aim, then, would be to preserve the basic structure of the tax code without making any radical changes, while also seeking to implement reforms that simplify personal income tax and eliminates various perverse incentives.Here is a basic summary of what I would propose:Lower corporate income tax: The United States has one of the highest corporate income tax rates in the world. In our global economy, this has encouraged many corporations to keep their cash reserves overseas and avoid the hefty tax bill that would come with repatriation. We should lower the corporate income tax rate to be more commensurate with other Western economies to encourage those assets to be brought home and spent in America.Treat capital gains as ordinary income: Returns on investment are taxed at a much lower rate than income earned from labor, which is why people like Warren Buffet will talk about paying less in taxes proportionately than his secretary, or why Mitt Romney only paid about 17% in taxes the year before he ran for President. Part of the justification for this has been our high corporate income tax rate, which is so high that investors can credibly argue that treating capital gains as ordinary income effectively subjects them to double taxation on the same earning. Thus, in conjunction with lowering the corporate income tax rate, increase capital gains rates so that the investor class pays the same on their passive income as they would if they had worked for it.Eliminate the cap on payroll taxes: Medicare and Social Security are not funded by income taxes, but on a flat 7.65% payroll tax on earnings up to $118,500. People making $800,000 a year, then, pay the same amount as someone making $120,000. The bulk of this tax burden falls on the middle class, who make less than $118,500. There are two great reasons for eliminating the cap: first, this is an incredibly regressive tax, and the tax burden should be shared more equitably with higher earners. Second, eliminating the payroll tax limit makes Social Security solvent into the indefinite future.Eliminate taxes for income earned overseas: The United States is one of the few nations to subject its citizens living abroad to its income taxes - income that a citizen earns while living in Paris, France, for example, is still taxed as though the individual lived in Paris, Texas. Often, the income is subjected to taxes in the country of residence as well, leading to a significant tax burden. This policy should be ended.Increase tax rates on higher earners: For decades, we have slashed at tax rates for high earners under the theory that these tax savings would be plugged back into the economy, creating jobs and boosting spending. George H.W. Bush, before being selected as Reagan\"s running mate, called this \"voodoo economics,\" and the intervening 36 years have not proved him wrong. The American economy, and the American middle class, were at their strongest during the era of significant progressive taxation. Make the IRS do taxes for you: For most people, the tax code is a pain because you have to prepare your own return, and risk auditing if you get it wrong. In most nations, the tax collecting authority prepares the return for you, and you simply need to make corrections if any errors have been made. While this is a bit reductive, the basic reason the United States doesn\"t already do this is called \"H&R Block lobbyists.\" To simplify taxes for the vast majority of Americans, we should make the process as convenient and painless as possible. That means not wasting a pile of consumer money on one or two tax preparation companies.Thank you, and I\"ll eagerly await the details of my opponent\"s plan.",

            "conclusion": "Taxes on the affluent should be increased.",
            "premise": "I would say it is very foolish to say taxes don't kill jobs. Even many liberals conside that high taxes can harm growth. Profit is the force the power that powers capitalism. By taking huge portions of peoples income, you reduce business profits which hurts business expansion. High taxes lead to low wages and less products. Low taxes means more production, so the standard of living for the poor increases. You can say that extra money will not be invested, but rich people also spend a ton of money on luxury goods. That stimulates the economy. Taxes are a black hole that sucks potential capital from the economy and then wastes it on all forms of government \"services.\" You can say that taxes are repaid in the form of services, but what use full services does the federal government provide? Most taxes are just generational theft that takes money from poor young people and gives to the elderly. Other tax dollars go to lovely \"services\" like corporate welfare that takes the money of small businesses and gives it to big ones. Or maybe your dollars will fund wars or even the lovely NSA. They could be used to build notoriously inefficient highways or throw billions of dollars at the failed government monopoly known as the education system that creates schools so bad they only continue the poverty cycle. How do any of these programs create jobs? If business had more money and less regulation, they could produce goods cheaper goods. Maybe there would be demand for these cheaper goods. Think of all the innovation and production that could be achieved if tons of capital wasn't siphoned out of the economy. As for revenue, government revenue had been at 19.5% of GDP since the 50s. If can claim that low taxes doesn't create jobs, you need to check out the results of tax cuts in the 20s, 60s. In the 80s, tax cuts were implemented in the US, Britain, and Chile, all to great success. Even JFK, who liberals DROOL over, was a big supporter of tax cuts. He said this, \" The final and best means of strengthening demand among consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system -- and this administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963. I'm not talking about a \"quickie\" or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last five years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incenitives [sic] for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking. In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the federal government's most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures.\" He also said this, \"This economy is capable of producing, without strain, 30 to 40 billion [dollars] more than we are producing today. Business earnings could be seven to eight billion higher than they are today. Utilization of existing plant and equipment could be much higher -- and, if it were, investment would rise. We need not accept an unemployment rate of five percent or more, such as we have had for 60 out of the last 61 months. There is no need for us to be satisfied with a rate of growth that keeps good men out of work and good capacity out of use.\" And this, \"Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget -- just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions, and any new recession would break all deficit records.\" This is why i believe that taxes and regulation should be cut by massive amounts to release the means of production of this nation. http://midimagic.sgc-hosting.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "Taxing the rich will benefit our economy",
            "conclusion": "Taxing the rich will benefit our economy",
            "premise": "Kudos to my opponent for providing a well thought out debate! Just to clarify to the voters, my opponents \"Introduction\" which states what he is arguing is suitable and will be the topic of judgment. First Argument: Taxing the rich ($250,000+) reduces job creation and company expansion.The problem with the U.S economy is that our government has their hand in the free market which is causing a kink in the natural course of capitalism. Our high unemployment rates and lack of investments are caused by uncertainty. When you have an inconsistent government trying to pass laws that directly affect the profitability of the private sector, investors become fearful and sell their stock. This eventually causes a bear market, and the combination of a bear market and an unstable government further depreciates the market and ultimately causes a recession. Companies rely on investors for productivity and profitability. When investors remove themselves from the market, it causes the companies debt/income ratio to increase. In order stay profitable, they remove expenses, most commonly in the form of employment. My point in the paragraph above, is that capitalism is a top to bottom method for economic and social well being. Capitalism only involves the private sector, so they are not included nor should they be included in our economy's success or failure. Therefore, it starts at the top after supply is created to fulfill demand. Those are the people who create jobs and have the power to stimulate our economy.Increasing the tax rates for those who receive $250,000+ will do absolutely nothing to enhance our economic situation. It is proposed that by increasing their tax rates, it will provide the government with 1.1 trillion in additional income. With the additional money, as my opponent stated, Obama is planning on building and fixing infrastructure, as well as provide money for public employees and allowing for middle class tax cuts. The problem with this, is that the demand created by the increased taxes have no long term affects in economic stimulation. Building infrastructure creates a temporary demand. It will provide temporary work to an outsourced, private sector company solely for the purpose of providing temporary jobs. However, because we have limited funds and limited infrastructure, it will inevitably end. People don't invest in something with limited value, so nothing but government spending and temporary work will become of it. With regards to public employees, the demand has always been there. They would simply alleviate some of the hiring freezes that were put in to place after layoffs. Regardless, public sector jobs don't provide for investment opportunities, so the market will continue on its current track. As my opponent stated, the low and middle class spend more than the upper class. This is true, however, the middle class only account for 10.6% of U.S taxes. The government can't afford to lower them to the degree where the increased saving and spending would even scratch the surface of improving our economy. As everything stated above suggests, taxing the rich provides our government with money, but does absolutely nothing to stimulate our economy. At best, it provides temporary work for infrastructure and places public workers back in to jobs they shouldn't have lost in the first place. Now let's talk about the individual. Small business owners make up about half of U.S employees. There are a little under 6 million small businesses who employ roughly 160 million people. The average U.S salary is about $27,000. Roughly 1 million of those small businesses make $500,000 to $1 million. For simplicities sake, we'll use $500,000 as an average small business owners income. 39% of 500,000 is nearly 200,000. Let's say we reduce the tax rate to 30%. Now we're at $150,000. By reducing the tax rate we are saving a small business owner $50,000, which is potentially two salaries and two less unemployed. If we did that for every small business owner we would have 12 million new jobs created. Let's say the business was at full staff and couldn't hire anyone else. The average person who makes that kind of money already has an established emergency fund. An emergency fund is typically 3 to 6 months of savings for emergency events that arise. All additional money either gets spent or is invested. $50,000 x 6 million business owners is 300 billion dollars that is put back in to our economy. Even if they save, a savings account is technically an extremely liquid loan to the bank, who takes the money you just deposted, and invests it. So regardless of whether the additional money is in a savings account, or a brokerage account, it is still circulating the market.Bottom line, taxing the rich will not stimulate our economy. It will provide $1.1 trillion to be spent on temporary jobs and jobs that should have never been lost in the first place. It will not be put back in to the market nor will it provide an environment to entice people to invest in the market. Keeping taxes the same or even reducing them, however, will allow capitalism to run its natural course. It will provide for billions of dollars to be put back in to the market that everyone of us depend on. New investors allow companies to expand in every aspect of their business. Stimulated businesses create jobs. Jobs reduce unemployment and allow for investing. Investing drives interest rates up, and our government reaps the benefits from all angles. More taxes are paid because there are more employees. They make more money off of corporate taxes because of expansion. And, it allows the federal reserve to charge higher interests because more money is flowing through the market.Sources:http://www.csmonitor.com...http://www.census.gov...http://www.sba.gov...",

            "premise": "I put my opponent's first argument into Google Translate, and here's what I came up with: ehh boi, et me start off by shakin me wopper n' sayin' i ain't yur teepicul drek irushmun. now we irush ain't got nuttin\" genst rich and nuttin' for, but aint' these the ladeehs who need supportien? en iruland me bois love a good brawl and thee reech fol always pey for oor beer n' milk. yu simpley dont understaund me countree and yu try tu slap ur ideas in ma face like i slap me giant whoppper in ya wifes feace. That's not much of an argument, nor is there anything that I can rebut necessarily. I'm not \"slapping my ideas\" in anyone's face. We're simply debating the topic, as the purpose of this site is. Anyway, here are my arguments:1. There is no evidence whatsoever that tax cuts are good for the economy. The Congressional Research Service looked into this and analyzed tax rates since 1945 (1). Here was their conclusion: Analysis of such data suggests the reduction in the top tax rates have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. The share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. They concluded, after looking at 65 years of rates, that tax cuts do not increase productivity, savings, or investment, but do increase income inequality, which by and of itself poses a substantial threat to the economy. 2. The Laffer Curve is plausible, but there is no evidence that we are at the peak of the Laffer curve and in danger of shrinking revenue or growth. The Economy Policy Institue had this to say about how high the rate could go (2):Recent research implies a revenue-maximizing top effective federal income tax rate of roughly 68.7 percent. This is nearly twice the top 35 percent effective marginal ordinary income tax rate that prevailed at the end of 2012, and 27.5 percentage points higher than the 41.2 percent rate in 2013. This would mean a top statutory income tax rate of 66.1 percent, 26.5 percentage points above the prevailing 39.6 percent top statutory rate.Furthermore, they commented in the same stae on the impact of tax rates since WWII, and came to the same conclusion as the Congressional Research Service:Analyses of top tax rate changes since World War II show that higher rates have no statistically significant impact on factors driving economic growth\u2014private saving, investment levels, labor participation rates, and labor productivity\u2014nor on overall economic growth rates.3. Corporations are getting huge breaks (3). Citizens for Tax Justice conducted a study and found, among other things, that one third of corporations they studied paid a tax rate lower than 10 percent; that, out of the 288 companies they studied, 55 enjoyed enjoyed several years of no taxes -- 203 no tax years in total -- and 111 companies, including GE, Boeing, and Exxon Mobile, paid negative tax rates; and the average corporate income tax is 19.4% only. Furthermore, there is no evidence that corporate tax rates generate growth. According to the EPI, again, not only is the corporate income tax not high by historic standards, but there is no evidence that cutting it would generate growth (4).4. We have a federal deficit we need to address, and an economy to stimulate, and simply need the money. We can get more money by raising taxes, and we know the ramifications of doing so range from negligible to zilch. So let's do it. 1. http://www.foreffectivegov.org...2. http://www.epi.org...3. http://www.ctj.org...;4. http://www.epi.org...;",

            "premise": "Rebuttal and Analysis \"Well to make my stance more clear, I belive every tax rate needs a constitutional ammendment to pass. This is so when the goverment passes lets say a 9% or a 6% tax then they cant keep raising it every time they blink\" This has nothing to do with our debate. It does not affirm the topic nor negate any of my contentions. \"100% is imopssible anyway, and our goverment isnt that dumb to make a 100% tax at this time.\" A flat tax can be any rate as long as \"taxpayers pay taxes at the same percentage rate of their total income\" so it is irrelevant if our government would implement a 100% income tax or not. What is relevant is that a flat tax could call for 100% of an individual\u2019s income. \"Should my parents who make x amount oof money get taxed 40% and not the people a few miles away?\" No. Nobody's income should be taxed. \"Further more they use our schools, our roads, our police system, and they don't pay for it.\" All of these things are generally funded by local and state governments and not the federal income tax so a flat tax would do little to fix this problem. \"if the buissnses are taxed less they will be more likely to hire. EX. lets say after investments I have 1,000,000$. I own a company. Then the goverment comes and takes 50%. Or after the flat tax with an ammendment is passed I only lose 10%. Woould I be inclined to hire more with losing 50% or 10%. I would build a new factory and hire with the 10% law!\" Using this logic wouldn't 0% spark even more economic growth than 10%? If we assume that lowering income taxes improves economic growth, a 0% income tax rate would always beat a 10% tax rate. \"Well, It is not economically sound.\" Exactly. \"Also it is still economically sound\" How can something be not economically sound and still be economically sound? \"a flat tax is a lot better then the tax system we have now.\" That is not the debate. \"If those people with no taxes get hired then they get taxed, and can get promoted. Thats what capitilism is about.\" Not exactly. Capitalism- an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.[10] \"I still don't understand how the goverment owns our income. Is it because they set it to wherever they want?\" When you get down to the basics, it is either one of two things; either the government owns 100% of your income and allows you to keep a percentage of it or they steal a percentage of your income. \"Well they do that now don't they? Just saying.\" If you are implying I support the current tax system you are mistaken. If you are not implying that, this argument has no validity in this debate. \"A system without an income tax is terrible. Weve seen this in europe. They pass a sales tax and keep raising it.\" It is absurd to claim that a system with no income tax is terrible and then give an example of why it is terrible with systems that have income taxes. Also, a sales tax is no more manipulatable than a flat tax. \"You can't really regulate raising and lowering the sales tax because the federal goverment keeps a 10% tax on goods and you state tax just keeps raising it unless the feds tell them to stop. so its 10% federal tax, 30% state tax. Wow that sounds good... not.\" The more local a tax is the more power citizens have over that tax so I don't understand where you are coming from when you claim the Federal government would have to interfere with state taxation to keep it from getting out of control. It is far more likely for Federal taxes to get out of hand.[10]http://www.merriam-webster.com...",

            "premise": "Read my arguments clearly before you argue against it. 50% of the people live ON BORDERLINE poverty, 15% of those people live below the poverty line. If you make a penny more then the poverty salary then this government will not consider you living in poverty. 50% of people who dont pay income taxes are very, very poor. Some are in poverty, some arent but pretty damn close, some are just to poor to give any back.\"The vast majority of new jobs in America are created by small companies\".......... Thats what you said at the very end of round 2 and when I used it you claimed it was false....... are you just a liar or dont remember your own arguments?\"I am in the 40% tax bracket, so you progressive system is %^&*. In a flat tax I get taxed 9% then my dad can hire more workes which stimulates the economy.\"1, its not MY system dingus, 2 if your dad is taxed at a lower rate he could very easily put his new profit into a bank account instead of using it to expand his company, there's no guarantee what he, or any of the other rich people, will do with all their new money. I want to urge the Con that we are debating progressive tax vs flat tax, not the U.S. progressive tax vs Herman Cain's retarded 999 planThe main point behind the Pro's argument is thatFlat tax = more jobs = more money = everyone richerA flat tax shifts the tax burden from the rich to the poor, the rich now have far more wealth then before because their INCOME just got a hell of a lot larger. Not the profit of the businesses they own, just their INCOME that they take from corporate profits...... Personal Income/Salary does not equal the profit made from corporations that they ownBill Gates made $900,000 in 2004,Microsoft made $9 billion for THE SECOND QUARTER of 2004 (1 quarter = 3 months)The company itself makes money which is then used only for the corporation, like to pay salaries or expand its businesses, that is NOT what Bill Gates's salary is for. That is his money and he can do whatever he wants with it. Bill Gates luckily has donated much of his annual income to charities but many other filthy rich people hoard their money and do nothing with it even though their companies continue to thrive and use its own profits to increase productivityWith all of their new wealth they DO NOT use it for expanding their businesses, that is what the rest of the money that their companies own is for. If the super rich want to put their own salaries back into their own companies thats a very noble thing to do, but a very RARE thing that happens as well. A flat tax does not guarantee job creation at ALL. Flat taxes dont apply to corporations it applies just to people, the corporate tax code is what is used on businesses but that is not what is being debated here.A Progressive tax places taxes on INCOMES of Americans, those who are in poverty, near it, or are too poor to give back can be exempted from the system unlike in a flat tax. The wealthy then are taxed at a higher rate because they have so much to give and their salaries come from corporate profits which they are removing from the corporation for their own use. A progressive tax is better for the economy then a flat tax because it brings in far more money then a flat tax ever could. If you had a low flat tax at say 9% then this country for example would be making far, far, far, far less money then it does now and that would destroy our economy. If you had a flat tax that brought in as much money as the US progressive tax for example then the rich would pay far less but the middle and lower classes would simply be crushed by the tax burden they face.....So to sumarize,A flat tax does not create jobs,A flat tax would shift the tax burden from the fabulously rich to the desperatly poor, A flat tax would bring in far, far, far less money then a progressive tax would......",

            "premise": "There is no evidence that tax cuts create jobs. There is an extensive academic literature on this subject, and it all lends itself to the same conclusion: tax cuts are not conducive to growth, but is to income inequality and middle class stagnation. First, let\u2019s discuss the reality of the current state of taxation in the United States. Andrew Fieldhouse of the Economy Policy Institute, in examining post WWII tax rates, noted this observation (1): Since the end of World War II, U.S. top individual income tax rates have declined markedly, as have effective tax rates on corporate income, capital income, and inheritances. Consequently, the federal tax code has become much less progressive (Piketty and Saez 2007). The top statutory marginal tax rate has fallen from just over 90 percent in the 1950s, to 70 percent in the 1970s, to 50 percent in the mid-1980s, to 35 percent for most of the past decade (TPC 2013a). The taxable income cutoff above which the top rate is applied for married joint filers has also fallen precipitously, from roughly $3 million in the early 1950s (adjusted to 2012 dollars), to roughly $1 million in the early 1970s, to just $388,350 for 2012 (TPC 2013b). The overall decline in progressivity is most striking within the top income percentile: The effective tax rate for the top hundredth of a percentile (i.e., 99.99\u2013100 percent of filers by income) has fallen by more than half, from 71.4 percent in 1960 to 34.7 percent in 2004, versus a decline for the 99.5\u201399.9 percentiles from 41.4 percent in 1960 to 33.0 percent in 2004 (Piketty and Saez 2007). To elucidate this piece, here are his conclusions: 1. Tax rates, which ranged from 70 to 91% in the first three decades of the post-WWII era, have fallen substantially. 2. Effective rates on corporate income, capital gains, and estate taxes have fallen as well. 3. The tax code, with time, has become increasingly less progressive. We also have data telling us that the tax systems in most states are regressive \u2013 that is, a disproportionate portion of the burden is falling on lower-income people \u2013 as many states move away from progressive income taxes in favor of sales taxes (2). At the same time, corporations are getting giant breaks. Not only are they low by historic standards, as Thomas Hungerford points out (3); the nonpartisan Citizens for Tax Justice conduced an extensive study (4) of 288 Fortune 500 companies over a 5 year period, and came to the following conclusions: 1. 111 companies, including GE, Exxon, and Boeing paid negative tax rates. 2. One third paid no federal income tax less than 10 percent over the period. 3. The average tax rate was only 19.4%. 4. 55 of the 288 companies enjoyed several years of new taxes, with a total of 203 years of no taxes. So, now we have examined the evidence as to the current state of taxation. Let\u2019s review: 1. Many states have regressive tax burdens. 2. The very affluent have seen their tax rates at near historic lows \u2013 in spite of significant growth in the post-WWII era with significantly higher tax rates \u2013 and are enjoying significant breaks on the backs of the U.S. taxpayer, who have been forced to shoulder the burden. 3. Corporations are receiving unheard of breaks. So, we know that the essence of trickle-down economics is already in play: taxes are already low. What are the results, however, of these breaks? Let\u2019s go back to Andrew Fieldhouse, whose study concluded this: Analyses of top tax rate changes since World War II show that higher rates have no statistically significant impact on factors driving economic growth\u2014private saving, investment levels, labor participation rates, and labor productivity\u2014nor on overall economic growth rates. Interesting. But what about the Laffer Curve, conservatives may ask? Is there not a point beyond which the government simply cannot raise taxes lest it loses revenue? Of course there is. But what is that rate, and are we anywhere near it? Fieldhouse addresses this, as well: Recent research implies a revenue-maximizing top effective federal income tax rate of roughly 68.7 percent. This is nearly twice the top 35 percent effective marginal ordinary income tax rate that prevailed at the end of 2012, and 27.5 percentage points higher than the 41.2 percent rate in 2013.This would mean a top statutory income tax rate of 66.1 percent, 26.5 percentage points above the prevailing 39.6 percent top statutory rate\u2026. Historically, decreases in top marginal tax rates have widened inequality of both pre- and post-tax income. Emmanuel Saez and Nobel Laureate Peter Diamond also weighed in as to what the effective tax rate ought to be, and concluded that the optimal tax rate on high-income Americans would be 70% (5). We also have data from a 65-year study from the Congressional Research Service (6). Here is their conclusion: Analysis of such data suggests the reduction in the top tax rates have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. The share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. For more on income inequality, let\u2019s go to Robert Reich (6): During periods when the very rich took home a larger proportion \u2014 as between 1918 and 1933, and in the Great Regression from 1981 to the present day \u2014 growth slowed, median wages stagnated and we suffered giant downturns. It\u2019s no mere coincidence that over the last century the top earners\u2019 share of the nation\u2019s total income peaked in 1928 and 2007 \u2014 the two years just preceding the biggest downturns. And, for a bit more, let\u2019s go to Nobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz, who cites World Bank economist Branko Milanovic (7): From 1988 to 2008, Mr. Milanovic found, people in the world\u2019s top 1 percent saw their incomes increase by 60 percent, while those in the bottom 5 percent had no change in their income. And while median incomes have greatly improved in recent decades, there are still enormous imbalances: 8 percent of humanity takes home 50 percent of global income; the top 1 percent alone takes home 15 percent. Income gains have been greatest among the global elite \u2014 financial and corporate executives in rich countries \u2014 and the great \u201cemerging middle classes\u201d of China, India, Indonesia and Brazil. But how bad is income inequality? Let\u2019s ask Stiglitz: Last year [2012] the top 1 percent of Americans took home 22 percent of the nation\u2019s income; the top 0.1 percent, 11 percent. Ninety-five percent of all income gains since 2009 have gone to the top 1 percent. Recently released census figures show that median income in America hasn\u2019t budged in almost a quarter-century. The typical American man makes less than he did 45 years ago (after adjusting for inflation); men who graduated from high school but don\u2019t have four-year college degrees make almost 40 percent less than they did four decades ago. So, there is certainly a moral argument at play: the middle-class has stagnated since the 1980s \u2013 the rise of Ronald Reagan, and the inception of the supply-side economics experiment we\u2019ve been experiencing for about 34 years now. But what are the economic effects of income inequality? Should we be worried that income inequality is constraining the economy? Yes, says Stiglitz again. He makes the following four arguments: 1. Income inequality will lead to underconsumption, as the rich spend relatively smaller portions of their income than poor people due to the diminishing marginal returns of income. 2. Income inequality leads to a waste of human talent, as the non-affluent cannot access high-quality education as readily as rich people. 3. Income inequality gives way to financial crises. 4. Income inequality lowers tax receipts. And we also know that income inequality in the United States, coupled with social mobility, is significantly lower than it is in Europe. We know that countries in Europe \u2013 Finland, Germany, Norway, et al. \u2013 and even the U.S. in the three decades post-WWII had higher tax rates, more government investment, less income inequality, and more growth as a result. European countries also beat the U.S. on health, life expectancy, happiness, economic mobility, etc. Conclusion: The evidence is overwhelming, and there isn\u2019t much time to waste. Supply-side economics is a fantasy.

            "discussionTitle": "Mitt Romney is a Liar (as a GOP Candidate)",
            "conclusion": "Mitt Romney is a Liar (as a GOP Candidate)",
            "premise": "I will respond to as many of these claims as I can in the time I'm given. A lie is a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive. [1] 1) On Mitt Romney's website (my opponents first source), it does indeed say on the side that zero trade deals have been signed by President Obama. The source my opponent gives to refute this claim is a deal that was passed by Congress in October 2011. I have frequented Mitt Romney's website often throughout the campaign because I've kept up closely with te GOP race (I'm a Ron Paul supporter). I haven't seen any changes. The latest date mentioned on the page is August 2011. It is fully possible that this page was written before the trade deal my opponent mentioned was passed, in which case this would not be intentionally false. If my opponent can present a trade deal that Obama signed before August 2011 or a similar statement made by Romney after October 2011, I will concede this point. 2) He does plan on cutting rates across the board. However, the source my opponent sites says he also plans \"to make up the lost revenue by limiting deductions, credits and other tax benefits for wealthy Americans.\" There is a lot of evidence that the reason why the most wealthy people in the U.S. do not pay as much in taxes is because of all of the loopholes and deductions that they get. [2] There is also evidence that lower tax rates do not amount to a lower amount paid. The total tax revenues from the wealthy actually were higher under Bush than now. [3] This has a lot to do with the economy. If Romney can get the economy back going again, as he seems to truly believe he can, the Federal government would take in more money from the top income earners. 3) This source seems incredibly biased. Obama's recovery has been a nightmare (see my response to 9). I saved this one for last and do not have enough space left. Let's talk this one on the next round. 4) CBO's projections often change. A later release in March 2012 by the CBO estimated ObamaCare would cost $1.76T over the next ten years, which averages to $176 billion a year. [4] Long term deficit savings are hard to depend on considering President Obama won't be President 10 years from now. 5) I concede this point, but I think we all know what Romney means. Obama has never been a business guy. All of his meaningful career positions have been closely related to public policy. Even as a professor, he worked for universities that are heavily subsidized. The Baskin Robins job seems like a stretch. Romney's claim is basically that President Obama is blind to what it's like to run a business under current tax and regulatory policies because he has always been on the public policy side of things. 6) I concede this point. This was an example of typical political rhetoric. 7) A Romney presidency might add to the deficit, but my opponent's comment does not prove that. In fact, cutting taxes has proven to be successful in raising tax revenues and cutting deficits. According to a recent article from the Cato Institute, \"Canada's federal corporate tax rate has been cut from 38 percent in the early 1980s to just 15 percent today. Despite the much lower rate, tax revenues have not declined. Indeed, corporate tax revenues averaged 2.1 percent of GDP during the 1980s and a slightly higher 2.3 percent during the 2000s.\" In addition, \"[in] 2012, Canada is expecting to collect 1.9 percent of GDP in federal corporate income taxes with a 15 percent corporate tax rate. The United States is expecting to collect 1.6 percent of GDP at a 35 percent corporate tax rate.\" [5] 8) Medicare never had any cuts from 1966 to 1999. [6] President Bush's Medicare Part D added to Medicare spending. Presidents like to lie and say they're making cuts. Certain laws were passed, but most cuts were just cuts in projected growth. Those are not cuts. Give evidence that under a certain President between 1933 and 2008, total Medicare spending went down and I will concede. 9) This economic recovery has been much slower than the ones my opponent mentioned when looking at total jobs lost by months since peak employment. [7] 10) As the PolitiFact article explained, it was based on numbers that they claimed were a stretch. It is true that many part-time workers are not making nearly as much as they need to become self-sustaining individuals. It's reasonable to consider many part-time workers unemployed, but that's up for debate. 11) My opponent is ignoring the important explanation behind why he said the 50% as seen when he said it [8]. Corporate income taxes are a tax on all employees of those corporations. If there was no corporate income tax and we only taxed individual income, he would have received a lot more income than he did. Because the corporation is taxed before they pay him dividends, 35% of his income is taken before it is even considered his income. There is a similar problem with taxes in general. Suppose the income tax is 25%. If I pay you $100,000, the government will tax it (at, say, 25%). If you pay another person the remainder of that money ($75,000), they will tax it again at 25%. Is that person being taxed at 25%? Or 25% + .25(25%) = 31.25% with an arbitrary transaction made in between? When money goes into a corporation's bank, it doesn't go to any particular person until that corporation pays their employees and their shareholders. 12) Fair enough, but that was in 2008. Give evidence that he has lobbyists working for his current 2012 campaign. 13) I partially concede. It sounds like he backpedaled on this one. But was he saying that he received the NRA endorsement in 2002? or in 2007 when he was running for President? Also, he may have slipped on this one. He did pass some legislation as governor in cooperation with the NRA. That might have been what he was talking about even though they did not endorse him during his 2002 campaign. I will concede given more clarity on the context of his quote on Meet the Press. 14) A lie is a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive. [1] Not sure if saying 87 instead of 86 had any deliberate intent to deceive. Politicians (and all people for that matter) misspeak often. 15) Since my opponent seems to have an affinity to PolitiFact, I'll give him the link to their four pages of Obama's broken campaign promises. [9] Among the most important of these to me personally was his promise to close Guantanamo Bay, to have diplomacy with Iran ([10]), and to reduce the deficit ([11]). More of these promises are mentioned here: [12]. 16) I concede this point. 17) There was no source [20] in my opponent's sources. I'm skeptical of many of my opponent's sources because many of them are from PolitiFact. PolitiFact has some great articles, but they've been criticized for being fairly liberally biased. See [12] or do a Google search of \"PolitiFact bias\". It would give my opponent more credibility to give more diverse sources. I have conceded on points 5, 6, 13 (partially), 16, but the goal is to prove he lied 10 times. [1] http://dictionary.reference.com... [2] http://blogs.wsj.com... [3] http://www.washingtontimes.com...

            "conclusion": "Tarrif penalty on imports not manufactured to U.S regulations for polution, safety, child labor, etc",
            "premise": "For this topic we\"re addressing federal income tax not federal payroll tax. State taxes aren\"t addressed. To address federal payroll tax we would need to address how to ensure people have adequate retirement support and medical coverage, as well as address unemployment insurance. But, payroll tax does bring up another important statistic because is a regressive tax as in the web site you mentioned (http://www.cbpp.org...). Note what this means when looking at the graph, \"Sources of Federal Tax Revenue,* 1945-2013,\" also on that site. Note the increasing trend in the percentage of payroll tax in the total federal tax revenue from 1952 until 1995. At the same time, consider that people paying Social Security and Medicare taxes are also paying individual income taxes. Individual income taxes percentage during this period had a flat trend during this period while corporate income taxes percentage had a decreasing trend. Payroll tax is a reflection of who is paying individual income taxes. The increase in the percentage of payroll tax versus the decrease in the percentage of corporate income tax shows that income taxes have in actual practice become less progressive than designed. While inflation caused the monetary numbers of individual income to go up during the period, the actual value of the average income of those paying individual income has actually gone down during this period. Manufacturing jobs are the mainstay of the US economy and exports (http://manufacturing.gov...). This decline in income from 1952 to 1995 corresponds to a loss in manufacturing jobs. \"Manufacturers in the United States are the most productive in the world, far surpassing the worker productivity of any other major manufacturing economy, leading to higher wages and living standards.\" (http://www.nam.org...) The percentage of US jobs in manufacturing declined from about 28% in 1962 to 9% in 2011. (http://manufacturing.gov...) \"The United States lost 6 million manufacturing jobs between early 2001 and late 2009. And despite small gains during the last two years [2010 and 2011], the trend in manufacturing employment for the last 30 years has been downward.\" (http://money.cnn.com...) Particularly disturbing with the downward trend is the loss in higher paying technical design and engineering jobs (http://www.computerworld.com..., http://www.todaysengineer.org..., http://www.infoworld.com..., http://www.usnews.com...), the middle and upper-middle income jobs, that are significant contributors to individual income tax. In our present recovery, the gains are for the rich. (http://www.economist.com...) Essentially the corporations and their executives who have outsourced their manufacturing have made great gains in the recovery. But, the people who previously worked in manufacturing jobs are not economically recovering. The outsourcing of manufacturing by US corporations has redistributed wealth among nations. In 2000 the US produced three times the manufacturing in China, but now China\"s GNP exceeds the US. (http://www.marketwatch.com... ) However, as seen in the previous paragraph, the distribution of wealth among people has become worse, with rich getting richer and middle class decreasing and poor increasing. At the same time, pollution and product safety has become an increasing issue in China. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com..., http://www.greenpeace.org...) Tariff penalties on imports are different from tariffs. They aren\"t an across the board tax like income tax or sales tax. They are more like a traffic ticket, and the penalties specific to maintain competitiveness. Penalties would be on a case by case basis just as is currently done when there is a non-competitive practice complaint against importers now. Just as with non-competitive practice cases, penalties for lack of regulation compared to US regulations would only be applied when it severely affected US manufacturing\"s ability to compete. Just as traffic tickets encourages drivers to keep traffic laws, the threat of a tariff penalty would encourage importing manufacturer to follow US regulations. It is unlikely that a small foreign company independent of any US company would be considered a competitive threat. The bulk of the importers with this issue are tied to large US or international corporations. They have large legal staffs. The real issue is who will represent the US manufacturing workers who work for the same corporation that imports products and defends the importer. This is the most likely scenario. This might take a chartering an organization such as the EEOC. While enacting penalties might be rare, the publicity of the hearings would have an effect on corporate practices. A prime example is Apple and FoxConn. (http://en.wikipedia.org..., http://www.forbes.com...) Sales tax can be either regressive or progressive. The way federal sales tax was implemented in the 1960\"s was progressive. It was a 20% sales tax on only luxury items such as jewelry. While we don\"t want sales tax to be as complicated for the average citizen as income tax, it can be progressive by exempting necessity items such as food, clothing, and medicine. Income tax essentially taxes US industry as opposed to imported manufacturing; thus, making it harder for US manufacturing to compete. Even corporate income tax encourages corporations to move their headquarters overseas, an issue President Obama touched on in his recent news conference. What other ways to do you have to address the problem of loss in manufacturing jobs in the US and its effect on the economy? I\"m open to other options, but think we need to use all the good options we have available.",

            "premise": "My belief is that the corporate tax should not be cut to 0%. However, this does not mean that it should not be lowered at all. Corporations are by definition: \"a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its owners. Corporations enjoy most of the rights and responsibilities that an individual possesses; that is, a corporation has the right to enter into contracts, loan and borrow money, sue and be sued, hire employees, own assets and pay taxes.\" [1] Corporations can hold huge amounts of money, and they are expected to make money (from shareholders), and they often engage in illegal activities with leftover money, so they can make money, thus being able to increase stock prices and therefore revenue. [2] Also, corporations may move entire parts of the company overseas to not be taxed. This is a problem because it worsens the economy. The same effect would be felt with no corporate tax rate. This is my political opinion, as well, that most corporations legally bribe politicians, and buy their support through Super-PACs. This is why major politicians are able to fund their campaigns, and why corporations get what they want. Corporations funded most of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney\"s campaigns, with about $489,660,089; and $366,336,696; respectively. Top two contributors were the University of California/Microsoft Corporation, and Goldman Sachs/Bank of America, respectively [3]. So my idea is \"the less they have, the better.\" [1] http://www.investopedia.com... [2] http://phys.org... [3] http://www.opensecrets.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Taxes on the affluent should be increased.",
            "conclusion": "Taxes on the affluent should be increased.",
            "premise": "Amid the worst financial cataclysm since the Great Depression, one factor remains constant: discussions in the Beltway are centered around deficit reduction and what can be \"slashed\" from the budget. They speak of short-term pain in order to prevent long-term pain. But who bears the brunt of that pain? The answer is simple: the poor, the middle class, and those struggling to make it. The wealthy, who have done better than ever -- with corporate profits at all-time highs, with the stock market continuing to rise, with taxes lower than they've been since 1950 -- are not asked to bear any of this pain. And why is that? Because many of them -- the Koch brothers, Exxon executives, et al -- are lobbying politicians for breaks and preferences, leading many to claim that we cannot engage in a meaningful discussion on whether to increase taxes for the affluent because, in so doing, we would \"be creating too much uncertainty in the marketplace\" and \"strangling job creators.\" I'll be making the case that neither of those are so. First, taxes are at historic lows as of now, and many wealthy individuals pay significantly lower than do middle-income and poor individuals. Take Mitt Romney, for instance: his income comes from investments, and thus he can pay a rate as low as 14% on millions of dollars in earnings. Is that fair when a family earning $50,000 is paying a rate of roughly 23%? But this is fair, says Mitt and friends, because the low rate provides for them an \"incentive to invest.\" Let me pose the obvious question to you, though: if we took the advice of Ronald Reagan and Art Laffer -- yes, I went there -- and taxed capital gains as regular income, would you hold your money? Would you funnel more of it to the Cayman Islands or Switzerland? Doubtful. As Warren Buffet pointed out, increases in the capital gains rate pose no deterrent to the willingness to invest. The chief factor is -- as business surveys even point out -- is demand. And right now, demand is struggling because the economy is struggling. The engine of the economy is the demand function -- consumers of modest incomes who spend roughly 100% of what they earn because they have to in order to survive, as opposed to their affluent counterparts who are more apt to save any increase in what they earn. But, say conservatives, saving is a good thing: a dollar saved is a dollar invested, so goes Say's Law. This is also a fallacy, rooted in an assumption. Investment decisions, as I stressed, are rooted in the demand for the product. Without demand, it doesn't matter how many resources companies and investors have -- they're simply going to horde them until the economy improves (or invest them overseas). In fact, executives are sitting on roughly $2 trillion in capital that they're not investing. Tax rates are at all-time lows. Why aren't they investing that money? Because doing so will create a \"glut\" of capital. With zero-bound interest rates, it is actually a good investment now to simply hold cash. Finally -- since I would like to leave a number of topics fairly open at this point in the discussion -- I would like to tackle the most commonplace arguments for tax cuts: the notion that they have created jobs. Here's the truth: rates were as high as 91% in the three decades following World War II, and yet we saw the most prosperous economy in American history. But wait, conservatives say: No one paid 91%! While they're partially correct, effective rates were as high as 56-58% -- significantly higher than they are now. Bill Clinton, again, raised taxes, and oversaw a booming economy. But as Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and even Barack Obama cut taxes, the U.S. economy stagnated; in the case of Reagan and Bush, deficits spiraled out of control, and Reagan even raised taxes 11 times. I thought the point of the Laffer curve was that, if taxes are cut, the federal government would take in more revenue. Why didn't that happen? Because the rate would need to be as high as 70-80% to find ourselves on the downward-sloping portion of the Laffer curve. Now, rates are nowhere close to that point. So, let me make my position clear: I do not believe that marginal rates should be returned to what they were under Einsenhower. Simply, I'd like tax rates that allow the federal government enough revenue to invest in roads, bridges, highways, education, health care, job training, research, green energy, etc -- all the things that in which we collectively invest in order to create a better society -- in order to create jobs and prop up a deeply depressed economy. What the actual rate ought to be is not of much concern to me, and I can't say I have a figure offhand. The fact of the matter is, we know from the data and from history that the wealthy are not going to take their businesses elsewhere; that the economy will not shed jobs; that there will be no calamity. With that said, I welcome any challengers, and eagerly await a vigorous discussion.",

            "conclusion": "Job Creation/Stability",
            "premise": "An increase in jobs is a fundamental part of getting out of a recession. Consumer spending needs to be increased in order to see tangible growth in the economy and consumer spending can not be increased as long as consumers remain unemployed. The most efficient way to create jobs is to decrease corporate taxes that create incentives to create new jobs. For example, the state of Michigan enacted policy that substantially decreased corporate taxes on companies that created new jobs in high-growth sectors such as green and bio technology.[[www.michigan.gov/documents/gov/Econ_job_223200_7.pdf]] The purpose of business is to profit and through corporate tax cuts, business will have the ability to profit easier while creating jobs. Employed consumers spend the necessary money to stimulate and grow the economy. This is proven in the example of Ireland, which adopted a 12.5% corporate tax in 1988 while having the second-lowest per capita income in Europe and now has the second-highest income in Europe.[[http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/04/tax-cut-stimulus-opinions-contributors_0204_peter_ferrara.html]] Recently, the French government posted figures of 0.3% growth in GDP for the second quarter of 2009, an indicator it is coming out of the recession. Across the euro zone, only Germany matched this growth. This was unexpected by experts and while it does not mean the recession is over for France, it is encouraging. One of the key forces behind this was an increase in consumption. Consumption increased by 0.3% this quarter. This increase was the aim of the government when reducing VAT as part of its strategy to combat the recession. For companies such as restaurants and cafes, VAT was slashed from 19% to 5.5%, which industry bodies predicted successfully would lead to an increase in consumption. [[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4446507,00.html]] [[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jXJawG8lN9DDRVZ8N5-VSsc4_-Dw]] Government spending can also create jobs but the question is are these jobs suitable for getting out of a recession? The answer is a resounding no. Let's examine one of the largest attempts by government to create jobs, Roosevelt's Public Works Administration which allocated $3.3 billion dollars for public jobs to stimulate employment[[http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/pwa.htm]]. The jobs created by it usually lasted only months allowing only short term employment and the unemployment rate remained above 9%[[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110011064 ]]. Many of the jobs consisted of building public structures and murals such as a mountain theater that were not done to grow the economy further but to grow political capital. After the expenditures stopped, so did the jobs. Only private industry can provide the long term stability and job creation through new and improved investments which are vital economic necessities to get out of a recession. By providing corporate tax cuts to incentive this, governments will not fall in a pit of spending that only provides sparks and stifling the private industry that could make blazing positive changes in the economy.",

            "conclusion": "Replacing the Current Tax Code With A National Sales Tax Will Reboot the American Economy",
            "premise": "I would like to mention my opponent has dropped his argument that there should be a 13% national tax rate, it has been forgotten for several rounds (Cameron Round One). This is especially amazing since the 13% tax rate was one of the core essentials of his primary argument. In counter to Pro R5, he claims that I 'neglect' why these loopholes exist. This is getting ridiculous, it is obvious why the loopholes exist and I am not trying to say they shouldn't have loopholes. The point of my argument was to acknowledge that an elimination of a corporate tax would have no effects on prices due to most corporations already evading taxes through loopholes. Instead of trying to attack me there, Pro should of stated that all the ma n pa businesses would benefit from the elimination of the corporate tax. And yes, shareholders must pay taxes for if they play the game right, they can reap in hundreds of times more of what they payed in taxes, this has nothing to do with the corporate tax, what Pro is inferring is a completely different tax. In Pros second argument R5, he uses the law of demand to justify how a rise of consumerism would commence. Again most major corporations already pay no taxes, there will be no fall in prices. Not only that, but prices aren't just determined if a corporation is being taxed lower, other factors such as, demand and supply take hold. And lets say we do implement a NST a decrease in taxes for the consumer would be nice for them, but this would cancel out with a increase of taxes elsewhere like products and services. Instigators 3rd argument is irrelevant, so I shall not take this into consideration. Responding to Cameron A4 R5, he concludes that he was not informed that I was talking about the wealth inequality that would sneak in with implementation of the NST. This is funny. Not only did I talk about how I was referring to wealth inequality in Rezamee R3, but I also state how income inequality is correct as well. Let me explain how these both can be witnessed in the plight of the NST. If you have a home worth 350k you can be considered a wealthy individual for owning that home, wealth inequality is when one class gets better and better life quality while another class is either stagnant or decreasing in quality of life. With a national sales tax the rich would create more CAPITOL, capitol is considered by the federal government to be a type of income, rendering my statement of income inequality true. By allowing the wealthy to create more capitol you can see real estate prices rise as well as auto-motives, which would hurt the middle and poor classes. How would these prices rise? Corporate in mentioned markets would see a rise of wealthy individuals, in race to make more cash, we could see many corporations biding for profit in raising prices in said markets (housing n cars). I highly doubt the source you got for Tennessee having a surplus is legitimate, either that or, you manipulated the source/search for your benefit. Due to Tennessee being known to take more money from the federal government than them giving back in TAXES. In summary, the National Sales Tax will only bring unbalance.. unbalance in our market, imbalance in our classes, and imbalance in our government. Not only this, but if implemented, we could see a rise of a aristocratic government which could prove fatal to democracy as we know it. I would like to thank Cameron for the debate, it was very interesting, and I can not thank him enough for the learning opportunity.",

            "conclusion": "Taxing the rich will benefit our economy",
            "premise": "Since Both my opponent and I have forfeited, it seems best that I will further argue my first argument in this round, while attempted to refute my opponents as well. Since both my argument and my opponents are somewhat similar (though arguing opposite ends), and we will have no last round purely for rebuttals, I will try to refute his argument here, since I laid out my argument in depth in the second round. My opponent starts by making this statement: \"The problem with the U.S economy is that our government has their hand in the free market which is causing a kink in the natural course of capitalism.\" Since the policies of Alexander Hamilton in George Washington's government (the first Administration in US history), the Federal Government has played a role in the economy. Hamilton's policies were markedly protectionist. [1] This myth that the \"free market\" is self regulating and that there is a \"natural course\" of capitalism is superstition. Every presidential administration in history has levied taxes and regulated the economy, so to attribute economic recession to this is inaccurate. Moreover, my opponent asserts that \"Capitalism only involves the private sector\". This is also false. For example, the issuing of government bonds is capitalism. The government guarantees a return rate for investment- which is the most simple and fundamental role of capitalism. Moreover, capitalism relies on the existence of incorporated businesses (called corporations) to create shareholders and distribute risk, but a corporate charter has always been awarded by the US government. My opponents biggest mistake in attacking my argument is stating that infrastructure spending causes \"temporary\" jobs. True, if the government pays a construction worker to build a bridge, when the bridge is finished his job is finished, but then all service sector jobs are temporary. But the true misunderstanding of my opponent is that while the construction worker may only have a temporary employment, his income that is spend into the economy causes permanent growth, which on a large enough scale raises demand, and thus incentivizes the private sector to hire for \"permanent\" positions. If my opponent understood my position as merely arguing that public works would lower the unemployment rate directly, I must have been unclear. My argument, the Keynesian argument, the argument of established economic policy accepted by economists, is that the income by temporarily hired people will be spent back into the economy, which creates growth. My opponents scenario is dead wrong. I have worked for several small businesses, and have discussed his scenario with my bosses many times. Consider my opponents scenario: the economy is stagnant (as it is now), and small business owners have given a 50,000 tax cut. Since business is not very good, due to the economy, hiring a new employee for 25,000 a year would cost more to the employer than he would gain in productivity. This is a very simple truth. In a time when there is no demand in the economy, hiring is always a direct loss. Capitalism is all about creating the largest profit possible, and even if small businesses' tax rate was reduced to 0%, hiring would not increase. An employer simply subtracts wages from productivity and if the difference is negative, he will put the tax cut in the bank, where it allows for greatest profit. Therefore, my opponent is incorrect in his assertion that supply creates demand, and capitalism is a top down structure. The great disposable income the consumer has, the more money is spent into the service economy. And while the Christian Scientist Monitor article you cited states that the rich pay the highest taxes, you forget to mention that in the past 5 years the percentage of total income earned by the top 1% in the US is at record highs [2]. In 2007 the top 1% earned 23.5% of all income in the US, and this number is rising. So, if the richest Americans have received greater proportional wealth since the beginning of the recession in 2008, why has there been increasing unemployment. Whether you like Obama or hate him, there is one thing we can all agree on: he is ineffective in passing his agenda. The tax structure is identical to that under Bush. Corporate profits in 2011 were the highest in 60 years [3], yet hiring is at a standstill. This is easily explained. Since demand is still so low in the economy, the wealthiest Americans and corporations still have reason to invest in new employees. Reluctant corporations holding assets to keep profits high instead of hiring people is capitalism running its \"natural\" course. Instead of allowing the wealthy to sit on assets and wait for the economy to recover, we the people through our government ought to instead reinvest these funds into the middle class, creating a boom in income, and a boom in spending. Since most middle class people spend all of their income, increasing their income would increase activity in the markets, which would in turn increase growth in the private sector, and make hiring a new employee a net gain in the productivity the employee creates.

            "conclusion": "Taxes on the affluent should be increased.",
            "premise": "I will limit my response to only address your last post out of respect to you. I acknowledge that we all have circumstances in our lives that take a toll on our time. Even though there are plenty of things I want to address, I\"ll save them for later. It is true that the Tea Party and the Libertarian Party are more likely (than establishment Republicans) to condemn corporate welfare, and to accept that Washington D.C. is beholden to special interests. That\"s why many billionaires and defense contractors have been turned off by them. However, their ideology is largely predicated on corporate welfare. Consider Ron Paul, whom I can glean from your profile that you support. He voted for every tax cut put before him, including oil subsidies. In a interview with Cenk Uygur (video displayed) he was questioned about oil subsidies, and why he casted a vote in favor of them. His response was: \"Well, how do you define a subsidy? See, I don\"t consider any tax break as a subsidy. That was not a spending bill, that was not a grant. So if they get benefits, I cut..I never vote to increase any taxes, I vote to always give tax credits, and I always cut spending.\" He then endorsed an income tax rate of 0%. Obviously, income tax rates are progressive, designed so that the affluent pay more \" though today the tax is fairly flat. Under this measure (provided that his position on the corporate tax is identical), he is supporting massive tax cuts for corporations as well as affluent individuals. Then, he justifies his support for corporate welfare by attempt to redefine the word \"subsidy.\" Is your case that oil subsidies \" to the most profitable companies in the world \" do not qualify as corporate welfare? If oil subsidies don\"t qualify as corporate welfare, then what is corporate welfare? There are also a lot of problems with his consistency, though. First, the definition of \"subsidy\" from Investopedia is: \"A benefit given by the government to groups of individuals in the form of a cash payment or tax reduction.\" Here\"s the problem though: not only is his position inconsistent with what he said back in 1988 when he spoke out against farm subsidies (video displayed), but there seems to be a double standard in the way he votes. He sponsored a bill that was introduced on April 12, 1984 \" H.R.5484 (below) \" calling for a ten percent flat income tax. The problems with the bill are as follows: \"Disallows income tax credits for any taxpayer who is not a corporation\" -- I don\"t think it could be more explicit than this. It goes on: \"Repeals the income tax credits for: (1) the elderly; (2) contributions to candidates for public office; (3) earned income; (4) the purchase of a new principal residence; (5) dependent care services expenses; and (6) residential energy conservation expenditures.\" He said in his interview with Cenk Uygur that he always votes for tax credits \" so why did he support eliminating several? The answer is simple: these tax credits benefit the poor and the middle class, rather than the wealthy or large corporations. He wanted to eliminate with the Earned Income Tax Credit, the child care credit, elderly credit, etc \" while, at the same time, repealing estate taxes and gift taxes and slashing income tax rates to 10%. This plan raised taxes on poor and working class Americans, while cutting taxes for the very rich. So, he at least lied in saying that he also votes to give tax credits. Is it peculiar that the Earned Income Tax credit is considered welfare, but oil subsidies are not? I think it is. But it\"s quite similar to Mitt Romney\"s \"47 percent\" comment, and to Paul Ryan\"s \"takers and makers\" comment, and to Rubio\"s, Bachman\"s, and Perry\"s support of tax hikes on the poor. Oddly enough, the Ryan Budget included huge tax cuts for the rich, too, and maintained oil subsidies, whilst gutting social programs. I\"m mentioning Ryan, of course, because many people consider him a Libertarian \" and because, as an article I linked below delineates, he and his family actually would benefit from the $45 billion in oil subsidies in his budget. Coincidence? I think not. But why is Ron Paul doing these things? After all, when Michelle Bachmann \" who founded the Tea Party caucus in the House of Representatives -- argued in 2012 that \"half the country who pays no taxes\" needs to pay \"at least a dollar\" (and, by the way, I linked to an article below showing that Bachmann received $250,000 in federal farm subsidies \" so she and Paul Ryan have both benefitted from \"corporate welfare\" that they should oppose), Ron Paul argued that this was a step in the right direction. But when he was questioned about how he would fund the government without an income tax, his answered \"Non-punitive tariffs.\" Who pays those? Well, they\"re regressive taxes, so of course the middle-class and the poor pay them. Why is he supporting the rich at the expense of the middle-class? And I haven\"t even addressed the massive spending cuts he has proposed (e.g., eliminating the Department of Education). The case is not much different for 2012 Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, who wants to abolish all income and corporate taxes and replace them with the Fair Tax \" a consumption tax, purpoetedly 23%, which is supposed to be revenue neutral. But not only is the rate much higher than it is often promoted as (a panel under George W. Bush held that the rate must be 34 percent, rather than 23 percent, for the plan to be revenue-neutral), but it also poses a huge burden on middle- and lower- income individuals. The panel found that the plan raises taxes on people earning between $15,000 and $200,000; they even called the prebate \"a new entitlement program \" by far the largest in American history.\" Again, Mr. Johnson is protecting the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, which his huge, 43% across-the-board spending cuts also attest to. I want to step back, though, and explain why this type of thinking is so popular. Perhaps you\"ve heard of Peter Schiff, C.E.O. of Euro Pacific Capital and former advisor to Ron Paul. Here\"s a quote from him (video displayed) regarding his views on taxes: \"If you raise taxes on the upper-income earners, all you do is you diminish their ability to invest and grow the economy. So if we\"re going to raise taxes at all \" if we really want to reduce the deficit with tax increases \" we have to raise taxes on the middle class, because those are the people who are spending money, and we have to reduce consumption, not investment if we want economic growth.\" So Peter Schiff agrees that the middle class are the consumers in this economy, and that the wealthy are likely to spend some of their money, but invest the rest \" without any genuine savings. Again, he\"s falling victim to Say\"s Law. I pointed out earlier that corporations are sitting on literally trillions in capital that they\"re not investing, and taxes are at all-time lows. Not to mention, consumption is 70% of G.D.P. \" to say that the investment component of G.D.P. is more important than the consumption function is simply wrong. And what\"s his solution? Raise taxes on the middle class, who are struggling \" not because they\"re not working, but because many of them are earning low wages, declining incomes, or can\"t find work (there are three unemployed people for each job vacancy, for instance) \" and give more tax cuts to the rich, who are doing better than ever. I sense a case of social Darwinism, and not only do I find his ideas destructively economically, but also morally. His case is essentially that the wealthy will work harder if they have more money, but if you give poor and middle class people more money, they won\"t work as hard. Do you see the fallacy in his logic? So, the Tea Party and the Libertarian Party support corporate welfare. Tax cuts \" especially for the very rich \" are part and parcel of their ideology: their claim that the rich are the \"job creators.\" Obviously I completely disagree, as does the business community, who say that lack of sales is the reason they\"re not investing; Bruce Bartlett, Ben Bernanke, the NBER, and small business surveys (link with quotes and data below) agree that the drop in aggregate demand is responsible for the current economic woes. Here\"s my final point (video displayed) and I think it\"s quite relevant given Schiff\"s comments: in 2008, the federal government was funded by regressive payroll taxes (36% of total) and individual income taxes (45%), while corporate taxes only accounted for 12%. Compare that to 1950: the corporate income tax accounted for 26% of total revenue, the individual income tax accounted for 40%, and payroll taxes were only 11%. To say that the poor and the middle class are not paying enough in taxes is simply wrong \" factually and morally \" and I would submit that it\"s bad economics.

            "premise": "Thank you very much for your rebuttal and taking the time to debate this subject. Let me begin by addressing your contention that my scenario's are incorrect. You stated in your rebuttal that \"In scenario #2, the pre-tax profit will be much lower\". And that, \"the reasons for the less money include\": 1. More money has to be paid to government 2. Economies with less tax regime will be more economical thus out-competing the countries with more tax. 3. Companies will be tempted to invest in economies with lower taxes, thus slowing down the whole economy To address these points: 1. EBIT = \"Earnings before Interest and Taxes\". This is a term well-known to CEO's and CFO's the world over. It's basically a companies \"Operating Earnings\". You state that 'more money has to be paid to the government' so my scenario is inaccurate. I disagree. The $1,000,000 in earnings would be the same in both scenarios because they are PRE-TAX earnings. No money has been paid to the government in either Scenario. 2. While, theoretically, this point is true. I believe it to be irrelevant to this debate. This more of point in discussing international trade agreements & tariffs. 3. Companies cannot \"write-off\" as expenses, investments in other companies or economies, so there isn't a \"tax incentive\" for them to do so. A CEO's motivation is to lower the companies tax burden while simultaneously growing their own company. In short, the scenario's I've illustrated are correct, and valid. They are indicative of the way 'Real World' CEO's view taxes and their effect on business decisions. I know this from first-hand experiences. In your rebuttal, you referenced the study, 'Fiscal stimuli based upon tax cuts are more likely to increase growth than those based upon spending increases'. While this study may be accurate and insightful, it doesn't address the topic of this debate. It addresses tax cuts vs. increased government spending. Hence, I find it irrelevant. However, I did find an article which illustrates my point very well in an even more extreme example. The link is below. To Summarize, higher corporate tax rates DO encourage business investment. The higher the tax rate, the more motivated a CEO is to avoid paying the taxes. The best way for them to do this is to spend the money on growing their business (invest) instead of giving a large amount to the government as taxes on their NET profit. The Mind of a CEO: Tax rates high = Cheap to reinvest in company Tax rates low = Cheap to declare profits Thank you for the opportunity to debate this subject - I look forward to many more discussions! http://www.alternet.org...",

            "conclusion": "Taxes should be raised on the rich",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for creating a great debate. Let's do this! I will make my own case first and then do refutations.My CaseC1: Laffer CurveOne of the most important factors in an economy is the Laffer curve. The Laffer curve, which Dr. Arthur Laffer leant his name to the curve after discussing it with some aides from the Ford administration, shows the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues. I will link a picture to show what it looks like. The important thing to understand is two scenarios in which the tax rate is either at 0% or 100%. In both cases the government is getting no money by either no taxes or a rate so high no one would possibly work because of how much money they would not be making. As the rate rises from 0% the government gets money and as it lowers from 100% more people come back to work. The important thing to understand is that at some point the government would lose revenue rather than make it with higher rates and that is why lower rates should be implented. When tax rates are high, rich people stop investing their money and find tax shelters for it, but when its lower they continue to invest and expand their businesses. [1,2]C2: HistoryI. Harding-Coolidge Tax CutsUnder Woodrow Wilson, the top tax rate rose to a high of 77% and the country went into recession in 1921. Warren G. Harding became the next president of the United States and lowered the rate to 50% followed by Calvin Coolidge after his death, who lowered the top rate to 25%. This was followed by huge economic growth and a massive budget surplus.During this same period, Real GDP growth expanded from 2.0% before the cut to 3.4% after. The unemployment rate fell from 6.5% to 3.1%. In 1920, the share of revenue for those with over an income of $100,000 was 29.9%, but it was 62.2% by 1929. This actually got the rich to pay more in taxes than they did with a higher rate. Production increased dramatically. [1]Even more specifically with the Coolidge cuts: \"Nor is it surprising that, with increased economic activity following the shift of vast sums of unemployment rate from 1925 through 1928 ranged from a high of 4.2 percent to a low of 1.8 percent.\" [4]II. Kennedy Tax CutThe tax rates did rise to a high of 90%, but more to that in my refutations later. JFK wanted to pass his own tax cut and bring the top rate down from 90% to 70%. He was killed (interesting notice: both Harding and JFK were supply-side guys and died), but LBJ passed the tax cuts anyway.The results showed modest improvements. Real GDP grew from 4.6% to 5.1% and unemployment went from 5.6% to 3.9%. The Congressional Budget Office looked into federal budget receipts and found huge increases in billions of dollars that exceeded expectations. [1,3]III. Reagan Tax CutsWe all know that Reagan passed major tax cuts during his presidency that expanded the economy dramatically. The top tax rate went from JFK's 70% in 1981 to several lower rates before finally finishing at 28% in 1988. Once again, looking at the some economic figures.Real GDP growth was at 0.9% before the tax cuts to 4.8% after and unemployment decline from 10.8% at its height down to 5.4%. As with the two previous examples, the economy grew rapidly. C3: Income MobilityWhen the tax rates have been lowered we have seen huge income mobility among people. In a sense, it spreads wealth around and increase income mobility better than any social program could. This means that lower taxes is better in helping the poor because businesses are able to provide more jobs and increase wages. Income mobility is in the best interest of the people.During the Harding-Coolidge years: \"The facts are plain: There were 206 people who reported annual taxable that number fell drastically, to just 21 people by 1921. Then, after a series of tax rate cuts during the 1920s, the number of individuals reporting taxable incomes of a million dollars or more rose again to 207 by 1925. Under these conditions, it should not be surprising that the government collected more tax revenue after tax rates were cut.\" [4]During the Reagan years:\"The percentage of families earning more than $50,000 in 1990 dollars rose by 5 points from 30.9 percent to nearly 35.9 percent. During the 1980s, millions of middle-class Americans disappeared into the ranks of the affluent.\" [5]During the Reagan years, there were fewer than 5,000 people who had an income of $1 million or above. When he left 35,000 people did. This shows that there was huge income mobility at the time. [5]My CaseR1: Higher Taxes do not BenefitMy opponent and his report claim that when taxes were higher, economic growth was greated. This is simply not true. The rate was 90% under Eisenhower and the economy grew at 2.3%. During the Kennedy/Johnson presidencies when the tax rate was 70% the economy grew at 4.9%. This is far greater than under Eisenhower. Under Reagan, the economy grew at 3.2% with his low tax rates. In fact, every president beat Eisenhower with his 90% rate in economic growth except George H.W. Bush. [6]It is clear that the economy grew strongly when the top tax rate was cut.R2: Capital GainsAccording to Shlaes:\"The study was published in 2010, and Sinai says he still stands by it. The results are dramatic. Right now, economists say the economy needs to create about 2.4 million jobs a year. Sinai found that eliminating the capital-gains tax alone, with no other policy change, would create 1.3 million per annum, or more than half the total sought. Real gross domestic product would increase by 0.23 percentage point a year. The jobless rate would drop by as much as 0.7 percentage point in a year. And productivity gains would increase by 0.5 percentage point a year.\" [7]The capital gains tax hinders the expansion of business and entrepreneurship which is necessary for every free market capitalist economy to expand, but taxes has hindered them. George Gilder writes about the history of the tax that:\"Government tax policies have done their best to deter innovation and promote mergers, creating a capital blight in which smaller companies that were attempting to expand suffered most throughout the 1970s.\" [8]R3: HistoryI have proven through the Laffer curve that tax revenue increased dramatically from when it was under higher rates and the economy expanded much faster. Why? Because people took their money out of tax shelters and invested or saved it allowing for economic growth and more revenue. The stock market grew stronger under Coolidge and Reagan than it did under Ike. Coolidge saw over 260% of Dow Jones growth and Reagan saw over 130%. Ike saw 120% growth, but remember that no one was paying their true income in the 1950s as they tried to hide their money. [9]FDR saw larger growth than Reagan's, but this was mostly because of World War 2 growth. Unemployment fell and real GDP increased, but only because of the war.Sources1.

            "premise": "Donald Trump is the definition of a great American success. He is very, very rich and is a billionaire\" He makes the best deals, you better believe it! He knows the economy better than anyone\" Donald Trump\"s tax policy will Make America Great Again! Socialism is NOT Ethical and NOT American Values of FREEDOM and LIBERTY Bernie\"s Plan: My opponent is pushing the tax plan of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist (democratic) and desires a socialist tax policy. There is a reason people from communist Cuba fled to become refugees in America. When was the last time Americans fled to a communist country? Young people today do not understand the horrors of communism. If millennials were more intelligent\" they would support Trump. The track record of leftist economic policy: Russia, China, Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and many others speaks for itself. Socialism is a failed ideology that has brought unbelievable poverty and suffering throughout history\" SAD! They say \"The way to HELL is paved with good intentions.\" Let\"s look at this from a moral standpoint. Bernie wants to place astronomical tax burdens on the \"evil\" top 1%. I will now give some statistics on this misunderstood group. The top 1% contribute more than their fair share of taxes. Even the liberal CNBC says: \"According to a projection from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of Americans will pay 45.7 percent of the individual income taxes in 2014\"up from 43 percent in 2013 and 40 percent in 2012 (the oldest period available)\"(1). Also \"The bottom 60 percent are expected to pay less than 2 percent of federal income taxes\"(1). Let me repeat this important information; the top 1% pay almost HALF of all income taxes\" while the bottom 60% of all Americans pay less than a tiny 2% of all taxes. 1 out of 100 Americans pay so much taxes, believe me. This shows that the \"evil\" 1% is supporting everyone else. This is 2014 data but my guess is the top 1% pay a greater share of income than back then. Under a socialist tax plan the top 1% might end up paying 90% of ALL taxes, NOT FAIR! Let\"s look at something very important: philanthropy. I\"m not talking about the Clinton Foundation\" I am talking about REAL charitable giving. Here is another statistic: \"Households with more than $1 million in income donated more than $150 billion to charity last year, roughly half of all US charitable donations. Greedy? It hardly seems so\"(2). Also what kind of careers do the rich pursue? \"Roughly a third were entrepreneurs or managers of nonfinancial businesses. Nearly 16 percent were doctors or other medical professionals\"(2). Many wealthy Americans work as doctors, dentists or surgeons where they SAVE lives. Many others are entrepreneurs who create JOBS and bring innovation. Furthermore, \"roughly 80 percent of millionaires in America are the first generation of their family to be rich. They didn\"t inherit their wealth; they earned it\"(2). These are the FACTS and they prove that the rich are hard working, contribute greatly to society, create jobs, pay a high amount of taxes and donate generously to philanthropic causes. Trump\"s Plan: Fair tax rates which will allow job creators to keep some money for themselves. Bernie Sanders does NOT understand basic economics. Donald Trump was the smartest student at the top business school in the world. He earned a degree in Economics\" did Bernie? High Corporate Taxes Weaken Economic Growth: My opponent supports our current corporate tax rate of 35% which is among the highest in the world. This tax rate destroys economic growth and makes American companies unable to compete with international corporations, SAD! This unfair difference in tax rates force companies to move to other nations. This costs us tax revenue and sends our jobs overseas\" destroying potential jobs in America. Our Unreasonable Corporate Tax Rate Hurts Small Businesses Estate Tax MUST be Repealed: In The Communist Manifesto Karl Marx argues for the \"abolition of all rights of inheritance\" as one of the main principles of communism. He also wanted \"abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.\" Marx would have been a fan of the estate tax because it brings America dangerously close to the failed ideology of communism. Bernie Sanders wants a top estate tax rate of 65%. This means that if you become rich, the government is going to wait until you die and then steal almost two thirds of your wealth. Would you rather have most of your wealth go to your children\" or the government? The estate tax makes the government entitled to the money of the wealthy. For instance in one of the debates CROOKED Hillary Clinton said this about Trump: \"If you believe that he\"s as wealthy as he says,\" she said, killing the tax \"would save the Trump family $4 billion. \" \"Just think about what we could do with those $4 billion.\"(3). My opponent, like Clinton feels the government should be entitled to the money of the rich\" this is communism, believe me. Additionally, the estate tax allows the government to tax money twice. When someone earns money they pay income tax or capital gains/investment/property tax. After they die they get taxed again. It is unfair to tax people twice especially when Bernie\"s plan taxes them so heavily the first time. Imagine being taxed 50% on all the money you earn and then being taxed 60% after your death; the vast majority of your hard earned wealth would go to the government. This government enforced theft should be seen as a moral outrage. One reason many Americans work hard is so their children can never have to worry about living in poverty. Sometimes people want to become wealthy so they can give their children a financial advantage in life. It is perfectly acceptable for people to work hard for this reason. Bernie\"s high estate tax destroys much of this incentive, SAD! Sources: [1] https://www.cnbc.com... [2] https://www.cato.org... [3]https://www.usatoday.com...)",

            "premise": "Good luck to you as well. I agree with my opponent's definitions for this debate, however I have one of my own to propose as well. Federal Aid- In the United States of America, Federal assistance, also known as federal aid, federal benefits, or federal funds, is defined as any federal program, project, service, and activity provided by the U.S. federal government that directly assists or benefits the American public. http://www.reference.com... Aid Given the recent fiscal decisions between Washington and corporate entities such as AIG, I am assuming the only type of aid implied within the resolution is fiscal aid. Thus, I will be solely referring to financial aid within this debate round. if I misconstrued the intent of this resolution that is something that will have to be cleared up in later rounds by my opponent and myself. I will go NEG--> AFF --------------------------------------------------- CONTENTION 1- article 1 section 8 of the U.S. constitution The first power enumerated within article 1 section 8 of the constitution is: The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States; The clause explicitly denotes that the federal government may have the power to tax within the united states to pay debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States. within this clause, the federal government is directly given the power to provide aid in several ways. Subpoint A- Tax Breaks The first of which would be tax breaks. As the federal government can tax, they can simultaneously levy taxes on certain or all private companies as they please. Given that federal aid is \"...any federal program, project, service, and activity provided by the U.S. federal government that directly assists or benefits the American public.\" alleviating the tax burden on private companies would be entirely beneficial to these companies= federal aid. This alone is enough to negate. Subpoint B- Acting in the common defense and general welfare of the United States. furthermore, as the constitution reads within that same clause \" The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes... to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. we find yet another method in which the federal government can provide aid: when acting in the common defence and general welfare for the country. if the collapse of a multibillion dollar corporation were enough to jeopardize the welfare and security of this nation, then the USFG can act as empowered by the constitution by whatever means provided to ensure that such a collapse would not occur. the primary medium= federal financial aid. Subpoint C- necessary and Proper (elastic) The last clause within the Article 1 section 8 states \"[congress can] make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\" it is the government's primary role to act on behalf of the general welfare of the people,this clause gives them the explicit power to create such laws to do so. if a scenario (like in subpoint b) were presented to the American public, the USFG would be forced to act to preserve general welfare by providing federal aid. ------------------------------------------- NOW ON TO THE AFF ------------------------------------------- My opponents first contention is negated by my first contention. I have fulfilled my burden within this debate round, to show that the power to provide federal aid by congress to private companies is enumerated within the constitution. Thus, my opponent's second contention is fundamentally flawed insofar as it is simply false that the federal government does not have such powers. additionally, when it comes to interstate policy, commerce, and affairs its the fed's job to intervene and regulate. a lot of these companies (like AIG) span across all 50 states. vote neg.",

Also please quote msaying all jos come from big companys, because I said small companys make the jobs and proved that a flat tax would help them. \"Those 50% are the ones who are almost dirt poor, they are the ones living on borderline poverty, if not already deep within poverty. They are not your snooty neighbors next door or your dickish bosses who are not paying income taxes, it is those who truly have nothing to give back because they make so little in the first place.\"Link? Scource? Please prove your point before making assumptions. 1, its not MY system dingus, 2 if your dad is taxed at a lower rate he could very easily put his new profit into a bank account instead of using it to expand his company, there's no guarantee what he, or any of the other rich people, will do with all their new money. My dad doesnt own a company, he's a doctor. So his office is a small buissness. He faors a flat tax because he says: \"A flt tax would lower tases, and I want to hire more people, and even if I have mor emoney and have enough workers, I will inveest in stocks ich will also stimulate the economy\" So right there 2 ways that help his profit and stimulate the economy, and what is a dinus. I can't refite a work that looks like a probalble insult I want to urge the Con that we are debating progressive tax vs flat tax, not the U.S. progressive tax vs Herman Cain's retarded 999 planWell your plan has the numbers because you are using the current plan, so I need that on my side to hae a similar argument quality as yours, so that being said, the 999 plan is bad how? I think simplicity is the key, your plan has 80,000 me pages right? That sounds simple, not. A flat tax shifts the tax burden from the rich to the poor, the rich now have far more wealth then before because their INCOME just got a hell of a lot larger. Not the profit of the businesses they own, just their INCOME that they take from corporate profits...... Personal Income/Salary does not equal the profit made from corporations that they ownWrong the burden is on evryone, and still you need to prove thata progressive tax is better, and you still havent proven how yours is benificial for making jobs, so before reticuling me you still need to prove the ecoomic benifits. And my points still stand, more jobs = everyone richer. Lessining the amount of poor. but many other filthy rich people hoard their money and do nothing with it even though their companies continue to thrive and use its own profits to increase productivityWrong! rich people want to get richer so they will eand, if you want to prove this give me a reliable scource, then we can cubut. A flat tax does not guarantee job creation at ALL. Flat taxes dont apply to corporations it applies just to people, the corporate tax code is what is used on businesses but that is not what is being debated here.... nothing garentees jobs, but I have providd more proof then you on this topic, so please give me a credile scource on this topic. A progressive tax is better for the economy then a flat tax because it brings in far more money then a flat tax ever could. If you had a low flat tax at say 9% then this country for example would be making far, far, far, far less money then it does now and that would destroy our economy. If you had a flat tax that brought in as much money as the US progressive tax for example then the rich would pay far less but the middle and lower classes would simply be crushed by the tax burden they face.....Well duh a flat tax brings in less money, but that is good. That will hlp lmit federal spending, wehich is acctually good for the sctock market because then there is less doubt. A flat tax does not create jobs,Still need scources that are written by educated politicians or economists, like mine. Forbe ran for predident in 2000. ANd the other scources are experts in the feild, and the reascources for those sites are credibal also. A flat tax would shift the tax burden from the fabulously rich to the desperatly poor, Nope ot shares the burde, and since my flat tax makes more jobs then there will be less poor. A flat tax would bring in far, far, far less money then a progressive tax would......Great that means less spending onuseless things, and they will only spend on vital tings sx: roads, bridges, armed force, etc. There are still even more benifits to a flat tax. It is mor esimpleor fines hidden behind 80,000 pages of legislation, a flat tax is easy to comprehend, so the only way to break it's laws is to not pay the small tax. One tax system that\u2019s easier to comply with would be a flat tax system that features one low rate and many fewer deductions and credits. Why doesn\u2019t Congress adopt such a system? Probably because that would mean abandoning the idea of using the tax code to advance social agendas, and politicians like the idea of trying to change people\u2019s behaviors. (1)Compared to traditional tax systems, a flat tax is extremely simple. Households get only one exemption -a generous allowance based on family size - and then pay a low rate on any income above that amount. (2)How would a flat tax work for businesses? All businesses, from the largest multinational to a corner pub, would play by the same rules. Companies would add up their receipts (how much revenue came in) and then subtract their costs (salaries, cost of raw materials, and expenses for new tools and machinery). (2)There are two principal arguments for a flat tax- growth and fairness. Many economists are attracted to the idea because current tax systems, with high rates and discriminatory taxation of saving and investment, reduce growth, destroy jobs and lower income. A flat tax would not eliminate the damaging impact of taxes altogether, but by dramatically lowering rates and ending the tax bias against saving and investment, it would boost an economy's performance. (2)If enacted, a flat tax would yield major benefits, including: Faster economic growth. A flat tax would spur increased work, saving and investment. By increasing incentives to engage in productive economic behavior, it would also boost the economy's long-term growth rate. Instant wealth creation. All income-producing assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the after-tax stream of income that they generate. Simplicity. Complexity is a hidden tax that requires record-keeping, form preparation, lawyers, accountants and other resources to comply with the current system. Fairness. A flat tax would treat people equally. A wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes. (2)http://www.youtube.com...http://blog.heritage.org... (1)http://www.heritage.org...

            "conclusion": "The united states should prioritize tax increases over spending cuts",
            "premise": "That is a very nice arguement but these taxes will not benefit us citizens. (To shorten this because im lazy im going to list facts that will generally refute your case. If theres a specific arguement or impact i will tell you) \"The confluence of fiscal policy changes scheduled to occur at the end of 2012 \" sometimes referred to as the \"fiscal cliff\" \" poses serious challenges for policy makers. One area of disagreement is the increase in tax rates for high-income taxpayers resulting in part due to the sunset of elements of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. President Obama has called for the reinstatement of the higher top tax rates in his budget submission to the Congress, while key Republican members of Congress have called for their extension. The increase in the Medicare tax and its expansion to unearned income for high-income earners under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) further contributes to the increase in top tax rates. The concern over the top individual tax rates has been a focus, in part, because of the prominent role played by flow-through businesses \" S corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, and sole proprietorships \" in the US economy and the large fraction of flow-through income that is subject to the top two individual income tax rates. These businesses employ 54% of the private sector work force and pay 44% of federal business income taxes.1 The number of workers employed by large flow-through businesses is also significant: more than 20 million workers are employed by flow-through businesses with more than 100 employees. This report uses the EY General Equilibrium Model of the US Economy to examine the impact of the increase in the top tax rates in the long-run. While a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report examined the near-term effects of all of the federal government fiscal policies under scrutiny at the end of 2012 and found them to be of sufficient size to push the economy into recession at the beginning of 2013, this report focuses on the long-run effects of the increase in the top tax rates. This report examines four sets of provisions that will increase the top tax rates: \uf0b7 The increase in the top two tax rates from 33% to 36% and 35% to 39.6%. \uf0b7 The reinstatement of the limitation on itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers (the \"Pease\" provision). \uf0b7 The taxation of dividends as ordinary income and at a top income tax rate of 39.6% and increase in the top tax rate applied to capital gains to 20%. \uf0b7 The increase in the 2.9% Medicare tax to 3.8% for high-income taxpayers and the application of the new 3.8 percent tax on investment income including flow-through business income, interest, dividends and capital gains. With the combination of these tax changes at the beginning of 2013 the top tax rate on ordinary income will rise from 35% in 2012 to 40.9%, the top tax rate on dividends will rise from 15% to 44.7% and the top tax rate on capital gains will rise from 15% to 24.7%. These higher tax rates result in a significant increase in the average marginal tax rates (AMTR) on business, wage, and investment income, as well as the marginal effective tax rate (METR) on new business investment. This report finds that the AMTR increases significantly for wages (5.0%), flow-through business income (6.4%), interest (16.5%), dividends (157.1%) and capital gains (39.3%). The METR on new business investment increases by 15.8% for the corporate sector and 15.6% for flow-through businesses. This report finds that these higher marginal tax rates result in a smaller economy, fewer jobs, less investment, and lower wages. Specifically, this report finds that the higher tax rates will have significant adverse economic effects in the long-run: lowering output, employment, investment, the capital stock, and real after-tax wages when the resulting revenue is used to finance additional government spending. Long-run macroeconomic impact of increasing tax rates on high-income taxpayers in 2013 ii Through lower after-tax rewards to work, the higher tax rates on wages reduce work effort and labor force participation. The higher tax rates on capital gains and dividend increase the cost of equity capital, which discourages savings and reduces investment. Capital investment falls, which reduces labor productivity and means lower output and living standards in the long-run. \uf0b7 Output in the long-run would fall by 1.3%, or $200 billion, in today\u201fs economy. \uf0b7 Employment in the long-run would fall by 0.5% or, roughly 710,000 fewer jobs, in today\u201fs economy.++ \uf0b7 Capital stock and investment in the long-run would fall by 1.4% and 2.4%, respectively. \uf0b7 Real after-tax wages would fall by 1.8%, reflecting a decline in workers\u201f living standards relative to what would have occurred otherwise.\" http://waysandmeans.house.gov... Now i would like you focus on the 3 to last point that has + after it. This tax increase on the rich buisnesses and the average american will result in 710,000 jobs. Now this is better then my opponents because this facts that my opponent has given is from a organization, yes this organization is out there to help people with no profit but mine is a government website. Also the reason why we are not letting our nation go over this fiscal cliff is to avoid these tax increases and its affects which i show through my one fact.",

            "premise": "Thanks for submitting your argument Victorian. Firstly I'd like to discuss your first argument, which deals with corporate personhood. I accept that corporations consist of many people, however the law views corporations in a different manner. Since the Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward case, 1819, and subsequent U.S. Supreme Court cases, have ruled that a corporation should be guaranteed the same rights as a natural citizen of the United States. Such legal interpretation of the state of corporations has been used to argue against corporate regulation, upholding a corporation's right to donate to political parties and many various other cases, where corporations have claimed personhood for their own personal betterment. With this interpretation, it is only fair that this 'legal citizen of the United States' pay tax. Corporations, as much as they would like to, cannot only have the better side of the deal. Corporate taxation contributed to 10% of US Federal government revenue in 2013, over $234 billion. This is a substantial amount of money, money that goes into education, health, infrastructure, the military and many other key areas of government spending, all of which rely entirely on such finances. Ultimately, the supposed 'burden' on middle and lower class Americans from corporate taxation is removed, because the revenue raised goes into necessary services for these people. To the average American, a well funded local public school and appropriately maintained roads are simply more important than $5 or $10 off the weekly shopping bill. Furthermore, the competitive nature of retail and industry in this country, between corporations, practically force prices down to as low as possible. The removal of a corporation tax would be unable to in any means lower or reduce overall prices dramatically enough to impact someone's back pocket. Furthermore, the United States is in a chaotic fiscal climate. While debt and deficit continues to restrict the ability of the United States Government to deliver various services in a climate of fiscal austerity, the removal of a major revenue raiser would only further impact the budget. If the government, like you suggested, were to instead raise income taxes and abolish/lower corporate tax, this would have a direct impact on the American middle class, through additional taxation. This would grossly reduce spending and slow economic growth, which is a much greater burden on corporations than a corporate tax that has always been implemented. Any attempt now, or in the foreseeable future, to change the tax system in such a negative way would ultimately lead to the detriment of the US economy, the American middle and lower class and the United States budgetary crisis. Also, I agree that not all corporations are large, wealthy multinationals. The law and the US tax code recognizes this. In the United States, there are many different types of business ownership/entities, which are recognized under federal and state law. For example, a small business in Wyoming classified as a sole proprietorship would be taxed differently to a multinational corporation based on Wall Street. The corporate tax system is flexible in that respect, and larger more affluent corporations are taxed higher than smaller businesses.",

            "premise": "Burden of proof is indeed shared. Higher tax rates on the wealthy will reduce economic growth. The literature on taxing the rich and economic growth is quite weak. There are studies purporting to look at this question, but they are often little more than looking at a historical correlation between tax rates and growth, which is simply not a very sound research method as it ignores other factors that have larger impacts on growth among other reasons. First, we have evidence that higher tax rates in general have a negative impact on growth. An overview of this literature is available the sources. The Tax Foundation chronicles these sources [1]. We also have evidence that higher tax rates are responsible for the relative decline in hours worked in Europe relative to the USA, which has contributed to Europe being less productive [2]. Second, we have the evidence that more progressive tax rates harm economic growth. An example of some of this evidence is in the sources [3]. Finally, we have the evidence on how the behavior of rich people changes when taxes are changed. The evidence suggests that the behavioral responses are significant [4]. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that higher tax rates reduce economic growth in general, more progressive tax rates reduce economic growth, and rich individuals have quite large behavioral responses to changes in taxation. This is important as the main channels through which high tax rates harm economic growth are on the supply side rather than the demand side. Entrepreneurship is one of the central drivers of economic growth [5]. After all, entrepreneurs are necessary to continually innovate in a constantly changing economy. Unfortunately, highly progressive taxation decreases entrepreneurship. This is simple to imagine if one looks at two men who both have a job that pays $200,000 and a potentially good idea. Both men pay 20% tax rates on their $200,000 income and, if they are to pursue their idea, they would be forced to give up their job. The difference is that one man lives in a country with a flat tax regime of 20%. The other man lives in a supposedly \"fairer\" society where the first $200,000 are taxed at 20% but every dollar after that is taxed at a punitive 80%. This would dramatically lower the chances that this man would become an entrepreneur. This is a rather extreme example, but the logic applies to any progressive tax regime to varying degrees. Not surprisingly, there is strong evidence that progressive taxation has a negative effect on entrepreneurship [6]. High tax rates discourage productive behavior such as investing, working, and taking risks and encourages unproductive behavior such as tax avoidance. The evidence provided in the sources suggests that this effect is quite powerful and makes a meaningful difference in the economy. It's also important to note that wealthy individuals are more able to change the composition of their income so they can more easily avoid taxes, which is why they have such high elasticities of taxable income [4]. There is a widespread belief that taxes on the richest 1% are low. This is simply not the case. It seems that this perception is based entirely on anecdotal evidence. There is no doubt that some rich people pay low tax rates, but, as a whole, the richest 1% pay quite high taxes. The CBO estimates that, in 2013, the top 1% paid an average federal tax rate of 33.6%, compared to 18.1% average for all quintiles [7]. This does not include state and local taxes which, according to reasonable estimates, add another 6% or so to the average tax bill of the top 1% [8]. In total, this suggests a tax rate of around 40% on average, with some higher and some lower. I find it very hard to argue that one's \"fair share\" is more than 40%. Admittedly, this is a bit subjective because everyone has a different belief system about what is fair, but I think the fact that wealthy individuals already pay almost 35% of their income to the federal government and 40% to all governments would come off to most reasonable people as, if anything, too high, especially when realizes that the wealthy are already paying a higher tax rate than other classes. The practical problems with raising taxes on the rich have already been discussed, at length here. I also believe there is a moral element to this debate. Do we really want to live in a society where nearly half (or over half) of somebody's income is confiscated by the government? I certainly don't. America was founded as a free nation, with free enterprise at its core. One of the key tenets of free enterprise is that the government sets no limit on wealth. It is understood that taxes are necessary to pay for basic services and such, but I think it is hard to say that people paying 40% of their income in taxes are not paying their \"fair share\". No, raising taxes on the wealthy, at this point, would bring us to a place with tax rates that are better described as \"confiscatory\" than \"fair\". Confiscatory tax rates on any class or group is totally contrary to the moral core of the USA. Raising taxes further on the wealthy would be a moral and practical mistake. 1. http://taxfoundation.org... 2. http://www.economics21.org... 3. http://business.pages.tcnj.edu... 4. http://www.economics21.org... 5. http://www.nber.org... 6. http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu... 7. http://www.cbo.gov... 8. http://www.itep.org...",

Corporatism is a small bunch corporations that have a monopoly in a field where small companies (or small corporations in the legal sense) have virtually no access. In short, smaller the business, harder to cope with the costs that a larger company can afford. We're not talking leadership politics here, rather economics. Yes, it is true that in Communism a small bunch rules, but that isn't exactly the case. In a free market, anyone can create a business. In Corporatism and Pseudo-Communism, you must have strong ties in politics if you want to get your business to have lower regulations and politicians to eliminate your competition at that point, that the only other competition is the corporation that owns the other half of the market. In Communism, obviously, there is no business. The state demands production from you and gives you something return. Capitalism combined with outsourcing, indeed makes a society where everyone cooperates. But Corporatism is companies working with the state to increase their own wealth, they do not care to pay taxes, they can afford it while their competition can't. Either way, the tax money will be invested in them, so it's a double win. Communism is of course, people working as slaves for the state, which entitles them in return to a small fraction of the common benefit, the rest is exported.",

            "premise": "Capital gains should be taxed in full as they are earned, not when realized. Capital gains are income, not really different in substance from interest, rents, and royalties: other kinds of capital income that are taxed as ordinary income. Reducing/Abolishing Capital gains negatively affects the economy The difference in tax rates between capital gains and other income is a prime factor behind individual income tax shelters. Since ordinary income is taxed at rates up to 35 percent while long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent, there is a 20 percent reward for every dollar that can be transformed from high-tax compensation, say, to lowtax capital gains. The basic idea is to make an investment that generates deductions, such as for interest, lease Thus, the lower tax rate on long-term capital gains produces several distortions: (1) It encourages investments purely for tax purposes that would not make any sense without the tax savings, draining capital away from other more productive investments. (2) Since tax shelters that can pass legal muster or escape detection tend to be extremely complex, brilliant financial planners, 5 lawyers, and accountants turn their talents to this lucrative, but socially unproductive line of work. (3) Similarly, the enormous tax savings available likely lure too many highly productive people into the private equity business, drawing them away from other potentially more socially valuable enterprises. Lower capital gain rates enables the oversize financial sector to wield enormous influence on the U.S. economy. It encourages corporate executives to take stock-based compensation, because it\"s taxed more lightly than the same amount of salary income would be. This practice encourages executives to obsess over short-term stock-market performance at the expense of the long-term success of the corporation. Increasing rates will decrease inequality In 2016, for example, nearly 76 percent of all capital gains went to households earning more than $1,000,000, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center. And 96.2 percent of the households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution are white. Preferential treatment for capital gains meant that the federal government forewent $109.5 billion in taxes in 2016, a giveaway second only to the tax exclusion for employers\" contributions to employees\" health plans. If capital gain tax rates were raised, then the rich will be taxed their fair share. More money will be given to the government, which will allow more social programs to be implemented that will aid the poor in supporting their family and improving the American economy in general since more money also translates into more importing, exporting, production,etc.",

            "conclusion": "Taxes Are Justifiable",
            "premise": "Taxation is justified for a few reasons: Fund Necessary and Beneficial Activities for Society Critical for Government Reduce income inequality Other Beneficial Programs C1: Fund Necessary and Beneficial Activities for Society Basic Society: National defense, law enforcement, and a system of government are all needed to maintain law and order. With no taxation, a government cannot exist beyond very simple means. Obviously, a government is needed for a modern system. If a government was't needed in a society, we wouldn't of evolved to have them. Infrastructure: No person has gotten rich by themselves. Every rich person has utilized the vast American infrastructure, payed through taxes by the taxpayers, to get rich. As Bill Gates Sr., the father of Bill Gates said (about keeping the inheritance tax): \"Bill Jr. didn't invent the Internet. [He and others] just used it - to make billions. There is no such thing as a self-made man. Every businessman has used vast American infrastructure, which the taxpayers paid for, to make his money. He got rich off on what other taxpayers had paid for: the banking system, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and Commerce Departments, and the Judicial system, where 9/10ths of cases involve corporate law. These taxpayer investments support companies and wealthy investors. There are no self-made men! They owe the taxpayers of this country a great deal and should be paying it back.\" [1] If you disagree with the rich on HOW they got rich, on WHY taxes are justifiable, and why they ARE critical to society, I question your sense of decency. Taxes are our dues \u2014 we pay our dues to be Americans and enjoy the benefits of American society. Taxes are what we pay to live in a civilized society that is democratic, offers opportunity, and has a huge infrastructure available to all citizens. This incredible infrastructure has been paid for by previous taxpayers. Roads and highways, the Internet, the broadcast airwaves, our public education system, our power grid \u2014 every day we all use this vast infrastructure. Our dues maintain it. [3] C2: Critical For Government Taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society. I challenge my opponent to name a modern society that survives and flourishes without taxation. Taxes, unlike market transactions, are also delayed and not less tangible. For example, when we fill up at the pump, in a market transaction, we get gas. With a government transaction, we pay for the gas tax, and we end up with the Interstate highway system and our roads. I have already discussed the other points of the goods of taxation. If we had no taxation, we wouldn't have government. One needs to have the other to survive. That is why all modern nations have both. \u201cTaxes, after all, are dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.\u201d - -Franklin D. Roosevelt \u201cI like to pay taxes. With them I buy civilization.\" -Oliver Holmes Jr. C3: Reduces Income Inequality The progressive tax, or just taxes are in general have found to have numerous societal benfits for nations that have taxation. Lower homicide rates, less violence, less teenage birth rates, less mental illness, less obesity, and other societal factors improve when a tax system is used in a nation. [2] C4: Other Beneficial Programs As well as our huge, vast infrastructure, our system of law and order, and a functioning, stable, modern Constitutional Federal Republic, we have other programs that our government has created that we get the benefits from. I will name a few benefits from the government that we have gotten through our taxes: - Regulation of the Business Cycle - Interstate Highway System - The Internet - Public Health Programs - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Social Security and Pensions - Medicare - GI Bill - Federal Housing Authority - Consumer Protection - Clean Air and Clean Water Programs - Workplace Safety - Anti-discrimination policies - Anti-Poverty progams - National Weather Service - Military and National Defense - Food and Drug Safety programs - Scientific and Medical Research - Student Financial Help - National Crime Information Center - Medical Establishment - Federal Reserve - Human Genome - Basic Scientific Research - Settling the West - National Parks - Conservation - Public Libraries - Education - Schools and Educational resources [4] Conclusion My opponent doesn't support taxation. However, with no taxation, we wouldn't be a modern society. We would have no system of law. Capitalism, the economic system that our nation has used to become rich, requires government as well. We all take advantage of the government programs that exist. We use them all the time. Our taxes pay for the huge, vast American infrastructure. With no taxes, we would become a barren, uncivilized nation. Vote PRO Sources: [1] http://governmentisgood.com... [2] http://psych.mcmaster.ca... [3] Lakoff, George.

            "discussionTitle": "Instituting A Flat Income Tax In America",
            "conclusion": "Instituting A Flat Income Tax In America",
            "premise": "My opponent ends the back half of Round 3, bringing up the portions of my writing in which I state I agree with certain parts of his arguments. He says he believes we are close to agreeing. I would like to say that I am nowhere near agreeing with him on flat taxation. The areas where I agree are the areas where he talks about what would happen to the rich if they were to receive tax cuts. There is a major difference between that and flat tax, mainly the tax hike we would see for the poor. Which is what my opponent touches on next: my problem with the probability of the poor being too harshly taxed under flat tax. He counters this idea with his own, that a flat tax would generate economic growth. As I have already stated, I don't dispute the fact that there will be more jobs, but they will not be of very good quality to those working them, because of their new, higher tax rate that comes as the bad part of the flat tax. Creating jobs is not the only way to determine economic success. The quality of the jobs, and how well they provide for those working them, is a big factor. He also makes mention of a 10% flat tax rate. Firstly, this would not be feasible a way to acquire funds for our government. Under our current system which provides funds to our government, there is only one income bracket that is taxed at 10%, and that's the lowest income bracket[1]. To reduce government funding like that would be like giving a pack-a-day smoker only one cigarette. It's asking for trouble. I'm not a fan of our government's extravagant spending, but to bring it down that low is an unreasonable way to try to fix that problem. Something else to note is the furthering of the gap that would occur between the rich and the poor if a 10% tax were given to all of them. My opponent then goes on to talk about the benefit of the large job growth that could occur. These jobs however would be degraded because of the new, higher tax that would be placed on their income. The other important thing to note is that while many jobs would be created, even more pre-existing lower income jobs would be degraded by the tax hike on the poor. He also disagrees with me on the idea of tax revenue, saying that adding jobs will cover the tax cuts given to the wealthy. I have already explained my reason for why this could not work: the bottom half of lower income jobs cannot make up for the upper half of well-paying jobs. But this obviously didn't change Pro's mind, so repeating it won't change his mind or anybody else's who is Pro, so I'll say this instead: Let's pretend Pro is right. The shifted taxes will still be able to provide for the government. It still doesn't justify the harsh taxation that the poor (refer to my Round 2 arguments) would receive. This gets back to the argument I provided in Rebuttal 1 of Round 3. Next my opponent says he advocates the flat tax being as low as possible. I've already stated that dropping it down to 10% wouldn't be feasible, so I won't repeat myself too much there. My opponent finishes off by stating many countries have adopted the flat tax. To that I would say this: every country has different economic situations. Their 'classes' may be in better shape compared to ours. Their progressive tax system's tax rates may have already been closer together in regards to lowest and highest tax rate prior to their adoption of the flat tax. Due to the fact that every country is different in many, many small ways, and often in a few big ways, we cannot say that we should get involved in flat tax, simply because other countries are. Closing Statement: There are positives to the flat tax that can be had without the flat tax. If I was to propose taxation reform, it would be tax cuts for the rich. Tax cuts for the rich, done reasonably, provide more jobs to people. However taxing the poor more than usual on their new-found jobs' incomes mitigates the effect of this, and it should be avoided for the economic prosperity of our nation. America has never collected a flat tax[2], and we have persevered through thick and thin. It is natural to look for quick and easy fixes during times of economic discomfort, but our progressive tax rates have gotten us through. I return to the idea I started with: The more you have of something, the less valuable it becomes. Conversely, the less you have of something, the more valuable it becomes. If that is the case, and it is (look at inflation), then the flat tax is taking things of more value from the poor, and taking things of lesser value from the rich. Note To My Opponent: Great debate! This is my first debate that I've actually been able to finish fully. So thank you for your prompt responses and engaging arguments. Sources: [1] http://www.moneychimp.com...

            "conclusion": "Obama's plan to tax the rich would do little to solve the debt problem.",
            "premise": "Although our country leader has decided on evening out our economical budget. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. Income -- that is to say, very high income -- has become a charged topic even during the Republican presidential debates. Mitt Romney's recent release of his tax returns has added new fuel to the class warfare fire. What Mr. Romney's detractors, including the president and Newt Gingrich, insinuate is that he came to his wealth by breaking the rules. The rub -- according to the president and others -- is that Romney paid only $3M in federal taxes. Three million sounds like a lot, so for the president and Occupy, it is rather self-serving to say that Romney's income tax rate was 14%, or about $3M on $20M of income. This rate is far less than the top income tax bracket of 35% and far less than many lower-income-earners pay, leaving many confused. To this point, the president said: Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. We should note that the loophole the president clamors about is really a benefit to all Americans with an investment account. America has the highest corporate tax rate in the world -- 35% -- on earnings, but any gains paid to shareholders are accessed via another tax at the personal level. To mitigate the double-taxation, the Bush tax cuts lowered the tax on investment gains to a maximum of 15%. Before 2003, a corporation might pay up to 35% on profits, and the investor might pay up to 35% in income taxes, for a total tax of 58%. The Occupy movement and the president either don't realize or purposely neglect to mention that our country has one of the most level economic playing fields of any country that has ever been. Most who have wealth in our country got it the old-fashioned way: they earned it. The president proposes that the rich have gotten richer while everyone else has gotten poorer and that the rich have gotten richer at the expense of everybody else. In a free-market society like ours, Steve Jobs got rich by developing great products that we all benefit from and that we all chose to purchase freely -- not by stealing. It is an economic truism that wealth trickles down. Despite what the president and the New York Times say, in real terms (adjusted for inflation), the middle class increased their income and spending by 50% over the last three decades. In the last decade alone, the gap between the rich and the middle class actually shrank, and income growth was greater for the middle class than was the income growth rate of the rich. With sterling delivery and broad smile, the president continued: We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know that's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last. This statement is so misguided that it's upsetting. The president says that tax breaks add to the deficit -- in fact, only government spending can add to the deficit -- and that the only way we can reduce our deficit is by giving the government even more responsibility for its citizens and by increasing taxes on the rich. The president is proposing that by increasing the taxes on the top income-earners, he can balance the budget. This line of reasoning is plain fallacy; if every American paid twice the federal income taxes in 2011, there would still be a $207-billion spending deficit. A 100% tax on the top 5% of income-earners wouldn't solve the problem either. What no one seems to mention is the astounding increase over the last thirty years in what the top ten percent of income-earners already pay in income taxes -- matched only by the stunning decrease in the percent that the bottom half of income-earners pay. It would be unjust to take from the rich, who have by far worked their way up to economical success, and give to the poor for the things they haven't earned.",

            "premise": "Point 1: Well it's impossible to have no taxes unless you want no Government (I'm not an Anarchist or extreme Libertarian). \"On average, the wealthiest people in America pay a lot more taxes than the middle class or the poor, according to private and government data.\"\" The 10% of households with the highest incomes pay more than half of all federal taxes. They pay more than 70% of federal income taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\": http://www.usatoday.com.... \"Data compiled by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center show households pulling in more than $1 million pay about 29.1 percent of their income in federal taxes. By contrast, households making between $50,000 and $75,000 pay about 15 percent.\": http://www.foxnews.com.... The supposed \"rich tax loopholes\" are just made up by people like you just wanting a free slice of the pie. Besides the Middle East and a few parts of Africa, almost all countries have a double digit taxes as a percentage of GDP ratio. Zimbabwe has a 49.3% tax rate-GDP ratio. Lesotho has a 42.9% tax rate-GDP ratio.:http://en.wikipedia.org.... Having a high percentage is also bad. These tax rates are common. The higher taxation rate arguments is again bombed by the fact that these tax rates are common. Almost all of Europe has over 25% tax rate-GDP ratios. And they are tumbling into disaster. And it's the fact they use the high revenue in taxes to have health care, other welfare programs, cleaner environment, and infrastructure that they are in that mess. \"Universal coverage does not mean universal care, as it will lead to rationing of care, either overt or via extended waits for care. Universal coverage would result in the government running the health care system making it worse than it is today - because the government can't do anything right. Competition is what made this country great, and universal coverage is anti-competitive as the government is involved. Even though every other industrialized country has some form of universal coverage, many are looking to add market mechanisms to their plans. This shows universal coverage doesn't work.Health care is not a right; if we are guaranteeing health care why not guarantee food, clothing, housing...\": http://www.joepaduda.com.... With the environment, it is not as bad as the Government says it is and the Government is overstepping boudaries. And infrastructure works better under a competitive environment. Implemented immediately. Expansion increases jobs. There is no other way. Point 5: The Constitution also says that Government overstepping its bounds (tyranny) is unconstitutional. Providing a bill like that is overstepping Governmental bounds. Government Social Security is an unconstitutional way of providing welfare. Point 6: If the lower and middle classes don't WANT to save, why force them? If they are dumb enough with finances, why make sure that the Government provides it to them free of charge and at a cost to the Government? The whole thing is unconstitutional because it makes the Government to big (read the Constitution) and just raises the Government debt. Point 7: Again, why make the poor pay it? This is just a \"just-in-case\" tax in case they run a deficit and need to balance. If the Government spends too much, they should face the consequences. Point 8: Why do it through the property tax? Why not some other tax? Why charge agriculture for education? Surely there must be better taxes for this. And if this is all you are proposing is necessary for the tax\u2026 Point 9: Again, most excise taxes are on addictive substances. They cannot stop taking the substance because they are addicted to it. It does not lower use because nothing can lower use except internally. Point 10: The competitive increase from the corporate tax decrease would be a great thing because that would increase quality and reduce price, thus helping the economy. And again, given free money, businesses will expand. That is the good thing about greed. It never ends. They will always want more. And with more comes more jobs. Businesses handed profits would not in their right mind not grow because they are essentially losing money. They will expand when given the opportunity. Point 11: Renewable energy sources are good when they are one, used in the right places (they cannot be used everywhere), and two, be managed properly and be kept out of by the Government (which means no carbon or gasoline tax, but also includes Government interference in the Renewable energy business). But you can also reduce dependence on foreign oil by drilling at home. Right now, renewable energy sources are just too expensive. If we drill at home, gas prices will plummet, and we will live in a stabler economy. We should wait to use renewable energy until it become practical to do so. Completely jumping in would be totally wasteful (but a little bit is good). Point 12: We need to cut all that is unnecessary to save the Country from disaster. That will mean making some hard sacrifices including the complete repeal of welfare. VOTERS: The Computer cut out half of my argument and I do not feel like re-making it. Please vote for my opponent. CONTRA: Thank you for accepting the debate and debating through. Thanks for a through and intelligent debate. I hope you will except a re-challenge on this same topic later once I get out of my many debates and get to feeling better. Enjoy the win.",

            "premise": "Your honor, jury members of the industrialized countries and the people of the world, the pro side has proved that their motive for personally gains. The pro side motive does not benefit the people as whole but for few select groups (awful drivers, unemployed, and wealthy people). One reason the pro side does not want to pay insurance premium because the pro side is awful driver, itself. The pro side is trying to manipulative federal tax system and states/province/territory tax system in each industrialized countries due fact they are awful driver. For example, in the USA, this industrialized country has to be either Federal taxes and/or States taxes. The following states do not have income tax Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming (source http://en.wikipedia.org...). The pro side wants to void the tenth amendment rights for people of these eight states in forcing these states to create income tax. (Source http://en.wikipedia.org...). The pro side also wants to void the other 48 states ten amendment by covering other states driver to cover the eight states that do not have income taxes. The Federal tax systems breaks downs for the USA such as Excises taxes 3%, Estate & Gift Taxes 1%, Other 6%, Individual income Taxes 41%, Payroll Taxes 40%, and Corporate income Taxes 9%. (Sources: http://en.wikipedia.org...). Therefore, if the pro sides gets the those eight states to have income tax then the federal government can take that money from the states and give them to all the awful drivers in that countries. The pro side has showed that the working class has to pay all the taxes for insurance premium so that the unemployed, poor and rich people can have insurance premium. I stated from the pro side \"the bus company should pay a higher premium. commercial drivers where the transit is central to the business (taxi, courier, public transit, etc) are statistically more likely to play fast and loose with the rules of the road because their profit margin depends on speed and deadlines - they should pay more than Joe Blo who can come into work a bit late if speeding means he runs the risk of landing in the ditch. people with luxury and high-speed cars are going to rack up higher dollar claims in the event of an accident than a common import or a domestic vehicle so they should pay more.\" These are the working class of the industrialized countries. If the bus companies have to pay higher taxes due to paying for insurance premium then the worker wages will go down due to the bus companies having less profit. This will cause less money for corporate income taxes and this leads to another reason why the pro sides has a personally agenda for personally gains. The pro sides want to bankruptcy these industrialized countries for the wealthy people of the world. If these countries start covering insurance premium for everyone in industrialized countries then will dry up the tax funds because spending will be higher than revenue. This is why he USA is in financial cliff. Spending is higher than revenue. This will only benefit the wealthy people because the government will have to borrow against these rich people. Therefore, your honor, jury members of the industrialized countries and the people of the world, the pro side has proved that their motive for personally gains for theses select groups (awful drivers, unemployed, and wealthy people).",

The proposed tax reform would obviously lower that, for lowering it would not alter the ammount of companies that have reside in the USA or have their assets there or very little so, for the USA coprorate taxes could not rival those of other countries and dependencies such as the British Virgin Islands or Panama beacause lowering the corporate tax to that level would cripple the economy given that the American economy is much larger than that of those places. Lowering the corporate tax to lower rates would not work for these countries would still have the advantage and very few more companies would put their seats there and at the very most this would maintain USA corporate tax revenue the same as it is now. Regarding loopholes, the law should not be corrected beacause that would require changing the whole US tax code. These reforms would take years to pass beacause said text is a very extensive one and it would cause massive political problems in the USA for this would be subject to much disagreement for the two parties and by that time companies will have found loopholes in the new texts and they would have to start over.",

            "discussionTitle": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "conclusion": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "premise": "1. I would argue that limited liability does not have as many economic benefits as usually claimed, and that it is a terrible idea, and should be done away with, but that's a debate for another day. The fact that corporations can deal with lawsuits is not relevant because individual citizens have that same right. However, my opponent is correct that investors (shareholders) can protect themselves from personal bankruptcy and I understand his arguing that they should pay for this protection. My response to this is that no one should be able to dump their debt on society, and also that allowing people to pay their way out of legal responsibility is a questionable moral area that smacks of bribery. 2. \"Individual people are unable to utilize such infrastructure to the overwhelming extent as corporations.\" This is not true. Again, corporations are made up of individual people. If one thousand people are able to do something as a corporation then they can do the same thing when they do not legally register as a corporation. A small business that owns a dump truck places a much smaller burden on roads and bridges than a corporation with 500 dump trucks, but 500 small businesses each with one dump truck is identical to the corporation. 3. \"[corporations] ultimately account for the necessity for additional public infrastructure when construction new shopping centers, manufacturing plants, offices etc.\" I am unaware of any shopping centers, manufacturing plants, or offices that are built for corporations by the government. If this actually occurs then it is a horrendous overreach of government and should be ended immediately. 4. \"Well, this [my claim that public services could receive the same amount of funding at less harm to the economy] is ultimately false. You mentioned previously that as a means of replacing the corporation tax, income taxation on the wealthy should be increased, with supposedly 'less harm to the economy'. But there are a number of issues with this. Firstly, members of the upper class and the upper-middle class are the biggest spenders in the United States.\" MY OPPONENT OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT THE UPPER AND UPPER MIDDLE CLASS ARE ALREADY PAYING THIS AMOUNT OF TAX THROUGH THE CORPORATE TAX. They receive lower dividends because the profits of corporations are heavily taxed by government. Eliminating the corporate tax and replacing it with a higher top MARGINAL income tax rate would cause the upper and upper middle class to receive higher dividends from their investments (including mutual funds) and they would then have to pay higher taxes on these earnings. The net effect could easily be a small positive gain for the upper and upper middle class. Eliminating the corporate tax is appealing not because it necessarily changes the amount of money that people pay in tax, but that it simplifies the tax code. A simpler tax code decreases the amount of time spent on filing taxes. Simpler tax codes are also more difficult to evade. 5. \"What makes the corporate tax more important and thus more preferable to an increase in the income tax is ultimately the need to make such large and powerful groups of collective citizens accountable to the government and for their actions, and ensuring they have collective societal accountability due to the privileges legally granted to them.\" My opponent argued earlier in this round that the point of having corporations was that they would NOT be accountable for their actions, and that this \"carries many economic benefits.\" If these powerful groups of people are to be held accountable for their actions, then the government should stop granting them limited liability. If limited liability is done away with, my opponent's argument is no longer valid. \"By abolishing the corporation tax, what you will find is that tax evasion would be come (sic) increasingly easier. Wealthy individuals would increasingly reclassify their earnings as 'corporate income', and thus escaping income taxation.\" Fortunately, this would not be a problem. Wealthy individuals could classify their income as corporate income all they liked, but under current tax laws as soon as they took that money out to purchase something for themselves, it would be counted as income and subject to income tax. Under current law, they would face felony charges if they were to spend the corporation\"s money on themselves. Thus, tax evasion would not be easier. In fact, it would probably be more difficult because simplifying the tax code would close countless loopholes. \"With finances being funneled from investors in California to the people of North Dakota, through such means of taxation, it is an effective means of spreading the wealth geographically. Without the corporate tax, there would be increase in disparity between the states.\" There are vastly more people in California than North Dakota. We would hope that there would be an enormous wealth disparity between the states. \"and many states would find themselves being exploited for their natural resources, but the wealth returning to people of other states.\" The term \"exploited\"\" is too vague and undefined for me to fully understand what my opponent fears would happen. States that wanted a share of the profit from its natural resources could implement a tax on natural resources. Thank you. Please Vote Pro.",

            "conclusion": "Taxes on the Rich should be Increased",
            "premise": "All my arguments have been dropped. I'd like to point that out for the voters. My opponent hasn't taken any time whatsoever to critically consider my arguments. I'll respond to his nevertheless.First, I'll offer my rebuttals to his first argument. I believe the rich, the top 2 percent as you defined, are already doing their part in society with their tax rate of 40%.Many of them are not paying this rate, as I pointed out earlier -- and rates have dropped substantially for the very affluent in recent years. Considering that the top 10% paid over 70% of the total amount collected in federal income taxes in 2010 [1], I would not be complainingMy opponent is obfuscating, and using this as a way to display his one and only source. This is completely irrelevant. We are talking about the top 2%, not the top 10%. Also, even if we were talking about the top 2% -- who, indeed, pay a fairly high percentage of the federal income tax, though not even close to 70% -- we have to bear in mind that payroll taxes, sales taxes, user fees, property taxes, etc. hurt middle-income and poor people more than they do rich people. State systems are highly regressive, as I pointed out. My opponne thas not responded to that argument. Most of the rich got where they are by hard work. They do not deserve to be taxed more simply because they were more successful in life. The first sentence is a bare-assertion fallacy -- where's your source? Many rich people did get there by hard work, while some got their based on fraud and abuse and cheating the system -- e.g., Wall Street. The second statement is a distortion and a strawman. You cannot point to a time where I said, \"Tax the rich because they've been successful.\" Taxes are not punitive. They are the price we pay for a civilized society, as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. put it. They're part and parcel of the social contract, whereby we all agree to sacrifice a bit of our freedom to collectively invest and provide for people. This statement is also rubbish when we consider that state systems are regressive. You seem to have no problem whatsoever with tax systems that disportionately hit poor people, but cringe at the idea that the rich may need to pay higher rates -- when their rates are lower than they've been historically (another argument you dropped). They do their part as they should. They should not have to pay more just because someone else cannot. That is completely unfair.What's their part? This statement is completely ludicrous and subjective. Many are paying rates lower than they have historically, with many -- Warren Buffett and Mitt Romney as good examples -- paying lower rates than middle-income households. Your second statement is ridiculous. The fact that corporations are getting such large breaks is the exact reason why middle-income and lower-income people have been paying more -- to pick up the tab for the welfare-queen corporations. When Bobby Jindal proposed eliminating the state income tax in Virginia, he wanted to replace it with a regressive sales tax -- thus tossing the burden from the rich to the poor. No, distributing the burden to the already stagnating middle class is unfair. Perpetuating debunked trickle-down lies is unfair. Evading taxes and hiding money in the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes is unfair. Paying a lower tax rate than a middle-income people when you're a multiomillionaire or billionaire is unfair. Politicians lstening to the billionaire Koch Brothers when they should be serving the people -- only because the Koch Brothers are exceptionally large donors -- is unfair. Your argument is unfounded. The wealthy already pay the large majority of taxes, why make them pay for all of it? Majority of what taxes? The federal income tax? They earn a majority of the income -- the top 1% owns 20% of total income, relative to 10% in 1980 -- so of course they're going to pay the \"majority of taxes\" in dollars. Who said anything about making them pay for all of it? That's a complete strawman. Middle-income and poor people pay a diproportionate percentage of their income in regressive payroll and sales taxes et al. After reading your eloquent barrage of information, I hope you do realize that you went off subject sir. The topic was about the rich, individuals, having increased tax rate. You simply cannot compare oranges to apples as you did with individuals to companies. Actually, that's what you did when you mentioned the top 10 percent. Here's what I addressed, all of which you droppped:1. Taxes are already lower than they've been historically, and the income has thrived in times where taxes where high, so there is no sound economic argument for raising taxes.2. Tax cuts do not create jobs. 3. Tax cuts lead to income inequality. 4. Income inequality is hindering the recovery. All of these were on-topic and relevant. That you failed to understand them, and thus did not respond to them, sounds more correct. At a suggested 70% tax rate, by a FRENCH economist, how many of the wealthy Americans would stay in this country? None!Why does it matter at all that Emmanuel Saez is French? Peter Diamond, who co-authored the paper, is American. Even your most insigificant statements are being reduced to rubbish. Also, good job making a completely baseless, unsourced, factually inaccurate statement for which their is no evidence. I'd provided you plenty of data saying otherwise -- data saying the top marginal income tax rate could be significantly higher than it is now, and it turns out, people would still want to continue to produce and procure wealth. The \"peak of the Laffer curve,\" as the piece from Fieldhouse points out, ranges from about 73% to 80% depending on whose research you follow. The point is, there is no evidence for your argument whatsoever, nor have you provided the slightest modicum of sourcing or critical thinking. You have gone off subject many times. From income inequality to company tax breaks, it has nothing to do with increased tax rates on rich American individuals and their families. This is complete rubbish, as I already pointed out. I felt when reading your opening arguments that it sounded like a typical episode of MSNBC Evening News.And reading your arguments sounded like a typical episode of Fox News. Hey, at least my statements included facts and analysis. I wish opponent good luck.Same to you! P.S. April 15th is just around the corner. Cool beans. Conclusion: My opponent does not have a single credible argument on the table. I have eviscerated his arguments point by point and reduced them to utter rubbish. Vote Pro.",

            "discussionTitle": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "conclusion": "Corporate Tax Should be Abolished",
            "premise": "I shall now refute a number of my opponents arguments and make a number of other points which I missed earlier. (1)\"First, one foolish policy does not justify another, so if corporate personhood is a foolish policy, and it is the justification for corporate tax, the solution is not to keep both, but to get rid of both.\" Again, on the issue of corporate personhood, what you fail to take into consideration is an important aspect of corporatism, limited liability. This is a fundamental aspect of a corporation's legal structure in order to protect investors and shareholders. However, because a corporation has such an inalienable right, it must have some means of social accountability. Because corporations can as a collective deal with lawsuits, and allow shareholders to dump debt on to society when they are unable to account for their own. I'm not suggesting this is a foolish policy because it carries many economic benefits, but corporations must pay for such a privilege and be accountable to society as a COLLECTIVE. (2) \"It makes sense that a corporation would have the right to \"use\" the roads, because what this means is that the owners of a corporation have the right to employ somebody to use the roads. Since all the owners of the corporation and the employees all have the right to use the roads, it makes sense that they still have this right when they call their arrangement a \"corporation\".\" Certainly individuals have such rights to use the roads and infrastructure provided by tax payers, however what this argument doesn't take into account is the additional burden placed on such infrastructure and government works by corporate and/or industrial operations. Individual people are unable to utilize such infrastructure to the overwhelming extent as corporations. Corporate entities increase the number of heavy transportation vehicles, more significantly contribute to environmental impact (practically entirely), utilize government services more strenuously and ultimately account for the necessity for additional public infrastructure when construction new shopping centers, manufacturing plants, offices etc. Ultimately, the individual corporation accounts for an increase in the need for localized government expenditure, therefore it is logical to require the corporation, rather than individuals from elsewhere, to pay for such a project. This similarly takes place in State and Local jurisdictions through income tax, with regard to education and infrastructure among many other practical government works, so that the local government is using local taxation revenue to provide local services. Ultimately, individuals are unable to account for the overwhelming usage of government works as a large, collective organisation, of which should as a whole be taxed for such use. (3) \"To summarize, all of the public services currently funded by the corporate tax could receive the EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING, AT LESS HARM TO THE ECONOMY, if the corporate tax were abolished and replaced with a better method of raising revenue.\" Well, this is ultimately false. You mentioned previously that as a means of replacing the corporation tax, income taxation on the wealthy should be increased, with supposedly 'less harm to the economy'. But there are a number of issues with this. Firstly, members of the upper class and the upper-middle class are the biggest spenders in the United States. To increase income tax on these classes would thwart spending in retail, on housing and other goods and services, which would ultimately damage the economy equally or to a greater extent than a corporate tax. It's a logical fallacy to assume that removing the corporate tax would 'have less harm to economy' if replaced by an income tax, because in terms of the fiscal side of things, it would carry similar consequences to the economy and raise a similar amount of revenue. What makes the corporate tax more important and thus more preferable to an increase in the income tax is ultimately the need to make such large and powerful groups of collective citizens accountable to the government and for their actions, and ensuring they have collective societal accountability due to the privileges legally granted to them. By abolishing the corporation tax, what you will find is that tax evasion would be come increasingly easier. Wealthy individuals would increasingly reclassify their earnings as 'corporate income', and thus escaping income taxation (of which you propose to increase). Such a process would be unbelievably easy considering our current tax code, and ultimately profits would be able to be shifted offshore and through tax escape strategies, of which modern businesses today excel at. While it is a very much circumstantial argument, thousands of businesses and individuals devote a substantial amount of time and effort to seek out ways to pay less tax, and the removal of the corporate tax will tax evasion much easier. You will find also, that corporate taxation works as an effective means of dispersing the wealth of corporate ventures more effectively. If a corporation were to commence operations in Zambia, a corporate tax would funnel revenue into the Zambian government from the bank accounts of investors in the United States. Likewise, such a process takes place throughout US states with corporate taxes run by the states. With finances being funneled from investors in California to the people of North Dakota, through such means of taxation, it is an effective means of spreading the wealth geographically. Without the corporate tax, there would be increase in disparity between the states, and many states would find themselves being exploited for their natural resources, but the wealth returning to people of other states. That's simply not fair, and yet another reason why corporate tax should not go.",

            "premise": "In your last argument, you're only really acknowledging the fact that the Negative Income Tax is a flat tax rate; you're failing to address the fact that the fixed government payment component covers the poor; anyone earning under a certain amount essentially pays no taxes. Ultimately, the effects of the Negative Income Tax are equivalent to the desired effects of a progressive tax system, except more effective. The example of the exuberant aristocrats you give is sort of an incoherent argument, even as an analogy. The Negative Income Tax does not subsidize the rich at the hands of the poor. Remember, the poor under such a system essentially pay no taxes. You say \"since rich people really, really hate paying taxes and can afford to hire expert accountants to help them avoid paying them, the IRS is the one department that needs to be expanded not downsized.\" First of all, I hope that by saying that the rich \"avoid\" paying taxes, you're attempting to say that they do everything they can to get massive deductions. A can't imagine really anyone managing to avoid paying ALL their taxes. But the point is this: the IRS is the very thing that allows the rich (or anyone, for that matter), to reduce the taxes they pay. The reason there are so many opportunities to receive deductions is because the system is so complicated that it allows for loopholes. A flat tax rate would ensure that there's no way to get around paying full taxation. The paragraph in which you distinguish between income and property taxes doesn't really help or hurt either of us. The debate is about income taxes. Nowhere did I state anything about how property taxes should be distributed, and I most certainly didn't suggest that the rich deserve lower property taxes. You then proceed to say the following: \"Finally, the minimum wage was introduced to defend vulnerable workers from greedy, exploitative employers and should be kept. At the end of the day, the US or the UK could abolish the minimum wage but, in the global economy in which we all now operate, American or British factory workers couldn't possibly compete with workers doing the same jobs in China or India. I mean, could you bring up a family on a dollar a day if you live in Europe or America? I don't think so.\" The Negative Income Tax would ensure that workers aren't exploited, as I've already explained. As far as China and India, you do realize that the reason they're doing so well is almost entirely BECAUSE of US minimum wage laws, don't you? Minimum wage has caused the outsourcing of most industrial jobs. The Negative Income Tax would do away with this, and all that would have to be done to prevent insourcing of jobs would be to tighten border security. The rest would work itself out, since illegal immigrants would not be eligible for government grants.",

            "conclusion": "Progressive Income Tax",
            "premise": "Thank you Jimtimmy for your response. I will mostly post rebuttals and closing for this round. A Fair Tax System The progressive tax is the most fair income tax method. This is because of a few reasons: 1) Improves Standard of Living Much of this I covered last round. Infrastructure can be invested in on larger scales. Plus, it reduces the income inequality in a nation, which has numerous health benefits for all! [1] 2) Rich gives back to Society that made them rich Bill Gates Sr., the father of the richest guy in the world, pointed out why a progressive tax was the better option (than not having it). He said that,\" Bill Gates didn't invent the Internet. [He] just used it -- to make billions. There is no such thing as a self-made man. Every businessman has used the vast American infrastructure, which the taxpayers paid for, to make his money. He did not make his money along. He used taxpayer infrastructure, [which included] the banking system, Federal Reserve, etc. These taxpayer investments support companies and wealthy investors. There are no self-made men! They owe the taxpayers of this country back a great deal and should be paying it back.\" [2] Remember, the father of Bill Gates said this. If you disagree with the rich on how they got rich, I seriously question your sense of logic. 3) Allows the less well off to stimulate the economy The progressive tax allows the middle and lower classes to consume more, which they do because of the economic theory of the Average Propensity to Consume - which people with less money tend to spend more of it than save. Consumption fuels 70% of our nation's economy, so a P.Tax benefits the economy in this way. [3] 4) Is the most proportional, the Flat Tax is regressive My opponent is against the progressive income tax (PIT), so he must be for the flat tax. A pure flat tax is inherently regressive, and let's less money in the economy in consumption, and reduces the burden of the already rich wealthy, who help fund this nation's infrastructure. The flat tax is purely regressive because the poor, who spend much of their money, and have little to none left over, would pay the same as the rich, who have much left over. The poor, who get much of their money, would get taxed higher than the rich. The rich pay lower rates in taxes usually than the poor because of Capital Gains and Dividends taxation, but there are exceptions. [4] [5] Economic Affects of Progressive Taxation You said that nations with a flat tax are better economically. The link was only a paragraph long, with no evidence. On the contrary, a progressive tax improves the economy. With progressive taxes, the only way to retain the bulk of the wealth created by a business is by reinvesting it in the business -- in plants, equipment, staff, research and development, new products and all the rest. Low taxes produce great excesses of negative activity as well. There is a propensity in business, and as a nation, to hollow out our businesses, and mortgage and sell off our assets, in order to grab short-term profits, which leads to downsizing, which is disastrous for local economies. So, progressive taxes help the economy by stimlulating consumption, but reduce the motive to gain short-term profits, and instead focus on long term growth. [6] Investment fueling economic growth There is no correlation between Capital Gains and Dividend taxes that lower rates = better economy. [7] [8] [9] Investment is needed. However, this is not going to depend really on tax rates unless they are really high. Investment was still high in the 1990s with a nearly 40% top tax rate. However, you also need: A strong infrastructure to maximize your return You need consumption to make your investment worth it You need to be competitive against Big Business The progressive income tax best provides these tools. With a progressive tax, the less-well off, such as small businesses, can still easily invest in expanding capacity. They are more competitive against big businesses too. Big business will not expand when they suddenly get a hundred million dollars. Big business expands with more demand, not more money. So, a flat tax system would reduce the opportunity of small business to compete, so your argument is refuted. Plus, my progressive tax system proposal is still not that tough on the ultrarich, unless you make billions a year. About marginal tax rates and incentive to work Basic economics says that in a competitive economy, the contribution any individual (or for that matter any factor of production) makes to the economy at the margin is what that individual earns \u2014 period. What a worker contributes to GDP with an additional hour of work is that worker\u2019s hourly wage, whether that hourly wage is $6 or $60,000 an hour. This in turn means that the effect on everyone else\u2019s income if a worker chooses to work one hour less is precisely zero. [10] More Government Revenue Tax cuts will not bring in more revenue. When the Bush Tax Cuts were implemented, the CBO estimated that it reduced 10 year revenue by at least $2.9 trillion over 10 years. Your low taxes = higher revenue is refuted as well. [11] Conclusion: My opponent has failed to provide a real case against the progressive income tax like I have suggested. The progressive tax improves opportunity for people to climb the economic ladder, for small businesses to compete with larger businesses, and the P.I.T. improves investment by small business by allowing them to expand. Income inequality is reduced compared to a flat tax, and the P.I.T. therefore improves public health. With a progressive tax, infrastructure in a nation can be improved, which leads to a healthier economic environment. It is also more fair since the rich got rich from the taxpayers. There is no evidence that by giving the wealthy tax cuts (such as with a non-P.I.T. system), that the economy improves. No evidence. I also include a video I strongly urge you to watch. Thank you, VOTE PRO!Also Jimtimmy: I challenge you to compare the GNP with the rate of taxation over the last fifty years-- for example the boom years of the '50s with their 90% marginal tax rate-- and explain that high tax rates discourage investment until you can do it with a straight face. http://www.youtube.com...

After sales, consumption, income, property, and corporate taxes businesses would barely have enough for salary or profit (if any). The result would be a decrease in spending which can be a precursor for recession. The recession is based on the health of the economy by how much people buy or sell, and the law of demand states that even the slightest price increase can lead to significant results. Another result would be high unemployment, because different companies have to pay their workers on top of these taxes which they sometimes find hard to do. Some people might think that the people already working there would just be paid more, well it depends. Most trustworthy and intelligent managers would hire more labor instead of investing more in what they already have. Given these facts, I think that taxes should be lowered overall for businesses so that they can hire more labor, get more resources, and supply better qualities of the product. https://en.wikipedia.org... https://en.wikipedia.org... http://taxfoundation.org...",

            "conclusion": "Raise Taxes on the top 1 percent of income earners",
            "premise": "Thank you to CON for accepting this debate. First, I would like to lay out the criteria by which I will fulfill my burden. I will articulate the facts of my case and demonstrate how it fulfills these three criteria in the later rounds due to space constraints. 1. Utilitarianism Utilitarianism is \"the belief that a morally good action is one that helps the greatest number of people\" (1). I will be arguing that raising taxes on the top 1 percent of Americans will provide the maximal good to the vast majority of the country. 2. Fairness I will be making the case that it simply isn\"t fair that so much wealth and influence has been amassed by the top 1 percent of Americans, and a more equitable distribution of wealth, as we had in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, would be preferable. 3. Economic Sense This criterion will be the crux of my case. I will argue that not only is income and wealth inequality both unfair and immoral, but economically toxic. Therefore, it is in our economic interest to reduce it, one way of which is to raise taxes. C1) The Tax Cut Deception We\"ve been told that we must cut taxes for the \"most productive\" because they are the ones who create the jobs. This, however, is a bold-faced lie. There is a wide body of academic research demonstrating that this is false. S1) Tax Cuts Don\"t Work I will first point out a paper from the Congressional Research Service, examining tax rates since 1945,which proves my point. Note the conclusion: \"The results of the analysis in this report suggest that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth. The reduction in the top statutory tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment, and productivity growth.\" (2) The conclusion has been echoed in several other papers. Note this paper from Andrew Fieldhouse: \"Analysis of top tax rate changes since World War II show that higher rates have no statistically significant impact on factors driving economic growth\"private saving, investment levels, labor participation rates, and labor productivity\"nor on overall economic growth rates.\" (3) Fieldhouse provided some further insight, giving us an idea of what the tax rates would need to be for there to be any negative ramifications for economic growth: \"Recent research implies a revenue-maximizing top effective federal income tax rate of roughly 68.7 percent. This is nearly twice the top 35 percent effective ordinary income tax rate that prevailed at the end of 2012, and 27.5 percentage points higher than the 41.2 percent rate in 2012. This would mean a top statutory income tax rate of 66.1 percent, 26.5 percentage points above the prevailing 39.6 percent top statutory rate.\" (3) As he explains, tax rates could be much higher then they are today, and the economy would continue to grow. Fieldhouse draws largely on Diamond and Says, who weigh in on what the optimal tax rates would be: \"[T]he optimal top tax rate using the current taxable income base..would be `4;* = 1/(1 1.5. \" 0.57). = 54 percent, while the optimal tax rate using a broader income base with no deductions would be `4; * = 1/(1 1.5. \" 0.17). = 80 percent. Taking as fixed state and payroll tax rates, such rates correspond to top federal income tax rates equal to 48 percent and 76 percent, respectively.\" (4) Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has also weighed: \"During periods when the very rich took home a larger proportion \" as between 1918 and 1933, and in the Great Regression from 1981 to the present day \" growth slowed, median wages stagnated and we suffered giant downturns. It\"s no mere coincidence that over the last century the top earners\" share of the nation\"s total income peaked in 1928 and 2007 \" the two years just preceding the biggest downturns.\" (5) As we can see, there is no reason to believe that cutting taxes is at all economically beneficial. S2) Historical Precedent Let's review this graph from Business Insider shedding light on what the historical precedent of statutory tax rates in this country (6): Of course, it would be remiss to not to key on, also, on effective tax rates: As we can see, effective as well as marginal tax rates on the affluent have been falling. In fact, they have never been as low as they are now at any time in the post-WWII era. Why, then, must we have more tax cuts? If they haven't worked before, and aren't working now, why must we buy into the myth that we must again pursue them? In fact, tax rates from 1945 to 1980 never fell below 70 percent, and were in fact as high as 92 percent, and yet the economy boomed. How can that be the case if we are to slash tax rates in order to generate prosperity? The claim is a flat-out lie. S3) Impact on Economic Inequality Now that we understand the precedent of tax rates, let's review these rates in context: How about we examine relative changes in wealth distribution from about the 1980s onward? This is a graph from the Stanford Center on Poverty and inequality: As we can see, right around the Reagan revolution, the very affluent began to do extremely well, whereas others began to do progressively worse. For instance, productivity has increased 80 percent from 1979 to 2009, but median wages have been nearly flat and in fact have fallen since the crisis according the U.S. Census Bureau. Since the recovery of 2009, 95 of income gains went to the top 1 percent. The Fieldhouse paper, the paper by Diamond and Saez, the paper by the CRS and much more attribute tax cuts to inequality. A large reason for this, as Thomas Pikkety has written about, is that capital income has been concentrated at the top, allowing the very affluent not only to escape taxation -- since capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than annual income -- and accumulate wealth much faster than people who spend almost everything they earn (i.e., poor people). Examine the following graph (8): What this shows us it that in recent years capital income -- rates for which have been slashes significantly over the past 15 years, and which has long been taxed at lower rates than earned income (why, for instance, Mitt Romney only paid about a 14 percent tax rate) -- has been increasingly concentrated at the top of the income spectrum. Pressman elucidates Pikketty's case as to why this is a problem and why we should care (9): \"Piketty makes the case that inequality tends to rise in developed capitalist economies as a result of three empirical facts. First, a slow annual growth rate (1 percent, maybe close to 2 percent). Second, returns on wealth of around 5 percent per year (as has existed over long stretches of history). And third, the fact that the distribution of wealth is more concentrated than the distribution of income. This being the case, it follows that those with lots of wealth will see (on average) their annual gains (or their income) rise around 5 percent each year, while those without much wealth will see their incomes (on average) grow only 1 percent or so annually (the growth rate of the economy). Income inequality rises as does wealth inequality.\" There's much more to the argument, however. Income inequality is the United States is far worse than the vast majority of developed countries, worse only than Chile, Mexico, and Turkey, according to a 2013 report by the OECD (10). Examine the following graph: Let's examine these figures in context, though. How does this relate to tax rates? Simple. Examine the following graph (11), also from the OECD: The only two countries with lower tax burdens -- note that these are a representation of tax revenues as a percentage of GDP than the US are Chile and Mexico; note that that Turkey's tax burden is only half a percentage point above the United States. Andrea Louise Campbell writes the following: \"Compared with other developed countries, the United States has very low taxes, little redistribution of income, and an extraordinarily complex tax code\" (11). Now, why should we care about this? There certainly are moral arguments, and appeal to Rawlsian ethics or utilitarianism could conceivably balance out my case. However, there are broader problems: we're all worse off collectively due to income inequality. As the following graph demonstrates, there is a negative correlation between income inequality and GDP per capita (12): Why is this so? Nobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz explains (13). He argues that it hinders tax receipts, the middle class's ability to spend to restore economic recovery, stifles innovation by promoting asymmetries as it pertains to educational attainment, and it is consistent with more frequent boom-and-bust cycles. For the final point, he noted that income inequality wasn't as bad as it is today since the 1920s, which culminated in the Great Depression. I'm now out of character space. Back to CON.

            "premise": "\"If the intention of this debate was to prove that a known cause leads to a known effect, you are simply lacking critical thinking. Critical thinking employs good judgment, context, and competency in making a decision (in this case, whether or not we should have progressive taxation) - especially a decision which huge implications that concerns the economy. Critical thinking takes into account not only efficiency, but equity and morality as well. Is it efficient to kill every murderer that is guilty after being convicted so we dont have to house them in jail? yes. Is it moral? No. Also, it is not up to you to declare who has already won the debate - it is up to the voters.\" Critical thinking was never supposed to be part of this debate. I am arguing economic growth and government revenue only. Never was equity or morality supposed to be part of this debate at all and that's the bottom line. If I wanted to to debate if raising taxes wasn't moral, I would debate that and NEVER were we debating progressive taxation vs. a flat tax. This is only on taxes and the rich. \"Equity: I am talking about income taxes. Who starts a corporation? A person at one point who starts the business. How do they start this business? With an income. The income he uses to start the business is separate from the corporate tax rate. People who are born into rich families inherit a monetary. Also, I see that your shallow reply to my key points show that you don't understand the concept at all.\" Lets get back to your original argument: \"Company \"A\" is a small business. They make $10,000 a month. They are taxed at 10% and are left with $9,000. Let's say they reinvest half of the profits (which is what business do) back into their business to expand it. They grow at a rate that $4,500 worth of capital will allow. Now, let's take a look at company \"B\" a very large business. They make $50,000,000 a month. They are taxed at 10% and are left with $45,000,000 and reinvest half of the profits (just like the small business does) back into their business to expand it......\" Your are clearly here talking about corporate taxes, not income taxes. You go on about monopoly, but that's also strictly business and does not focus on the individual, economic growth, or government revenue. This argument fails because this is not what were taking about. \"This one is actually quite simple. You could make the moral argument that you believe it is unfair to tax a large corporation more than a small one, but then you have to take into consideration of fairness to the middle-class, not just to the large corporation. If Joe makes $1,000 a month and pays a flat-tax of 10% and he is left with $900, then where is the fairness in taxing the large corporation the same amount, but keeping $45,000,000? A flat-tax harms the middle to poor class more than anyone, because they still need to buy groceries, food, gas, and other essentials but proportionally, have significantly less income to do it and less taxation means that those in poverty have less tax-funded assistance to help them pay for those essentials.\" That's your moral argument. Now: \"Moral reason: there is a moral implication involved in tax rates. Let me set an extreme example for you: Everyone gets taxed at 99% of their income. Would this be moral? No. Who would be able to survive? The richest 1% would still be able to buy basic necessities but neither the middle or lower class would. This is the same fundamental concept of morality in the income tax rate: Those who earn millions, should pay more in taxes than someone that lives in poverty. To say morality doesn't apply to the income tax rate is simply wrong.\" Morality was never part of this debate. We're arguing economic growth and government revenue. Obviously with a 99% income tax there would be little economic growth. However, lower taxes does create income mobility and economic growth, I have proven that. Finally, on China and environmental issues these still do little with overall taxes in the United States. I said lowering taxes would be a good idea, but I never said where the tax revenue had to go. Conclusion The voters know what we were exactly supposed to debate and my opponent did not refute my arguments. He also focused in two issues not involved with economic growth and revenue. That's one point against conduct. The other point against conduct falls n the fact that he was not supposed to give opening arguments in the first round. Arguments and conduct to me.",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for starting the debate today. I will be arguing the benefits of the FairTax, as presented by FairTax.org and Representative John Linder of the United States Congress. Contention 1: The FairTax will work to repatriate American businesses. The United States of America has damaged the expansion opportunities of businesses in the United States. For decades, we have held a 35% corporate income, 2nd only to that of Japan. The simple fact of the matter is, we cannot be a pro- business nation with an outrageously high corporate income tax. Our corporate income tax has unfortunately driven many corporations to outsource crucial manufacturing sectors, taking thousands of jobs from the economy and removing federal revenue. It's time that the United States adopts a more pro-business tax policy. The solution lies in the FairTax. The FairTax would remove all existing corporate income taxes, allowing businesses to return to the United States of America. It is internationally recognized that the United States has some of the most productive workers in the world and corporate executives realize this. It is time to bring American businesses back to American shores, and that is exactly what the FairTax will do. Contention 2: The FairTax will increase transparency. The United States of America has long been a nation that enjoys being \"short and sweet\". Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address only contained 272 words, the Constitution, only 4258 words, but the tax code of our nation contains in excess more than 9,000,000 words. The core of this debate revolves the more desirable tax code. Transparency in taxation is a fundamental characteristic of any tax code and my opponent must prove our current tax code is just as transparent as the FairTax. The FairTax Act, as introduced by Rep. John Linder, is only 132 pages long, short enough for any American to read. The current code is more than 60,000 pages long and is quite complex. By transitioning to the FairTax, our nation's tax code will become more transparent and understandable to the everyday American citizen. Contention 3: The FairTax will remove unnecessary compliance costs of the current tax code. According to John Linder of Georgia, the citizens of the United States of America spend in excess of 200 billion USD per year to simply comply with current tax code regulations. This cost is made up of hiring tax attourneys, buying applications to do your taxes for you, and the like. These compliance costs could be cut down considerably by enacting the FairTax. The FairTax return form is a single sheet instead of the complex assortment of papers of our current system. In conclusion, because the FairTax will work to repatriate American businesses, and because the FairTax will increase taxation transparency, and because the FairTax removes unnecessary compliance costs, I must affirm the FairTax.",

            "conclusion": "High Tax Rates Hurt the Economy",
            "premise": "I'd like to thank my opponent for opening his substantive contentions. First I will address his, then introduce my own. In terms of the setting of this debate, I think it should be applied to every country, not just the USA, because every country faces the trade off of high and low taxation.Pro 1. Reduced reward means less productivityThis argument presupposes that earning less money reduces reward. Money itself, however, has no intrinsic value. The only value of money is in the denomination. Therefore, it is not money that gives people utility, but the standard of living associated with that money. Government expenditure, the quality of the environment, the crime rate, interest rates (which affect investment) and numerous other factors can alter my standard of living. As I will shortly prove, these other means are more effective at improving standard of living than private expenditure, and they are all improved through taxation. Exactly the same counter-argument is true for capital taxes.My opponent cites Edward Prescott's study as evidence for this. Virtually every other economist agrees that the major source of US growth recently has not been low taxes but high debt [4]. The periods examined by Prescott are very selective. The biggest growth the US ever had was during the 1950s-60s, when tax rates for the top tax bracket were about 91%, the biggest slump was during the 1920s when the rate was only about 25% [5]. If he had looked at these periods relative to other countries, he would have seen quite a different picture. The first period he chose, 1970\u201374, was when the US was mounting debt before the crash of the early 80s. The second was the early years of the Clinton administration, years marred by \"the massive deficit and the problem of government spending\" [6]. Europe had much less debt during these periods and that's why this study is misleading. That tax rates corresponded to productivity during these periods was the product of bad decision making, not effective economics.He then cites the \"numerous studies\" that show a link between tax rates and investment. \"Investment\" in economics has a very precise meaning. It generally means money given by the private sector (including households) to companies from their savings. It does not include government spending. When I give $10 to a company and the government gives $10 to a company, the effect on the economy is the same but the effect on investment is very different. When tax rates increase, investment might go down, but government spending goes up, so there is a neutral effect on the economy.Finally he makes precisely the same claim, again citing his \"numerous studies,\" this time for tax rates and growth. The problem is that almost all of the studies found only a small, modest correlation, and that was almost entirely due to the same dataset that Prescott studied. The other datasets often did not fit with their conclusions at all, and even contradicted them. They also only measure the cost of taking the money into the hands of the government, not the benefit of the reallocation of wealth. Engen and Skinner, for example, admitted in their conclusion \"beneficial government expenditures may yield a net improvement in the ... economy,\" before going on to prove government spending has empirically raised growth in some cases - their conclusion was the taxation itself had no effect on the economy, but rather what mattered was how it was spent.Pro 2. Incentive for tax evasionActivities that fall under the radar of taxation are called the \"shadow economy.\" Uruguay has a lowish personal income tax rate of 0\u201325% [1], and their shadow economy is 51% of their GNP [2]. The USA's rate is higher, at 0-35% plus up to 10.55% state taxes [1], yet their shadow economy is only 8% of their GNP [2]. Lower taxes, therefore, does not mean less tax evasion. What really causes tax evasion is how much people trust their government, as has been shown empirically on numerous occasions [3]. What better way to lose the faith of your citizens than to be underfunded and unable to carry out the big projects they demand? To build trust you need a strong police force, you need a strong education system, you need strong social security, not to mention a strong healthcare service. The money for all these things needs to come from somewhere.Pro 3. EmigrationLook at the status quo. In the Bahamas there is no tax [1], yet not everyone emigrates to the Bahamas. People are obviously motivated to stay in certain countries by more than just the tax rate. The same thing is true of companies. The tax rate is irrelevant if the country isn't going to be profitable, and if it's profitable the company has another incentive to expand there.Now on to my points:Con 1. Govt makes better decisionsUnlike private households and the vast majority of businesses, governments are advised by a panel of experts as to what sectors of the economy merit investment. They are in the unique position of being able to have access to as much information as possible about the state of their own country, as well as a duty to provide the greatest return to everybody, not just their \"shareholders\" or family, possibly at the expense of others. It makes sense that this group should be allowed to direct investment to areas which will provide long-term prosperity. Good investment by government contributes more to growth than bad investment by individuals. Individuals are much more likely to get it wrong because all they look for is a monetary return.Con 2. EquityGovernment spending increases equity because much of it goes to the poor, as opposed to investment which largely goes to the wealthy. The largest impact of tax cuts is on the wealthy, particulary as my opponent appears to argue against progressive tax in particular. This is bad because it's actually a distortion - the poor often work at the expense of the wealthy. Capitalism automatically feeds wealth to leaders, even though leaders often don't work hard to get to the top. Inequality, social injustice, and poverty are the results. This was exactly what happened in Brazil [7]. In China the government recently admitted taxes were one of the reasons why so many Chinese live in poverty, and adjusted its tax rates as a result [8]. It happened twice in the USA - once in the 1890s and once between the 1970s and late 2000s (under the influence of the supply-side model). In both cases, real wages fell sharply.Con 3. Govt more efficientWhile all governments have their fair share of bureaucrats, so do the big firms. The difference is that they don't need to advertise, pay corporate salaries, keep profits rolling, plus they achieve the greatest possible economies of scale. For all these reasons governments are likely to not only do the right job, but do it better than corporates. That is, if corporates do it at all (*cough* Bolivia's water supply *cough*).Con 4. Govt investments more likely to bolster external sources of standard of livingThe title says it all. The government is more likely to keep the streets safe, build free parks, look after nature reserves, and so on, than private firms, because these activities do not generate income. These improve the quality of people's lives in other ways and can have massive positive benefits to productivity.The moot falls.Sources1. http://en.wikipedia.org...2. http://aysps.gsu.edu..., pg 213. http://www.bsos.umd.edu...4. http://www.thenewfederalist.eu...5. http://www.businessinsider.com...6. http://en.wikipedia.org...7. http://www.infosurhoy.com...8. http://www.biznewschina.com...",

            "conclusion": "Corporate greed is more harmful than taxes collected by the government",
            "premise": "\"\"Corporate Greed\" to me is the \"most toys\" mentality that people wish to be much better off than having to worry about affording a place to live, food, etc.\" And, they shouldn't be much better off than that? If corporations could magically \"sex up\" such cars, they'd \"sex up\" transportation via cardboard box-- low costs, therefore higher profits for them if they pull it off. Yet they haven't. People like high horsepower vehicles on their own. At best, a company can convince a customer that THEIR high horsepower vehicle is better than the competitor's. It cannot omnipotentrly convince them which sort of vehicle is best for their needs. \"The basic necessities of life are all owned by corporations,\" They are PRODUCED by corporations. But they stop being owned by them when sold. This is, again, points in favor of the corporation-- the only reason you buy from the corporation instead of anything else is that the corporation does a better job producing it. All of the things you mentioned, except such advanced things as cars which only result from corporate greed, are things you can attain in other ways-- but not as well. This is because corporate greed is BETTER at providing them. \"completely out of democratic control\" Not entirely true, unfortunately the mob manages to pass all too many regulations with those tax monies of yours. But to the extent it is out of democratic control, yay. It replaces it with control by RIGHT- control of everything by the one who created it until he chooses to sell it. This is superior to the advance auction of stolen goods by whoever can steal them which is an election. \"and the moment the CEOs determine that you are not a profitable sector of the economy to keep making their products affordable to you (or by contrast, that the loss of quality their products would endure by dumping your job for overseas slave labor).\" Corporations do not enslave overseas labor. They hire overseas labor that was starving due to an insufficient amount of corporate greed being allowed in their countries, using their size to threaten local tyrants into allowing them to provide the things people need by trading it for those people's labor, saving millions of lives by the simple act of trying to make a profit. To the extent the people in question are \"slaves,\" this is the fault of governments. \" Compare Medicare to private HMOs. Medicare offers significant bang-for-buck efficiency in terms of revenues it collects from payroll taxes to what it doles out for actual medical services, and in addition HMOs actually have people hired strictly to refuse to pay for critical services for their customers in dire need of medical attention using very flimsy excuses\" There is no such thing as a \"private HMO\" in today's world. The \"private\" health sector is CRIPPLED by government regulations. Taxes go into DESTROYING the values it could have created. http://www.theobjectivestandard.com... Furthermore, you're measuring efficiency improperly. The proper measure of efficiency would be whether the people whose money is being spent value the health services in question more, or what they would have otherwise bought-- and there is no question there :). If you wish to find HMO's that refuse fewer claims, pay for a better contract. It's that simple. \"You've now had a 100% loss of income. Now tell me, which is the greater harm that impacts your life more, in the above scenarios: the 50% increase in tax or the 100% cut in income?\" Things like the 100% cut in income are CAUSED by the tax money, and the regulations it's spent on. Without tax increases, employers can employ more, and there are fewer regulations that can be bought by tax money to make you less employable. In a free market, even if somehow outsourcing were possible, you'd just find a job slightly down the wage curve-- and the loss would be efficiently minimized :)",

Big business never goes unrivaled. There is always competition in a vast and large marketplace. Subsidies are not good because that is crony capitalism. Also, remember that WE want businesses here for our own county and for our own economy. We want to eliminate deductions and put in a lower rate because businesses want higher profits, not lower ones. By creating business friendly environment in the USA we fix that problem. I have already sourced how it would be good for the government and the economy, so I have the facts out there.

Forbes doesn't just like a flat tax cause he will pay less, but because the economy does better. The rich get richer the better the economy gets. Of course poor people are going to vote for sanders. They want free stuff. That's a conflict of interest. (See how silly that sounds). About the IRS. Everyone hates the tax code, and the IRS. We abolish the IRS, and current tax code and replace it with something people actually understand. It will take 5 minuets to file taxes. Yes, ultra rich tax businesses and Lawyers will be out of the job. Wait... that's what you want right? No super rich people. You also said your for a tax code reform. As to knowing about people paying taxes, there will be an office in the treasury department in charge of taxes. It's easy to look at a name of a US citizen, pull up their 1 piece of paper taxes and file it. If someone refuses to pay, they get punished. Your idea of taxing the rich and giving the money to the poor and middle class to create a good economy is great in theory, but wrong in reality. Bernie wants a 50% tax on the rich. Bernie will also eliminate loopholes and stuff. Please stop using bernie's plan with things today. It doesn't help the debate, and is pointless. I know most countries are more socialist then the US, with Bernie's policies of a 50% rate, the US becomes more socialist the countries like the UK, where a 45% income tax rate occors. https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk... . And the UK tried a 50% tax rate. My guess is they didn't like it, cause it went to a 45% rate a few years ago. So you're in favor of a plan that doesn't work? Strange. Now when the US pit's a higher tax rate on, along with restricting businesses, and making minimum wages 2x what they are now, where another country has a lower tax rate, with a way less minimum wage. Which would a rich guy with a business choose? Not the US. What I'm going to say next, I don't mean to offend any low wage job people who contribute to society. We need jobs at all levels for america to succeed. So you say how rich people don't contribute like a poorer person does. Now a rich person buys more stuff, and pays way more in taxes. Also how would america be without guys like Steve Jobs and bill gates? Very smart people who make billion dollor deals are needed. A average guy couldn't run a billion dollor business. I agree with you when you say the rich deserve 2 rewards for working super haRd and being smart, I don't thing they should get tax breaks. A fair flat tax doesn't have tax breaks for the rich. Bernie's plan makes america undesirable for rich people, and has no incentive to work. Without workers and businesses and rich people there can't be a good economy.

            "premise": "\"This debate was over if raising taxes on the rich would create more economic growth and more revenue, so my opponent has basically lost this debate.\" If the intention of this debate was to prove that a known cause leads to a known effect, you are simply lacking critical thinking. Critical thinking employs good judgment, context, and competency in making a decision (in this case, whether or not we should have progressive taxation) - especially a decision which huge implications that concerns the economy. Critical thinking takes into account not only efficiency, but equity and morality as well. Is it efficient to kill every murderer that is guilty after being convicted so we dont have to house them in jail? yes. Is it moral? No. Also, it is not up to you to declare who has already won the debate - it is up to the voters. Equity: I am talking about income taxes. Who starts a corporation? A person at one point who starts the business. How do they start this business? With an income. The income he uses to start the business is separate from the corporate tax rate. People who are born into rich families inherit a monetary. Also, I see that your shallow reply to my key points show that you don't understand the concept at all. Moral reason: there is a moral implication involved in tax rates. Let me set an extreme example for you: Everyone gets taxed at 99% of their income. Would this be moral? No. Who would be able to survive? The richest 1% would still be able to buy basic necessities but neither the middle or lower class would. This is the same fundamental concept of morality in the income tax rate: Those who earn millions, should pay more in taxes than someone that lives in poverty. To say morality doesn't apply to the income tax rate is simply wrong. The point in mentioning the China example is that they were using capitalism focusing solely on economic growth (as you do) and it created numerous problems for the well-being of those living in China so it also would in America. Well-being is the central focus here: just because lowering taxes on the rich would spur economic growth, doesn't mean it's in the best interest of the majority of people within that economy. The point in mentioning the environment, is that it is simply an exploitable resource in the eyes of capitalism. Taxes help to support national parks and the preservation of the environment - funding helped by a progressive tax rate. Your concluding sentence is very arrogant: \"...My arguments have been agreed as correct and my opponent's arguments are just plainly irrelevant to this debate.\" Let the voters decide for themselves.

            "conclusion": "The united states should prioritize tax increases over spending cuts",
            "premise": "I accept. Good luck to my opponent. This will be my first online debate, so please bare with me if I make any syntax errors. -- My partner and I affirm the resolution resolved: The US should prioritize tax increases over spending cuts. Proposal: We would like to propose to increase to 33.1% for the top 1% of Americans. According to Bruce Bartlett, \"in 2008, those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, with incomes over $380,000, had an effective tax rate of 23.3 percent. In 1986, a year when the real gross domestic product grew a healthy 3.5 percent, their effective tax rate was 33.1 percent. Bartlett, who culled Internal Revenue Service data for his analysis, which appears in his New York Times column, goes on to say: \"If this group were still paying 33.1 percent, federal revenue would have been more than $166 billion higher in 2008 alone. That would be enough to reduce the budget deficit by about 10 percent this year. If the top 1 percent of taxpayers had continued to pay the same effective tax rate they paid in 1986 every year from 1987 to 2008, the federal debt today would be $1.7 trillion lower.\" Contention 1: Improves Social Needs and Public Welfare Tax increases will enable the government to ensure that services to citizens are available, and necessary expenditures on infrastructure are met without the need for excessive bond issuances. According to the New York Times, there is a direct correlation between the amount of money provided to Congress for the national budget and the quality of living in the US. In a study conducted by the Bureau of Economic Statistics, in the past 7 years, the average standard of living has been determined through looking at adjusted income per person and the poverty rate. In the years with a higher annual budget, the standard of living has risen higher than in years with a lower annual budget. The Board of Economic Advisors concluded from this study that the national budget reflects directly upon the standard of living in our country. The government on us imposes taxes so that they can benefit us. Taxes are imposed so that roads get fixed. They are imposed so that we get an education. They are imposed so that people don\"t invade our country. They are imposed to protect our rights. What right do we have to say that the government shouldn\"t impose taxes on us? If we don\"t pay for government programs, that money comes from excessive bond issuances. According to the Department of Labor and Infrastructure, the lack of funding in their departments have caused the pushing back of almost a decade\"s worth of renovation and projects to the point where many projects may never be finished. By raising taxes, we will be able to ensure that our nation is up to date and has all the necessary expenditures to develop, and we can lower the poverty rate and invest more heavily in programs that will help improve the living conditions and living quality of Americans today. Increasing tax rates also mean new jobs. The tax rates were increased in 1990 and 1993. Capital gain rates were cut slightly in 1996. And, 21 million new jobs were created in the 90s. That is about a 20% increase in the number of jobs available in the United States. The infamous Bush tax cuts passed in 2001, and even before the Bush recession began, job growth lagged behind GDP growth. After the Bush recession, we had a net job growth of 0%. And, thanks to population growth, no new jobs means record high unemployment, according to the Tax Policy Center. Contention 2: Can reduce debt We are currently in a 16 trillion dollar debt that is rising at the rate of 6 billion dollars every single day, according to the Department of Treasury. That\"s almost 4 million dollars every minute. To put our current situation into perspective, judge, our national debt at present is greater than the combined economies of China, the United Kingdom, and Australia combined. Should the burden of this debt be spread to all Americans, each American family in the US would owe about 50,113.78 dollars to various countries in the world. The biggest problem right now is that we don\"t have enough money to pay for some of our major programs and we are getting sucked into a death trap. For example, 41% of our taxes are spent on Social Security and Medicaid/Medicare benefits according to whitehouse.gov. However, when we pay our taxes for social security, it does not go to a private bank account where it is set-aside just for us. It goes to paying for the current recipients of these benefits. But the problem is that over our lifetime, Americans still deposit less than the average American will take out of this funding. Every single year, for every dollar put into Social Security, more and more is being taken out. The Bureau of Economic Statistics released a report in 2009 stating that at the current tax rate, by the time our generation gets to retiring age, there may not be enough money to pay for our social security benefits, and this is just one program of many.",

            "discussionTitle": "Resolved: Progressive income taxes are just",
            "conclusion": "Resolved: Progressive income taxes are just",
            "premise": "This debate will focus primarily on the definition of just, which, defined by Pro, ends up being \"Giving each his due\". If I as Con can provide examples and situations where progressive income taxes do NOT give each his due, then I will win the debate. Now Pro has already gone ahead and explained Progressive Income Taxes in one of his opening paragraphs in R2, which I agree with for the most part; the system is designed to only take away a larger percentage of income once your income reaches a certain level, say $90,000 a year. After that, everything will be taxed at a higher rate, but that 90K itself is left untouched. I would like to start my round off by emphasizing my opponent's thesis: Progressive income tax is just because it fairly distributes rights and responsibilities to every member of society. Now to move on to my contentions, and then I will address my opponent's argument and why it fails to meet his thesis and the resolution. Definition: Capital Gains- When you sell an asset at a higher price than you paid for it, the difference is your capital gain. For example, if you buy 100 shares of stock for $20 a share and sell them for $30 a share, you realize a capital gain of $10 a share, or $1,000 in total.If you own the stock for more than a year before selling it, you have a long-term capital gain. If you hold the stock for less than a year, you have a short-term capital gain. Most long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than your other income while short-term gains are taxed at your regular rate. [1] 1. Progressive Income Taxes exempt Capital Gains. Progressive income tax has major flaws, all of which show it to be unjust. Because the system doesn't take into account capital gains (CG) as heavily as normal income, it creates unbalance in who is paying the most taxes. The PIT system was made in order to tax the richest of the country at higher levels, as to provide for the common well being of this country in a variety of ways; what is happening instead is that this group of people are paying the LOWEST taxes because they maintain the majority of their income through capital gains. Right now, the tax rate is at 15% for those with capital gains [2]. 35% is the highest level of progressive income tax that one must pay, and we already see the problem; those maintaining their income through capital gains (the wealthiest) pay 20% less progressive taxes then those who do not have capital gains. Is this giving each his due? Is it giving each his due when the secretary of Warren Buffet ends up paying more in progressive taxes then he does, when she only makes a fraction of what he does? It's not just, for it's not giving each his due. \"The benefits of preferential rates for capital gains are enjoyed by the wealthiest Americans because they're the ones who tend to receive this type of income. More than 70 percent of the benefit goes to taxpayers with annual income of more than $1 million, a group that comprises only about 0.3 percent of all taxpayers.\" [2] The rich are, yet again, eluding the way our taxes work. Most Americans don't have the ability to make more than 2/3 of their income through capital gains, giving those who are wealthiest the biggest savings. The richest 400 U.S. taxpayers in 2007 paid an effective tax rate of just 16.6 percent. That's largely because more than two-thirds of this group's income\u2014which averaged $345 million\u2014was in the form of capital gains and dividends, while most Americans are paid in salaries and wages.\" [3] The reader's might be asking themselves, how exactly can we see that these people are able to achieve so much of their income through capital gains? \"This select group probably includes some managers of hedge funds and private equity funds, who enjoy another special loophole allowing them to treat most of their investment-management compensation as capital gain instead of ordinary income\u2014vastly lowering their taxes. Historically, when different forms of income have been taxed at different rates, lawyers and accountants have found ways to create tax shelters that make one type of income look like another type to take advantage of the lower rate\u2014this is just one example.\" [2] Basically, the wealthy file their incomes as capital assets, which fall under capital gains, giving them that extremely lower interest. The Progressive Tax system is not fairly distributed, and is not just. The historically low rate of capital gains has made the federal income tax system less progressive while increasing the budget deficit. [2] This contention alone shows how unjust Progressive taxes really are, and how people like Warren Buffet or Steve Jobs pay less in progressive taxes then their secretaries do. All in all, not giving each his due. REFUTATIONS C1. My opponent tries arguing that since most people are \"born into wealth\" they should be taxed more, because they usually maintain this wealth, thus making progressive income taxes just. This is an example of how Progressive Income taxes work in general, but I really don't see how this contention really strengthens my opponent's argument that PIT are just. If anything, it just helps my argument, because more and more people are easily becoming wealthy (see opponent's C1 sources) by being born into it, making more people who will elude PIT through capital gains. Also, I would like to point out that his statistics show those who are in the lower quintiles to remain there over the years; this is most likely because they know if they reach a higher income, they will have to pay that to the government through PIT, showing PIT to be demotivating for the average citizen to achieve higher success. C2. Pro's second point is that the wealthy owe more back to the system, because they have more at stake and are only able to achieve their wealth through the government protecting them. I again agree with this statement, but my contention about capital gains shows that the wealthy are not properly giving back to the system as they should be, because PIT allows them to elude paying through Capital Gains. Again, not a relevant point. C3. This point again falls invalid because it is merely in thought that it would provide free services for every member of society. Instead, those without capital gains, but with higher incomes, must pay and provide these free services for, in most cases, their bosses, or just those who make up a small portion of taxpayers who evade PIT. Basically, my opponent has again helped my case by showing that these taxes are paid to help the wealthy, who don't pay them in the amount that is just. |Conclusion| So far my opponent has only given examples of how Progressive income taxes should have worked on paper, but we can see in practice, it is not just, nor does it work. Through my contentions, and the help of my opponent's, we see those who don't/ aren't able to have larger Capital Gains paying the standards for PIT, while the richest and most powerful business owners find it all too easy to maintain over 2/3 of their income through capital gains, giving them a huge tax break. The poorer are basically paying for the richer...now we must refer back to the definition provided by my opponent; Giving each his due (Aristotle). We all see this is not giving each his due. Also, let's see if my opponent's thesis has held up throughout all this. Progressive income tax is just because it fairly distributes rights and responsibilities to every member of society. We see the rich evading these rights and responsibilities, and allowing those not as fortunate as them to make up for it. Pro's thesis is not met, and all his points fall. Thank You. Sources 1.

            "premise": "Rebuttal and Analysis\"Um my stance thing isnt negateing anything. I'm clarifiyng things.\"Passing a tax rate with a constitutional amendment has nothing to do with whether or not a flat tax is the best tax system. \"This is not true because I make a billion dollars the goverment takes away lets say 20%, but then the poor people get 20% taken awat too. thats not 100%.\"That is if the tax rate is 20%. Since we are not arguing a specific rate and we are arguing a flat tax in general, it could possibly be 100%.\"Your for a national sales tax instead.\"No, I'm not and I never claimed to be. I am for states and local governments deciding their own forms of taxation as long as they don't tax income. The federal government would be funded by a tax on the states rather than a direct tax on the people. \"You 0% plan still doesnt work, they have to buy supplies aka your sales tax. So either way you can gelp or hurt them.\"The difference between an income tax and a sales tax is, a sales tax is an optional tax and an income tax is not. You decide to pay a sales tax by buying goods.\"They only own a percentage of the income, you own the rest.\"Is it not immoral for government to own money you worked for?\"A national sales tax is a risky system that may not raise near enough money to support all our needs in defense, education, health care, etc.\"I am not advocating for a national sales tax so it doesn't matter if it could raise enough money.\"Consumer spending, which drives a thriving economy, would likely drop as people save and invest more rather than spend. Need more examples?\"In an article, \"The naked stimulus: Why savings stimulate more than spending,\" on CNNMoney the author explains why savings are more beneficial to the economy then spending, \"Over long periods, it's savings\u2013\u2013not consumer spending\u2013\u2013that finance the investments in mainframes, robots and other capital equipment that enhance productivity and drive economic growth. \"President Obama keeps saying that only consumption counts,\" says Allan Meltzer, the distinguished economist at Carnegie Mellon. \"It's foolish. Of course the money that people save doesn't go under the mattress. It goes to individuals to buy a house, or to businesses to build a plant.\"Let's examine how savings translate into investments, and hence into a crucial source of spending\u2013\u2013for the future, the most crucial. When people save, they either purchase stocks or bonds, or they deposit the cash in the banking system. When they buy newly-issued securities, those savers provide companies with the cash to purchase equipment, or buy factories and call centers via acquisitions. When they buy CDs or deposit money in savings accounts, the bank typically lends that money either to corporate customers that spend it to expand, or to the government by purchasing treasuries\u2013\u2013and once again, the funds are quickly spent.\"[11]\"E. Burnum. The Federal law trumps state laws. So they can intervene whenever they want to. It's in our constitution.\"First of all, I was not debating this point. I was just pointing to the fact that most of the corruption in government comes at the federal level but if corruption does come about in state government, it is much easier to correct than at the federal level. Since pro brought this up, I will debate it. Pro is referring to article 6 of the constitution, \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\"[12] This clearly says that the federal government only has power over the states on matters delegated to the federal government by the constitution. The tenth amendment, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,\"[13] gives the states the right to the powers not delegated to the federal government so in some cases the federal government can trump state law but not in the case of tax rates.

            "conclusion": "Taxes on the top 1% Wealthiest Americans ought to be raised.",
            "premise": "My job in this debate is to make the case that taxes should not be raised on the wealthiest 1% of Americans. I'll lay out my case in this debate and, in the interest of fairness, hold off on responding to my opponent's arguments until later roundsHigher Taxes on the Rich Would Hurt GrowthHigher tax rates on the wealthy would reduce economic growth. The literature on taxing the rich and economic growth is quite weak. There are studies purporting to look at this question, but they are often little more than looking at a historical correlation between tax rates and growth, which is simply not a very sound research method as it ignores other factors that have larger impacts on growth (among other reasons). To his credit, my opponent did not make the mistaken claim that the lack of correlation between historical top tax rates and historical growth automatically implies no effect. Indeed, there is evidence that higher tax rates on the rich hurt growth:1.) First, we have evidence that higher tax rates in general have a negative impact on growth. An overview of this literature is available the sources [1].We also have evidence that higher tax rates are responsible for the relative decline in hours worked in Europe relative to the USA, which has contributed to Europe being less productive [2].2.) Second, we have the evidence that more progressive tax rates harm economic growth. An example of some of this evidence is in the sources [3].3.) Finally, we have the evidence on how the behavior of rich people changes when taxes are changed. The evidence suggests that the behavioral responses are significant [4].Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that higher tax rates reduce economic growth in general, more progressive tax rates reduce economic growth, and rich individuals have quite large behavioral responses to changes in taxation. This is important as the main channels through which high tax rates harm economic growth are on the supply side rather than the demand side.Entrepreunership is one of the central drivers of economic growth [5]. After all, entrepreneurs are necessary to continually innovate in a constantly changing economy. Unfortunately, highly progressive taxation decreases entrepreneurship. This is simple to imagine if one looks at two men who both have a job that pays $200,000 and a potentially good idea. Both men pay 20% tax rates on their $200,000 income and, if they are to pursue their idea, they would be forced to give up their job. The difference is that one man lives in a country with a flat tax regime of 20%. The other man lives in a supposedly \"fairer\" society where the first $200,000 are taxed at 20% but every dollar after that is taxed at a punitive 80%. This would dramatically lower the chances that this man would become an entrepreneur. This is a rather extreme example, but the logic applies to any progressive tax regime to varying degrees. Not surprisingly, there is strong evidence that progressive taxation has a negative effect on entrepreneurship [6].High tax rates discourate productive behavior such as investing, working, and taking risks and encourages unproductive behavior such as tax avoidance. The evidence provided in the sources suggests that this effect is quite powerful and makes a meaningful difference in the economy. It's also important to note that wealthy individuals are more able to change the composition of their income so they can more easily avoid taxes, which is why they have such high elasticities of taxable income [4]. Taxes on the Rich are Already Rather HighThere is a widespread belief that taxes on the richest 1% are low. This is simply not the case. It seems that this perception is based entirely on anecdotal evidence. There is no doubt that some rich people pay low tax rates, but, as a whole, the richest 1% pay quite high taxes.The CBO estimates that, in 2013, the top 1% paid an average federal tax rate of 33.6%, compared to 18.1% average for all quintiles [7]. This does not include state and local taxes which, according to reasonable estimates, add another 6% or so to the average tax bill of the top 1% [8]. In total, this suggests a tax rate of around 40% on average, with some higher and some lower. I find it very hard to argue that one's \"fair share\" is more than 40%. Admittedly, this is a bit subjective because everyone has a different belief system about what is fair, but I think the fact that wealthy individuals already pay almost 35% of their income to the federal government and 40% to all governments would come off to most reasonable people as, if anything, too high, especially when realizes that the wealthy are already paying a higher tax rate than other classes. A Moral QuestionThe practical problems with raising taxes on the rich have already been discussed, at length, here. I also believe there is a moral element to this debate. Do we really want to live in a society where nearly half (or over half) of somebody's income is confiscated by the government?I certainly don't. America was founded as a free nation, with free enterprise at its core. One of the key tenets of free enterprise is that the government sets no limit on wealth. It is understood that taxes are necessary to pay for basic services and such, but I think it is hard to say that people paying 40% of their income in taxes are not paying their \"fair share\". No, raising taxes on the wealthy, at this point, would bring us to a place with tax rates that are better described as \"confiscatory\" than \"fair\". Confiscatory tax rates on any class or group is totally contrary to the moral core of the USA. Raising taxes further on the wealthy would be a moral and practical mistake.ConclusionI have laid out my case against raising taxes on the top 1% here. I look forward to responding to my opponent's points and defending my own points in future rounds.1.) http://taxfoundation.org...2.) http://www.economics21.org...3.)http://business.pages.tcnj.edu...4.)http://www.economics21.org...;5.) http://www.nber.org...;6.) http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu...;7.) http://www.cbo.gov...;8.) http://www.itepnet.org...;",

            "premise": "I support long term extentions of tax credits \"The federal renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) is a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for electricity generated by qualified energy resources and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year. 2.3\"/kWh for wind, geothermal, closed-loop biomass; 1.1\"/kWh for other eligible technologies. Generally applies to first 10 years of operation. \"(5) contention 1 is inherency, at our current state, we have not extended ptc(production tax credits) that incentivizes the creation wind farms in general. Wind energy in general is a rapidly growing industry that needs the US federal government support in order to expand. On the East coast of the US, offshore wind can create around 4200 GW of wind energy capacity (4).(3). logically, probably less then half of that potential can be tapped but it can still therefore solve for a lot of US energy needs at 1100 mw capacity. contention 2 is global warming- It's well established by the global scientific community that global warming is real and caused by humans.(2) Wind turbines won't burn fossil fuels like other sources of energy like coal and gas which release co2 into our atmostphere causing global warming. Wind turbines capture wind and create electricity and therefore do not pollute the air. Global warming is destroying our world and climate. America is a global leader and if we take increased initiative and incentivize offshore wind power, other nations will follow. More industrialized nations like Germany and Britian are already taking initiative and to prevent global warming, we must attempt to solve. The US pumps out around 20% of the global co2 emission, stopping US emissions is a critical step and offshore wind can be a vehicle to eliminate our carbon footprint. Electricity is around 26% of all co2 emissions on this plant and industry accounts for another 19%. eliminating 26% of global emissions is something we must take to halt our emissions as well as connecting industry to the grid to reduce their emission rates and slow down global warming. Global warming by 2100 is going to increase from 6-8 degrees celsius according to most estimates(12). Global warming leads to ocean acidification, ecology harm, crop failures, severe weather and drought, and other major problems. IT MUST BE STOPPED!!(13) contention 3 is jobs This expanding industry will increase the number of Jobs in electricity industry. Spur jobs created in making turbines, the infrastructure in the turbines, scientists and engineers who explore and design these turbines, and creating maintenance crews. Jobs are vital for our economy. Global warming is killing our ecosystems and therefore vital aspects to our economy like fishing and farming so solving for global warming also benefits our economy. Job creation is great for our economy and yes it will trade off with oil and gas jobs and will spend US tax revenue doing so, but gas and oil jobs already use US government subsidies from $10-50 billion so the Federal Government won't really miss a thing(8). Offshore wind will create more jobs than offshore drilling and electricity.(9) (1)http://www.ucsusa.org...' (2)http://climate.nasa.gov... (4)http://oceana.org... (3)http://cleantechnica.com...

You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.\u201d[[http://thinkexist.com/quotation/you-cannot-strengthen-the-weak-by-weakening-the/821892.html]] Investment like people is mobile, and with globalisation becoming more global. There has been a particular trend of outsourcing jobs and investment over the last few decades. As tax is a cost to the rich businessmen it is likely to create more outsourcing. The rich are the wealth creators of the country, the innovators, inventors and investors, scare them away and they will no longer invest in the country. Most of them are hard working and because they are mobile will be very sensitive to tax changes.[[Harry Phibbs, Piling taxes on the rich will hit the wrong people - and raise diddly squat, MailOnline, 24th March 2009, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1164123/HARRY-PHIBBS-Piling-taxes-rich-hit-wrong-people--raise-diddly-squat.html%5D%5D Overall the level of taxation has an inverse relationship to the level of economic growth. This is because the investors do not feel as rewarded for their investment if they cannot gain most of the profit, they want to know why the government which has often done very little to help them should gain the benefit of their investments through taxation when the economy is already gaining through higher number of jobs. The higher the tax rate the higher the rate of return investors will require for their investments and the less they will pay for a given investment. In the US from 1997 to 2007 the non-income tax states had 21% job growth compared to 11% job growth in the high income tax states. Also Personal income grew by 84% in the non-income tax states, versus 64% in the high income tax states. This is most severe where there is a progressive taxation regime i.e. higher taxes on the rich than on the poor. According to a Joint Economic Committee of Congress report in 1982 \u201cIncome taxes levied on individuals and corporations are particularly detrimental to growth... Progressive taxation not only lowers the rate of economic growth compared with proportional or regressive taxation, but in the process hurts the very persons that progressive taxes are designed to help: The poor.\u201d[[Arthur B. Laffer, Stephen Moore & Jonathan Williams, Rich States, Poor States, American Legislative Exchange Council, (Washington, 2009), pp.34-36, http://www.alec.org/am/pdf/tax/09RSPS/26969_REPORT_full.pdf%5D%5D Tax has a similar effect on the stock market, if the rich are being taxed more on their income they will have less to invest on the stock market. Moreover if returns from investments (capital gains) are counted as income then the higher the tax rate the fewer investment opportunities there will be that meet the new required higher level of return.[[Daniel Obrycki, Rafael Resendes, Tax the Rich, Starve the Poor, Real Clear Markets, 24th January 2008, http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2008/01/tax_the_rich_starve_the_poor_1.html%5D%5D There will therefore be less trading and investing and companies stock will be worth less, which in turn reduces the amount of capital in the country reducing investment. Overall as higher taxes equals less investment which in turn equals lower economic growth then the consequences of raising taxes are negative. This lower growth will mean less jobs so more are out of work, while those in jobs get lower pay increases. There is less building of infrastructure such as roads and railways, less choice in services such as banking and education, and less exciting new innovations such as debatewise!",

I declare that CON shall need to establish the converse: that the taxes collected by the government are a worse harm than corporate greed. I shall allow CON to actually establish the opening argument, and thus I am making this four rounds. In the hopes of staving off my own wordiness that I worry has caused my previous opponents to slow their responses, I have reduced a character-limit to arguments to 4,000 characters. However, PLEASE NOTE that I have reduced your time to argue to 48 hours, so if you expect to have a lot of real-life interference for the next few days, please do not bother accepting this challenge. Further, I ask the audience to refrain from trying to become a \"third debater.\" I also ask my challenger (or the audience) to not attempt to make arguments in the \"Discussion Tab\" until the debate is over. I have an overabundance of time on my rat-paws. If you find you dislike my position, but do not think the challenger is doing a good job at opposing me, feel free to challenge me! I can handle more than one debate at a time. AGAIN, I FOREFEIT ARGUMENTS THIS FIRST ROUND to allow \"Con\" to make opening arguments. Thank you for accepting my challenge, and good luck!",

The bigger companies would have much more investment power and the smaller companies would have a little bit more, but these rates would be unrivaled by those of the bigger companies. Moreover it would be quite unlikely for foreign companies to go to the US, for still a 20% corporate tax rate, although slightly lower than the EU average (21.34) would not be very attractive since that would require that the companies from the EU, whom I guess might be some potential targets of the movement move their legal residences to the US and that would exclude them from the EU subsidies. It would be very unlikely for target companies to be from the third world since the tax rates there are already pretty low or at the very least the tax codes are full of loopholes.",

            "premise": "My argument will hiting key factors, by first explaining there cause. Then explaining how Obama has acted to fix them and his record of actually fixing them. 1) Stock Market Cause- http://money.cnn.com... How Fixed - $700 billion bailout tho i agree that this evidence is arguable based on the fact neither side can say weather or not it did anything bc it is unprovable with nothing to connect it and the random choice of investors to buy stocks. Fix - Dow Jones up 60% since Obama takes office. http://www.cleveland.com... 2) Taxes Cause - Depends how one would look at it the income of the USA is based on taxes so the higher the taxes the more money and the less the deficit. the american public hates taxes and who blames them no one but they have to pay bc as the deficit rises the need to create a surplus grows now there is two ways to make a surplus one way is to cut taxes and allow more income to people and bushiness so they can make more money which intern creates more taxes from there higher incomes but that's assuming it does produce enough income to close the gap second way is to raise taxes and pay it off but this also flaws bc if taxes are too high people become poorer and tax income goes down. each president has handled this situation caution. president bush's handling is deffinetly not one that should be defended raising the deficit $700 billion with the bush tax cuts which have been found not to actually boost job growth. http://www.bloomberg.com... How Fixed - How Obama handled the tax issue is by doing the exact oppiste of what most republicans and tea party activists claim and has left income taxes low so low in fact they are lower than they have been in 60 years so it may boost the economy but plans on raising the taxes later when it is easier for the country to handle ending the failed bush tax cuts and lowering the extremely high cooperate tax to boost economic growth and allow companys back into the country. http://www.cbsnews.com... Fix - the bush tax cuts set to expire and taxes at there lowest in 60 years 3) Deficit Cause - http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov... we can point fingers all day but its there now so how are we going to fix it How fixed - moves by the Obama administration to cut spending and lower the $1.3 trillion deficit he inherited http://www.whitehouse.gov... fix - the deficit drops to $1.27 trillion http://articles.latimes.com... 4) Housing Cause - the cause is blamed on so many people and organizations who cares how is it being fixed. How Fixed- Obama opened the mortgage relief program Fix - tho foreclosures are still at record highs a slow in the rate of foreclosures has been seen and a rise in home sales values of 12.3% http://www.realtor.org... 5) Jobs Cause - numerous causes the rescission jobs leaving over seas and so on.... How Fixed - $700 billion dollar bailout auto company bail out and improving economy Fix - when Obama took office unemployment was at 9% and growing after all Obamas bail outs it stopped at 10.1% and began to fall now unemployment is lower than when he entered office now at 8.6% http://www.propublica.org... http://money.cnn.com... now not every president is perfect all have flaws my argument basis its self off the proven benifets obama has made and could contuine to make if re- elected unlike the unproven benefits opposers of Obama claim",
