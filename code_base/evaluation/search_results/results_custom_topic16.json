            "premise": "Advertising serves an important purpose by informing the public about a specific product. It is also regulated from manipulation, and therefore deserves no special restrictions; these same restrictions and watchdogs would be in place if advertising of drugs were allowed to make sure that no drug is misrepresented. We trust consumers to view adverts with a level of skepticism and we know that they form only one part of the research that goes into, say, buying a car. Drug companies have become more open in recent years. For instance, GSK now publishes the results of all their drug trials (including the ones that fail) online and there are plenty of other sources of information on drugs available. A drug that remains unused is a drug that is helping nobody; adverts are simply a reasonable way for drug companies to help consumers find out about their products within a safe and highly regulated environment[1]. When the first discussion in the European Parliament was started, regarding the advertisement of pharmaceuticals, the pharmaceutical industry specifically pointed out the anomaly that exists: \u201cSpecific laws stood in the way of it communicating with patients over its products, even when others could. Presumably, this meant information was communicated by the media about new medicines. In this regard, the restrictions on the pharma industry contrast with the freedom enjoyed by manufacturers of vitamins and herbal remedies, who routinely advertise products to patients.\u201d[2]\u00a0This shows that it is unjust to make any differences between the companies. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0Debate: Should Drug Companies be allowed to advertise prescriptions direct to the public.\u00a0http://toostep.com/debate/should-drugs-companies-be-allowed-to-advertise-prescription [2]\u00a0Jessop N., Will DTC Advertising appear in Europe ?, published 01/07/2011,\u00a0\u00a0http://pharmtech.findpharma.com/pharmtech/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=702161, accessed 07/29/2011",

Actually, Lunesta helps patients sleep 15 minutes faster after six months of treatment and gives 37 minutes more sleep per night. The Majority of ads are based on emotional appeals, but few include causes of the condition, risk factors, or important lifestyle changes. In a study of 38 pharmaceutical advertisements researchers found that 82 percent made a factual claim and 86 percent made rational arguments for product use. Only 26 percent described condition causes, risk factors, or prevalence.[1]\u00a0Thus not giving the patients balanced information that would make them aware, that taking one of the pills is not a magic solution to their problem. Actually, according to a study conducted in the US and New Zealand, patients requested prescriptions in 12% of surveyed visits. Of these requests, 42% were for products advertised to consumers and consumers could not recall more than 4 different products of medicine.[2] This proves that the decisions made by the patients are not more informed and mainly only pressure to the advertised drugs.\u00a0 [1]\u00a0Creating Demand for Prescription Drugs: A Content Analysis of Television Direct-to-Consumer Advertising.

A patient trusts their doctor and if their doctor makes a majorly wrong prescription, then the doctor's license will be at least revoked. Doctors have to go through grueling med school, memorize thousands of drug names in order to achieve their status as one and make good choices for their patient. However, if companies are allowed to advertise prescription drugs without really getting to know the patient and their individual case, the \"diagnosis\" has a huge chance of being inaccurate and could even be detrimental to the patient's health. One cannot actually tell from an ad who made it, what they are really giving their customers unless one really buys it and sees them. Unfortunately, too many non legit drug companies or even other companies can advertise whatever they want to make a quick buck from gullible people and they could even unknowingly cause their \"patients\" to have serious medical problems -Thank you",

In private health care systems it is likely that economic pressure will result in a doctor eventually agreeing to the patient\u2019s demand. In nationalized health services \u2018pester power\u2019 has resulted in doctors giving in to patients in the past rather than arguing with them (seen, for example, in the massive over-prescribing of antibiotics by British general practitioners for viral infections against which they are ineffective). If the doctor prescribes another drug (perhaps a cheaper generic version), even if it is chemically identical to the branded and advertised drug, the reverse-placebo effect may result in the drug being less effective than it should be, because the patient believes it is a weaker treatment. The patient may also be less willing to complete the prescription, or to visit that doctor again, thereby undermining the doctor-patient relationship.[1] Prescription medicines are fundamentally complex and dangerous, which is why they require a prescription by a qualified doctor. It is not helpful to have a patient who lacks the decade of medical training a GP has self-diagnosing on the basis of an advert. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0FDA: Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Prescription Drugs:Looking Back, Looking Forward, published October 2005,\u00a0\u00a0www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm095993.ppt, accessed 08/07/2011",

Companies spend millions of dollars a year on advertising, and would not do so if there were no return on this investment. While purchasing a particular brand of cola on the basis of an advert might not be disastrous for the consumer, using an inappropriate drug could be. Drugs companies have also shown their willingness to abuse their advertising rights. For instance the FDA has recently had to insist that the possible side effects of drugs must be listed as an integral part of TV advertisements, because advertisements were being produced in which the list of side effects was read at too fast a pace to be understood. It is thus understandable that in a survey soon after the 1997 regulations on direct to consumer advertising, 80% of American Medical Association (AMA) General Practitioners (GPs) thought it was not a good idea and undermined their role.[1] [1]\u00a0FDA: Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Prescription Drugs:Looking Back, Looking Forward, published October 2005,\u00a0\u00a0www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm095993.ppt, accessed 08/07/2011\u00a0",

This leads both to greater hypochondria and to self-diagnosis of normal conditions as medical ones. For instance in October 2001, GSK ran advertisements for Paxil in the New York Times, claiming the drug would solve chronic anxiety. These advertisements came at a time when the events of 9/11\u2014rather than a medical condition\u2014were probably to blame for New Yorkers\u2019 stress. The FDA declared in a 1999 study that fewer than one in four new drugs has any therapeutic value and the medical community now accepts that prevention through lifestyle choices is often the best way to tackle disease (for instance, rather than seeking a weight-loss or diabetes wonder-pill, childhood obesity should be tackled through exercise and healthy eating). Pill-popping seems easier and so is more attractive to many patients but in practice it is worse for the long-term health of society. By allowing the prescription drugs to be advertised we are making more people believe they are ill and need pills for them, rather than explaining to them that their back pain and high blood pressure are problems caused by their lifestyle choices.[1] \u00a0 [1]\u00a0Health Information Action, Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising The European Commission\u2019s Proposals for Legislative Change, September 2011,\u00a0http://www.haiweb.org/campaign/DTCA/BMintzes_en.pdf, accessed 08/07/2011",

Because of such advertisement, in the U.S. there was a rapid widespread exposure to dangerous drugs before risks were fully recognized, as with troglitazone (Rezulin) for diabetes and cisapride (Propulsid) for nighttime heartburn.

The study, conducted in the years 2001 \u2013 2005 in the United States, shows that there is no significant relationship between advertising and price sensitivity. The comparison with other countries shows, the prices of pharmaceuticals and the price for health care (for drugs) have not risen in the United States. Through advertising, after the introductory phase of a drug, the health system is not burdened more. Simply put people are just able to choose between drugs, in a comparable price range easier and therefore do not cost additional money to the state.[1] So a greater financial burden is no excuse from prohibiting companies to advertise products. \u00a0[1] Villanova University, DOES DTC ADVERTISING RAISE PRICE?

            "premise": "Advertising prescription drugs enables patients to learn, and to request innovation faster in order to benefit from the new drugs that health personnel still have not gotten used to. Advertising increases consumer awareness of drugs, which makes consumers more likely to take appropriate medication. The drugs market is complex and so advertising can help explain the differences between treatments, for example between contraceptive pills intended to reduce period pain, period flow and those simply to prevent pregnancy. Advertising under current rules is used to inform patients of new drugs which may be appropriate for conditions which they suffer from (such as recent asthma drugs which reduce the frequency of attacks), but which their doctor might overlook or not have the time to crosscheck against her list of patients.[1] 56% of AMA general practitioners believed that direct-to-consumer advertising had prompted some of their patients to seek treatment for a condition which would have otherwise been neglected.[2]\u00a0If a patient has taken the time to actively consider a particular drug and then visits their doctor, whether they are prescribed it or not, they are building up a positive relationship with their doctor and are more likely to continue to take an active interest in their health. Further on, in states where there is no direct to consumer advertising but there is advertising to doctors, patients are disadvantaged because it is in the interest for private medical insurance firms or national health services to keep information about expensive new drugs from patients. In the UK it was because of cost that the Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) refused to allow the prescription of Herceptin, a drug which US studies have shown reduces the damage done by breast cancer. Ultimately pressure from Roche, the drug\u2019s manufacturer and from patients resulted in the drug being authorized for use, but the process was much faster in the US where Roche could run advertisements alerting consumers to the potential benefits of Herceptin, and thereby immediately giving patients access to a similar level of information as their doctors and allowing them to push for its authorization. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0Patient View \u2013 for improving patient care, Information on prescription medicines: the views of EU-based patient groups,\u00a0http://www.patient-view.com/projects4.htm, accessed 08/07/2011 [2]\u00a0Lyles A., Direct Marketing of Pharmaceuticals to Consumers, Annual Review of Public Health, published May 2002,\u00a0\u00a0http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140537, accessed 08/08/2011",

            "premise": "Actually prescription drugs are generally sold expensively worldwide, especially in North America and receive enormous profits, regardless of the advertising. Companies actually have enormous budgets dedicated to advertising, in countries where it is legal. They are required to spend this money because they have to compete with other companies that are advertising their products, but if there were no advertising, they could spend the money on more research. The pharmaceutical industry has been the most profitable industry in America for each of the past 10 years and, in 2001, was a five-and-one-half time more profitable than the average for Fortune 500 companies[1]. Moreover, in Canada, the sale of a typical patented branded drug would bring about a profit margin of almost 70%[2]. \u00a0\u201cU.S. Pharmaceutical Launches: Marketing Spend and Structure\" reveals that the average blockbuster brand in the United States allots 49% of its budget to fulfill advertising needs.\u00a0 This hefty allotment is attributed to the fact that most blockbuster brands target a mass-market audience that requires large-scale advertising.[3] Advertising reduces the incentive for research into new drugs as companies have found the returns on investment in advertising are better than those on research and development. This is particularly the case as it has become increasingly difficult to find a \u2018blockbuster\u2019 drug (because increasingly, new drugs are minor adjustments to existing ones). Significant changes to the way drugs are researched are needed for scientific advancements, but such changes are expensive and carry high risks of failure. It is of much lower risk is to the manufacturer to relicense existing drugs for new markets and new consumers, thereby allowing them to re-brand the drug[4]. So they do not use the money mainly for research for new therapeutics, but spend nearly half of it on advertisements to maximize their profit even more. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0CIBC World Markets (2003) 2003 Investors' Guide to The Canadian Drugstore Industry, published 2003, \u00a0http://www.envoycapital.com/includes/docs/drugstore_industry.pdf, accessed 07/30/2011 [2]\u00a0Families USA (2002) Profiting from Pain: Where Prescription Drug Dollars Go, \u00a0http://www.familiesusa.org/assets/pdfs/PPreport89a5.pdf, accessed 07/30/2011 [3]\u00a0PR Newsmedia \u2013 United Business Media, Pharmaceutical Advertising: United States vs. Europe, published 12/22/2010, \u00a0http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pharmaceutical-advertising-united-states-vs-europe-55640307.html, accessed 07/29/2011 [4]\u00a0Turning ideas into products- a pharmaceurtical paradigm shift.\u00a0http://www.paconsulting.com/our-thinking/turning-ideas-into-products-a-pharmaceutical-paradigm-shift/",

Each new drug costs an average of $500m to produce and very small percentage of the drugs that are researched ever make it to the market.[1]\u00a0The more profitable the industry, the more new drugs it can afford to research and develop and thus the more patients who can receive appropriate treatment. Many of the complex cures being developed for diseases like cancer, HIV/AIDs, SARS and Avian Flu will take decades to research. In the meantime, drug companies require funding streams from other drugs to continue research. Drugs have become increasingly expensive and advertisement helps to cover those costs. From 1980 and 2004, from about $6 billion (in 2005 dollars) to $39 billion. There has been a real growth rate of about 8 percent a year, on average. By comparison, drug firms\u2019 gross margins\u2014sales revenue minus costs and income taxes\u2014have been increasing more slowly, by about 4 percent annually.[2] So, with more personalized medicine and greater costs in drug development, the industry needs a greater source of revenue in order to research therapeutics further.\u00a0 Advertising would provide this revenue.

            "conclusion": "The costs and effects of advertising will place an additional burden on the healthcare system",
            "premise": "Allowing advertising places an additional burden on the health care system. As a result of advertising, if it were allowed, many patients would request the more expensive brand drugs and so place an additional burden on the public health care system. The offered generic drugs have the same effect; they are simply cheaper because they do not spend several millions on advertising. Drug costs are increasing at a faster rate in the United States than anywhere else in the world (roughly by 25% year on year since the mid-1990s). This growth has been mainly driven by patients demanding advertised drugs (they accounted for half the 2002-2003 increase, for instance). Advertised drugs are always more expensive than generic rivals because of the branding and advertising costs, as well as the increased price that manufacturers can demand for a snappily named product. In private health care systems, this drives up insurance premiums, thereby pricing large numbers of people out of health care coverage (44 million Americans have no coverage, despite the United States spending more per capita on health care than any other country). Alternatively, it forces many people to select insurance packages with lower levels of coverage (the solution introduced in 2005 by the Bush administration). The EU has estimated that its member states with public healthcare systems would be crippled if they spent as much on drugs as the United States[1]. Actually estimates in the United Kingdom state that, by buying generic drugs, the public health care system could save more than \u00a3300m a year. General practioners could make more use of cheaper, non-brand versions of the drugs, without harming care. An example of the NHS overpricing drugs: one treatment for gastric problems, Omeprazole, can be bought from wholesalers for between \u00a32.50 and \u00a33.40, yet the NHS pays \u00a310.85 every time it is prescribed. To make the matter worse, doctors often over-prescribe; at least \u00a3100m could be saved if they were more careful in this matter.[2] Therefore, because it would create a substantial financial burden to the current public health care system, allowing advertising would be a bad idea. \u00a0 [1]\u00a0Heath Care in the United States.\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States [2]\u00a0BBC News, Drug profiteering claims denied, published 03/14/2004,\u00a0\u00a0http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3511102.stm, accessed 07/30/2011",

This not only saves money but is also better for patients. Surgery involves the risk of complications as well as taking time both directly and in post-operation rehabilitation. Also many degenerative conditions can be best treated by early intervention; if patients are aware of the drugs that are available at an early stage they are more likely to take them, thereby increasing their standard of living and reducing their long-term cost to state or private health cover providers.",

            "conclusion": "Advertising is harmful to society",
            "premise": "Thank you for accepting, Con.I will be making three contentions in this debate:1. Advertising discourages rational decision-making2. Advertising creates a consumer culture3. Advertising adversely affects the cognitive ability of the audienceContention #1 - Advertising discourages rational decision-makingAccording to CEO Insights, \"Without advertisement not a single farm or company can grow in this world of competition.\"[1] The obvious implication of this is that it is not the quality of the product that sells it in today's society, but the aggressiveness of the marketers who advertise it. This is especially true when we consider the rampant dishonesty within advertising. To examine just one industry, nine out of ten people find broadband advertising to be misleading.[2] Richard Pollay, author of The Distorted Mirror: Reflection on the Unintended Consequences of Advertising, analogizes advertising as a type of \"brain surgery.\" Pollay says that ads are designed to \"attract attention, change attitudes, and to command our behavior.\"[3]For an amusing yet somewhat frightening look at the potential power of advertising, please watch the video on the side.Contention #2 - Advertising creates a consumer cultureWhile consumption is naturally an essential part of a capitalist society, it needs to be kept in balance with \"producerism\" in order to keep it from turning into consumerism. It is worth quoting Professor Amitai Etzioni at length here to explain my point: What needs to be eradicated, or at least greatly tempered, is consumerism: the obsession with acquisition that has become the organizing principle of American life. This is not the same thing as capitalism, nor is it the same thing as consumption. To explain the difference, it is useful to draw on Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of human needs. At the bottom of this hierarchy are basic creature comforts; once these are sated, more satisfaction is drawn from affection, self-esteem and, finally, self-actualization. As long as consumption is focused on satisfying basic human needs -- safety, shelter, food, clothing, health care, education -- it is not consumerism. But when, on attempts to satisfy these higher needs through the simple acquisition of goods and services, consumption turns into consumerism -- and consumerism becomes a social disease. The link to the economic crisis should be obvious. A culture in which the urge to consume dominates the psychology of citizens is a culture in which people will do most anything to acquire the means to consume -- working slavish hours, behaving rapaciously in their business pursuits, and even bending the rules in order to maximize their earnings. They will also buy homes beyond their means and think nothing of running up credit-card debt. It therefore seems safe to say that consumerism is, as much as anything else, responsible for the current economic mess.[4] 92% of respondents in a poll said that television commercials aimed at children are responsible for making children materialistic.[5]Contention #3 - Advertising adversely affects the cognitive ability of the audienceAdvertising defines and redefines the desires and tastes of the public. Harnessing the power of media, advertisers are able to cause people to desire irrational products, lifestyles and body images. For example, a report by the British Medical Association called for advertisers to stop featuring \"abnormally thin\" women in their advertisements as it was causing girls to attempt to emulate the models.[6] This clearly indicates the power of the media to create irrational desires and thoughts within the minds of their audience.Sources1. http://www.theceoinsights.com...2. http://www.virgin.com...3. http://hilo.hawaii.edu...4. http://www.huffingtonpost.com...5. http://www.csun.edu...6. http://www.theguardian.com...http://www.youtube.com...",

Nevertheless, I'll start out with some basic arguments. Policing these advertisements would be a violation of two parts of the first amendment. Firstly, Freedom of Speech. These companies are trying to promote their brand that is (and has to be) FDA approved. As long is no one is being hurt or defamed by these advertisements, it is unconstitutional to police them. Secondly, freedom of press. Many ads appear in newspapers or magazines. Again, if the drug is FDA approved and the publishing company lets the drug ad go in, it is legal.

            "discussionTitle": "Energy drinks should be regulated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration.",
            "conclusion": "Energy drinks should be regulated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration.",
            "premise": "An excellent opening argument made by my opponent. I'll start by refuting. My opponent's main arguments are: A1. Energy drinks are not drugs. A2. There is not a huge amount of caffeine in energy drinks. A1) To justify this my opponent states an energy drink counts as a beverage by the FDA definition. However, according to the FDA, caffeine is a drug. So how much caffeine is in the majority of energy drinks? According to Consumer Reports, the most popular energy drinks (Monster Energy, Rock Star, 5 Hour Energy) have 100-200 mg of caffeine, but some versions of Monster and 5 Hour have almost 250 mg. This is a huge amount. Also, a characteristic of all drugs -- a DEFINING characteristic -- is addiction and withdrawal. People CAN get addicted to energy drinks, as I've proven. When they're forced to stop drinking them, they go through withdrawal. This is one of the defining characteristics of a drug. You don't get addicted to beverages like orange juice. Although energy drinks are a \"liquid for drinking,\" they're not a BEVERAGE. My opponent also states that the FDA does not define foods containing caffeine as drugs, such as coffee, iced tea, soft drinks, dark chocolate, etc. In saying this, he fails to realize two things: 1. soft drinks are regulated in the amount of caffeine they may contain while energy drinks are not and 2. all of these examples have less caffeine than the average energy drink. 5 Hour Energy has 215 mg of caffeine per serving. An 8-ounce cup of coffee has about 100 (although Starbucks usually has more at 150 mg). A soft drink like Coke has 39 mg of caffeine. Compare all these to the caffeine content of an energy drink, 215 mg. Quite clearly, energy drinks cannot be grouped into the same category as soda, tea, coffee, or chocolate. A2) My opponent justifies his claim by stating the level of caffeine in energy drinks is not high compared to the standards recommended by the FDA. However, he fails to realize who the majority of consumers of energy drinks are: adolescents. According to the FDA, the recommended amount of caffeine for kids, depending on their size and weight, is 45-85 mg. Although teens probably fall into a higher category, I think we can all agree that the 215 mg of 5 hour Energy is way too much. Monster X-presso has even more at 220 mg and Rock Star is absurdly high at 229. All these popular brands are WAY over the limit. An attempt is made by my opponent to compare soda and coffee to energy drinks. Judging by his cherry-picked evidence, he wants us to conclude that coffee has a lot more caffeine than energy drinks, appealing to common sense that no one has died from coffee. But think about a tall steaming cup of coffee. How many people chug that down in a few gulps? How many coffees do you drink a day? The answer to all these questions are probably going to be different if I asked these questions about energy drinks. Coffee is not a valid comparison to energy drinks. My opponent also provides a counter argument, which I'll break down into three parts. Part A: \"The first part is totally irrelevant, it is the same as saying poor people are more likely to abuse alcohol, smoke marijuana, etc. Who cares? It is not an argument in favor of the FDA to regulate the drink as a drug.\" His argument about poor people is completely irrelevant as there is nothing we can do to prevent them from getting addicted to drugs, but we can regulate energy drinks as drugs to try and prevent people who are addicted to them to get addicted to things like crack and heroin. Part B: \"Second one only occurs because of the caffeine and as I showed that it is unlikely to get addicted to caffeine only if you consume a LOT of caffeine per day.\" He's just hit the nail on the head. Caffeine IS a drug. You can get addicted to something with massive amounts of a drug in it. I've already proven that people have gotten addicted to energy drinks, so my opponent's refutation is completely invalid in the face of solid evidence. Part C: \"And still it is not an argument in favor of regulating them as a drug because you can drink caffeine from other Soft Drinks and they are not regulated as drugs.\" I've refuted this already in my refutation of his second argument. Energy drinks have a substantial amount of caffeine, while soft drinks only have a little. Furthermore, soft drinks are regulated in the amount of caffeine they may have, so they have a lot less caffeine. Having refuted all of my opponent's points, I'll move on to my own. P1. Energy Drinks have detrimental effects to the body. Adults & kids are taking an overdose of energy drinks & we need to put an end to it. This can cause serious effects similar to drunk driving, which also happens with other drugs. National Center for Health Statistics: A form of drunk driving occurs 86% of the time after consuming energy drinks. Not only this, consuming multiple energy drinks has sent adults to emergency rooms with racing heart beats, usually 220-250 beats per minute! But Judge, if adults with fully mature bodies couldn\"t handle the caffeine, what would happen to the kids? Besides this, there are actually instances where alcohol is in Energy Drinks. Brown Univ.: Four Loko, an energy drink, is 12% alcohol, which is the equivalent of 4-6 beers. Also, 78% of all Energy Drinks actually have alcohol! Judge, just imagine. Every time someone consumes one energy drink they could be consuming up to 6 beers alcohol wise! Does this look like something healthy for average teens, or even adults, who should only be consuming 60-70 mg of caffeine a day? Regulation can prevent people from harming themselves and others due to energy drinks. P2. Energy Drinks behave like drugs. Judge, currently energy drinks are becoming the new \"gateway\" drug. Keyword: drug. American Beverage Association: If someone drinks 6 or more energy drinks a month, they have a 3x greater risk of smoking cigarettes or engaging in a fight. Judge, even if energy drinks don\"t cause that much harm, the gateway effect will lead them to consume more riskier substances, which will inevitably cause extreme adverse effects. Oklahoma State Study: Teens that drink energy drinks consume more than 2x the amount of alcohol & have far riskier drinking habits than those who drink alcohol. Judge, this study shows that energy drinks can lead to even worse abuse of alcohol & cigarettes! Not only this, it has similar adverse effects like withdrawal, a common condition obtained when taking drugs. If this is the case, shouldn\"t it be regulated like a drug? Univ. of Miami: Energy drinks cause severe addiction, possibly worse than even cigarettes. In some cases, consumers could go from 1 bottle a day to 5 bottles a day. As I already stated, it\"s the addiction that\"s extremely harmful. Maybe in the beginning the consumer is going to take energy drinks in moderation, but slowly they\"ll get addicted, until their bodies won\"t function with o it, like what happens with alcohol. Then, withdrawal symptoms occur! Health Psych Magazine: Withdrawal can cause nausea, vomiting, & other undesirable effects. NY Times: There were 7,800 adult ER visits in 2009 caused by energy drinks. As I've already stated, if this can happen to a person with fully mature systems, what would happen to a teen or adolescent? The answer to my own question is significantly higher heart rates & even more ER visits, almost all leading to extremely adverse effects like withdrawal.",

It will become burden to costumer. 2-The promoters only emphasise on the merits. 3-Advertisers present the product as a favourite of the celebrities. This has great influence on young minds. 4-People are preferring ready made food than fruits and vegetables through advertising. These new habits are adversely impacting their health. 5-Some pesticides, though in very small quantities were found in common cold drinks. But advertisers are not revealing this fact. 6-All cosmetic products are advertised in the name of fruit extracts, the chemical contents are neither displayed nor printed on the product cover. 7-Teenagers are attracted by cigarette, alcohol and diet pills advertisements, and their health is adversely effecting by these habits. 8-Consumers tend to be manipulated by an advertisement's promise that the product will do something special for them, which upsets their budget. 9-An advertisement for an expensive good is likely to create an ill-feeling in the mind of a poor teenager who cannot afford it. Such feelings often lead to hatred and anti-social activities.

            "premise": "Firstly you say millions die from drug use ; 30,711 deaths directly related to drugs in 2004( national vital stats report) and that includes prescription drugs. In the second part of your argument you said that jail is there to \"prove a point\",but what exactly is that point?It is a well known fact that drugs are readily available in correctional facilities and in the majority of cases prisoners move on to harder drugs during time. They also invariably make criminal connections in these facilities and this results in the drug user becoming the drug dealer. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics 68% of all people that serve time in jails will re offend, the majority of these will commit a crime within a three year period of their release. If jail really did work as a deterrent or punishment surely this would not happen. Overcrowding in these facilities is also a major issue of concern and paedophiles and rapists are released before serving their full term in order to make room for recreational drug users..surely this is in no way advantageous to society. In point 3 of your argument you say how saving money is nothing compared to the dehumanization that comes with drug use so i find it funny then that in point 4 & 5 money seems to be your major concern. You seem to be more worried that drug use will affect the person as a consumer rather than what it will do to their health. Also you criticize drugs for their dehumanizing quality and in the same breath condone locking drug users away in a cage with murderers, rapists and every other sort of violent criminal as if this is not dehumanizing. Ultimately to arrest and sentence someone for consuming drugs is to say that their body dose not belong to them but the government. To finish i would like to say that i am not implying that drugs are good for you or that the government should do nothing about it only that criminalizing those who use them is not the way and this is obvious for all to see. vote pro",

            "conclusion": "Dr's role in the rising prescription drug abuse",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for instigating this debate. Before I begin, please allow me to clarify that I sympathise with the plight of my opponent's family member, and that I am equally angry at the poor conduct of her doctor. However, this will not affect the way I approach the resolution.As my opponent has not proposed a formal resolution in the form of a declarative statement, I will take the topic sentence of his paragraph as the resolution:The rise in prescription drug abuse should fall into the hands of the Dr. Thus the burden of proof is on my honourable opponent to prove that doctors have to bear the greatest responsibility in the rise in prescription drug abuse.As my opponent has not delineated a set of rules for the debate, I will take the liberty of presenting my opening arguments and refuting some of the arguments my opponent has presented. I will welcome any attempts to present and clarify the rules of this debate by my opponent, for (s)he is the instigator.Constructive arguments1) Doctors are not responsible for the underlying causes of drug abuseThe motives behind prescription drug abuse can generally be summarised thus: (1) To feel good or 'high', and experience the metal effects of the drug To relax or relief pressure To reduce appetite, boost vigilance or improve academic performance As a result of addiction To 'fit in' Even if doctors did not misprescribe, as long as these motives exist, there would always be ways for drug abusers to obtain drugs, such as by receiving drugs from those who have not fully used their medication during previous treatment processes. Conversely, without such motives, there would be no incentive for drug abusers to abuse drugs, even if there were doctors prescribing drugs improperly. This shows that doctors should not be held responsible for drug abuse itself, which should be blamed on the abusers. The rise in drug abuse should be attributed to reasons why more people are having such motivations, and not to the doctors who are simply doing their job by prescribing drugs. 2) Doctors are not responsible for the availability of drugs to abusers.The majority of teenagers who abuse prescription drugs get their drugs from relatives or friends who have been prescribed the drugs; thus doctors did not prescribe any drugs to them. (2) Thus doctors are not responsible for the fact that they have these drugs at their disposal.Even in the event where the abuser was prescribed the medicine and decided to over-dose or to use the drugs for other purposes (such as 'getting high'), the doctors have only prescribed drug according to the patient's needs: if those drugs had been taken exactly as prescribed, there would be no quantity of medicine available for future abuse. Therefore, they should not be held responsible for the availability of excess medicine, which ought to be the fault of the patients who did not take drugs according to doctors' instructions.Rebuttals 1) Explanation at the beginning'So, they see their health care provider, after the pain contract is signed by both patient and Dr, and are prescribed many forms of narcotics and I am baffled at how, Dr's cannot figure out why narcotics abuse continues to rise.'My opponent states, at the beginning of the paragraph, that the prescription of narcotics by doctors causes the rise in prescription drug abuse. However, (s)he has not yet given a clear explanation of how this has happened. It appear that (s)he has not explained this causal link clearly. By 'I am baffled at how', (s)he seems to imply that the causal link is obvious and 'goes without saying'; however, I fail to see this relationship. 2) Example of the family member's incidentMy opponent has given a detailed account of the personal experience of a loved one. However, I contend that one isolated example alone cannot prove the resolution, which is on the rise of prescription drug abuse, and implies the rise of drug abuse in society as a whole. To conclude that rampant prescription drug abuse is caused by doctors is, therefore, to over-generalise.Moreover, my opponent has not shown that his or her family member's case was related to drug abuse at all. She did not 'abuse' her drug in any way; she was simply following the prescriptions of a registered doctor, and in fact, she used fewer drugs than needed on some days. This alone is sufficient to prove that she had not abused the drugs.My opponent states that she had become addicted to the narcotics. While this may be true - it may not be, for she has terminated all her uses of narcotics and resolved not to utilise such medicine again - it does not follow that this is a case of drug abuse, which is the action of using drugs one should not be using, or using drugs in excess quantities. Addition is merely a state in which a body has become dependent on a substance or activity, or to be more precise, 'Addiction is a persistent, compulsive dependence on a behavior or substance' (3), and there is no necessary implication that the addict acts on the addiction. ObservationsMy final observation is that even if my opponent can show that this type of misprescription leads to drug abuse, it does not necessarily result in a rise thereof; it is therefore his/her responsibility to show that there has been an increase in misprescriptions which has led to an increase (positive change) in the number of drug abusers.(1) http://cliniquemedecine.com...(2) http://www.drugabuse.gov...(3) http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com...",

Also at the end of your statement you stated that coaches are able to stop athletes from consuming drug which fall on my side of the argument stating that we should drug test athletes. Public Schools - in 2002 the supreme court ruled that public schools have the legal permission to drug test their athletes -In 2005 and 2006, 373 school even received government funding to do drug tests Private Schools -They cannot be directly affected by state laws. -But they can be affected by national laws. - due to not wanting to be suspected of drug testing many private schools drug test their athletes -It is also in their best benefit to drug test their athletes because if they are taught their whole team can be eliminated from their conference and put a bad view on their team. Benefits Of Drug Testing - Many people fear that drug testing will violate a student, but in contrast there are several way these tests can be completed without violating a student. -If a student does test positive, public schools are prohibited from sending the results to any legal office; therefor, students are protected. -Along with testing positive, school officials can suspend or expelled any student from a sport. -decrease drug abuse in teens",

            "premise": "ArgumentsAntibiotics have played a huge role in saving lives. Penicillin on its own is estimated to have saved 200 million lives. [1] To be clear, I am not advocating complete disuse of antibiotics, but rather limited use in order that the antibiotics we currently have will remain effective for as long as possible. Antibiotic misuse and overuse Imagine a world without antibiotics with post-operative conditions similar to those before 1940. Not only could elective surgeries be potentially life threatening, but necessary life-saving procedures, such as organ transplants, could be rendered pointless without a method to fight off potential infections introduced in the process. This is the world we could live in without controlling misuse and overuse of antibiotics. For a long time, there have been newspaper stories and covers of magazines that talked about \u201cThe end of antibiotics, question mark?\u201d Well, now I would say you can change the title to \u201cThe end of antibiotics, period.\u201d We\u2019re here. We\u2019re in the post-antibiotic era. There are patients for whom we have no therapy, and we are literally in a position of having a patient in a bed who has an infection, something that five years ago even we could have treated, but now we can\u2019t. - Dr. Arjun Srinivasan[4] The biggest problem with using antibiotics when they're not needed is the development of antibiotic resistance, which is when bacteria survive by outsmarting the antibiotic. Common infections become difficult to treat, and when you really need an antibiotic, it may not work. - Dr. Laura Hicks The overuse and misuse of antibiotics have contributed to new strains of bacteria which are now resistant. This is contributing to \u201csuperbugs\u201d which are resistant to all antibiotics. There are currently strains of Tuberculosis which are completely resistant to all current antibiotics available [8]. Some forms of staphylococcus (MRSA) have become almost as resistant as the untreatable strains of Tuberculosis [9]. In addition to these, the CDC has set new guidelines for the use of antibiotics which leave only one drug for the routine treatment of Gonorrhea because of resistance [5]. Continued misuse/overuse will bring about more drug resistant strains of other bacteria. \u201cEach year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections.\u201d [2] Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed for situations for which they can have no impact on the illness. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections. Viral infections are a completely different beast, and are unaffected by antibiotics. To prescribe antibiotics for viral infections is misguided and harms us all - yet it happens. \u201c\u2026about half of the 100 million prescriptions written for antibiotics each year are for respiratory ailments that aren\u2019t going to be helped by a drug.\u201d [3] Some prescription for ailments, such as ear infections, are completely unnecessary since the patient\u2019s body can and will (if given the chance) fight off these infections without help. When prescribing antibiotics, doctors use the most powerful varieties 60% of the time, and out of these broad spectrum prescriptions 25% are for viruses.[7] In doing so, they are needlessly contributing to the downfall of (currently) our best defense against bacteria. We need to do away with appeasing patients (instead of educating them), prescribing antibiotics out of habit, and using these drugs when unnecessary in order to ensure their continued effectiveness. Antibiotic use in animals Antibiotic misuse is not limited to humans. In fact, humans are not the primary consumer of these miracle drugs. Approximately 80% of antibiotics used in the U.S. are being fed to animals [6]. These drugs are not primarily used to treat infections, but rather to increase growth in food animals or as a pre-emptive measure in regards to unsanitary conditions. To make matters worse, this misuse has been linked to resistant infections in humans. In 2010, Director of the CDC stated,\u201d There is strong scientific evidence of a link between antibiotic use in food animals and antibiotic resistance in humans.\u201d In 2012,the FDA stated,\u201d Misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs creates selective evolutionary pressure that enables antimicrobial resistant bacteria to increase in numbers more rapidly than antimicrobial susceptible bacteria and thus increases the opportunity for individuals to become infected by resistant bacteria\u201d. Also submitted by the FDA in 2012,\u201d In regard to antimicrobial drug use in animals, the Agency considers the most significant risk to the public health associated with antimicrobial resistance to be human exposure to food containing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria resulting from the exposure of food-producing animals to antimicrobials.\u201d Limitations placed upon the use of antibiotics in food animals could provide significant benefits to the prolonged effectiveness of these crucial drugs. I look forward to my opponents opening arguments, and will turn this over to her now. [1] http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org... [2] http://www.cdc.gov... [3] http://ideas.time.com...

What is more important- studies or medicine? It is awful when you suffer such regular problems as cystitis for instance, and have to get medication in order to treat it. Imagine if this occurs every month. How are you supposed to support yourself? When you ask if you can get support in the form of dentistry appointments, doctor\u2019s prescriptions and eyesight tests, you are usually expected to give half of the money that your parents give you for food on such things; this is ridiculous for the full-time student who barely has the means to support him/herself.",

It could be claimed that drug users have the right to not pay the tax simply by not purchasing the drugs, but this gets away from the fact that citizens should be treated equally under the law. People have the right to choose what they consume. The use of taxes to control behaviour is wrong and it is not the role of the government to decide how its citizens should behave. It is for the citizens to decide what acceptable behaviour is and for the government to implement those limitations while also not restricting basic rights. It is also important to note that imbalanced taxes show favouritism to one segment of producers vs. another. Naturally, people favour less expensive products over more expensive ones, which means that government can create unnatural market conditions that favour products that are taxed less.",

The major pharmaceutical manufacturers were invested in healing, curing disease and ameliorating symptoms that diminished quality of life. They were the \"Good Guys\". We, in the industry, trusted them. We worked with them. We had relationships with their representatives. They were good times, fine times. The average prescription was around $12.00. Generic equivalents were new to the market. Brand name dispensing was the custom. The manufacturers made money. Now, 2005, there is no doubt that the only mission Big Pharma strives for is to MAKE A PROFIT. As big a profit as they can. The idea that they are interested in curing illness is a laugher. They bring out new drugs for big illnesses \"high cholesterol\". Lipitor is or was recently the top grossing drug on the planet. As Rhett Buter said, \"Frankly, My Dear, we don't give a damn about your little, inconspicuous disease. There's no money in it. Oh, hell, stop it. We know you are going to die, but .. well, there' just NO PROFIT in it.\" Pfizer then turns to Smith-Kline Glaxo and says, \"Let's go get a drink.\" Jim Plagakis at http://www.jimplagakis.com",

            "premise": "We believe that the final think we need to do in this debate is to show that, even in a perfectly regulated market, harmful substances can be very dangerous. In the recent time the amount of deaths from overdose of drugs has been gradually increasing. The pace is amazing. Over the last few years the number of people died from overdose has become 4 to 5 times higher than during the \u201cblack tar\u201d heroin epidemics of the 1970s and more than twice what it was during the peak of cocaine-crack outbreak in the early 1990s. Also the profile of people dying from overdose has changed from poor Afro-American youngsters to working white male in their 40s. It is amazing that cocaine, heroin and amphetamines account only for about 39% of these deaths. What is happening then? The research has been conducted to explain this paradigm and it gave striking results. The huge increase in overdose deaths accounts mostly for prescription drugs. Prescription \u201cpainkillers\u201d called opioids like Vicodin OxyCondin or Methadone gained the honorable first place according to statistics. Sedatives like Valium now highly used by many people got the third place in this \u201cpeople killing\u201d competition. The number of deaths that involved prescription opioid analgesics increased from 2,900 in 1999 to 7,500 in 2004, which in other words in an increase of 160% in just 5 years. However, during the same time rates of overdose deaths from heroin or cocaine remained flat. The reason for these deaths in the first place is the increasing usage of these legal drugs. The country wide research in the US showed the positive correlation between unintentional death from overdose rates and usage of painkillers and sedatives. On the second place is abuse and misuse of these legal drugs. [[http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2008/03/t20080312b.html]] We live in society where people are constantly overwhelmed with stress and problems. Some people do sports to cope with it, some people like fishing and resting in nature, but some people use sedatives to cope with high pressure or painkillers to cancel their headache. These prescription drugs are legal since they are regarded to be more or less harmful. The evidence we gave show how even these relatively harmless drugs could cause deaths of thousands of people. Illegal drugs are now banned. One of the reasons is that they are more harmful than prescription drugs. The other one is that addiction and tolerance towards them develops very fast. Imagine now the situation after amphetamine, cocaine and heroin are legalized. They all are even better painkillers than prescription drugs and they also all are more addictive. Now people if they want to get a sedative or a painkiller have to see a doctor, explain him their problems, and only then, if the doctor considers it to be worth, they could get a recipe. If the doctor refuses in prescribing a drug, they have to think out a sophisticated way of abusing the system, which could be hard to imagine and implement. Imagine now better and more violent painkillers are legalized. People don\u2019t have to see a doctor anymore to get their recipe. They just go to a supermarket and buy a dose of heroin. It is amazing how it helps to get rid of their headache they think. The next time they have brutal headache they visit the store once again. And after one more they are hooked and have to use heroin just because otherwise their body can\u2019t function. Moreover, tolerance is developed soon. Now they have to buy not a one dose of heroin to feel the effect, but two, three or five times more. In the end police finds them drown in their vomit and report one more heroin overdose death. Statistics proves that people are very eager on dying from prescription drug overdose even now, although acquiring drugs involves significant costs of going to doctor or abusing a system. If we legalize better painkillers and sedatives, but more violent ones, which are more likely to cause death, we believe that rates of such death cases will skyrocket. Predicting that the proposition could call legal status of prescription drugs and illegal of heroin or cocaine to be unfair, we would like to say that we feel the debate to be more about what is good and what is not, rather than what is fair in relation to evil substances. We would like very much to cancel all death of such kind, but these drugs are necessary for some people. That\u2019s why we strive for stricter regulations and control. If we could alter these deaths at least partially by banning drugs, we go for it. By the way statistics we have given ruins the argument of forbidden fruit once again. The huge number of deaths from drugs accounts mostly for legal prescription drugs. The increase in these rates accounts for prescription drugs as well with rates of deaths caused by heroin and cocaine remaining flat. The amount of deaths caused by legal drugs is also higher than the amount of deaths during the epidemics of heroin in the 1970s or the outbreak of cocaine-crack in the 1990s. This proves that people chose what is easier to acquire rather than what is forbidden when making a decision. They prefer to go to a doctor and buying a prescription drug, rather than visiting a drug dealer to try out a \u201cforbidden fruit\u201d. This is because going to a doctor is legal and doesn\u2019t involve any consequences if they are caught by police. Also going to a doctor is easier because they could find the address of a hospital in the record book and don\u2019t have to search for it. However, finding a drug dealer involves searching for it and meeting him or visiting certain unpleasant places in unpleasant districts. Thus most of people prefer convenience rather than feelings from trying something forbidden. If you make serious drugs available and easy to buy, people won\u2019t stop consuming them because they are not forbidden any more. A more likely scenario is that they switch to them from prescription drugs and consume more of them, since costs involved in acquiring them (including time and the fact they are breaking the law) fall significantly. In the very end we would like to note one more mechanism of how legalization leads to an increased consumption. By putting a status \u201cillegal\u201d on something we show that it is potentially harmful and using it could cause serious consequences. Imagine if the state now legalizes drugs, it sends a clear message to public that drugs \u201care not that bad\u201d. In fact, it puts it even lower than prescription drugs in the list of potential harmfulness, since no regulations were proposed. This shows people that heroin is less harmful than Valium and they start substituting Valium for heroin, since it also helps to calm down.",

Many anti-depressants actually cause the depression to become worse often times leading to suicidal thoughts. Pain killers and muscle relaxers cause many of their legal users into addicts whose consumption spirals out of control and ruins their lives. Many drugs taken for cancer or aids patients have DEATH as a side effect on the label. Theses are drugs that are completely legal with a prescription and yet they can cause more damage than the ailment they were being used to treat. People taking these often times have to take other prescriptions to counter another. The fact of the matter is prescription drugs carry many of the same risks as illegal ones when abused. http://news.yahoo.com... http://www.webmd.com...",

            "premise": "Drug importation and establishing drug-buying pools where businesses and companies could intervene and use their combined buying power to reduce the prices of drugs for individuals, could improve the expenditure on expensive drugs for the Average Joe. If drug-prices keep on increasing with inflation then there will be a substantial refusal to purchase these drugs and this will cause problems for both the ill and the drug companies. It is impossible as an individual to buy in bulk and reduce prices generally because when you only need a specific prescription, you will be wasting the drugs that you are buying in bulk. The Government could save more than \u00a3300m a year by being more efficient when prescribing drugs. GPs could make more use of cheaper, non-brand versions of the drugs, without harming care. An example of the NHS overpricing drugs: one treatment for gastric problems, Omeprazole, can be bought from wholesalers for between \u00a32.50 and \u00a33.40, yet the NHS pays \u00a310.85 every time it is prescribed GPs often over-prescribe and \u00a3100m at least could be saved by them being more careful in this matter(1).

            "premise": "What is OxyContin? OxyContin is a drug and the brand name by which Oxycodone is known. When you buy OxyContin online, You take it because it is prescribed for the treatment of symptoms of moderate to severe pain. However, If you\"re planning to buy OxyContin without a prescription, You must remember that the drug has its set of side effects which can affect you depending on the amount of medication you have taken and the duration for which the drug has been received. The drug can also produce a feeling of euphoric high and because of which people mainly abuse the drug. What are the side effects of OxyContin? Generally, When people buy OxyContin online, They are given the option of order OxyContin online overnight delivery or order OxyContin overnight delivery from the USA. Along with that, They are provided with a prescription if they buy the drug from an online pharmacy that can present with a prescription. The prescription not only helps them in knowing a lot about the medicine but tells how and when to start and stop the intake. However, Most people choose to buy OxyContin without a prescription and end up becoming a victim of the drug\"s side effects and also of the drug\"s withdrawal symptoms when they suddenly stop the intake. Some of the side effects of OxyContin abuse are:- Drowsiness Finding it challenging to operate machinery or drive while being under the influence of the drug Pinpoint pupils Constipation There are some more side effects of the drug which remain for a long-term like:- Severe constipation and persistent vomiting Spasms in muscles Slowing the rate at which the heart and the lungs deliver oxygen to the brain and other vital organ systems Why some people prefer to buy OxyContin without a prescription? We already told you that people buy OxyContin online because it is a drug prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, We would also like to warn you that most people prefer to buy OxyContin without a prescription instead of order OxyContin online overnight delivery or order OxyContin overnight delivery from the USA. Some of these people are those who don\"t know anything about the drug and end up taking it without having the symptoms of moderate to severe pain in the first place. That is why we would recommend that one should buy OxyContin online and from an online pharmacy which can provide a prescription.",

            "discussionTitle": "Drugs should be decriminalized",
            "conclusion": "Drugs should be decriminalized",
            "premise": "\"You probably won't get caught doing drugs\" Here's the problem. First of all, thanks to the popularization of crime shows like CSI, it's getting harder and harder for police to catch criminals, granted that the criminals are not idiots. Its the same for Drugs. If you work hard not to get caught, chances are, you won't. But, like murder, if you openly do drugs in the middle of the mall, chances are, you will be caught. In this sense, EVERY crime is the same. For those who think it through, trying not to get caught, chances are they won't. However, this is the part that i do not quite understand about my opponents arguments. My opponent has claimed that \"no punishment would really be a very successful deterrent\". Yet, the punishment for Drugs, is fairly similar to that of most other crimes. You pay fines and go to jail. Clearly this, as my opponent has stated, is a deterrent to prevent people from stealing, Murdering, and anything else. If you don't care about going to jail, i suppose this would not be a deterrent. But isn't this the same for any other crime? If you don't care about going to jail, how is jail-time a deterrent for Murder? Not all drugs are addictive, and not all drugs are addictive to the same degree, either. Id also like to ask my opponent what he means exactly by \"neither are Particularly enforceable\". I don't understand that either, as the drug laws have been enforced, which is obvious when we look at the statistics of how many people have been caught and placed in jail. \"I know you will say that drugs do too, but notice that drunk driving is illegal, and drinking is not.\" Ive had a bottle of beer once, and drove, was stopped at a checkpoint, talked to the officer, told him i had one beer, and was left off. Clearly i had been drinking, and now i was driving. Now, why was I let off? The answer is simple. Because, in small quantities, the effects of alcohol are extremely benign. The officer knew this, and I knew this. I can have a drink or two and be completely level-headed. Can the same be said of other Drugs? If a single hit of LSD causes me to hallucinate and become paranoid, is LSD as benign as alcohol? Can i drive? This is the main difference between Alcohol and Drugs. There are benign drugs, sure. Some anti-depressants are a more milder form of Ecstasy, for example, and are not illegal at all. But harder drugs, drugs that cause hallucination and paranoia, drugs that are TAKEN for that very effect, are dangerous. And these drugs are not benign in small quantities. \"But we're talking about adults here. The same adults who can smoke and drink.\" This comment I made was in direct response to your previous comment on how it would boost the economy and help with taxes, if we legalize drugs. Clearly you've missed the point. Whether we use the sale of Fully automatic firearms as an example, is irrespective of the point I was trying to make. There are many things which are restricted, Child and adult alike. The reason why we restrict them is because the potential harms, overwhelming outweigh the benefits. We don't let adults buy and sell nuclear weapons, because there couldn't possibly be a benefit for such a thing to occur, regardless of whether it will boost our economy. What possible benefit is there, for someone who becomes addicted to Cocaine? \"But these have to have a prescription from a doctor. To drink alcohol, you just have to be 21.\" Already explained the difference between Drugs and Alcohol, but here's the short version. Many prescription drugs are affected by different body chemistry, including high and low blood sugar, previous heart problems, etc. The dosage changes with height, weight, age. These things could only be known by your family doctor. Alcohol, on the other hand, will not change its effect regardless of whatever previous condition you might have. There only about 1300-1400 deaths directly attributed to alcohol poisoning(1), yet there are a whopping 20,000 people die from prescription drug overdoses alone.(2) \"Shall I go do field research before I finish this debate?\" It seems like common sense to me. I mean, I can't find a reason why a drug cartel would kill their loyal customers who are addicted to their drugs, unless the customer is refusing to pay. I didn't twist anything. You made a nonsensical point, and i called you out on it. If you are also unaware of what's happening and who is getting killed in Mexico by the drug wars, i suggest you refrain from making absurd claims like \"Why would anybody support the drug cartels who kill you\". \"How much do we care about profitability?\" You're kidding me, right? \"Alternatively, we could give it to private businesses \" How would the outcome differ? If anything, private businesses would care MORE about profitability, and therefore increase their prices BEYOND that of what the government would sell. I think your point has failed here. \"it's necessary to run background checks and get licenses and stuff\" This argument fails when you consider how easy it is to get, for example, long guns and handguns. In some states such as Alabama, Long guns require no background checks, and no licenses if you are not carrying the weapon around. \"The government doesn't exist to stop our bad habits, so it doesn't really matter how bad it is for you.\" Actually, yes, the government does exist to stop us from causing potential harm to ourselves. Its why the FDA exists. Why do you think the FDA forces drug companies to prove that their product is SAFE, before placing them on shelves? \"Now, tell me, how many cigarette smokers are social smokers who are not addicted?\" Great. Now i get to tell you the difference between Cigarettes and Cocaine. Can you overdose on cigarettes? Plain and simple. And BTW, it was the government who pushed the bill, requiring ALL cigarette packages to label their product as potentially causing cancer. \"Still, how many people already die of accidental (or, perhaps, not accidental) overdoses? This is really not very different.\" Boy, will your face be red when you read my arguments... \"It's proven that smoking puts you at a higher risk for lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, etc., but it's legal.\" Again, this is the difference. You could never overdose on fatty foods, nor eating fatty foods all your life does not necessarily mean you will die of heart attacks. The same doesn't go for Drugs. You could overdose very VERY easily on drugs, yet you could eat and eat mcdonalds until your stomach is about to burst and STILL not die of a heart attack.(3) \"How does this negate the resolution?\" It negates your point about police officers. \"We can legalize anything with restrictions and regulations. Point completely negated.\" This is what we currently have, though. What do you think prescription drugs are? What do you think Vicodin, Morphine, Oxycontin, LSD, Diazepam, and Ketamine, are? These are ALL drugs that HAVE restrictions AND are regulated. These are what we CALL PRESCRIPTION drugs. This isn't at all what you are trying to advocate. What you are trying to advocate, is essentially ONE restriction, ONE regulation, which is nicely summed up in the next sentence: \"Only adults can buy them. They have to be tested and approved.\" Tested and approved for what, exactly? In the end, it comes down to two criterions: -The potential to abuse the substance -The potential harm of the substance For aclohol, both criterions are fairly low. For cigs, one is high but the other is low. For Drugs, BOTH are high. Sources 1. http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov... 2. http://www.cdc.gov... 3. http://news.injuryboard.com...",

            "conclusion": "Adderall usage in college students without prescription",
            "premise": "To address your first statement I would also like to point out that the use of Adderall without a prescription is also controversial, which is why we are having this debate in the first place. I would also like to disagree with you in your statement that \"the university classroom is competitive to a much less extent.\" Academics are extremely competitive in today's world which is exactly why many students take these drugs so they can get better grades than others. If it weren't so competitive then there would be no incentive to take the drugs and we wouldn't be having this debate. Also, there are times when one student taking Adderall to take an advantage can be bad for other students. I personally know several people who have taken Adderall for the SAT and ACT in order to get higher scores which is one of the major factors that schools look at when admitting students. Given the amount of people that I alone know who did this and that 20% of students admit to taking Adderall without a prescription, I think it would be safe to assume that there is a large number of students following this same trend. The problem with this is that those who decide not to take it for whatever reason may end up not getting admitted to the same college as the other person because of their test scores. http://serendip.brynmawr.edu... I also like to say that my opponent's comparison of Adderall to coffee is absurd. I would like to restate that you do not need a prescription to obtain coffee for a reason. Adderall was created for a completely different purpose than coffee. It is a drug that is manufactured specifically for people with a real mental condition. I don't think that feeling tired in the morning can be classified as a mental condition...I have never drank coffee in my life and have never needed to. People who actually have ADHD don't take Adderall because it helps them wake up in the morning they take it because they need it to function normally. Also, coffee affects the dopamine system to a far lesser degree than drugs like Ritalin and Adderall. As for your argument about prohibition and slavery, my statement that taking Adderall without a prescription is unethical because it is illegal is merely a minor supplement to my argument, not the sole basis. The idea that anything that is illegal is unethical to do is obviously not always the case. The fact that it is illegal is just another reason why it is unethical. In this case, I think it is clear that it should be illegal for anyone without a prescription to take the drug, otherwise what's the use in requiring a prescription. It seems to me, given your previous statements, that you are arguing that anyone should legally be able to get any prescription drug without a prescription? The fact that it is so easy for many people to acquire a prescription is part of the problem. Yes, it is definitely unethical for people who do not have ADHD to take Adderall since the drug was meant to help people with this mental condition. Lying in order to acquire a prescription for Adderall in order to get better grades is completely unethical, especially if you are using it simply to get an advantage in school because that is obviously not what the drug was intended for. In conclusion, I think the cons far outweigh the pros when it comes to non-prescription usage of Adderall. It requires a prescription for a good reason (albeit with lenient standards--those of which I think should be stricter). Thank you. I have thoroughly enjoyed our debate.",

These prices, for the fiscal year 2010, was $1,841,500 PER APPLICATION. In total, there were payments made to the FDA as follows: Application fees -- $172,238, 150 Establishment fees -- $183,328,513 Product fees -- $173,709,880 Total fees collected (just for Prescription Drug User Fee Act fees) -- $529,276,543 This can be seen at: http://blogs.plos.org...;It can also be seen directly from the FDA here: http://www.fda.gov... Forbes also reports that properly adjusting for drug trials as is required by the FDA, 1 single new drug can cost a staggering $12 billion dollars, including clinical trials which can cost as much as $100 million a piece. http://www.forbes.com...;On top of these staggering costs brought forward just by the FDA, medscape.com, one the most FDA friendly review sites on the net reports that the process of getting a new medication from idea to market, is about 12 years. http://www.medscape.com...;Next is the Affordable Care Act's new Pharnmaceutical Tax which by itself is costing between $3 billion - $4 billion to each manufacturing company each year. http://www.irs.gov...;Worst part is, this only accounts for the FDA; this does NOT account for fire code, health code, OSHA, local taxes, state taxes, federal taxes, etc. Let's think about taxes for a second here: The U.S. currently has a 35%-39% federal corporate tax rate which is 3rd highest on the planet. There are then the state taxes of an average of 10%, followed by the local taxes which average 4.5%. That's an average total of 54% paid in taxes to the government annually. http://www.ey.com...;All of these expendatures outlined, it's not a wonder why prices for medications in America are so darn high.",

            "discussionTitle": "The United States government should reform drug patent time limits.",
            "conclusion": "The United States government should reform drug patent time limits.",
            "premise": "Drug patent time limits are defined as the 15 years given to the inventor or developer of a prescription drug to have exclusive rights to selling and distributing the drug without having to compete with generic brands of their product. This allows prescription drug manufacturers to artificially raise prices, slow down the process of research and development, and to eliminate all competition for an overly extended period of time. Drug patent time limits are benefical in allowing drug producers to be rewarded and compensated for their research in developing new medicines, however, by allowing an overly extended amount of time, it is slowing down the progression of modern medicine and defeating American capitalism through excessive regulation. In a capitalist society, the government should only regulate to the point where there is an incentive to produce. That point lies where the firm initially begins to earn economic profits. A perfectly competitive industry allows other companies to enter the industry at this point. At this point there are only variable costs and the costs of production should be equal between corporations. Now the firms may ablely compete for the purchasing powers of its citizens. The fatally flawed drug patent hinders this from happening. The affirmative proposes a system that will oppose the Con's case supporting the status quo: 7 years would be alloted as a drug patent, with the normal abilities of extension being available to the corporation. The average extension ranges from 5 to 7 years, giving a total estimated patent to the pharmaceutical corporation of 12-14 years, in comparison to the 25-27 years that you are defending. The appeals process, which is legal and cannot be banned without being in contradiction of many standing laws, is a permanent fixture in the system. The drug patents lead the consumer to believe that, due to its excessive period of exclusive rights, that generic drugs are inferior to their original drug, while they are in fact the exact same product. Allowing for the abuse of the drug patent system while corporations continue to amount massive profits is monopolistic and unhealthy for both the American economy and the future of American medicine and pharmaceuticals. Modern American capitalism with government regulation holds anti-trust laws that prevent patents from being absolute. If the best drug is to survive, then it is with respect to generic drugs. However, generic drugs are equal to the original drug, so the competition playing field is relatively equal. A National Center for Policy Analysis study criticized this corporate splurging, and cited that less than 1/3 of profits are spent towards research in development, in comparison to over 50% on advertisement during the original time of the patent. However, during the last 3 years of the drug's exclusive rights overall, the corporation actually increases its advertising spending heading in to the surfacing of generic drugs. In terms of the incentives for the Affirmative's plan, the incentive to create lies in the company's ability to maximize profits over a period of time, but making this period of time shorter would not act as a disincentive. Even after the profit maximization, they still hold the upperhand in the opinion of the consumers and usually tend to charge more than the generic drugs will charge, despite the bioequivalency of the two drugs and the equally similar costs of production. An economic incentive is given even if the drug manufacturer is given a few months to exclusively market and sell its drug. Thanks, The Colonel",

Just think of all of those people who can't consume milk because there bodies reject or cannot tolerate it. Humans should not be consuming painkillers as painkillers are very hard on our bodies and inhibit our bodies natural ability to sense pain in response to an outside stimuli. Any drug that affects your brain chemicals should not be taken unless absolutely necessary. Thousands of people die every year as a result of accidents with prescription pain killers and prescribed medication. Bringing attention back to caffeine, Caffeine I'll admit for most people is ok as in they will not be debilitated by it at least in the present. But that does not mean that caffeine is safe on our bodies long term health. The effects of caffeine on our bodies in the long term is unknown and therefore should be avoided.",

            "discussionTitle": "The FDA Does More Harm Than Good",
            "conclusion": "The FDA Does More Harm Than Good",
            "premise": "I will respond to each of Con's rebuttals. 1. That earlier attempts at prohibiting alcohol failed doesn't change the fact that the FDA allows you to use these dangerous substances while restricting access to widely used, low-risk medicines, like antibiotics. Here's another example for a non-recreational drug: Tylenol is available over the counter and yet it is quite easy to overdose on it, which can cause deadly liver failure. Why can you buy Tylenol without a prescription, but you can't get an antibiotic for your throat infection without spending time and money visiting a doctor? http://1.usa.gov... 2. \"If the FDA feels that something should be taken off the market, inspected, and then re-approved to be out on the market to protect consumers than there is nothing wrong with that.\" I don't think the manufacturers of these drugs, who have been doing so safely for decades, or the people who would rather buy these drugs for much less then the 'approved' prescription versions, feel that there is 'nothing wrong with that.' And if Con is worried about bias, perhaps he shouldn't cite the FDA's explanation of why it's necessary to support his pro-FDA argument. As for dietary supplements, I never said that they couldn't be dangerous. Too much of anything is dangerous. However, Con's references prove that the FDA needn't get involved in the regulation of dietary supplements- both media outlets and research groups such as Consumer Reports have done a fine job of letting people know that they should take care when taking dietary supplements. Con's definition of 'drug' is, in fact, the government's definition of a drug (from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). And unsurprisingly, it is so vague as to put anything that you consume regarding your health under the jurisdiction of the government. It's also unsurprising that the FDA would attempt to regulate Cheerios because the box claimed that eating them was 'clinically proven to reduce cholesterol.' It is by the nature of the food that Cheerios was touted to be healthy, not because it was altering a chemical process in your body like a pharmaceutical drug. As such, General Mills was not attempting to defraud or otherwise trick people into buying their product because of its claim to reduce cholesterol. http://1.usa.gov... The FDA asserted that \"these claims indicate that Cheerios\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is intended for use in lowering cholesterol, and therefore in preventing, mitigating, and treating the disease hypercholesterolemia.\" Any rational person can tell that Cheerios was NOT intended by General Mills to be \u2018used for lowing cholesterol,' but that by consuming Cheerios as food, you may also enjoy some health benefits. Therefore the FDA's actions here cannot be defended as being for the public good, as there was no evidence the General Mills was being fraudulent, nor was there evidence that the offending labeling put anybody in danger. It is much more likely that, given the evidence of FDA corruption cited in my second round, drug companies and not consumers had something to lose while these cholesterol claims were on the Cheerios box. If a doctor gives a patient the option to change their diet or go on medication, they may be more inclined to change their diet, knowing foods like Cheerios can help reduce their cholesterol, rather than solicit the drug companies. Regarding example 4, the article isn't 'biased' as much as it's simply explaining how the FDA allowed drugs that were known to cause dangerous side-effects to be on the market, while not allowing alternatives that had been proven to be effective and safe to be sold. The conclusion is that the FDA's actions have led to needless deaths, which is reflected in the title. 3. I never argued that the FDA is harmful because it's not perfect. People make mistakes. However, it has been slow to remove some dangerous drugs from the market, such as Rofecoxib (Vioxx), as referenced in round 2, point 3, examples 2 and 4. Since the FDA controls what drugs are allowed to be sold, it must be trusted as the authoritative source for \u2018safe' drugs. But its conflicts of interest (see round 2, point 2), questionable safety record (see point 3), and lack of competitors make it a less than ideal authority. Here is a link to an interview with Dr. David Graham, a longtime member of the FDA, who called out the FDA on the Vioxx debacle. In it he explains how the FDA protects the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of patient safety and the multitude of conflicts of interest that cloud the agency's judgment. http://www.naturalnews.com... 4. Con asserts \"\u2026companies must go through far more vigorous experimentation to ensure that whatever drug they are manufacturing is up to date with safety codes, because if it isnt a couple thousand dollars saved on a drug could end up as a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the company.\" This sounds like a pretty big incentive for drug companies make sure their drugs are safe, regardless of what FDA regulations mandate. As it is, FDA's ever-increasing list of demands have increased the cost of developing new drugs without a comparable increase in patient safety. Of the 33 drugs on the following list of drugs recalled by the FDA since 1980, 21 of them had been approved since 1990. (I'll link the list again) http://bit.ly... Another thing to think about is that the big pharmaceutical companies can afford to pay for the costs of approving new drugs, while small laboratories are much less able to do so. In addition, because the FDA is the sole determiner of what drugs are legal to sell, any increases in development costs go directly to the consumer and are industry-wide. This creates a cartel-like situation for the big drug companies, since they can charge more and more for their drugs and they don't have to worry about low-cost alternatives. In conclusion: yes, the FDA's control of the drug market allows for a semi-independent judge of which drugs are safe and which are not, and its actions may have been helpful in some cases. However, the Con's assertion that drugs and medical equipment \"would not go through any kind of inspection or testing and corporations would begin to market just about anything to make a quick buck while consumers pay the price\" is unfounded. Would you go buy medicine that wasn't approved by anybody except the company that manufactured it and had no history of safe use? Of course not. Consumers want to be as sure as possible that the drugs they take are safe, and consumer safety laboratories could sufficiently perform that task more objectively and less expensively then the FDA. By having competition between \u2018drug safety' laboratories (see my final link in round 2), they would be very careful to ensure the safety of the drugs they inspect. Something akin to the Vioxx incident in the FDA would spell bad news for that 'safety' laboratory, where the FDA, a monopoly, can continue, unchanged. Drug companies would be more than willing to submit their drugs for testing, since an unapproved drug would find few buyers in the market. The FDA's total control of the drug market breeds corruption and has led to the highest-priced prescription market in the world. http://bit.ly... It has limited patients' access to safe and effective treatments while allowing dangerous prescriptions to be sold. It can pick and choose what drugs require prescriptions and which don't, with these decisions reflecting little on the danger of the drug (Alcohol, Tobacco, & OTC Tylenol vs. Prescription Amoxacillin). It restricts the rights of patients to use whatever treatments they and their doctor deem appropriate, such as experimental treatments for a terminal condition. For these reasons and more, the FDA does more harm than good, and patients would not only be just as safe with private laboratories doing the safety testing, but would have more and lower-cost treatment options.",

            "conclusion": "End the War on Drugs...",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his response and will respond to his points. But first, a statement: My opponent has commented that he wishes an alcohol/cigarette style limitation on these drugs. And I shall debate accordingly. \"Here my opponent commits a strawman fallacy, misrepresenting my position.\" I apologize for the mistake but must correct my opponent. A strawman fallacy was not made because I did not deliberately attack a misrepresented point, nor did I base an argument on that misrepresentation. Hence, it cannot be aptly named \"strawman fallacy\". \"My opponent only addresses my point about drugs only affecting the user, ignoring all of the other benefits to legalization.\" I do not deny that there are all those other benefits should the legalization of all drugs go exactly according to your plan. However, my argument is that because we are in a managed care system of health care, none of those benefits will be realized as you set forth in your argument. \"Fair enough. Drug use is dangerous.\" Then my opponent concedes that the drugs he wishes to legalize and make freely available to the public will, to the person, cause great injury for no medicinal purpose. We now go to my opponent's rebuttal of my main argument. \"First, what about all of the illegal drug users right now who have health insurance? They are covered, and yet society is not falling apart. If anything, legalization will help with this issue, because when drugs become less dangerous, people will consume less insurance.\" The illegal drug users now are limited because there are few of them. Legalizing all illicit drugs will absolutely cause the number of addicts to skyrocket. More users means more addicts, these illegal drugs are addictive by their very nature and in order to even be effective recreationally, an amount that causes dependence and addiction needs to be taken. This means that every recreational drug user will 100% become a burden on the health care system. In addition, the legalization of these drugs would lead to a substantial number of potentially fatal drug-drug interactions between regular prescription drugs. One does not even have to be an addict, only on a certain medication or dietary supplement to receive health problems. \"Second, alcohol and tobacco are legal in the United States. Users of these two very dangerous drugs are covered by health insurance, and yet the system is not falling apart.\" To already classify alcohol and tobacco as \"very dangerous\" would leave few applicable descriptions for the three drugs my opponent wishes to legalize. Compared to alcohol and tobacco, the drugs cocaine, heroine, and ecstasy are far, FAR more deadly. The quantities in which alcohol and nicotine would cause fatality is astronomical in comparison to that of the three illegal drugs, there is absolutely no comparison. Users of alcohol and nicotine can be relatively healthy for decades and decades, but those who use cocaine, heroin, or ecstasy will begin suffering intensely in less than a year. \"What about people who abuse legal narcotics, such as oxycontin? My opponent assumes too much, and his argument simply does not hold water when we consider the facts.\" The number of people who abuse prescription medications is few. Pharmacists are trained to detect drug-seeking behavior and the fact that a prescription is needed in order to obtain this medication makes it very easy to catch those who are drug abusers. The DEA is also heavily invested in catching overuse of these medications and they are very, VERY tightly regulated. Much more so than tobacco or alcohol. Oxycodone is essentially a substantially safer version of Heroin, with less addictive nature, much less side effects, and better medical use. The facts are not on my opponent's side for this point. \"Countries with high alcohol and tobacco taxes do not suffer from this problem.\" There are plenty of safe ways to enjoy alcohol and tobacco, but for those three drugs I mentioned? The recreational aspect is necessarily linked with all the properties that are destructive to health. In addition, those who drink casually or smoke casually do not necessarily get addicted. To make cocaine, heroin, or ecstasy use anything remotely definable as a \"habit\" is suicide. **** There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of chemical substances available for medical use that would kill a person in seconds if ingested, in a dose that you can barely fit on your fingernail. Thankfully, there are rules and regulations that protect people from having these drugs readily available. In addition, for any drug that one can become addicted to, there are series of rules and regulations preventing abuse and further addiction. Not only that, but there are drugs which can easily react with not only other prescription medications, but also over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, or even food. Luckily, pharmacies can keep track of those and warn people about the dangers of potentially fatal interactions. The sleeping pill \"Ambien\", generic name Zolpidem, is a controlled substance because it is habit forming. One cannot get this medication without a prescription. My opponent has clarified that the regulations for these drugs should be the same as tobacco and alcohol. My opponent is suggesting that we take the world's deadliest, most addictive drugs, substances with absolutely no medical usage, and make it available to everyone with a 21 license, in whatever quantity they wish, so long as they have the money, making them more available than Ambien. But let's set aside the absurdity of this proposal. Let's go back to Health Insurance. My opponent thinks that because alcohol and cigarettes are fine, then so must these drugs. He is very, very poorly informed. My opponent's comparison of Cocaine, Heroin, and Ecstasy with tobacco and alcohol is completely unfounded. The addictive nature of these drugs as well as the inherent danger to one's health simply cannot be compared to that of tobacco or alcohol. The very thought of such a comparison is ludicrous. What my opponent does not understand is that there is absolutely no safe way to take these three drugs recreationally. To make it available for recreational use is, for all intents and purposes, to turn them into addicts and destroy their health. Normally, that would be okay with my opponent because of his stance on personal liberty. Health insurance is hideously expensive already. The more meds people take, the more sick they get, the more hospital visits, the more expensive for everyone. With all of these addicts popping up, regular people who think legal = safe, people who ignorantly think as my opponent does: That the deadliest, most addictive drugs in the world are like sipping a wine cooler or a smoking a newport, do you really want to pay the hospital bills for people this irresponsible?",

            "premise": "The Problem I find with the Laws of Logic is that they are a description not a prescription. In other words, the laws are simply a description of things we know to be true. The universe does not conform to logical absolutes because someone thought them up and is holding reality to that standard. These absolutes exist purely to describe patterns that we have observed as true in reality. To understand the difference between a descriptive and prescriptive law, consider this example: Gravity is a descriptive law. Isaac Newton didn\"t create gravity. It existed before he identified it and would have continued existing regardless of whether he had ever given it a name. The laws of gravity are simply observations made by scientists that explain natural processes.The traffic speed limit is a prescriptive law. It was created and enforced by people, and it\"s meaningless without such enforcement. If no one came up with a speeding limit or held people accountable for speeding, speed limits would cease to exist. In the same way, the laws of logic are descriptive. No one made them up or wrote them in a handbook somewhere for them to exist. They were simply observed as always being true (rocks are always rocks because if a rock were anything else, it would cease to be a rock). Because the laws of logic are not prescriptive, they do not require the mind of a deity or any other mind to exist. Human minds can identify them and put them into words, but the phenomena these laws refer to would continue to exist regardless of whether a deity or anyone else thought about them.What this means is that these descriptions themselves are what is purely conceptual. But the laws they describe are not conceptual. What these laws refer to is the consistency of existence, which exists whether or not they\"re being described or identified by a mind. A rock is always a rock because it exists in reality. If there were no mind to observe the rock, it would still be a rock. Minds are necessary only to describe that phenomenon, not to make it true.",

            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for accepting. I'm looking forward to an excellent debate. My main contentions are -- 1. Energy Drinks have detrimental effects to the body. 2. Energy Drinks behave like drugs. Definitions: Regulate = (According to U.S. Congress) to control the amount of something in an official manner. In this case, we will be discussing the regulation of the amount of caffeine in the energy drink. Energy Drink = Drink with extremely high amounts of caffeine, taurine, & other dangerous substances. 1. Energy Drinks have detrimental effects to the body. The consumption of energy drinks can have very dangerous & unhealthy side effects. A long-term effects of energy drink ingredients is addiction. Caffeine withdrawal is also an extremely common effect correlated with energy drinks. The problem is, the section that the energy drinks are currently put in is \"dietary supplements\", which is very misleading as consumers think it\"s good for them. Regulation will fix this & bring attention to these harmful products! According to the American College of Medical Toxicology: 43% of people who use energy drinks report poor sleep & increased inattention throughout the following day, rather than the supposed \"benefits\". All these side effects can do very harmful things. Esp. for teenagers, poor sleep can result in bad growing habits. This will lead to bad study habits as well. Also, 67% of all teens take Energy Drinks to stay up late & study, but this can actually be very bad for their bodies. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine: Energy drinks have no nutritional benefit. When teens consume energy drinks, they believe that it provides benefits due to its misleading categorization, while in reality no benefits really happen. Not only does it harm the consumer, these drinks aren\"t even doing what they\"re supposed to do! According to the Miami Herald: 4 athletes, who were all previously healthy, were sent to the hospital after consuming an energy drink before exercising. Let\"s think about this for a moment. How would perfectly healthy bodies with fully mature systems get sent to a hospital after consuming energy drinks? What would happen to the children, whose systems aren\"t even fully developed yet? This is what regulation will prevent! 2. Energy drinks behave like drugs. There is a worry that young people will experience the \"gateway\" effect: the concept that addiction to energy drinks could make it more likely for one to move on to riskier substances such as illegal drugs. This is why energy drinks are the new \"gateway\" drug. According to National Science Board: People that drank energy drinks are 2 times more likely to abuse alcohol, smoke marijuana, etc. compared to people who don't. Also, energy drinks cause consumers to become addicted, making it nearly impossible to stop drinking. When they try to stop, withdrawal and a variety of harmful symptoms, occur. According to the Fitness Magazine: Energy drink consumers are more likely to get withdrawal symptoms & pain than smokers or alcohol consumers. Withdrawal is the behavior of a drug. Thus, shouldn\"t we regulate it as a drug? Also, coming back from addiction is extremely hard, like going up a waterfall once you already jumped down. When it gets to the point that the addiction causes a consumer\"s body to not function properly with o taking it daily, something needs to be done. According to the FDA: Caffeine is a drug. It is clear that some of our bodies are not able to handle the combination of caffeine with other ingredients such as Taurine, Gurana and Ginseng in Energy drinks. Moreover, energy drink manufacturers are misleading the consumer by throwing in some vitamin additives to show that it is good for the consumer. This concludes my argument. I'm looking forward to my opponent's response.",

            "premise": "In my opponents argument, he said that although being physically dependent on a drug is bad, it shouldn't be criminalized. This I agree with. No consumer of a drug should be criminalized and it should be considered a medical issue - of addiction and dependence. Those selling, growing and distributing that drug though, should be criminalized. If it were legal, as the proposition says, then it would only take one try of that drug to become addicted - or frequent use will have the same effect. To per-empt, that physical addiction and spare many the painful steps of withdrawal, it should be banned from being sold. Now, my position is that no-one should be criminally prosecuted for taking drugs. Instead they should be offered medical help. For those drugs that are too addictive, it should be stopped from being sold (or at least be changed and regulated to make it less addictive). Think about it this way. If a product doesn't fit with food/drink/drug regulations to make them safer and less addictive, then it can't be sold and is as such \"illegal\". Why should drugs be any different. If some drugs are too dangerous or addictive and it fails to be regulated to change that, then it shouldn't be sold and should be \"illegal\". Therefore, to argue that all drugs should be legal to consume, you are therefore arguing that there would be no regulation. If you tried to regulate it, some drugs will still not be allowed to be sold and go into the black-market, making it illegal. For all drugs therefore to be legal all regulation on medical, recreational or pharmaceutical drugs would have to be taken away. Not everything can be legal. Are companies allowed to put anything they want into our food or medical drugs? No, and rightly so. Some drugs and food do not meet our regulations and are illegal. This shouldn't change.",

            "discussionTitle": "Drugs should be decriminalized",
            "conclusion": "Drugs should be decriminalized",
            "premise": "I suppose ill take up this debate, as my last debate was a bust. First, i will like to thank my opponent for making this debate. I will address his points first, and then move onto my own. \"We've now been fighting a \"war on drugs\" for decades. People still do drugs.\" Sure, people still do drugs. Just like people still murder other people. I mean, has there been a single criminalization of anything, which completely deterred people from doing the said thing? I cant think of any. \"It also tells us that 20% of our prison population is not in prison for harming someone or their property.\" I fail to see the logic in this argument, either. If the criterion for jail was simply harming someone else or their property, where would the drunk drivers go? Illegal Gun possession? These are all things that do not necessarily harm other people or their property, just like Drugs. Should we let these guys go as well? \"If we were to allow drugs to be sold, it would certainly help the economy.\" Of course it would! Just like lowering the drinking age to 12, would also boost the economy, increase tax revenue. Imagine if kids didn't need to go out and get a fake ID, and could just walk into any liquor store and buy drinks. It would be great for the economy. Why don't we do it? Because, we have standards, and one of those standards is to decrease the possible number of accidents and mishaps. And one way to do this is to place restrictions. Currently, we have drugs that are available to the public if properly prescribed, such as Vicodin(an Opiate), Marijuana, MDMA(A.K.A Ecstasy, currently being used to treat disorders like PTSD)(1). But, much like alcohol, there are restrictions in place, to prevent just anyone going out and buying these. \"Why would anybody support the drug cartels who kill you when you can get drugs for cheaper and without getting shot or losing fingers?\" First of all, why would the drug cartels kill you for no reason? It would make more sense to keep you alive, especially if you were a customer. Secondly, here's the problem with your argument. Suppose that the Government produces specific factories to produce Drugs. What would the Government have to pay them? The standard minimum salary, of course. What do Drug Cartels have to pay their lowest employees? Whatever they want to, including below-minimum pay. They probably will, as all they care about is money. However, now we have a conundrum. We have the government-made Drugs, that cost hundreds of dollars(Just take a look at the US Drug market.)(2) And, we have the cheap-labor prices of the drug cartels. Now, if you were a Drug addict who spent most of your money on the safer, store-sold drugs, what would you do? \"There are two groups of people who would be hurt by drug legalization: Drug dealers and police officers.\" This is possibly the most absurd argument that my opponent has made yet. Drug dealers will not be as hurt as you may think. Guns, which are legal, are a great example. Are gun-runners being hurt by the fact that there are legal Guns out there? Or has their business stayed the same, because it is more tedious and cost more to buy them legally?(3) As for officers, not at all. I will explain more later. Now, onto my own arguments. 1. My opponent has brought up Alcohol and prohibition as a parallel to this situation. I think it's a very poor example, and here's why. Alcohol, in moderation, has very little effect on the body. As with any substance, including Nutmeg, taking too much can be detrimental. However, small doses of Alcohol merely lightens moods and warms the body. Can the same be said of most illegal drugs? Here's a good question to ask. How many social drinkers are there? I would estimate that at least 90% of people who drink, are not Alcoholics or otherwise dependent on alcohol. Now, how many social Cocaine users are there? Clearly much less, to the point that i would guess 10% of people who use Cocaine are not addicted or dependent on it. This is, of course, because Cocaine is much, much, much more addictive than your average beer, and much harder to shave off. Its the reason why AA meetings are just that, meetings, while Drug rehabilitation clinics requires an entire building. Clearly Alcohol is a poor example, as it does not even come close to the detrimental effects of Drugs. 2. Many drugs, are prescription drugs for a reason. The main reasons, are: -Drug Conflicts. If you are taking two or more drugs, unless you are a doctor, you do not know how these drugs interact. Which is why, many prescription drugs are prescribed by a doctor who knows your family history and medical history. These drugs are in fact dangerous in the right combination. -Reduce addiction. As said above, there are many drugs that are highly addictive. To reduce this risk, the drugs are prescribed to people who actually need them, and in specific quantities so that there is no abuse of the drugs. Each time the patient wants a new bottle of said drugs, they require a new prescription, and this is usually given only after the Doctor re-examines the patient so that he can confirm the patient is still in pain or still requires the drug. -Previous history. LSD, is a great example, as it can trigger a schizophrenic episode in someone who never knew he had schizophrenia. Other examples include things like Low or High blood sugar, heart/lung/liver problems, etc etc. The list goes on. 3. This is by far the most important point I am going to make. Currently, the death toll and Alcohol-related accidents are so high, for reason. That is, Alcohol is readily available at almost any city block. Now, I've never tried drugs before, mainly because I have no idea where I would get my hands on them. Imagine if Drugs were sold as frequently as Alcohol? Wouldn't anyone agree that this would drastically increase the Drug-related accidents and deaths? Now, my opponent has previously mentioned that drug legalization would decrease the number of police officers. I said this was absurd, and here's why. The abundance of readily available drugs, might decrease the number of drug busts, but at a cost. It will also increase the number of drug-related accidents. Clearly we would still need as many police officers, to deal with these occurrences. Whether or not this means less, or more police officers, is up to speculation, but it is safe to say that the number will not change drastically, or at least as drastically as my opponent would hope. 4. This is possibly the most dangerous aspect of my opponents argument. If all drugs were legalized, this would mean the end of Prescription drugs. Drug companies would go wild. There are specific steps, processes, that a drug company must go through in order to have a drug accepted by the FDA(Food and Drug administration). This includes a strict regulation of drugs in order to see whether or not the drug will have adverse effects when mixed with other drugs. Now, it is not an understatement to say that on average, a drug company will spend a couple hundred million on drug research, clinical trials, testing, and approval from the FDA. Without this process, drug companies will go the cheaper, more profitable route of skipping that and going straight to clinical trials. No one can stop them, cause all drugs are legal! 5. I would like to ask my opponent a question. If we were to legalize all drugs, what would the restrictions be? Clearly we must put limits as to who can buy them.

If a student chooses to use Adderall to study for a test and receives 100% it has no effect on the chances of any other students receiving 100%. As for my comparison to coffee I will first point out that fatigue is a mental condition, which is why many people drink coffee in the morning. Both caffeine and Adderall are stimulants, and there is evidence that caffeine also affects the dopamine system (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Therefore drinking caffeine enhances mental performance, and by my opponent\"s logic consuming caffeine would be unethical unless the consumer was tired and/or suffering from a mental condition in which caffeine would help put them \"on an even playing field.\" \"The fact that it is illegal in itself makes the use of Adderall without a prescription unethical.\" Would you say it was unethical to drink alcohol during prohibition? Slavery was once legal, therefore was it ethical before it was abolished? Unfortunately public policy is not always a perfect indicator to the ethicality of an issue. On top on that my opponent seems to be assuming that everyone with a prescription to Adderall have ADHD. Given the vague criteria for diagnosis, which reportedly leads to frequent over-diagnosis, there are likely many people with an Adderall prescription who do not have ADHD. Is it unethical for these people to use Adderall? (http://bjp.rcpsych.org...)",

            "discussionTitle": "Legalization of Marijuana",
            "conclusion": "Legalization of Marijuana",
            "premise": "Thank you Pro, now in to my argument.My Opponent's argument is not factually backed My opponent says things, and I quote like;\"marijuana is wasting money and causing wars,\"Now, this is a very broad statement and is not factually based by any source, statistic, or even website. Therefore, for lack of evidence, presumed false. Another quote, \"prescription drugs kill about 100,000 people in the world each year,\" May be true, but not backed up. I now ask my opponent to show me his sources when he states statistics and makes broad statements. Rebuttal to my opponent's argument in Round 2My opponents argument is not factual scientifically at all, and has no sources to back any assumptions up in his first opening argument. My main argument to my opponent is the fact that they assume that it will only be used as a medical drug. You have to understand that once legalized, people will have more access to get the drug. Whether they need it for medical use or not, once legalized for medical purposes it will be released in to the public through the government. Now, another theory is the abused system it will bring. With marijuana now being able to be given out for \"pain removing\" there will be \"pot-heads\" that abuse the system to get the drug that they think their body needs. My opponent says that when marijuana is legalized we will stop \"wasting money\" but I ask my opponent, what are we wasting money on? And how would marijuana being legalized make us stop, \"wasting money\" It makes no sense, for my opponent does not go into any further detail. My opponent just states it and move on. Now, my opponent tries to argue how if smoked safely, marijuana is safe. How is marijuana smoked safely? Earlier in the paragraph my opponent says, \"Besides, Marijuana affect would have you pass out before you could try to overdose,\" [on prescription drugs]Yes, passing out seems perfectly safe to me, especially if I'm doing something with a group of people at a party, and I pass out. Seems very \"safe,\" And also, my opponent claims that legalizing Marijuana would \"stop the deaths caused by overdose on prescription drugs because they would pass out before they could overdose.\" So, my opponent is saying that you wouldn't be able to abuse prescription drugs because you would be passed out because of marijuana. So if I just walked up to someone, knocked them out with a baseball bat, they wouldn't be able to abuse prescription drugs, simply because they are \"passed out,\" The idea is ridiculous to assume because my opponent has to remember that when passed out, people do indeed wake up, and that is not going to stop them from overdosing. Therefore, no, marijuana does not help with prescription drug overdose. \"There has not been any deaths directly related to marijuana,\" Now, this is one thing my opponent has a source cited for. Now, marijuana is considered by the Controlled Substance Act of 1970 as a gateway drug. Sure, marijuana may not be directly related to a persons death, but the drugs after such as cocaine definitely have been directly added to a persons death. According to Web definitions, a gateway drug is;\"a habit-forming drug that is not addictive but its use may lead to the use of other addictive drugs; \" So, according to the controlled substance act, marijuana is a habit forming drug, that may lead to the use of other addictive drugs. So yes, marijuana may not be directly the cause of someone's death, the drugs used because of marijuana do lead to death. In conclusion, marijuana is an indirect cause to death.My opponent goes in to a great effort to proclaim how dangerous and \"toxic\" prescription drugs are. In comparison, they are more regulated and researched than marijuana! Marijuana comes in a plastic bag from any dealer, a prescription drug comes in a certified package, with directions suitable for each patient written clearly, and in most cases they are prescribed by a doctor. Not only are they tested by numerous scientists, but also companies in the US such as The Food and Drug Administration, FDA. Therefore, making them more safe than marijuana. Final argument to my opponent In conclusion, my opponents opening argument was not based of scientific data or statistics. Causing no direct advantage to society by legalizing marijuana. As my opponent states no direct plan of action to legalize and the advantages it is, so I will state a few disadvantages. 1) A gateway drug, [as defined above] to extremely addictive and harmful drugs such as cocaine and heroin. 2) Leads to an unhealthy lifestyle. The use of marijuana may lead to what is socially claimed as a \"pothead,\" Somebody always paying for marijuana and using it, usually spending a great deal of money on it, and not keeping a good hygiene. 3) Other terms of medical pain relief. There are many prescription drugs and even other plants that relieve pain in the body, so why do we pick a drug like marijuana, that causes unhealthy lifestyles and leads to further drugs, to relieve our pain when there are much other safer ways of going about it. 4) Controversial. A lot of people disagree and want nothing to do with marijuana, and would like to stay as far away with it as they could. I have yet to meet as person that would we ok with the idea of a marijuana store opening up next door or down the road. Many may even move! The basic idea is that people do not like it. 5) We just don't need it. We have survived as humans without it, and since it will only cause harm, why do we need it? It doesn't do things that other medicine wont do anyway, and really doesn't benefit society, so why do we need it? Now since I have responded to my opponents case and presented my own, I turn the debate over to my opponent.

            "conclusion": "Mexico's Problem With Drug Cartel Warrants United States Military Intervention",
            "premise": "Thank you for another very well organized and thought out rebuttal. I now will provide my response: Con points out from my last round, \"He draws a really good example regarding prohibition, however it is turned to my side. Consider that since alcohol is now legal the black maret for it no longer exists.\" Moonshine is still bootlegged today as most of the United States regulates the percentage (proof) of alcohol. There are many strands of marijuana all of different potencies which the government would regulate much like they have done with alcohol. In turn, this would leave a black market for stronger and more natural marijuana. Again, con points out, \"He makes another good argument about how prescription medication causes more deaths. However if you read his card, it only specifies abuse of perscription drugs (which is illegal) so the advantage is turned to my side.\" This helps to clarify my point regarding prescription drugs as we have failed to control them. Prescription drugs are commonly find their way in the wrong hands or are abused by those they are prescribed to leading to overdoses. This \"historical precedent\" shows that the same will likely be true if current drugs deemed illicit were to be legalized. Con suggests, \"Pro argues that the drug cartels are involved in other crimes as well . Granted, but what kind of impact does this have? I mean obviously the drug cartels specialize n drug crime, so the majority of their crime would go away. \" Their other crimes include extortion and kidnapping. As mentioned in the previous round in Phoenix, AZ alone there were 700 kidnappings from affiliates of the cartel in a two year period. Con writes, \"Advantage one: Crime Down\" I would like to thank con for the rebuttal on this as he so eloquently pointed out in his con position for the debate \"The US Should Legalize all drugs\" from 9/11/11: \"...argument that crime will decrease due to legalization can be shown as false on many accounts. For one thing, there is a solid correlation between drugs and crime. The National Center for Victims of Crime[3] reports: 'In the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correction Facilities, 32% of State prisoners and 26% of Federal prisoners said they had committed their current offense while under the influence of drugs. Among State prisoners, drug offenders (44%) and property offenders (39%) reported the highest incidence of drug use at the time of the offense. Among Federal prisoners, drug offenders (32%) and violent offenders (24%) were the most likely to report drug use at the time of their crimes. ' Nearly 1/4th of violent offenses were committed under the influence. That is no coincidence. Drugs increase the probability of a person making an irrational decision including a crime, so logic shows us that drugs are a primary component in many crimes.\" Con points out in my 2nd round the following, \" Pro Argues: 'our resources are not and should not be tied down in searching and destroying nuclear material.' --> What? We shouldn't spend our resources preventing a deadly nuclear attack, but we should spend them invading a sovereign nation over different types of herbs?\" As I'm sure you, the voter, read before I stated, \" Yes, nuclear war is bad; however, all of our resources are not and should not be tied down in searching and destroying nuclear material.\" \" Border Fence Pro only argues that people can tunnel under the fence.\" Con must not have read my whole rebuttal to the border fence as I pointed out, \" A border fence is not going to stop the illegal drugs that come through by vehicles, through the air, or by sea which is is how the majority of the drugs from Mexico find their way into the United States. Additionally, the border fence has failed to stop the drugs and immigrants that are tunneling their way under the fence.\" As for why we need intervention, which I supported in the violence that has effected America, I will elaborate further at the request of con. According to the State Department [4]: \" No one can say for certain how many Americans have been killed in the escalating Mexican drug violence in the past several years, but the closest thing to an official list\u2014the U.S. State Department's database of deaths of U.S. citizens abroad by non-natural causes\u2014indicates that the number has been steadily increasing. At least 106 U.S. residents were victims of \"executions\" or \"homicides\" directly related to drug battles in Mexico in 2010, compared to 79 in 2009 and 35 in 2007, according to the State Department figures. Many deaths, disappearances aren't tallied. And experts\u2014and the State Department itself\u2014say the number is certainly much higher. For example, the State Department doesn't list several recent high-profile deaths that have been publicly linked to the drug cartels or cases in which Americans have vanished or been killed in the U.S. by Mexican drug gangs.\" This report goes on to state, \"The cartels are pushing new boundaries when it comes to targeting Americans. Recent law enforcement bulletins have stated that cartels have instructed members to shoot and kill American border agents using AK-47 assault rifles, according to testimony presented March 31 at a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Homeland Security. 'The shooting of special agents Zapata and Avila is a game changer which alters the landscape of the involvement of the United States in Mexico's war against the drug cartels,' said U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee. 'For the first time in 25 years, the cartels are now targeting American law enforcement.' Gonzalez, the Texas sheriff, whose department sits on the other side of the Rio Grande from Mexico, said his officers have long seen evidence that the violence doesn't respect borders. 'The feds say our side of the border is safe,' he said, 'but we have bullet holes in our schools and businesses that say otherwise.'\" According to Sheriff Paul Babeu in Arizona [5], \" 'Mexican drug cartels literally do control parts of Arizona,' he said. 'They literally have scouts on the high points in the mountains and in the hills and they literally control movement. They have radios, they have optics, they have night-vision goggles as good as anything law enforcement has. This is going on here in Arizona,' he said. 'This is 70 to 80 miles from the border - 30 miles from the fifth-largest city in the United States.\"' It is evident that we are falling victim to these ruthless cartels as a result of the Mexican Govt allowing them to have free reign in their country as they make their way across our border. How long do we wait until we intervene with our military? I say we have waited long enough which is why I believe we use our military to put an end to these ruthless cartels, take back our border and country, and protect the citizens of the United States of America. 3. http://www.ncvc.org... 4. http://www.amren.com... 5. http://www.examiner.com...",

            "premise": "I presented no arguments in previous rounds because the burden of proof rested on Pro in this debate, as she is arguing for a change in the status quo. I will not present any arguments in this round either. Instead, I shall provide some brief rebuttals and a summary of the debate.On psychological dependenceMy opponent cited cases of strange addictions from the humor site, Cracked.com. Pro went on to say that this was evidence that humans can become psychologically dependent upon almost anything, and that therefore making a substance illegal because it carries a risk of dependence is ludicrous.However, the APA Dictionary of Psychology defines psychological dependence as \"dependence on a psychoactive substance for the reinforcement it provides.\"(1) The term \"psychological dependence\" can, therefore, only be used when speaking of the effects of psychoactive drugs such as LSD.On comparing hallucinogens to methamphetaminesI would like to restate my previous assertion, that proving that one dangerous illegal drug is less dangerous than another does not mean that it should be legalized. If anything, it is simply an argument for why the more dangerous one should stay illegal.My opponent provided no evidence to back up her claim that the legality of a drug does not deter people from its use.On the immediate and long-term dangers of hallucinogensWhile it is obviously true, as my opponent said, that not every user of psychoactive drugs will suffer from side effects, this does not mean that there is no risk. Unfortunately, whether or not one will suffer from said effects is highly unpredictable, difficult to determine even for those with medical training.(2) Because of this, using hallucinogens is like playing a game of Russian roulette.I did not try to refute my opponent's statement that Abilify can cause neurological damage because I do not doubt that it is true. However, simply because a prescription drug with known health benefits has certain side effects is no reason to legalize a drug for recreational use. If anything, it is simply an argument for setting higher standards for the pharmaceutical industry. My opponent is also incorrect in her belief that hallucinogens carry no long-term health risks. Hallucinogens cause such long-term side effects as: Memory loss Difficulty in speaking Impaired thinking ability Depression Unwanted weight loss Mood swings Anxiety Flashbacks Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) -- trailing images, spots, auras, and other visual disturbances; depression, or panic attacks; long after use or perhaps permanent Increased risk of developing schizophrenia or psychotic episodes(3) Pro tried to argue that prescription drugs can cause death, however she failed to provide an example of a prescription drug that can be immediately fatal. And once again, a deadly prescription drug would not be evidence for the need to legalize psychoactive drugs, but for the need to impose stricter regulations on the pharmaceutics industry. As for whether or not hallucinogens cause mental illness, we know of at least one meal disorder that is caused directly by the use of psychoactive drugs: HPPD.(4) Summary To sum up this debate, my opponent began by arguing that hallucinogens are \"physically harmless and not addictive.\" However, when presented with evidence to the contrary, Pro admitted that psychoactive drugs can be lethal and that users can develop a psychological dependence upon them. She then changed her argument, saying that psychoactive drugs should be legalized because although they are dangerous, they are no more dangerous than certain prescription drugs (a statement she failed to properly support with evidence). I would like to close by thanking Pro for being a challenging debate partner. Best of luck. Sources 1. VandenBos, Gary R. APA Dictionary of Psychology. 1st ed.

            "conclusion": "Drugs should be decriminalized",
            "premise": "Thank you for an interesting debate. \"the police are wasting considerable force on moral criminals instead of property criminals.\" Wow. You make it sound as if Police are spending more time busting into peoples houses just to search for drugs. Oh wait, police can't do that, cause of a little thing called probable cause. Yes, that is correct. Most Drug raids and busts, are either on people who are ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING/SELLING the drugs, or people who have committed OTHER crimes and drugs were merely an added offense. The former is illegal, even if Drugs become legalized, and the latter is more than simple \"Moral criminals\" who probably have committed property crimes. So yeah, my opponents argument is a bust. \"But if you're addicted to a substance, you tend to care less, and your judgment tends to be impaired.\" As mentioned above, rarely is anyone arrested SIMPLY for doing drugs. Its also why, for example, some sentences are NOT prison sentences but Rehab sentences. And yes, rehab centers do help in staving off addiction. But i find this argument laughable. First off, your judgment doesn't stay impaired after you've stopped using drugs. Secondly, maybe if you are a complete loner, you wouldn't care if you went to jail, but most people aren't. Thirdly, being in a prison where drugs are scarce, would make you care more, and I would like to think this is common sense. Especially if you were more addicted, you would have a harder time in jail. My opponents arguments just don't follow through. \"Then they come out of jail and back to their drugs.\" There are always repeaters. This is the same for ANY crime, including Theft, assault, and even murder. I believe my opponent has failed his argument in showing how the punishment is any more effective in deterring people, than any other crime. \"So, for some people, that is indeed one beer. For some people, that's 5 beers. It's the same way with drugs.\" Sorry, but no. If i have no drugs on me, but I've taken some Cocaine, and am still completely sober and lucid, I won't get arrested. There is no test for drug use beyond examination in a lab. The reason why the level of Alcohol is set at .08%, is because that is the determined limit of alcohol in a person's body to which he is lucid and sober enough to drive safely. If youve taken drugs and are completely lucid, there ARE no grounds to arrest you. But here's where the similarity ends. Most social drinkers do not require enough drinks to become so drunk that they cannot stand anymore. With Drugs, the psychological effect, the need to achieve the same high as before, exists much, much more strongly than with alcohol. It's why, as I said before, there are AA meetings and Drug Rehab clinics. This is the vital difference between drugs and alcohol. This is what my opponent fails to understand. \"And clearly some people see a benefit is doing cocaine, since they do it.\" Did you not read my argument, carefully? I clearly stated that we weigh the potential harm, with the benefits. The potential harm of Cigs, isn't as high as other drugs. If you've missed this part in your History Class, here's a recap. The reason why Russia and the U.S.A never started a nuclear third world war, is because BOTH had nukes and BOTH were afraid of M.A.D. That is, mutually assured destruction. These are benefits that outweigh the harm. The benefit o Cocaine is the high, but that is also the harm, because of the addictive and tolerance potential. The more you use Cocaine, the more you need to use in order to get the same high. This is hardly comparable to cigarettes. I used to be a casual smoker for 4 years, never needing to increase the number of puffs per day. And one day, I just quit, cold turkey. I could never say the same for Cocaine. \"Alcohol affects many people very differently.\" You are confusing affect with effect. Someone with a bad liver, or smaller people, will have a harder time breaking down alcohol, and therefore they will become drunk faster, and longer. But the sole effect is sobriety, with a difference in time. If only prescription drugs were this simple, your argument would hold some water. Prescription drugs, will AFFECT the body with DIFFERENT EFFECTS to different people. This is the Vital difference that you are failing to grasp regarding prescription drugs. \"These are statistics for prescription drugs, which are legal already.\"-You The point is, alcohol is something you can buy at any corner store in almost every city. Prescription drugs are not. Yet, even with such a STRICT restriction on prescription drugs, there are still MUCH more people who die from Presc. Drug overdoses than Alcohol overdoses. Clearly it is much simpler to overdose on Drugs than Alcohol, yes? This is, of course, after doctors TELL their patients how many to take in one day. Now, think if these prescription drugs made it onto the shelves, as easy to buy as alcohol? If you still cannot see the point, then you are beyond hope. \"I know that people are being killed in the drug wars, and I know that the drug cartels are killing people.\" But you have no idea who's getting killed, or why. If you don't know this, then clearly your previous statement is FALSE. \"do you understand how high the prices are currently from drug dealers?\" Sure, and unless these drug dealers are complete morons, if drugs become legal, they won't keep selling them for the current prices. And that's my point. Drug dealers, cartels, are capable of selling their product at LOWER PRICES than that of the government or private businesses. Cartels have already refined their process for purifying drugs, so no cost goes to R&D. Cartels don't need to hire people for minimum wages, cause the minimum wage is whatever the cartel wants it to be. This is my point. \"the government is making sure that drug companies aren't harming you. It has nothing to do with you harming yourself\" Actually, they're the same thing, and here's why. No one is forcing you to take drugs. You can, and people do, refuse to take medicine, vaccines, prescription drugs. Every drug has a label that LISTS ALL the possible harms and side-effects. These are risks. And the FDA exists to MINIMIZE these risks. By doing so, they minimize the possible HARM that you are doing to yourself. As stated above, it is YOUR decision to take the drugs. You can AVOID potentially harming yourself by refusing the drugs. Whether or not you are doing more harm to yourself by taking prescription drugs, is what the FDA is trying to limit. So yes, the FDA is there to limit you from harming yourself. \"Aspirin is legal, is it not?\" Acute aspirin overdose has a death rate of 2%. Very rarely is aspirin overdose lethal. \"Relative safety\" Again, my opponent has advocated only a single restriction, that is, age. One of the main reasons why prescription drugs require a doctor, is because the doctor EXPLAINS which drug is best, and what NOT to mix the drugs with. My opponent seems to prescribe to \"It's their body, i don't care\". I suppose, if you don't care about someone who his stabbing himself in the leg, and have the audacity to simply walk past them without a second glance, then people doing drugs and overdosing, people with high blood pressure, taking a drug that had the side-effect of increased blood pressure but wasn't notified because the drug that used to be prescription is now free to sell at any convenience store, wouldn't bother him at all. But it bothers me. I actually do care if people are doing harm to themselves. And quite a few people agree with me, or they wouldn't bother dispatching police, a government organization, to talk down people who are about to commit suicide. My opponent is wrong. The government does care if we do harm to ourselves, or they wouldn't have forced Cigarette companies to label their product as harmful. And so do I. Vote Con.",

It costs the Federal government about $16 billion a year, or otherwise about $500 per second.Drug legalization, taxation, and regulation would be a stronger, more reasonable path for America. Sure, drugs have negative consequences, this is not denied. But the drug war is worse. As well as disrupting families, urban communities, crime, and the budget, it violates civil liberties.Productivity in the economy probably wouldn't change that adversely. Most users would be recreational, and I don't think that most citizens would use drugs, at least not the hard types. Individual earnings are directly linked to that worker's marginal productivity. If drug usage caused productivity to decrease, businesses would prohibit drug usage themselves, and/or workers would directly bear the cost of their actions.Borrowing money from China to kill people and property abroad is a poor policy.

            "premise": "\"Such examples are of drug caused murders, and other crimes directly caused by drugs.\"No. People should certainly be charged for murder. But drug possession is not equivalent to murder, nor is there implied causation. If someone is on drugs and kills someone, he/she should be punished for murder just like someone who kills someone while not on drugs. People should not be charged with something that could POTENTIALLY occur as a result of an action they choose to take. \"Also regarding the example of Portugal, the laws that were put in place only limited the abilities of the cartels that were running rampant in the country just as they are in Mexico.\"That's not true. In 1999 Portugal had the highest rate of HIV amongst injecting drug users in the European Union. And The number of heroin users was estimated to between 50,000 and 100,000 at the end of the 1990s. [1] These factors led to the adoption of The National Strategy for the Fight Against Drugs in 1999. And, again, the results show that the decriminalization of drugs in Portugal worked. \"More importantly drugs such as cocaine cannot be legalized for the simple reason that it is blatantly unsafe for the consumer.\"It is well-established that cocaine has serious risks attached to its use. With this in mind, a consumer should have the right to make the decision of whether or not he or she should use it. It is an individual choice. If I want to eat cardboard every day, I should be able to, without government intervention, because it is my choice for myself. The government is simply a group of people, and as I said before, no one should be allowed to infringe on the rights of others; this would include one's right to perform acts of self-harm. \"To say that selling cocaine is acceptable, is like saying it is acceptable to sell tainted food to even knowledgeable consumers.\"Tainted food that is sold as regular food is deceptive and criminal. This is like selling cocaine as flour. But tainted food that is sold as tainted food should be justly sold if demand exists. \"...the vast majority of the population does not care about the risks, and unfortunately the government has to do that caring for them...\"The government is a group of people with arbitrary viewpoints, just like people in the general population. I do not know if the claim about the \"majority of the population not caring\" is true, since I found no study evidencing it. But acts that do not infringe on the rights of others should not be regulated by a group of people with a set, narrow view that opposes the views of members of the non-government population.

First Round: Accepting the debate and a brief summary of what you think should be legal regarding drug use. Second Round: Why you believe your stance. NO REBUTTLE. Do NOT attack my argument on round two. Third Round: Rebuttal, I will attack your argument and you will attack my argument. Fourth Round (Conclusion): Explain why you believe you won the argument (If you think you did) and anything else that you would like to add. You CAN attack my rebuttal if you choose too. RULES: 1.) Stick to the topic do not start ranting about why you think I'm stupid. 2.) Make sure to show your sources through the use of links when presenting data. That's about it and yes, these rules also apply to me. By accepting to debate me you are agreeing to these terms. Good luck! My stance regarding legality: Although I believe all drugs should be legal I do think there should be regulations. For example, I'd tax heroin heavily (probably a 50% state tax) and cannabis along with other lighter drugs would always need to be cheaper than harder drugs such as methamphetamine and heroin by about 1/2. There would also be an age restriction of 18 in the US. (or when you're legally an adult) Corporations would also need to present the REAL risks regarding every substance and they may not falsely advertise any of the harder substances, only their company.",

            "premise": "I'm sorry, but a drug addict who neglects or abuses thier children is not \"unintentionally abus(ing)\" thier children, they're just abusing them, and no one has the right to do that. My opponent even says \"the majority of the population is educated on the adverse effects of heroin along with other harmful narcotics\", in my opinion, that also goes for the drug addicted parent, who knows full well what they're doing, and the harm that drug can cause, and the harm that drug may cause them to inflict on others, so it is NOT unintentional abuse, it's just abuse. Lets break down the claim made by my opponent that the population is educated on the adverse effects of drugs. It is a true statement, but does that mean that anyone who is educated on the adverse effects of drugs, is not at risk of drug addiction? Of course not, if someone is injured at work, they might be prescribed a powerful painkiller, and that's where the addiction may begin. That could cause a fully grown adult, who is fully educated on the adverse effects of drugs, to become addicted, without choice. Also, there are those who try drugs in a purely recreational manner, and become addicted, they were educated on the adverse effects of drugs as well. I think my opponent is trying to claim that our society is safe from mass addiction because we're educated on the adverse effects of drugs, but we know that isn't true. Our society is in the grips of, not only one mass addiction, but several mass addictions of several different drugs. I apologize, but being educated about the adverse effects of drugs is of no consequence, in real life, or in this debate. Educated or not, people can still become addicted. My opponent claims that \"once you turn 18 you are free from your parents and no longer need to do what they wish\", \"no one should be enslaved by their parents\". Umm, I'm not quit sure how to make a rebuttal against that, because I don't know what point my opponent is trying to make. True, when you turn 18, by law you are an adult, but if your parents are good parents, you will never be free from thier love and worry for you, and I'm not sure how this is relevant within the context of this argument. I invite my opponent to infuse some clarity into that statement. I congratulate Portugal and it's initial success with thier drug policy, however I must point out that the drop in overdoses may not be solely tied to the decriminalization of drugs. Portugal transfered their drug policy away from law enforcement and gave it to thier health sector. They also began investing huge amounts of money into drug prevention, and treatment. They funded alternative drug vans, which drive around the cities, handing out free alternative drugs to anyone who wants them, and people line up to get the drugs that are meant to be an alternative to hard drugs. There is a huge pricetag on thier decriminalization policy, both in terms of taxes, and health costs, and it would be a shame if Portugal were to come into some kind of economic hardship and find themselves unable to afford the high cost of thier drug policy. If that happens, then they would find themselves right where they started. The spread of HIV has gone down in Portugal as well, but that is due to a nationwide needle exchange program. I live in a state with a needle exchange program, and we have had similiar results. Also, in my state, anyone who serves time in prison is required to learn how to properly prapare a needle and proper disposal methods, regardless of the crime that put them there. The drop in HIV rates in Portugal has nothing to do with the decriminalization of drugs, it's because of the needle exchange program. Like I've said before, I'm just as much a libertarian as the next guy, but if my taxes and health costs go up to help pay for expensive drug treatment programs, then I would consider that an infringment on my rights.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should decriminalize drugs.",
            "premise": "I. Intro I\u2019ll mostly be going over the major points of contention and showing you why Pro has won this debate. II. Harm Principle No matter whether you buy my argument here or my opponent\u2019s, I win this argument, and therefore, the debate. If you believe me and think that people should be able to harm themselves, via drugs in particular, then I win this debate because the government should not make laws restricting the right to do what you want to your own body. In the last round, my opponent likens drug use to self-harm. If you buy this argument, I still win because, as my opponent even states, these people are hospitalized for their self-harm. If my opponent wants to liken it to drug use, the same procedure should occur. It should be treated as a health issue, rather than a criminal one. Therefore, drugs should be decriminalized and we should shift toward a health-centered model like Portugal. Either way, I have won the debate on these grounds alone. III. Choices Impacting Others Here Con essentially states that the harm principal does not apply because drug use has a secondary effect on other people. However, if the use itself isn\u2019t directly harming others, there is no reason to make it criminal. In the US status quo, there are plenty of decisions we can (and should be able to) make that have some negative impact on others. For example, if a father decides to spend money on the new iPhone instead of paying to fix the hot water heater, his family is negatively impacted. If a mother decides to abuse alcohol, her family suffers. However, these are both legal. People act selfishly. Sometimes there are secondary effects from these selfish actions. However, if they do not directly hurt others, they should be able to make poor decisions. We do not need the government to protect us from ourselves. IV. Prison System Sure. Every inmate is \u201ctaking up a bed.\u201d Con is correct. However, drug users pose little to no threat to the outside world. There is no reason that they should be deprived of their freedoms and basic human rights just because of a poor decision that harms their own well-being. They are non-violent (until being deprived of normal social interaction and immersed in the violent world of the prison system for an extended period) and therefore they need not be imprisoned. A shift toward a health-centered model would alleviate the issues in the prison system, help rehabilitate drug users, and ensure dignity to both inmates who remain in prison and the drug users who would be sent to rehabilitation facilities. This is a health issue, not a criminal one. Con questions whether regulation would occur with legalization (though this debate is about decriminalization; legalization takes it a step further) which is a ridiculous notion. Surely, like all other drugs that are currently legal, including OTC drugs, prescriptions, and alcohol, there would be a governing body which oversees and regulates potency, production, distribution, etc. V. Usage Rates Con drops my Portugal case study, which proves that decriminalizing drugs actually LOWERS rates of drug abuse. I again win the debate on these grounds alone, because Con\u2019s primary goal is to decrease drug rates (which as I stated, has not happened in nearly a half-century of the current American drug policy) so if I can prove that decriminalization achieves this (and I have) then I win the debate. VI. Conclusion In this debate I have proven that the government need not interfere in our decisions to harm ourselves. However, if they do, it is not a criminal matter, it is a health one, so we should not criminalize drug use. This was the first pillar to Con\u2019s position. I have cast doubt on the health implications of certain drugs Con decided to use as examples, particularly marijuana. Marijuana has massive health benefits and should be legalized for those reasons. This puts a dent in the second pillar. Finally, I have proven that decriminalization will reduce rates of drug abuse and help move us forward. This takes out the third and final pillar of Con\u2019s position. Since I have disproven two of the three essential pillars to the Con position, as well as providing offense of my own, this debate has clearly been won by Pro. VII. Closing Remarks Thank you, Con, for a good debate. Thank you, voters, for taking the time and effort to put into it. If you are voting for Bsh\u2019s tournament, no RFD is required, but if you have the time, I know I\u2019d appreciate a quick one like \u201cPro wins because he proved x and y, while Con only proved z.\u201d If you can do that it\u2019d be greatly appreciated, if not thank you anyway! Emilrose, if you advance, good luck in the next round!",

            "premise": "I dont find it necessary to prove the safety of cocaine any more then i find it necessary to prove the safety of alcohol. They are both dangerous. I would advise against taking both, but were do you or anyone get the authority to say that a person cannot make that decision on their own? No my argument about illegal and legal drugs was in reference to your statement \"Illegal drugs are illegal because they are harmful. Illegal drugs are not illegal just because.\" I was simply pointing out the inconsistency of our laws in allowing for some very harmful drugs to be legal yet make others illegal. Then make less harmful drugs (marijuana) illegal. Our drug policy has no consistency, because there is no real underlying principle behind it. Our drug policy was merely created to please a growing evangelical political movement in America. It is impossible to disprove or prove anything about the effects of full drug legalization because there is no example in the world. You are correct to point that out and i never disputed it. Yet whenever a country has made moves towards legalization positive things have come out of it. The example you gave in Alaska is hardly fool proof for either side. The courts have effectively legalized small possession amounts by citing a case in the 1970's. And five seperate studies (two of them from the government itself) negate the DEA pamphlet that you c/p from that stated: \"Alaska's experiment with Legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally.\" And if one harm alone is sufficient to reject legalization then the same should be true for the war on drugs, but its not, because people supporting drug criminalization start out with a personal disapproval of drugs then go about building a case to make them illegal. The DEA is merely trying to hold onto its job...of course they are against legalization it literally puts them out of work. My whole argument isn't negated by one flaw...even if the one you had pointed out was flawed. I should have explained the context of that blog better. It was made after the drug czar claimed that there was absolutely no medical uses for marijuana. The government didnt bother going into an investigation about whether or not he had lied because he was just following his job description. The job description tells him that he me use any means necessary to oppose drug legalization (which does not exclude lying). I am standing on quite a solid foundation for my argument. One that i presented at the beginning and you have not addressed a single time. That is the former drug prohibition that this country went through during the 1930's. The former alcohol prohibition and current drug prohibition share many frightening correlations. Homicide rates increased during both periods (offsetting general decreases during other time periods). Deaths from substance overdose increased (both the result of no required labeling of the dosage for both substances). Deaths from contaminated illegal substance increased (the result of no industry oversight). Organized crime skyrocketed and benefited greatly from the constant high revenue source of substance trafficking. All of those problems were largely eliminated or at the least greatly reduced by the simple act of legalizing alcohol. It seems only logical that if drug prohibition has followed the same trends of alcohol prohibition that ending drug prohibition would also solve the same problems that ending alcohol prohibition solved. Then there is a constitutional argument that we never addressed...you'll notice that an amendment was passed when they made alcohol illegal...no such amendment was ever passed for drugs. Putting drug criminalization on very shaky constitutional grounds here in the US. Last of all there is the moral argument. I still dont know where you or anyone else gets the authority to criminalize something just because they dont like it. If people think drugs are wrong and should not be consumed then they have a very simple course of action: do not take drugs and offer knowledge to others of the dangers of drugs. I find it very hypocritical that you think any amount of money is worth \"saving the children\", but yet thousands of these children and other people have ruined lives because of the tough enforcement of the drug war. At the very least politicians should be debating the merits of this issue, and not throwing more cash at it and pushing it under the rug.",

            "premise": "I will refute my opponent's refutations in the order he has posted them.Me: If drugs were to be legalized, multimillion corporations, which would no doubt be established, would be free to launch mass advertising campaigns promoting these drugs to the entire nation.Pro: What is wrong with business and corporations being established. In fact we should be happy, business and corporations drive our economy and drugs will no longer be monopolized by cartels.What's wrong?? As I have already establised quite explicitly, business and corporations will launch huge campaigns, promoting the drugs at an incredible scale. This will without a doubt increase the number of users of these drugs.Me: A staggering number people allow themselves to be put under the influence of legal drugs. Not all of these people are addicts, but the drugs that my opponent believes should be legalized are highly addictive. Imagine the sheer number of people who are very productive citizens becoming encumbered and debilitated by drugs that we currently consider illegal.Pro: Keeping drugs illegal would make no difference, people will take drugs no matter what the law says. Despite massive amounts of government spending fighting drugs in America drug addiction has stayed the same (3)My opponent completely digresses from my point. I said that a sheer increase in the number of drug users/addicts will occur. My opponent, in a non-refuting statement, says that people will take drugs no matter what the law says. I did not say that the law stops all drug use. I am merely saying that the numbers will increase dramatically. That drug addiction has remained the same under government control has nothing to do with the massive number of people who will be subjected to addiction or abuse and knocked out of the workforce.Me: A staggering number people allow themselves to be put under the influence of legal drugs. Not all of these people are addicts, but the drugs that my opponent believes should be legalized are highly addictive. Imagine the sheer number of people who are very productive citizens becoming encumbered and debilitated by drugs that we currently consider illegal.Pro: My opponent statement is based on a fallacy that legalizing drugs will cause more people to take drugs. This fallacy has been proven false. In Portugal they simply decriminalized not even legalized drugs and drug abuse is down 50% (1) and Portugal has the lowest rate of marijuana use in the EU which is 10% what is it in America, 40% (2). Note that my opponent says the Portuguese have decriminalized drug substances. This points to nothing. Upon careful analysis of my opponent's source, I find it imperative to explain Portugal drug policy. Decriminalization =/= legalization. Here's an excerpt from my opponent's source:\"First, some clarification. Portugal's move to decriminalize does not mean people can carry around, use, and sell drugs free from police interference. That would be legalization. Rather, all drugs are \"decriminalized,\" meaning drug possession, distribution, and use is still illegal. While distribution and trafficking is still a criminal offense, possession and use is moved out of criminal courts and into a special court where each offender's unique situation is judged by legal experts, psychologists, and social workers. Treatment and further action is decided in these courts, where addicts and drug use is treated as a public health service rather than referring it to the justice system (like the US)\" (1)My opponent tries to promote decriminalization as legalization, using a a true statistic that falsely relates to his premise. I find decriminalization to be a good idea, maybe we should enforce that policy, but I digress...moving on.Pro: Keeping drugs illegal would make no difference, people will take drugs no matter what the law says. Despite massive amounts of government spending fighting drugs in America drug addiction has stayed the same (3)Again, my opponent makes a pointless refutation that does not address my point about the increase in numbers of drug users. Of course legalization makes a difference. The difference between use of a legal and illegal drug is huge. Here are some statistics for marijuana, the MOST used illegal drug in the USA: About 10% of males use marijuana compared to 6% of females About 10% of users will go on to daily users Almost 7% - 10% of regular users become dependent 14.6 million Americans report using marijuana in the last month 100,000 people per year are treated for marijuana addiction http://www.healthyplace.com...Here are tobacco statistics: 1. In 2009, nearly 70 million Americans age 12 and older had used a tobacco product at least once in the month prior to being surveyed (3) 2. It is estimated that there are more than 43 million adults who currently smoke in the United States (2)3. Tobacco also costs our nation more than $100,000,000,000 each year in medical expenses and lost productivity in the workplace. (3) Marijuana is the most abused illegal drug. All other illegal drugs have much lower numbers, but are massively more addictive (cocaine, heroine, etc.) If corporations were to advertise these drugs at the same scale that tobacco is being advertised (tobacco industries spend $6,000,000,000 a year advertising their product), their numbers would soar above and beyond that of tobacco if only due to their highly addictive nature. Must I also mention that many illegal drugs are not only much more addicting, but also much more harmful? Notice the loss of workplace production in tobacco alone. Pro: My opponent brings up economic costs. There is still an economic benefit, the economic costs my opponent talks about have always been there. Look drugs are always going to be in our society because of that we need to tackle this issue in a different manner; instead of imprisoning and spending billions on prohibition the government can take a much cheaper approach and pay for rehab and drug education that is a much sensible way of dealing with drugs. I've already effectively refuted the 'economic benefits' of legalization. Economic costs will always be there. That is correct. I have shown that economic costs outweigh economic benefits. Legalization will only raise economic costs and amass more money for the drug corporation. The economic benefits provided do not cover the costs. I agree that rehab is a good approach, but rehabilitation institutions can be implemented without legalization. This is basically recriminalization. As established earlier, recriminalization =/= legalization. Pro: I find quite ironic that my opponent is bringing this up because the effects my opponent were talking about is after China made Opium an illegal drug (4) Let me explain. China illegalized Opium watching it drain its resources. China made the fatal error of allowing opium to run for a few years, subtracting from its nation's economic reserves and destroying the workforce. the effects were already there before opium was made illegal. This refutation is completely insignificant and does not refute my historical argument. (Short-circuiting my round due to lack of character space) My opponent's premises have been proven erroneous. His main argument, economic benefits, has been successfully refuted. My premises stand above my opponent's tangential refutations. Illegal drugs should retain their illegal status. Con wins.

When an individual chooses to consume mind-altering drugs, they are knowingly governing their own behaviour. \" That may be true, but these are drugs. Once your hooked, you are probably going to be hooked for a while. Another reason this argument doesn't work is because of drunk driving. People who are drinking and driving, are knowingly drinking and then driving. Much like this is legal , the taking of mind-altering drugs should be a crime as well. Though my opponent has stated that this debate is not about the crimes committed after, the taking of these drugs puts the person at a higher risk of committing these crimes. Like driving drunk increases the chance for an accident, taking mind-altering drugs increases the chance for a crime. They both follow the same logic, and should therefore either be legal or illegal. Since drunk driving is illegal , the taking of such drugs should be illegal as well. \"Their taking of such drugs is not an act of coercion, and therefore, such an act cannot justify jail time.\" Then a serial murderer would not be jailed either. His act is not of coercion, and following my opponents logic, he should not be reprimanded for his actions. This of course is not true, therefore my opponents arguments are not true. Mind-altering drugs are mild, but still are drugs. Though these may be legal, it will nevertheless lead people to other drugs that are illegal. Much like any other drugs, people develop a dependence on them and may act violently to obtain such drugs. http://www.emedicinehealth.com... http://www.newscientist.com... And as seen in this article, mind altering drugs have a tremendous impact on a persons ability to think. If someone were to not follow the instructions and take this drug alone, he puts himself at a higher risk of doing something very stupid. Increasing the risk for injury or crime so high should be made illegal. -Mind-altering drugs should be illegal for the same reasons drunk driving is.",

So, they see their health care provider, after the pain contract is signed by both patient and Dr, and are prescribed many forms of narcotics and I am baffled at how, Dr's cannot figure out why narcotics abuse continues to rise. I never thought to much about the use of narcotics and the damage it can cause the patient and their families until a family member had a total of 6 brain surgeries over the last 17 years. So her Dr had her sign this contract for the pressure and pain she experienced, at any time she could've been called in by the Dr for a surprise pill count and urine test, she never thought becoming addicted until her Dr called her in, the nurse counted the pills and asked for a urine sample, which she did, and was shocked by the Dr's action. Since she had good days as well, there were several times she could go an entire day without needing any,however this Dr informed her that she had violated her pain contract, because she had more in her bottle that she should've had, and because he had her on 2-30mg morphine, 1-15mg morphine and 4-10mg of Vicodin everyday except on days she didn't need all of that, and could get by with only taking 1 Vicodin for a few days here and there. He terminated her contract because her urine did not show any of the morphine in her system, and she had more morphine than she was suppose to have. About 2 or 3 days after her Dr terminated it, she started to become more tired, emotional, her headaches came back in full force and felt she was having flu like symptoms, and that is when we all realized she had become addicted and dependent on them, so she returned to her Dr. who gave an impression of \"Just another addict looking for narcotics\" and refused to help her even after she said she didn't go in for narcotics, instead she was looking for help to get through the detox she was experiencing. That didn't help and after 4 days of going through hell, she was rushed to the hospital, where she sat for 2 days in ICU, she lost so much weight and looked like she was on her death bed, finally a week later, she was discharged. Now she finds other ways to deal with her pain, and refuses to use prescription narcotics EVER again, all because of the pain she went through. Now what Dr out there can force narcotics on a patient regardless if there is any pain or not what so ever, and terminate the contract because for not taking EXACTLY what the bottle says to take. Can any Dr out there see just how one of the reasons prescription drug abuse on the rise, it starts right in their office for many!",

            "conclusion": "The United States Should End the War on Drugs",
            "premise": "Individuals participate in society because it is in the best interests of all who participate. Left to their own device, people are selfish, cruel, and miserable. Many people simply lack the logic and proper ability to reason to make effective choices even if all the required evidence, materials and information is available to them. In a hands-off approach to society, these people are effectively destined to lead miserable and unfulfilled lives solely because they are born and raised in an environment in which their nature is to fail. Stating that it is immoral for government to interfere in the lives of individuals does not make it fact. It is an assertion. Defining government any way you wish will obviously allow any moral claims as to the proper role of government to be true by definition. Clearly I can do the same in saying that people of a nation have an implicit social contract with the government, the purpose of which is to provide the maximum amount of happiness to the most people. The first claim that my opponent makes is that the most commonly abused drugs are \"legal prescription drugs\". This is a patently false an very misleading statement. Pro's source clearly states that 20% of US citizens have used some kind of prescription medication for non medical reasons. This includes people who have used said medication only one time. Using this same criteria, we find that Marijuana is more than twice as popular as prescription drugs [1], while alcohol and tobacco are almost four times as popular[2][3]. My opponent seems to limit her understanding of the War on Drugs to the legislative and educational effects of specific policies that are included within the War on Drugs. By making this mistake, she makes a clear and confusing contradiction. She argues that: :the repercussions of said drugs are 99% less harmful than the drugs that are legal. despite the fact that she must know that illegal drugs are used far less than legal drugs. A drug such as morphine or Heroin is effectively harmless in comparison to something such as alcohol. In addition to being less harmful, morphia is possible to directly substitute for alcohol in even extreme cases of alcohol obsession[4]. However, despite their relative safety, almost as few as .6% Americans use opiates[10], while over 50% of the population regularly uses alcohol. How can you possibly explain this contradiction? Why would Americans use a substance that is obviously more harmful at a rate that is much higher than than a drug that is much safer and more pleasant? The answer is that the War on Drugs is not simply the sum of legislation and programs regarding drug use and distribution. It is a state of mind. It's a perspective that allows one to hold simultaneously contradictory beliefs without question or doubt. The overwhelming majority of Americans KNOW that drugs like Heroin are far more harmful and dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes. They also KNOW that virtually identical drugs are perfectly harmless when \"prescribed\" or \"prescribable\" by a doctor. In essence, the system itself is it's own ultimate justification. How can you honestly trust a person to make rational health decisions for themselves when they openly admit that their beliefs directly contradict with the most basic rules of logic? Surely one would never argue that a child should be given the opportunity to make negative life altering decisions. This is because they lack the innate ability of rationality that we associate that with adulthood. However, what few want to admit is that rationality does not exist in a static state. Rather, rationality is measured on a sliding scale, with no true reference point. Most adults, while arguably more rational than children, need to their behavior regulated lest the slip into a chain of self destructive behavior. While Pro may be quick to point out that the majority of people are responsible enough to regulate their own behavior, the evidence clearly shows this to be false. The overwhelming majority of Americans have some type of degrading vice, whether it be the inability to control their eating, substance abuse, or any other emotional disorder. Now, Pro may be inclined to argue that such restrictions on human behavior are severe intrusions on freedom. However, the concept of freedom is arbitrary. There is no evidence that such a thing as free will exists; people are slaves to their own passions and their own nature. By strictly regulating human behavior, we are able to substitute the horrors of human nature (enslavement) for the lesser burden of societal codes. Even if one's natural state is changed by government, there is no reason to reject this intrusion if one clearly benefits from this \"intrusion\". Even if you regard it as slavery, there is no reason to not choose the more kind of two masters if no other choices are present. As for the War on Drugs itself, obvious changes need to be made. Much more power needs to be given to the federal government to establish full police power to truly enforce prohibition. One of the reasons why alcohol (and current) prohibitions do not work as well as they could is that the federal government relies on states to enforce the law by proxy. In the current system, States have a conflict of interest when it comes to enforcing drug laws. They have a variety of other important aspects of law enforcement to attend to, and suppressing drug use does not yield immediate benefits. During prohibition, as it is now, resulted in a half hearted enforcement of drug laws. This has shown to be effective in countries that have taken a serious stance as far as prohibiting specific substances such as alcohol[9]. Currently we are focused primarily on the least harmful of substances. Rather, we should focus most of our efforts on the most dangerous of drugs, such as smoked tobacco, alcohol, and methamphetamine. This can be accomplished by slowly reversing the perceived dangers of legal drugs. By releasing a new wave of propaganda and social indoctrination, we can make people understand that the (real) most harmful drugs should be the least socially acceptable, while retaining the illegal status (seeing as all but marijuana are currently at unprecedentedly low levels as it is). There is already a massive movement to criminalize tobacco and once that is accomplished, Alcohol companies can take on the role as the new Evil Villain. Studies showing that alcohol being more dangerous than Heroin and Cocaine will produce cries of moral outrage and condemnation of the companies that have defended and encouraged such horrible concoctions. The mentality of an invisible War on Drugs has showed itself to be a useful tool for manipulating the behavior of society. To abandon it now will be to have wasted nearly a century of social engineering and experimentation. We've proved beyond a doubt that through social manipulation, use of certain drugs can be pushed into nearly non existence despite their relative safety and medical history. While prohibition has had marginal effects already, imagine how much of a difference can be made by prohibiting drugs that are truly are the most dangerous? 1. http://www.time.com... 2. http://www.ok.gov... 3. http://rileychildrenshospital.com... 4. http://books.google.com... 5. http://www.drugpolicy.org... 6. http://www.nytimes.com... 7. http://pewresearch.org... 8. http://www.scrippsnews.com... 9. http://en.wikipedia.org... 10. http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "War on drugs should be abolished",
            "conclusion": "War on drugs should be abolished",
            "premise": "First of all, in the second contention of Round 2 it should say \"harsh prison sentences,\" NOT \"harsh prison citizens.\"I apologize for posting my rebuttal in Round 2. Feel free to give Pro the conduct point, but as I will demonstrate now, the arguments should definitely go to Con. Pro's rebuttal is brief, so I will review it line by line, and point by point.Refutations\"First of all, drug users obviously cause harm to themselves by their usage of drugs\"I would disagree with Pro here. It is our business if people are causing harm to themselves. If people are suffering, we have a moral obligation to assist them. This is why we have: suicide hotlines, counselors, psychiatrists, and rehab centers. To put things bluntly, Pro is being very insensitive here. I do agree, however, that a problem with drug usage should be treated as a medical condition. Unfortunately, this isn't relevant to the war on drugs though. I didn't think this would be necessary but just for clarification, the war on drugs is: \"An initiative begun under the administration of US President Ronald Reagan that attempted to eliminate\u2014or markedly decrease\u2014drug abuse.\" [1]\"Secondly, it is not uncommon for drug users to cause harm to other people Take for example, the fact that about 8,000 people are killed each year as a direct result of drug-related auto accidents. [1] [2] Additionally, the use of drugs results in more than 400,000 visits to the emergency room each year.\" Pro makes a blatant bare assertion that violence is a result of drug users feeling as though they have been treated unfairly. Pro completely ignores the fact that 8,000 people are killed annually from drug-related auto accidents, so my point about drug users causing harm to other people still stands. As for crime going up as a result of prohibition of alcohol, I don't see how this is relevant. This is an event that took place over eighty years ago, and while it was illegal to sell or manufacture alcohol in the U.S., it was not illegal to consume it. This is the reason why organized crime was on the rise; It was illegal to sell and manufacture, but it was not illegal to consume. There was a demand, but there was no supply. This was a dream come true for criminals looking to make a profit. The war on drugs doesn't compare to prohibition because it is not legal to manufacture, sell, or consume drugs. The fact that 25,000 people die annually in alcohol-related crashes don't help Pro's case. It doesn't warrant the end of the war on drugs. Rather, it means we need to implement stricter laws to help curb drunk driving and provide for the safety of the public. \"50,000 people are hospitalized for motorcycle accidents.\"By using a motorcycle as a method of transportation, you are not causing a significant risk to other people. You are causing a potential risk to yourself, but this is sufficiently negated by our traffic safety laws and the fact that motor cyclists are required to wear helmets. \"23,000 kids go to the hospital each year for sledding accidents\" Same thing as motor cycles, you aren't causing a significant risk to other people as you are when you are driving a car under the influence of drugs. \"7,000,000 people go to the hospital every year for smoking related accidents\"First of all, anything smoking related can hardly be called an \"accident.\"Additionally, smoking tobacco does not produce the same mind-altering effects that illegal drugs do. Smoking tobacco may be bad for your health, but it does not impair your mental functions enough to warrant criminilization. Furthermore, we have laws concerning cigarettes and second-hand smoke to help protect other people. \"I was simply showing how the cycle of crime directly relates from kids being deprived of their fathers over crimes that really shouldn't even be crimes in the first place, therefore, my argument stands.\"As I have said before, it is unfortunate that children are left without fathers but that does not warrant the legalization of drugs. We can't simply repeal a law because it puts fathers in jail. This argument is an emotional appeal and nothing more.Making drugs legal would make crime rates go down. I already established why prohibition isn't relevant to this resolution. See above. \"Actually it makes perfect since. You know. Like when you want something really bad and when you finally get it, it loses appeal.\"No I don't, actually. Not only did you not refute my argument, but you are only stating your opinion here. There's literally no argumentation to be found here. \"Ask yourself, would you rather have your next door neighbor smoke marijuana quietly and harmlessly next door without affecting you or would you rather have him imprisoned and your tax money pay for him.\"There's a lot more than just Marijuana that's illegal. You completely ignore the fact that drug users harm other people, and the fact that they harm themsevles and therefore, we are morally obligated to assist them.ConclusionThis debate isn't about whether or not addiction should be treated as a medical condition. This debate is about whether or not we should end the war on drugs. Pro's entire rebuttal in Round 2 was a result of a complete and utter misunderstanding of my arguments, as well as the resolution. I have more than adequately refuted Pro's arguments, and my arguments have just been misunderstood, and not attacked. For these reasons I see no other vote but Con.

I'll now respond to Pro's objections.Defense LegalizationAdvantage one: Crime Down Pro argues that the drug cartels are involved in other crimes as well. I have a few responses.--> Granted, but what kind of impact does this have? I mean obviously the drug cartels specialize n drug crime, so the majority of their crime would go away. --> My CP would deprive the cartels of much of their revenue, making their abilities to commit crime go down. --> My CP frees up law enforcement and resources of the U.S., allowing us to migitate crime quicker.--> The New York Times card my opponent brought in supports my side, because it claims that the crime comes from \"Mexico\u2019s drug cartels and their trade.\"[Emphasis mine].--> He draws a really good example regarding prohibition, however it is turned to my side. Consider that since alcohol is now legal the black maret for it no longer exists. Granted, it may have continued to exist for a short time, but it n longer does. This historical precedent shows that the underground market for drugs would likely disappear as well.--> He makes another good argument about how prescription medication causes more deaths. However if you read his card, it only specifies abuse of perscription drugs (which is illegal) so the advantage is turned to my side. Advantage Two:Dropped.Advantage Three: Pro Argues: \"our resources are not and should not be tied down in searching and destroying nuclear material.\"--> What? We shouldn't spend our resources preventing a deadly nuclear attack, but we should spend them invading a sovereign nation over different types of herbs?He further argues that preventing nuclear proliferation makes us appear controlling ....and invading our neighbors doesnt? My plan has by FAR less negative impact, especially considering how it already happens in the status quo.Border FencePro only argues that people can tunnel under the fence.--> Yes, but having a fence there in the first place still slows down the cartels and gives law enforcement a greater window of opportunity to capture them.Mandatory executions\" Speaking of US hegemony, what do you the perception of the US would be when the rest of the world sees us killing someone with a gram of marijuana? \"--> Refer to counterplan one. We could legalize the soft drugs if we wanted. --> It's true that my plan would reduce some diplomatic power of the U.S., but the Hard power gained outweighs. My Opponents plan leads to soft power being much decreased, because an unwarranted invasion makes the worldview of the U.S. decline substaintially, and Hard power goes down because our resources and soldiers are tied up in Mexico fighting a useless war.Note that my Opponent hasn't even presented a coherent case about how we could/why we should invade Mexico so even if you don't buy any of my arguments, still vote Con because it's the status quo.

That's because although drugs like Tamiflu can prevent an individual from contracting swine flu, there aren't enough stocks of this anti-viral medicine to go round and, consequently, paranoid posh people have been purchasing this medicine from private doctors, even though they are not suffering any symptoms of the virus. (1) This costs them a small fortune but the posh know that if Tamiflu is running out, doctors would rather prescribe the drug to innocent little children rather than bloated tycoons or inbred aristocrats. You see, as far as the posh are concerned, the poor to can go to hell in a handcart - make no mistake, these over-privileged toffs and snobs don't care how many orphans die so long as they don't contract the virus themselves and have to suffer the inconvenience of a runny nose and a sore throat. Now, several governments around the world have, quite rightly, prohibited posh people from handing over huge wedges of cash in exchange for a Tamiflu precription and I contend that all governments should adopt this policy forthwith.

            "premise": "Thank you for the reply.Because my opponent did not attempt to rebut my statements about the risk of psychological dependency present in the use of hallucinogens, I will assume that she has conceded this point. Also, because her original argument was that hallucinogens cause zero physical harm and she is now arguing that they cause relatively little harm, voters may consider her to have lost the debate at this point.My opponent claimed that the effects of LSD and other psychedelic drugs are not more dangerous than prescription drugs, other recreational drugs or cigarettes.Prescription drugs compared to hallucinogensThe example my opponent used for this claim was Abilify. However, the list of possible side effects for Abilify are far less serious than those of psychoactive drugs. While increased blood sugar levels, elevated lipid and cholesterol levels and weight gain may cause other health complications over time, they are not immediately dangerous unless the victim has pre-existing health conditions.(1) Because Abilify is a prescription drug, clients with these conditions are not able to obtain the drug by legal means anyway.(2)Contrast this with psychedelic drugs, which have the potential to cause immediate, life-threatening danger with seizures, erratic blood pressure or coma.(3)Methamphetamines compared to hallucinogensBecause methamphetamines are currently illegal, my opponent's argument has little to no weight. It is pointless to say that because one dangerous and illegal drug is less deadly than another that it should be made legal.Cigarettes compared to hallucinogensWhile nicotine may be extremely dangerous over time, it is still not immediately dangerous. Hallucinogens are. The statistics my opponent presented are a far better argument for the outlawing of nicotine products than the legalization of psychedelics.On overdosingAlthough one may assume that hallucinogen OD-related deaths would be relatively low in places where the drug was properly regulated, this is irrelevant as these drugs can trigger lethal side effects even when there is not enough of the drug present to cause an overdose.On the positive effects of hallucinogensA single study is hardly enough to be conclusive and the websites and literature of government agencies around the world still support a connection between psychotropics and mental illness. As for ketamine, it is a legal drug precisely because it has been found to have positive health benefits and lower risks than other hallucinogens. In fact, there are no long term side effects in people who have the drug legally administered to them.(5)Sources1. http://www.mayoclinic.com... 2. http://www.abilify.com...3. http://www.intheknowzone.com...4. http://www.recovery.org...5. http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "conclusion": "Marijuana Should be Legalized in the United States of America.",
            "premise": "(Dont worry about the delayed response, no harm done :) ) Ok lets get to it then 1) \"Prohibition does not stop consumers from consuming it.\" Prohibition of Marijuana does control consumption of it because it severely limits ACCESS to it. People who are addicted to Marijuana will go to extreme costs and pay even more to have access to the drug, but legalizing it would mean everyone would have constant access to it and then millions of more people would increase the number of those addicted to the drug and the side effects it causes..... 2) \"If used correctly Marijuana can be an alternative to many medicines\". Now let me state that this is very true but there are 2 problems. The first is that it must be used correctly, If Marijuana were to be used for medical purposes it would have to be prescribed by a licensed doctor to only one individual who has a disease or ailment that Marijuana can alleviate. After that the prescription only can allow that single person access to a very limited amount of Marijuana so that it could improve his/her health without triggering an addiction. legalizing marijuana for all would cause many many people to abuse it and become addicted to it which would cause more health problems then it would solve since Marijuana only causes ailments to subside by causing a euphoria in the person using it. The second is that this argument is a good argument for the legalization of MEDICAL Marijuana (which i do support) but this debate is about the legalization of Marijuana as a drug. Legalizing it as a drug would make it available to millions of Americans who would most likely abuse the drug or suffer side effects from using it..... Marijuana is safer than tobacco and alcohol, this is true but your comparing it to two of the most harmful substances in the world. Marijuana is less dangerous than tobacco but Marijuana contains hundreds of chemicals that have been proven to be carcinogenic (cause cancer) http://www.abovetheinfluence.com... Marijuana also causes an enormous number of teenage addictions, in fact addictions to Marijuana are greater than addictions to all the other illegal narcotics COMBINED The dangerous aspect about Marijuana is that it directly causes very few deaths compared to other substances (both legal and illegal) but it causes many many other problems that could lead directly to death Marijuana plays a role in 15% of teenage car deaths, 1 in 6 teenage marijuana users become addicted, Marijuana deteriorates memory, attention, and learning skills which can cause people still in school to flunk People who have used the drug feel less physically and mentally healthy It can worsen psychotic symptoms in people which may cause extreme paranoia http://www.drugabuse.gov... http://www.abovetheinfluence.com... http://www.well.com... http://www.teengrowth.com... I agree that Marijuana is not as lethal (keyword lethal) as tobacco or alcohol, but i do believe that Marijuana should still remain illegal because it causes many harmful side effects that can harm people and play a factor (just a factor) in their deaths as well..... As of 2012 guess how many deaths in the US involved Marijuana, almost 64,000 deaths and well over 300,000 serious injuries for 2010 ALONE. roughly 370,000 deaths and 2.3 million serious injuries since 2001 http://drugwarfacts.org... Marijuana is a very harmful drug and it should not be legalized as a marketable product",

Resources are not required unless using a statistic. 1) I believe there should be less people in jail for use of drugs, as it is their own choice and sending them to jail for it uses up valuable tax dollars and space needed for more serious offenders. 2) I believe if you take away meth and heroin, the drugs that are pure poison, there's no need to worry about death from using drugs like ecstasy that are cut with meth, if the government were to create and sell the drugs they could make a higher amount of money and insure the safety of the people who use them. If they had a dosage level that would be maximum amount labeled around the country people would not overdose unless they didn't listen to the warnings. 3) If one was to use the drugs they'd have to be a certain age, and schools would still advertise the dangers of drugs and just because they're legal (Like alcohol) doesn't mean they're ok or good.",
