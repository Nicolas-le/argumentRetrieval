The most crucial thing is that the students learn or gain something fruitful from the schools.Some research indicates no direct relationship between learning and homework, whereas other studies state that homework can cause stress in young students and that students from lower-income homes may not have access to the same amount of parental assistance and resources as students from higher-income homes. We just have to ensure the students score with flying colors in their exams and understanding towards all the subjects. As you can seen in above statement, homework causes stress to students. Especially in Asia region, parents like to sign up extra-classes after school for students to brush up their studies. They have to do the homework which is assigned by the teachers from school and extra-classes. If we remain in this state-quo, students will just get too stresses out and give up their studies. Is this the outcome you speculate?",

            "premise": "For this round of debate, I will state my contentions and provide supporting evidence as to why they are viable. 1) Large amounts of homework are bad for children. \"Nancy Kalish's daughter was an enthusiastic middle-schooler -- until homework started to take over, consuming her evenings and weekends. When she started dreading school, the Brooklyn mom began to grow alarmed.\" This is just one of many cases where children are being overworked to the point where a mother or father might get involved. A group of Australian researchers have stated that, \"Piling on the homework doesn't help kids do better in school. In fact, it can lower their test scores.\" Furthermore, according to Richard Walker, an educational psychologist at Sydney University, countries where students spend excessive time on homework prove to have worse results on standardized tests. These three pieces of evidence prove that homework is overworking children. In some cases, overworking be beneficial, but overwork defined by Oxford dictionary is, \"exhaust with too much work.\" Going back to my first example about the daughter of Kalish, exhaust has proved to alert her mother so much that she wrote, \"The Case Against Homework: How Homework Is Hurting Our Children and What We Can Do About It,\" to further prove her point. For this reason, I urge a con ballot. I have a question for you. If these large amounts of homework are negatively impacting student's test scores, how is this beneficial to a student's future life? Keep in mind that test scores such as the SAT are a huge part of college acceptance. http://www.parenting.com... http://www.livescience.com...",

            "premise": "I invite you to quote your sources about the research you are talking about. First I would like to come back on what you said. If students are given extra-classes in Asia, or in any other country, that is in order to help those students who might have difficulties but still want to progress. Therefore, teachers giving those extra-classes will be there only to help the students, for instance with doing his homework. I doubt they also give extra-homework, unless if the students are really looking forward to delving into courses. Even in that case, I think that if a student gives up his studies it is because courses are too difficult for him or because he is not motivated enough but not because of homework he sometimes can't manage to do. Then, I would like to point out that homework such as exercises are great for the student because it gives him the possibility to put what he learnt into practice and to be sure he has understood the concepts seen in class. For example homework in mathematics or physics allow the student to move from abstract ideas and formulas to concrete examples. Afterwards when the homework get corrected, he will know whether he was right or wrong. In both cases it is beneficial as he can either be sure he understood or understand the mistake he made, not to make it again. Finally, it is generally agreed that working regularly leads to better results, the brain being able to memorize information easier if they are constantly repeated. That is one of the reasons why homework is beneficial to students, indeed it obliges the student to work when he is at home. Doing so, he will review what he learnt early on and it amounts to the same thing, that is to say to work in a constant way in order to better succeed. Last but not least, doing homework allows the student to develop skills such as a better organization, efficiency or memorising abilities. By way of conclusion, I can't see why would homework be something bad or useless, as its main goal is to help students getting better by raising the difficulties they could be facing and by consolidating what they are good at.

Homework helps kids understand what is being taught by giving them experience. It also helps kids remember what they were taught earlier by making them use what they've learned. Secondly, banning homework would be ridiculous. Are we seriously going to make that a law? The government is already a little too involved in the private lives of it's citizens, and this would go beyond even that. Also, banning homework would demand that you enforce that in not only public schools, but also with private schools and home-schoolers. Telling a private school that they can't issue homework would be unreasonably interfering with a private institution, which the government has no right to do. As for home-schoolers, one could say that all the work they do is homework, as it's all done at home!

We all know that parents dislike their kids when they jump on the couch, scream, or run around the house breaking some items along the way. Homework solves the problem of breaking items. If homework is not banned, items around the house would not be as broken as if homework was banned. ==> Conclusion After reading these arguments, I hope that you can understand why homework is beneficial.

This does not prove that students should never get homework in their education. Parents don't always know how to help the student with homework, but the student can still email the teacher or ask about it the following day after doing the best they can on it. As you said, in middle and high school, students can use their study halls and homeroom well by working on their homework and if a problem arises, they can try to contact the teacher whenever the teacher is open that day. Also, study halls do help students have more time after school to do other things. I still believe it helps students learn and see what they need to study and improve upon the most.

            "conclusion": "Homework Should Be Abolished",
            "premise": "Firstly, let me define the important terms. ~Homework: work that teachers give their students to do at home ~Abolished: to end an activity or custom officially The argument I will be saying in this round is: ~homework is beneficial to children in moderate amounts And in Round 3 I will be stating that: ~homework enables school days to be shorter Then in the final round, I will be doing a rebuttal of my opponents well-meaning, but perhaps misguided views. Firstly, homework is beneficial to children in schools, as long as it is in moderate amounts. I, as team opposition, understand that in large amounts, homework can overload the child and can be very stressful. But when moderated, homework can be extremely beneficial. The most common benefit of homework is the obvious, improvement in academics. \"Researchers who looked at data from more than 18,000 10th-graders found there was little correlation between the time students spent doing homework and better grades in math and science courses. But, according to a study on the research, they did find a positive relationship between standardized test performance and the amount of time spent on homework.\" This source obviously shows the correlations found in tests. However, doing homework has a lot of less-know benefits for children \"Pryor-Johnson identifies four qualities children develop when they complete homework that can help them become high-achieving students: responsibility; time management; perseverance; and self-esteem. While these cannot be measured on standardized tests, perseverance has garnered a lot of attention as an essential skill for successful students. Regular accomplishments like finishing homework build self-esteem, which aids students\" mental and physical health. Responsibility and time management are highly desirable qualities that benefit students long after they graduate.\" My source clearly demonstrates my point. Whilst the general public may not know these benefits, they are there, improving the child's work across the board. So, as you can clearly see from these arguments, and the sources I have provided, homework should not be abolished because it is beneficial to the children who do them.

            "premise": "[ REBUTTALS ]1. Con claims that homework teaches kids responsibility. He says when kids (don't) do homework, they learn that it is their fault and \"NOT THE PARENT'S FAULT\" that it is turned in late. Please extend all of my Point 2 arguments as a rebuttal to this contention. Respected teacher John Spencer notes, \"Homework doesn\u2019t teach kids responsibility. It teaches compliance. A better solution is self-directed, independent, optional learning\" [1]. A student exemplifies responsibility when they take ownership of their own education and look to improve it by choice. Completing tasked assignments to avoid disciplinary action isn't necessarily an indicator of responsibility. Moreover, many of the alleged benefits of homework (such as teaching responsibility) can be acquired through other, more beneficial endeavors [2]. For example participating in athletics arguably encourages more responsibility than homework [3]. Kids have to learn to keep to a schedule, work on a team, concentrate, persevere through adversity, practice, and all while enjoying the added benefits of exercise, improved motor skills, better health and stress relief. However kids won't have time to pursue these other endeavors if they are saddled with homework.Jobs teach kids responsibility - should we mandate jobs for that reason alone? Just because something may (or may not) be beneficial does not mean it ought to be required. 2. Homework also provides kids with the ability to manage their own time.Please extend my Point 3 and Point 4 arguments as a rebuttal to this contention. A child's homework completion or performance is not only dependent on their time, but that of their family and care giver's schedule. Kids already \"work\" in school all day, and should have free time after school to pursue other endeavors (or practice their academic endeavors individually according to their needs or parental preferences). Some have pointed out that assigning homework in and of itself is a reflection of the teacher's own poor time management in sufficiently managing the curriculum [4]. Adults lament having to take their work home with them, and often suffer as a direct result [5]. We should not impose the same burdens on children unnecessarily. 3. My opponent claims that homework helps kids get better grades on their tests.Please extend my Point 1 arguments as a rebuttal to this contention. Con presents one source noting 5 or 12 studies that allegedly link value between homework and academic achievement. I've presented numerous studies contending the exact opposite in the last round. Here is some more research:\"Students enrolled in college physics courses were surveyed to determine whether any features of their high schoolphysics courses were now of use to them. At first a very small relationship was found between the amount of homework that students had had in high school and how well they were currently faring. But once the researchers controlled for other variables, such as the type of classes they had taken, that relationship disappeared. The researchers then studied a much larger population of students in college science classes \u2013 and found the same thing: homework simply didn\u2019t help.\"Philip M. Sadler and Robert H. Tai, 'Success in Introductory College Physics: The Role of High School Preparation,' Science Education 85 [2001]: 111-36. In fact homework doesn't teach kids to practice the skills they have been taught, but rather \"drill and kill\" information that does not develop meaning. \"Learning isn\u2019t just a matter of absorbing new information or acquiring automatic responses to stimuli. Rather, we human beings spend our entire lives constructing theories about how the world works, and then reconstructing them in light of new evidence. Not only educational theorists but virtually all cognitive researchers today \u201c[sub]scribe to this constructive view of learning and knowledge. The kind of teaching most consistent with it treats students as meaning makers and offers carefully calibrated challenges that help them to develop increasingly sophisticated theories. The point is for them to understand ideas from the inside out\" [6]. If I have to present even more research next round I will, or I can expand on why my studies have better quality than Con's. But the takeaway should be that my research should be accepted because there is no good reason to accept that homework's \"drill and kill\" provides a positive educational impact.

He is supposed to be making the case himself and using sources to back up his arguments - not citing other people's arguments and presenting them as his own.

The best way to put something to memory is repetition, and this is one of the things homework does. Let's say student A is in a math class and is having trouble with factoring of quadratics, the best way for the student to learn is to do examples and learn the different ways that they can factor and as they do more and more problems it will become faster and faster until they eventually master it. The other big thing that homework does is that it forces you to think about class outside of class time so the information is not forgotten. Let us use student A for an example again. If he learns the method to factor the quadratic in class and then he spends 24 hours away from class what are the chances he learns it? The homework is reinforcing the information. It also fosters independance and improves study skills (1) source will be in comments as con has limited me to 1000 character and wont fit.",

            "premise": "Homework creates a bridge between school and home. Parents rarely get to spend much time with you while you're at school. Homework allows them to keep up with what you're doing in your classes on a daily basis. But you don't have homework purely for your parents' benefit. It's good for you, too! Homework can help you become a better student in several different ways. First of all, homework given in advance of a particular subject can help you make the most of your classroom discussion time. For example, before beginning a discussion of a complex period in history, it can be very helpful to read background information as homework the night before. Homework also gives you valuable practice with what you've learned in the classroom. Often, the brief period of time you have during class to learn something new is simply not enough. Repeating classroom concepts at home helps to cement in your mind the things you learned. For example, you've probably experienced the value of homework when it comes to mathematics. A new concept explained in class might seem foreign at first. With repetition via homework, however, you reinforce what you learned in class and it sticks with you. Without homework, a lot of classroom time would be wasted with repetition that could more easily be done outside the classroom. In these ways, homework expands upon what is done during the day in the classroom. Your overall educational experience is better, because homework helps you to gain and retain more knowledge than would be possible with only classroom work. As you learn more, you know more and you achieve more\"and you have homework to thank! Homework teaches lessons beyond just what's taught in the classroom, too. Bringing homework home, completing it correctly, and turning it in promptly teaches a host of other important life skills, from time management and responsibility to organization and prioritization. Despite these benefits found by researchers, the topics of who should receive homework and how much homework are hotly debated among educators and researchers. In one study, researchers found that academic gains from homework increased as grade level increased, suggesting homework is more beneficial for older students. Some researchers have found that too much homework can lower or cancel its benefits and become counterproductive, because students become burned out.",

            "premise": "Thanks!Point 1Con claims that my research is outdated, however fails to explain how the date is relevant to the majority of my contentions. In fact data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides a good look at trends in homework (HW) for the past three decades, and concludes that today's students have had about the same amount of HW over the last 30 years [1]. This means all of my studies are relevant. I presented studies that collected data from more than 10,000 students nationwide between 1990 and 2002 [2]. The TIMSS report is from 2007 and covers 59 different countries [3]. Is research from the last 8-20 years really that off base? Con would have to prove that the amount of homework assigned then vs. now is drastic enough to make a difference, but he won't be able to.Con states that my research only includes a small portion of the population, and therefore this research is not valid. However this negates the very own research he presents. First, almost all of the \"pro homework\" studies cited by the CPE is research from the 1950s to 1990s, making Con's claim about my allegedly outdated research null and void. Second, Con does not prove that those studies account for more of the population than the ones I have presented. If he cannot, then we have no reason to believe that the pro-HW studies are any more valid. Con's very own source: \"Information from international assessments shows little relationship between the amount of homework students do and test scores.\"\"Kohn says... there is no conclusive evidence that homework provides any benefits\u2014either academic or nonacademic\u2014to students.\" \"Homework also has potentially negative associations, one involving students' economic status.\"\"Teachers do not give students more help if they have trouble with homework.\"\"Lower-achieving students may take more time than higher-achieving students to finish assignments\" [3]. Indeed it would appear there is conflicting information, and there are some cases where homework could be beneficial. [ Re: Counterplan ]1A. Even if we accept HW can sometimes be beneficial, Con is only saying that *beneficial* homework be required - not all homework. Yet he cannot ensure the HW assigned will, in fact, be beneficial. 1B. Just because something is beneficial does not mean it ought to be required. Exercise, a healthy diet and a good amount of sleep are all beneficial to one's health and even education, as those factors affect one's academic performance [4, 5]. Schools can encourage these things in their facility, however in the home they rely on parents to do what's best for their children. As I mentioned in the last round, parents should determine or influence the way their kids learn or reinforce information in the home. If they want their kid to do homework, they can assign it or seek additional resources. In his Point 4 rebuttal, Con claims that HW is simply defined as \u201cschoolwork that a pupil is required to do at home\" and my suggestion that it can sometimes be beneficial works as a concession. It does not. First, homework is uniform and I specifically advocated an assortment of assignments TBD by teachers, students and parents - not uniform HW. Second, Con must prove that homework ought to be required - that is mandated by the school/state. Again just because something is beneficial does not mean it should be required. Homework can be suggested, encouraged or even assigned, but not necessarily mandatory.Point 2My opponent claims that he \"doesn't understand\" how the backlash from parents over homework proves that homework is a burden on parents. It's self-evident. Parents complaining about the burden (to the point of going to court) proves it is in fact a burden. He then goes on to say that some parents don't mind homework, and claims he can cite court cases where parents have gone to court asking for homework and won. I would like my opponent to prove that he can cite court cases where parents have asked for more homework and won. He won't be able to, but even if he did, all this proves is that the parents who want homework should be able to give their kids homework, whereas those who don't shouldn't have to. Many parents secure tutors or prep classes for subjects and tests their kids need help with. This can replace homework for the parents who believe it is helpful, without placing an undue burden on teachers and other classmates/parents who feel otherwise. Con argues that by reducing HW time, the problems of HW won't exist. But while they might be less significant, they would still exist. Even 1 hour of HW per night interferes with 1 hour of family or recreational time. Furthermore, Con cannot prove that all students spend the same amount of time on homework, and in fact this was one of my contentions in the last round that Con dropped. We don't assign slower students longer school days, but we assign them longer homework days. Kids who struggle with their HW would spend a lot longer on their tasks than those who do not, meaning required HW is still problematic.Con requests sources proving that parents do homework: A survey from 2008 shows that 43% of parents have done their kid's homework [6]. It's nearly 80% of black and Hispanic parents who do their kid's HW one day per week, and more than 40% of them do it THREE or more times a week out of likely four assigned HW days [7]. It is around 36% for white students. This cheating does not foster independence, responsibility or honesty, nor does it provide any of the alleged benefits of homework to these students. My opponent has dropped my contention that each child has a different home environment. Whereas some parents have the time and resources to dedicate to homework monitoring and assistance, other parents do not have the opportunity to be as involved. Thus a shoddy HW response might reflect poorly on the child unfairly. Many students (especially in low-income areas) specifically have a hard time completing their assignments. They cannot focus in their environments [8] which Con's own CPE source reiterates. Even when good HW is assigned, it is the student's approach that is critical. However teachers cannot monitor or control how students approach their HW. My opponent claims that my research on the utility of homework is outdated (I've argued that his is outdated) and yet I also don't believe his citations account for today's HW distractions. Research shows that students today are not grasping as much of the homework material even when they complete it, because they are distracted by social media and don't retain the information [8].Con argues it doesn't matter that teachers waste time grading homework because they know it is a condition of the job. That's fallacious circular reasoning. Just because something is a condition doesn't mean it ought to be a condition, which is exactly what I'm arguing (that it shouldn't be). I explained that teachers can use the time they spend grading homework to improve their own education (research, school or reading) or plan new and innovative lessons that provide more learning utility than homework. Point 3Con states that I have made the \"unsourced\" claim that by spending time on homework, kids are missing out on time spent on other things. Quite frankly it's ridiculous to ask for a citation on this self-evident fact. If someone spends time on X, they cannot spend time on Y. I'm not sure how that can be any more clear, but hopefully these sources will satiate Con's request [9, 10]. Here is another source claiming homework inhibits rest [11]. My opponent does not deny the utility of things like athletics, the arts, etc. but rather says they are provided in school (irrelevant) and that students already participate in after-school activities. But regardless of the amount of homework assigned, the time spent on HW interferes with other things whether it is rest, relaxation or other hobbies. Further, consider the fact that many older students work (or want to work) but can't as they must complete their \"second shift\" of homework after school. Most adults are not forced to complete work at home after their work day. Even if they were, adults have the option of getting a different job. Con advocates less HW but cannot ensure that less HW (and meaningful work) will actually be provided by the teachers that students cannot opt out of. Point 4Con writes, \"Voters should NOT buy my opponent\u2019s claim that it encourages cheating and creates a gap between the intelligent and academically struggling because this is once again bare assertion on my opponent\u2019s behalf.\" 1 - Parents often do their kids homework (which is cheating).2 - Students cheat because they fear penalty of not completing their assignments from teachers and parents.3 - Grades, rather than education, have become the major focus of many students [12]. Computers can make cheating easier than ever before, and kids have unmonitored (and often unlimited) access to computers in the home. Students can download term papers from the world wide web. They can also take pictures of math calculations that not only provide the answer, but how they got the answer so the student is able to regurgitate it without any effort or learning on their part. Studies show cheating is more common than ever before [13, 14] which is obviously most problematic in the home. Research shows the lowest amount of students admitting to cheating on written assignments is 84 percent, and some data shows it as high as 95 percent [15]. ConclusionCon's point that homework can sometimes kinda sorta maybe be beneficial to some people does not mean it should be mandatory for all. Outside influences have too great an impact on the alleged benefits of HW. Students, parents and teachers can ASSIGN homework, encourage it, grade it but not REQUIRE it given all of the problematic variables. This allows for HW's benefits but also accounts for its problems.SOURCES: http://www.debate.org...",

Quoted from stanford, \"Pope and her colleagues found that too much homework can diminish its effectiveness and even be counterproductive. They cite prior research indicating that homework benefits plateau at about two hours per night, and that 90 minutes to two and a half hours is optimal for high school.\" (1) They say two and a half hours of homework is optimal, however the average amount of homework given is 3.1 hours per night, and again quoted from stanford, too much homework can be counter productive. Another downside is how homework has been linked to causing health issues in students such as sleep deprivation. Quoted from stanford, \"In their open-ended answers, many students said their homework load led to sleep deprivation and other health problems\". (1) Next, I\"d like to address your point when you say \"Many students hate obtaining homework when they have after school activities or they just are lazy.\" Laziness does play a role in this, but students who dislike homework because of extra curricular activities have a solid reason. As stated by stanford, Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were \"not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,\" according to the researchers. Students were more likely to drop activities, not see friends or family, and not pursue hobbies they enjoy. Homework is a balancing act. No one questions homework can be beneficial at times, but in the current state, the negatives outweigh the positives. Over to you",

            "premise": "Thanks Danielle! Point 1 She claims that I provided no explanation of how the date is relevant. This is false. I claimed (and sourced the claim) that the education system has changed since those studies were published and also showed how inaccurate the studies were due to the fact that the percentage of people accounted for are 0.00000947368% of children! She drops this and merely claims that I fail to explain to explain how the date is relevant to the majority of her contentions. This is false as we can clearly see. She then makes a mathematical error in the dates. She claims that her sources are from 8 - 20 years ago. In fact that are from 8 - 26 years ago and I clearly sourced the claim that education and homework has significantly changed in the last 3 decades (see my source [2] from last round). She drops this. She falsely states that I must prove that homework assigned then vs now is different in quantity. This is, as I said, false. All I need to do is show that the systems of education have changed since then because that affects everything. If homework is different in regards to difficulty (for example), then higher quantity is not as necessary if it\u2019s harder. If it\u2019s easier then the opposite is applicable. So the fact that the system of education was different then is a valid reason to consider her sources (at the least, the ones from 20+ years ago); the differences are too large to compare to the present. The fact that my sources are outdated is irrelevant as my intentions and uses of them are different. If I was using those sources for statistical evidence or about the education system (which she does) then outdated sources are unacceptable. If I\u2019m using them for more generic purposes (which I am) then the date is not applicable as it does not affect my point. She cites some Con homework information in my source. I am aware that there is information in my source that I disagree with. I was using that source to reinforce a point that I agreed with in the source. I agree with some of the claims made however I disagree with the sources impact analysis and conclusion of information. Debaters are not expected to agree with everything said in every one of their sources. They are expected to agree with the statement that they are using the source to reinforce. [Counterplan] 1A. This is false. I never said that only beneficial homework is allowed. This would be ideal but not once in my counterplan was the word beneficial mentioned. In fact I only mentioned the word beneficial once in my entire round and it was not in the context in which my opponent states (anybody can check my clicking Ctrl f and searching the word beneficial whilst viewing the debate). 1B. Again, this seems to be a misinterpretation of the counterplan. I never mentioned that it had to be beneficial, nor did I say that beneficial things have to be mandatory. Here is a remind of my counterplan: Homework should be given in moderate quantity (in short). This is about homework QUANTITY (ie. how much homework is given) NOT homework QUALITY (ie. how beneficial it is). I extend the counterplan. I\u2019ll drop the claim that she quasi concedes in order to continue onwards with the debate. I\u2019ll allow voters to consider whether or not this should be viewed as a concession or not. Point 2 The point that she fails to see regarding the burden on parents is that it is in extremely low quantity and I provided accurate statistics showing that this was clearly a minority. The statistics clearly show that the majority of parents are satisfied with homework. Whether I can or can\u2019t cite a court case regarding homework quantity is irrelevant. That argument was only made as an alternative to the counterplan. Since she fails to refute the counterplan, it still stands and due to this her entire objection is negated given that all homework will be reduced to a more suitable quantity. She persists the raise the objection that family time is lost. If anything, family time is created. It is a psychological truism that teenagers (on balance) become more distant from parents and others during this period of their lives, this means that they spend less time with their parents and family [1]. Homework often involves parents helping the child and parents interacting with the child, as she correctly in his initial arguments. We can conclude that since teenagers are distant from their parents and given that parents often involves themselves with their children family time is created indirectly through homework. Different students of different abilities will not take identical amounts of time which is why, within the status quo, there are sets which are based on examination and classwork. Depending on their abilities they are each set different amounts of homework so that it will fulfill a set amount of time [3]. Whilst students are more than welcome to spend additional time on homework, schools give recommended amounts of time and usually make this clear [4]. [2] The fact that parents help with homework is a good thing. The fact that they do it is not. Since setting is based on classwork and examination parents doing homework has no negative effects. The homeworks purpose is to show a child\u2019s understanding of a topic and reinforce their knowledge of the topic from their classwork. If their parents do it then it is the same as what she proposes (ie. no homework) because they are not receiving the benefits that homework has to offer. For the students that actually do their homework, they are benefiting from homework. This contention presents no mitigation to my burden since all it does is show that some people aren\u2019t doing homework and some are. Some people benefiting from homework is better than nobody benefiting from it. She says I dropped his argument regarding different home environments however the counterplan negates this without me having to address it since there will be a lower homework quantity this means that these people will not be overwhelmed with homework - homework is not used as a primary source of determining sets. Schools also take into account financial states [5]. She helps explain the very purpose of homework itself. She points out that homework cannot be monitored in regards to approach and therefore students may not grasp or understand the material properly. If they do not understand it and get all of the questions wrong (for example), then it is the teacher\u2019s duty to correct the student and explain the homework to them. The lesson is designed to teach all students generally. The homework shows specific pupils progress and understanding of that lesson which teachers can then monitor and intervene if necessary in order to help said student to understand it properly [6]. There is a reason as to why it is a condition of the job. It allows teachers to have an individual understanding of a student\u2019s grasp of the lesson so that they can help students that are struggling [6]. Point 3 The reason I asked for sourcing is because I wanted evidence that homework actually digs into and reduces the time that people spend on certain things. Often people can still do their one activity and also do other activities in the same amount of time that they usually would do even without having the first activity, so I was merely asking for confirmational purposes. The CP negates this point since these sources reference to there being too much time being spent on homework due to excessive quantity. The fact that these activities are provided in schools is NOT irrelevant due to the fact that IF you are buying her claim that homework cuts into activity time, students will not be missing out on these activities since they will be doing it in school. She makes a an argument riddled with fallacies. She claims that homework cuts into time for anything. The fact of the matter is that schools cuts into people\u2019s time, work cuts into people\u2019s time, sleep cuts into people\u2019s time, etc. Should people stop going to school, work and stop sleeping in order to do activities? The answer that she will most likely give is no. So why is homework an exception? People still manage to have part time jobs within the status quo, in the UK homework is compulsory and there are a record number of students in part time jobs at the moment [7]. This completely negates my opponent\u2019s claims of a supposed negative correlation. She misunderstands the counterplan. He says that I cannot ensure that less homework will be given by specific teachers. The counterplan is a proposed change in the status quo, thus making it a law for teachers to only be allowed to set a limited amount of homework. Point 4 1 - Homework counts for nothing and only is there to show a student\u2019s understanding of a lesson. So whilst parents cheating is discouraged, it still has no negative benefits that give my opponent\u2019s proposed changes any advantage over mine. 2 - There is no evidence presented in support of this claim. 3 - Whilst cheating can be the case and the same objection to 4 - 1 is applicable here. Her statistics are unreliable. They are posted on a forum site and a bias one too. The site stophomework.com. The website makes little attempt to give credibility to these statistics and the only effort made is where they provide 3 fake links that lead to nonexistent / fake pages. [Conclusion] She provides her sources in an external link which shows a poor demonstration of conduct. She set a character limit and this limit was violated. I have abided by the rules set and not attempted to bypass them in the way that she does. I ask that voters vote on the conduct point as this gave her additional space for rebuttals and gave me limited space for counter rebuttals. More generally, the decision is simple. A vote for the Con is clear at this point in the debate Sources [1] http://bit.ly... [2] http://bbc.in... [3] http://bit.ly... [4] http://bit.ly... [5] http://bit.ly... [6] http://bit.ly...

I for one, learn more when I am at home in a quiet room than I do when I am at school, in my case college, where we also have homework.

What students are given as homework is the problem, not homework itself. Your topic was homework should be banned, I don't think it should. \"Homework\" may have little to do with the reasons behind why students here in America do not get straight A's, but what is happening at home has lot to do with it. Come up with an intelligent idea for how homework should be handled, bring it up to your teacher in a respectful manner, and see what happens. Explain to him/her that you don't believe the homework they require you to do is beneficial to your education. The taxes your parents pay every year is what funds public school systems. You are never too young to stand up for what you believe in. Put some real thought into it before you present your idea.",

            "premise": "Thanks Danielle! This debate has definitely been a fun one to participate in. [Debate Summary] Clarification It is evident that my opponent completely misunderstands what a counterplan is. My counterplan (ie. proposed changes to the status quo which gives me a fraction of the BOP) was in regards to quantity because, obviously, I can feasibly make sure that all homework is beneficial and of a good quality - that does NOT mean that I can\u2019t talk about homework quality within the status quo and in the past because my counterplan is not a list of my advocacies (as my opponent seems to believe). Ergo, there is no contradiction, I hope it is now clear to my opponent and to voters of what a counterplan is and how it is different to my advocacies and rebuttals. So, just to clarify, my counterplan states that quantity is too high so it will be reduced. My rebuttal to my opponent\u2019s source is that it addresses an older version of the education system with different qualities of homework. These statements are not contradictory and can coexist without any contradictions. Nobody should be confused by this. I extend those arguments. Point 1 The outcome of this contention is simple. My opponent uses incredibly unreliable data that fails to account for 99.99999163742% of the children in the world (children in poverty and in poor conditions are still children and should be [and are] included in this figure). Virtually all of my opponent\u2019s sources here deal with large quantities of homework which is something that I\u2019m specifically advocating the removal of from the status quo (as is made evident in my counterplan). My opponent has attempted to show that my sources do not account for as many people as hers however my sources are not being used in the same way that hers are. She is using her sources to prove that homework should be abolished using statistical data. I was using mine for general claims that bare the same weight regardless of the amount of people involved since I did not use these for statistic related claims. She also appears to believe that not every beneficial thing must be mandatory. I have accepted this however my opponent seems to believe that this is as far as her burden requires her to achieve. This is objectively false. There are some things that are beneficial and should be mandatory (my opponent concedes this). Therefore, my opponent\u2019s burden entails them in proving that whilst homework can be beneficial it should not be mandatory. My concession of beneficial things not having to be mandatory does not mean that my opponent\u2019s burden is advanced in any way. Counterplan 1A. My opponent once again misunderstands what a counterplan is. My opponent lies about me saying that my counterplan involves only beneficial homework being implemented. She tries to get out of this precarious situation she\u2019s been put in by saying that by saying this it means that I advocate all homework - even non beneficial homework. This is simply not true. A counterplan is a proposed change to the status quo on the the negative case\u2019s behalf. I cannot make a beneficial related change to the status quo because as my opponent pointed out earlier on in this debate, that simply isn\u2019t feasible. This doesn\u2019t mean that I wouldn\u2019t prefer there to be only beneficial homework, I would. Though this is virtually impossible so I am focussing my counterplan elsewhere. 1B. My opponent makes an identical misinterpretation to what she says in response to point 1A. Just because I\u2019m not making a proposed change on the status quo to make all homework beneficial, doesn\u2019t mean that I do not advocate this - I merely find this proposed changed to be unfeasible and unrealistic. Please extend my counterplan as my opponent pretty much drops it all and instead resorts to refuting nonexistent argument regarding benefits and then making strange and ultimately false complaints about me advocating homework that isn\u2019t beneficial. Point 2 In this contention I proved that the burden on parents is of an extremely low percentage. The majority are clearly content with the status quo. Regardless, even if this objection fails you still ought to presume Con as the counterplan minimizes homework quantity for those that receive too much homework, therefore the burden on parents is virtually non existent. Either way, you ought to consider this point in my favor. She also raised the objection of family time being lost which was also refuted by the fact that I used psychological evidence in order to refute this point and show that in reality family time is created as opposed to being lost. I also showed that students are set based on abilities and are given the amount of homework that should be sufficient in correlation with their ability so that everybody spends the same amount of time on homework (though not necessarily doing the same amount of homework or the same difficulty level in homework). Furthermore, I managed to show that parents doing homework is neither good nor bad. Though no benefits at all is worse. Sets and teaching opinion on students is formulated based on class work and examination (which I proved via citation in the previous round). Therefore, whilst this does happen, all this means is that some students won\u2019t gain anything from homework and some will. I refuted the objection in regards to resources due to the fact that schools take the student\u2019s parents/carers financial state into consideration. My opponent blatantly lies when she says: \u201cCon dropped that even when good HW is assigned, it is the student's approach that is critical.\u201d This is massively untrue. I will quote my response from R3: \u201cShe helps explain the very purpose of homework itself. She points out that homework cannot be monitored in regards to approach and therefore students may not grasp or understand the material properly. If they do not understand it and get all of the questions wrong (for example), then it is the teacher\u2019s duty to correct the student and explain the homework to them. The lesson is designed to teach all students generally. The homework shows specific pupils progress and understanding of that lesson which teachers can then monitor and intervene if necessary in order to help said student to understand it properly\u201d. My opponent\u2019s claim that I dropped this is ludicrous. Point 3 My opponent claims that homework cuts time into things and she also claim that it provides a second shift of work for children. This is automatically negated by the counterplan. Additionally, even if my counterplan was not enacted this contention would still work in my favor since after school activities exist and I presented a large statistic showing that people have plenty of time to do homework alongside activities and I demonstrated that there are a record breaking amount of people in part time jobs in the UK which my opponent drops. Point 4 I have shown that homework does not count towards sets for children. In fact class work and examination are used only. The only claims that my opponent has been able to muster are bare assertions that homework is often graded (which is irrelevant since grading homework is not the same as taking it into consideration when assessing that student\u2019s ability - which is what general classwork and examinations are for). I concede that cheating happens however my opponent\u2019s website regarding cheating statistics is unreliable (and my opponent drops this argument). We can conclude that since homework does not count for anything important, cheating has no effects (neither positive or negative). Whereas the students that opt in to do their homework properly receive the benefits from homework which my opponent concedes when she says that just because homework is beneficial, doesn\u2019t mean that it should be mandatory. Once again, my opponent lies and states that I dropped the effects of HW\u2019s drill and kill methodology. This is false. Again, I will have to quote my response which my opponent supposedly claims is nonexistent when she says that I dropped it: \u201cAgain, the review my opponent cites in an attempt to prove that homework results in the loss of sleep, self esteem and childhood is refuted by the counterplan as it once again references to excessive homework and homework taking up valuable time from children.\u201d The outcome of this debate is incredibly clear. The resolution is negated. Please vote Con!",

            "premise": "1. Homwework is benificialHomework is a obvious benifit to the entire learning process. Homework is almost the equivalent of studying. The more you practice something the more you remember. Students are not excited about homework because they are bombarded with other options that seem far more exciting? Let\u2019s face it - homework is no more exciting today than when we were kids. It was tough for us to do our homework and we did not have nearly as many distractions as today\u2019s students. Their world includes instant communication, muti-tasking, cell phones, exciting video games, texting and social-networking. Homework is competing for your child\u2019s attention against some tough competition. Some students think homework is a waste of time. Others understand the intrinsic value of homework and take responsibility for doing it correctly and handing it in on time. However, the majority of students are somewhere in between these extremes. The students that do their homework without a nightly battle view their education differently. They understand that for a couple of hours school work is the priority and then they can do something else. They understand that homework teaches them where their strengths are and where they need to spend more attention. For most students the problem may not be the homework, but in how they look at it. In the \u201cgood old days\u201d we did our homework because it was expected and because there were far fewer options for our time. 10 Benefits of Homework Homework teaches students about time management. Homework teaches students how to setting priorities. Homework helps teachers determine how well the lessons are being understood by their students. Homework teaches students how to problem solve. Homework gives students another opportunity to review the class material. Homework gives parents a chance to see what is being learned in school. Homework teaches students that they may have to do things - even when they don\u2019t want to. Homework teaches students how to take responsibility for their part in the educational process. Homework teaches students how to work independently. Homework teaches students the importance of planning, staying organized and taking action. School and homework teach students important life lessons that they will use as an adult. For example: It teaches them how to read and comprehend information, communicate ideas with others, listen and take notes, remember things, solve problems, how to develop a plan, set priorities and take action. Homework also teaches students how to concentrate, write reports, spend time alone and helps develop their curiosity about new subject Let me also point out that if we ban homework then we will be detrimenting the learning pocess and will let asians coninue to get ahead of us.",

            "premise": "Hey Harlan, I apologize for being unable to post on the first debate. I've been swamped with school and homework lately and just haven't had time. I am very interested in this topic and I look forward to debating it with you. My opening topic is in response to your original opening statement. Feel free just to repost your original opening statement and add a response to mine. I was once in your shoes Harlan. I completely hated homework. It was trivial to me. I would get the same grades in a class whether or not I did the homework. I hated the fact that I went to school for 8 hours a day just to come home and do another 2-3 hours of homework every night. I disagreed so much with homework that I even called in to a local AM radio show when they were on the topic of homework to voice my opinion. Then came high school and college. My whole opinion of the system reversed. For once in my life I realized what the point of homework was and how beneficial it was to understanding and reinforcing the material that was learned in class. The average high school class is 45 minutes long. In that time you take 5 minutes to organize the class and the rest teaching. In that 40 minutes of teaching it is impossible to reinforce the topics introduced enough to embed them in the minds of the students. That is where homework comes in. Homework reinforces the work that was taught in class and allows the child to fully absorb the information that was presented to them. In college, homework is essential. Without it most of the student population would be lost in translation. Sitting in a lecture hall of 400 students listening to an a professor talk in a monotonic voice doesn't allow anyone to learn anything, it mearly provides a guideline of what needs to be studied and what homework needs to be done to learn the material. Is homework immoral in some cases? Yes. Homework is immoral when it is assigned just to give a student homework and not to reinforce material that was presented earlier in the day. In this case homework interferes with a childs outside of school development as well as time spent socializing and interacting with peers and family members.",

So I am still left with refuting the rest of the Con's statements.However, this round, there is some truth to what the Con says.But once again, I'm forced to bring up the matter at hand of this debate. The Con argues that homework is more bad than good.Therefore, I can only provide evidence that homework is generally more beneficial for the student.As a matter of fact, homework pays off!The benefits are the obvious: It helps children develop positive study skills and habits that will serve them well throughout life Homework encourages children to use their time wisely It teaches children to work independently Homework teaches children to take responsibility for his or her work [1] Besides any disputed educational effects, the latter are reasons homework is beneficial for all children, no matter how old, how well they do, or how much they struggle.Study habits, time management, independence, and responsibility are characteristics that all people need to progress in life, for whatever career path they choose to take. Yes, it is true, homework causes some stress and may result in family disputes. (But not make kids fat. Read this inaccurate and irrelevant article, and you'll understand why I don't buy it. [2])Yet, it can be argued, and I am arguing, that the general benefits outweigh any handicaps. Not only that- but I guarantee that in a majority of the cases in which students are becoming less active or belligerent over homework, the parents are to blame. When students have massive amounts of electronic games or television to watch, why expect them to do homework instead. If every parent were to remove the distractions from the household, then you would have the select few students that genuinely struggle with education and the few situations where homework actually hinders the student pyschologically. In conclusion, homework is generally good and helps more than it does hinders.Thanks for the debate willtreaty1156, I understand this is your first.Vote Pro![1] Top 14 Reasons Why Homework is Important - e-Skool.

Even if the student gets the gist of a subject, the teacher would still send home homework in order to prepare the student for any future tests;which is essentially required studying and practice at home. Outside of the educational ideals, homework teaches students in a simple way about an important aspect in life for the future-- responsibility, that is.

The resolution is \"Schools shouldn't give homework\". PRO must offer sufficient reasons as to why homework should not be assigned. I will offer an argument of my own, just because I can, then I will rebut PRO's argument.1. Schools ought to do that which will promote the success of their students. 2. Assigning homework promotes the success of students.C. Therefore, schools ought to assign homeowork. Defense of P2Homework is most often assigned for the purpose of practice at home. This gives students the opportunity to do practice problem, practice vocabulary, learn concepts, etc, outside of the classroom. Depending on the length of classes and the organization of the school year, a teacher might not be able to assign only classwork for the lessons. Often, a lesson will take a good portion of the class period, and any classwork that was being worked on will be unfinished. It is more reasonable to assign this as homework, as to leave it as classwork for the next class might result in further time constraints. Some teachers have preset dates and times for things like quizzes and tests. Often times, these same teachers like to properly prepare their students. So, then, these teachers might prefer using class time for lessons and homework checks. It is more time effecient to do homework checks rather than classwork. If a worksheet takes 20 minutes (on average) to complete, and class last, say, one hour, there are 20 less minutes available to the class. In school, 20 minutes is a lot of time. This is enough to have a discussion on a poem explication or a method of solving algebraic equations, for example. If students don't have any questions on the work, then 20 minutes have effectively been wasted. If this work is, instead, assign as homework, students can come in and ask questions if they have them in the span of 5 or 10 minutes, thus the lesson moves forward. As noted above, sometimes classwork must be assigned as homework to keep the lesson moving forward. Generally, there are certain standards which must be met for a student to effectively pass a class. Continually pushing back classwork can lead to these standards not be acheived. For example, if on Monday, chapter 1 is covered, and classwork is assigned but not completed, then on Wednesday, when chapter 2 is covered, there is still work for chapter 1 as well as work for chapter 2. If this is a regular practice, the only way for all of the work to be completed is outside of class. A class period rarely changes in length. Some days, there are necessary schedule changes, but for the most part, a one hour class will be one hour. If the lesson takes 45 minutes to cover, and the classwork 20 or more, the classwork will not be completed. Some teachers are vehement about their schedules, and will not adjust for simple things like this. If we are to cover chapter 4 on Tuesday, it will be covered on Tuesday. With those teachers in mind, classwork must be completed outside of class, especially for those who are slower to catch on, as this is the best way to ensure the information is being learned. RebuttalsEven if all of these things are true, that gives no reason why schools should not assign homework. Constant WorkEven if a child is doing work all day, this work is rarely the same subject. Math, science, language arts, history, and other subjects are discussed over the course of a school day. Each of these subjects takes time from the others. If math lasts one hour, that is one hour less available to the other subjects, unless the day is to be extended. Doing work all day does not mean that this work is being done effectively or correctly, nor does it mean that the student has grasp the concept at hand. This is facilitated partially through homework. For math, one does not apply rules and theorems correctly every time after learning once. It takes practice. Unfortunately, math builds on itself. What is learned in early August might well come up in mid-October. The student then has incentive to practice outside of the classroom. The teacher also has a reason to encourage the student to practice outside of the classroom. Homework for a grade acts as such an incentive.It doesn't make you learn more.Homework isn't necessarily meant to make you learn more. Homework is meant to offer further practice on a particular lesson. Practice is the only way to hone a skill. One does not become a basketball star as soon as they step on the court. Likewise, one is unlikely to know how to use the Quadratic formula for math, or make a conversion table for chemistry without practice. Homework serves such a purpose. There is enough time in the day.Not necessarily, and sometimes not at all. For example, in a 50 minute college class, there is rarely any classwork. The only way to practice the material is at home. Likewise, in a one hour high school or middle school class, if teaching the lesson takes too long, time will not be left over. Students might ask questions, class might start late, there might be technical difficulties, there might be need to offer better explanation. The list goes on and on. One cannot assume that since there are generally 7-8 hours in a school that therefore there is time enough to do classwork. There might not be, and as I argued above, sometimes the most efficient way of conducting the classroom is to assign uncompleted classwork as homework.",

            "premise": "Keep in mind I cannot respond to any of Con's dropped contentions.Point 1My opponent seemingly defeats his own argument. In the last round he said exactly this: \"Here is a remind of my counter plan: Homework should be given in moderate quantity (in short).This is about homework QUANTITY (ie. how much homework is given) NOT homework QUALITY (ie. how beneficial it is).\"And yet when explaining why my sources are allegedly irrelevant, he says:\"She falsely states that I must prove that homework assigned then vs. now is different in quantity... All I need to do is show that the systems of education have changed since then because that affects everything. If homework is different in regards to difficulty (for example), then higher quantity is not as necessary if it\u2019s harder.\" In the first statement he says that he is arguing QUANTITY is what matters in assessing homework. And then in the second statement he says DIFFICULTY is what's relevant and quantity isn't relevant at all. I'm sure I am not the only one confused by Con's statements, and once again, I will not have the opportunity to respond.To repeat my position, students have had roughly the same amount of HW quantity over the last 30 years. Con does not deny this - nor has Con proven that a DIFFERENCE in education standards over the last 30 years means a difference one way or the other (easier or harder) let alone a difference in the quality of HW assignments. Moreover, I argued that Con had not proven that his studies account for more of the population than the ones I have presented. If he cannot, then we have no reason whatsoever to believe that the pro-HW studies he cites (noting that quantity of homework is most important -- which I've argued against) are any more valid. He dropped this contention and has not proven that his studies represent a larger sample size.I pointed out that my study examined data of more than 18,000 students to uncover explanations for academic performance. Con suggests we have to use the entire world population of children as a measure which is absurd. Out of 1.9 billion children, 1 billion of them live in destitute poverty [1]. These children, especially in the third world, can't even eat or drink and millions die from starvation daily -- yet Con suggests we should factor them into the population of students who benefit from homework, when they have never seen a school in their life. That is an abusive standard no judge would take seriously. Quite obviously we are discussing homework in the West (especially the U.S.) where public education and the subsequent standards is the norm. Thus 18K is a good sample size for research. Con has not even tried to present us with an estimate of the number of students his cited studies cover, let alone present research that accounts for a larger size. Some studies in his favor have \"hundreds\" yet I invite Con to prove his studies are more relevant in size, date and scope [2, 3]. One study in his favor had a sample size of around 1,300 students -- or about 1/18th of the population my sources covered. In short, Con has dug himself a hole in trying to attack the credibility of my sources and studies; he has not proven his are any more valid. In the last round I decided to move on from this and noted it would appear SOME cases show that homework could be beneficial (accounting for a lot of different variables). Of course, that is completely irrelevant to the rest of my argument. I've pointed out that not everything that is beneficial ought to be required as well as suggested the potential negatives of HW outweigh the potential positives. Indeed that is the crux of my position in this debate. 1A. I pointed out that even if HW can sometimes be beneficial, Con is only saying that *beneficial* homework be required - not all homework. Yet he cannot ensure the HW assigned will be beneficial. He responded with accusations of straw mans when in fact he fails to see the absurdity of this objection. If Con is not saying that only BENEFICIAL homework be required, then he is advocating that even NON-beneficial homework be required. Why would Con advocate non-beneficial homework?! That would be punishment with no substance or positive effect. Therefore it is only logical to assume Con is only advocating BENEFICIAL homework. If he would like to challenge this, I guess he can...1B. It would appear Con does want to challenge this lol. He writes, \"Again, this seems to be a misinterpretation of the counter plan. I never mentioned that it had to be beneficial, nor did I say that beneficial things have to be mandatory.\" So here we can see that Con even supports HW that is not beneficial, meaning he has no good reason (positive benefits) to support HW at all. And furthermore, Con skirts 1B as if it is a meaningless statement when in fact it is the entire basis of my argument. Please extend all of my 1B points -- I pointed out why not all things that are beneficial should be required. Ergo, even if homework were beneficial, it need not be mandatory. Con thinks HW (despite being so problematic) should just be imposed whether it has benefits or not, which is an even more ridiculous position than I think anyone expected him to take. Point 2Con accuses me of not refuting the counter plan which is false. His counter plan is simply \"less homework\" which I have argued, especially in Point 2. \"Con argues that by reducing HW time, the problems of HW won't exist. But while they might be less significant, they would still exist. Even 1 hour of HW per night interferes with 1 hour of family or recreational time. Furthermore, Con cannot prove that all students spend the same amount of time on homework...\" which proves I did address his counter plan of less HW time. My opponent says that it's okay for students to spend different amounts of time on HW, which fails to address my point on an undue burden for slow learners or those who take longer to do assignments. This means additional stress and imposition for those students on recreational and rest time, which Con glosses over as being addressed by special classes/assignments but this cannot be proven or enforced. Even students in special classes learn at a different pace from each other. Con asked for sources proving that parents do their kid's homework. I presented the studies; Con dropped this point and said \"Well kids should be doing it themselves.\" Sure, but extend my argument that they are often NOT doing it themselves based on my statistics. Con must concede this point; instead he suggests this simply doesn't matter. Obviously when parents do their kid's assignments, it places burden on the parents and provides no utility to the child while still creating work for teachers. Once again - whereas some parents have the time and resources to dedicate to HW monitoring and assistance, other parents do not have the opportunity to be as involved. Thus a shoddy HW response might reflect poorly on the child unfairly. Many students (especially in low-income areas) specifically have a hard time completing their assignments.In response, Con says \"since there will be a lower homework quantity, this means that these people will not be overwhelmed with homework\" which clearly doesn't address my points at all regarding lack of resources, not just time. Con also says that the states account for financial factors in HW assignments and cited this source from the UK -- yet not a single line from that source said anything about poverty affecting assigned work or HW. I invite my opponent to copy and paste the line from that source which proves his point here [4]. I have no reason to accept it thus far. And besides, people within the same school can still come from vastly different financial backgrounds. Con states, \"If [students] do not understand [HW] and get all of the questions wrong (for example), then it is the teacher\u2019s duty to correct the student and explain the homework to them.\" However teachers do not give students more help if they have trouble with homework - a factor cited in Con's previous source from the CPE [5]. Con dropped that even when good HW is assigned, it is the student's approach that is critical. However teachers cannot monitor or control how students approach their HW. Con also dropped that his citations don't account for today's HW distractions. Research shows that students today are not grasping as much of the homework material even when they complete it, because they are distracted by social media and don't retain the information.Point 3Con says \"She makes a an argument riddled with fallacies. She claims that homework cuts into time for anything.\" That is not fallacious but a logical fact. If you spend time on X (homework) you cannot spend time on Y (anything else) that requires significant attention. That's called the law of non-contradiction. Just because school provides some activities doesn't mean it provides the same activities or amount of time/attention on those activities as parents or kids would like. Con notes that school, work, etc. cut into people's time and yet I am not advocating those be abolished. I explained how homework provides a \"second shift\" of work that kids should not have to face. Please extend my arguments on parents not being subjected to this burden and having options here; Con dropped it and I will not be able to respond.Point 4Con says that HW \"counts for nothing\" yet HW is often graded. Con says I have provided \"no evidence\" of cheating. See explanations regarding points 12-15 in the last round. He only contested 1 of those sources. One is a forum - the rest are academic - and he ignores that parents doing HW is cheating which he admits happens. He dropped every one of my arguments on copying and using the internet to cheat as well. Con also dropped the negative effects of HW's \"drill and kill\" methodolgy and its impact on learning. PLEASE EXTEND MY LAST ROUND'S CONCLUSION.Thanks!SOURCES: http://www.debate.org...",

            "conclusion": "Reduce homework, lengthen schooltime",
            "premise": "Burden of Proof My Burden of Proof is to prove that greatly reducing the amount of homework given [to High School students] in favor of increasing/setting the length of the school day from 9am to 5 pm does not provide sufficient increased benefit to society or the students to justify making said change. Con Case My case will address several factors that strongly oppose the outright reduction of homework as well as opposing the imposition of a 9 to 5 school day (increased). These are not rebuttals to Pro\u2019s Case but arguments that in themselves oppose great reduction in homework & lengthening of school day. School Day Length Lengthening the school day will ultimately detract from the extra-curricular activities that Students can participate in, both by directly decreasing the amount of overall time available for those activities and by decreasing the viability of participating in activities. \u00a7 Reduced daylight hours available, shortened leisure hours available for decompression from the now lengthened school day, less time to complete homework and more importantly study for examinations, less time and less prime hours available to obtain and work an after-school job. o It is important to the end of educational and social development that extra-curricular activities be a part of a student\u2019s daily or weekly routine. Participation in extra-curricular activities yields better development social and intellectually. Benefits of participating in extracurricular activities included having better grades, having higher standardized test scores and higher educational attainment, attending school more regularly, and having higher a higher self-concept. Participants in out-of-school activities often learned skills such as teamwork and leadership while decreasing the likelihood of alcohol use and illicit drug use and related problem behaviors. Those who participate in out-of-school activities often have higher grade point averages, a decrease in absenteeism, and an increased connectedness to the school. (Wilson, U. Wisconsin-Stout, 2009) [1] Homework Guidelines Homework is a necessary tool of education. By extension, reductions in Homework will hamper ability to fully develop and achieve the best level of education & should be seen as a failure on the part of the education system. There are several components of homework that are valuable in themselves, both educationally and socially 1. Preparation \u201cHomework teaches pupils to take responsibility for their tasks and prepare for life after school. Homework prepares pupils for their next stage in life\u201d. 2. Scheduling \u201cHomework is a way to organize time. It is also a way for teachers to organize their lessons to include appraisal of homework and testing. Homework is also part of organizing one\u2019s free time\u201d. 3. Control and assessment \u201cThe teacher assesses work done by assigning tasks followed by appraisal and testing. This helps a teacher to monitor a pupil\u2019s development\u201d. 4. Love and care \u201cHomework contributes to family members helping each other.\u201d 5. Identity and status \u201cHomework is a sign of a pupil\u2019s identity and acknowledgement that a child is now \u201cbig enough\u201d to take responsibility for one\u2019s schoolwork. It also gives status to a particular subject. When a pupil gets homework to do in a particular subject, that subject gets more respect\u201d. 6. Community and contact \u201cHomework serves to improve communication between teacher and parents\u201d. 7. Work performance Hellsten\u2019s conclusion is that a pupil\u2019s work done in school is not seen as a task carried out. (Hellsten 1997 as cited by Dennis, Malm\u00f6 h\u00f6gskola, L\u00e4rarutbildningen, 2007) [3] Homework teaches responsibility and offers a sense of achievement \u201c[H]omework for pupils is an integral part of the working methodology of the school. To teach pupils to take responsibility for a task suited to their individual capabilities were an important part of character building which the school is responsible to provide\u201d (Skol\u00f6verstyrelsen, 1980 p 50). It even pointed out that homework should be used to give pupils the opportunity for revision and practice, important methods of learning that serve to secure knowledge intake of knowledge and the learning of skills. (Skol\u00f6verstyrelsen as cited by [3], 2007) [3] The type of homework assigned is critical. Homework in itself as a tool or an institution cannot be held responsible for the failure of teachers or \u2018the system\u2019 to assign meaningful and useful homework. Subject influences effectiveness of Homework Homework can be assigned in several ways. Research has shown that the most effective way is to assign homework daily. In the USA, more research has been carried out than in other countries. In his book, The Battle over Homework (2001), Harris Cooper summarizes 120 studies on homework. \u2026.Studies carried out on older children [high school] show that homework has a greater effect on their ability to learn but that ability varies depending on the subject. For example, in math, the difference in performance between those who had done their homework and those who had not, was very little, while greater differences could be seen in subjects in the areas of social science and language. The latter areas are areas that demand more factual and repetitive learning on the part of the pupil. [3] Students whose parents have achieved a higher level of educational success do more homework than students with parents of less educational accomplishment. This is representative of the value of homework, those who have attained greater education require greater time spent doing homework from their offspring, an obvious endorsement of the institution. On an average day, 39 percent of high school students whose parent(s) had less than a bachelor\u2019s degree did homework, compared with 52 percent of those with a parent who had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. In addition to being more likely to do homework on an average day, high school students whose parent(s) had higher educational attainment spent more time, on average, doing homework. Twenty-four percent of students with a parent holding a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher spent 2 or more hours doing homework, compared with 13 percent of those whose parent(s) held less than a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Allard, Monthly Labor Review, 2008) [2] Homework: memory/motivation Homework is an integral part of the process of committing learned lessons to memory. ...homework assignments [review] what has been done in the classroom ...it is beneficial to associate what is being learned to what is already known.[when] based on things that people have already mastered, it is easier to store knowledge in one\u2019s memory. ...assignments which are not too difficult provide better motivation and pupils feel motivated if they can manage an assignment and the risk of failure is small. [3] Conclusion A 9-5 school day will harm students by decreasing time to participate in extra-curricular activities (sports, clubs, jobs, volunteer/community work, decompression, educational leisure) that are key to students\u2019 development. Homework is an integral part of the educational process and offers a number of benefits to Students, Teachers, and Parents/Families. The decrease and or elimination of Homework coupled with the lengthening of the school day does not provide sufficient added benefit to students or to society to justify making a change to the current school day and education model (it in fact would be harmful to students\u2019 education).

            "premise": "Hello Debate.Org. I am here to convince you that homework shouldn't be banned and why it is beneficial for you. I will speak about two points,my first point being that homework builds a sense of responsibility and commitment towards schoolwork and my second point being that homework builds on skills that are learnt in class. My first point is that homework builds a sense of responsibility and commitment towards schoolwork. Everyone will have to face the fact that one day they would have to get a job, most jobs require the skill of responsibility and organisation. This is achieved by homework. Studies have proven that homework does improve the stability of a student in school. A study has (where is the study from reference) compared the achievement of 20 students who have homework and who do not in 1962 (try and find a newer stat, they can rebut and say that it is too old). The results were outstanding, 14 students showed a benefit in doing homework, meanwhile 6 felt no benefit at all. I myself am very busy, having out of school activities and other assigned tasks from other classes. \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\" this is quoted by Nelson Mandela. He is telling us that we can do anything we want, we can go anywhere we want to be if we are given the right education. Homework brings up the skill of participation, this increases each student\"s individual involvement in applying specific skills and knowledge while enjoying learning. This brings me to my second point, homework builds on skills that are learnt in class. Only the talented will pick up tricky maths and confusing science equations in one lesson, having homework improves your skill of the subject. Have you ever heard of the saying \"practice makes perfect\" this falls into play with homework. Homework gives each student an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of skills taught in class; to increase speed, mastery and maintenance of skills. According to an article published in the Journal of Educational Psychology, homework gives you positive affects such as advancing your knowledge of the subject and opening your mind up to learn and create. Harris Cooper, an educational psychologist, performed a \"meta-analysis\" which is a statistical technique for combining numerous studies into the equivalent of one giant study. Cooper performed a meta-analysis on numerous homework studies. About 70% of these found that homework was associated with higher achievements in learning. Henceforth homework broadens knowledge and builds on skills that are learnt in class.",

            "premise": "1) Homework helps kids exercise the skills they need to pass, and accelerate in education. According to the \"National Education Association\"(NEA), Individualized assignments that tap into students' existing skills or interests can be motivating. It states that kids at an elementary school level, can help develop study skills and habits that the child will need later on, as he/she passes onto secondary education. They also state that homework is associated with greater academic achievement, such as kids getting A's on tests and some making it into higher education statues such as the \"honor roll\". In an article published by Doug Gavel from Harvard University, he states in his report that \"The assignment of homework, over time, serves to foster the kinds of qualities that are critical to learning -- persistence, diligence, and the ability to delay gratification,\" she continued. \"These [skills] become increasingly necessary as students graduate to higher levels of scholarship in middle school, high school, and beyond.\" Sitting in a room and simply listening and participating in class activities, sometimes isn't enough. If you want to master the skills and exceed in certain subjects, it takes personal time, and effort at home. School isn't the only place on the Earth where people learn new things. Just like learning a new instrument, you can't become a professional just by going to lessons. You need to take what you've learned, and improve on them at home, or somewhere else that doesn't have the influence of a teacher or guardian. You must take the wheel into your own hands, and drive your own path of knowledge using your own mind and body. For this reason, I urge a pro ballot. It's not beneficial to a students future, if their test scores are dropping due to homework, but knowledge is more important than test scores. Even though test scores are impotant, especially if you want to be accepted into a college. They do not always show the true amount of knowledge a being can have. They are simply numbers, that people use to judge you with, without even knowing much about you. http://www.news.harvard.edu... http://www.nea.org...",

            "premise": "Good Argument. I believe we should not have homework. Their are many reasons for and against this topic. I believe that children need to have time to be children. They can go to school and learn but they should have a break once in a while. However, students have homework piled onto them so much they work late into the night trying to finish it so they can keep their grade up. The dont get much sleep because their mind is racing , thinking about homework they maybe didnt get a chance to finish that they have to do in the morning or because they are just too stressed both at school and at home. If a child cannot learn what needs to be learned in a six hour day, we are expecting too much of a child. We are creating a jam-packed hurried day without a chance to play, reflect and interact. Adding hours to an already busy day is absurd. Older Children Are Even More Busy: So if younger students need a chance to play, the reality is that many older students are busy with extracurricular activities. Duke University\"s study (by Harris Cooper) concluded that homework does not increase achievement and it often decreases it instead. I spent some time looking at the \"studies\" regarding homework and they all point to a correlation rather than a causal relationship between homework and achievement. The bottom line is that the research is sketchy at best. Homework doesn\"t teach good study habits. It teaches kids to study, because they have to rather than need to. Similarly, homework doesn\"t help children become hard workers, because the work is not self-directed. Want to watch a child work hard and take ownership of learning? Watch a child build a bridge for fun. Let a child read a book for fun (without the bribery of fried dough) and see just how hard a kid will work when there is a meaningful goal. Hard work is a product of motivation. It is an internal drive. When we a parent steps in an makes a child work hard, the work ethic diminishes. In conclusion, I believe that students should not have homework because it isnt beneficial and it stresses students out tremendously. :)",

Consider the scenario that not many children at a school buy their lunch at school. This means that because not many of them do it, it is pointless and the school should stop putting out effort to feed these kids. That doesn't sound very good does it? *No*Also, \"Homework also makes the student bored and makes them not want to achieve in school due to the lack of free time because of homework.\" Well, saying that homework bores students is a complete assumption. What if their homework is to go to a park and collect different leaves from trees? What if their homework is building a diorama of a Volcano? Those sound fun to me! My point is that you cannot make the assumption that:a. Some homework is boring.b. All homework consists of some homeworkc. Therefore all homework is boring \"Also why after 6 hours of working should they have to endure another hour of two?\"They endure another two hours of homework in order to understand everything that they have learned. It would be pointless to go to school for six hours and just keep learning and never go over what you learn.\"Though recent studies may show the fact that students gain from homework it is stressful enough for them to have to go to school study and do exams in the first place why add more stress on their back?\"Well, if studies have proven that students gain from homework, exams are just a test of knowledge to make sure they understand how they are doing their work. Stress is a state of mind that you put yourself into. It is easily avoidable in the sense that you really shouldn't stress about just another test. All exams are just big tests, stress is easily avoidable. If you cannot control your stress you should work on it, or talk to someone and try to get help.\"Recent studies also show that many students drop out of school due to homework and result to home schooling and other means of education.\" Okay? If these students cannot handle their homework, they should get tutoring, or spend less time socializing until they have a chance to actually finish their homework. \"Homework also strains the parent/child relationship due to them arguing over it, whether it the time place or how to actually do it.\"Homework doesn't strain any relationships, the members do. Either the parents are over-baring, or the student is irresponsible. Thank you!",

            "premise": "School without homework is not an image I can fathom. There are many reasons homework should not be abolished as it is beneficial towards the student, allows the teacher to acknowledge the student's weaknesses; in turn giving them an opportunity to improve and acquire new skills. Also, taking time each night to do homework is a chance for students to catch up on missed class and further reinforces the day's lessons so it is permanently etched in the student's mind where the information is stored and used when called upon. Several studies have proven that homework, in fact, does improve the stability of the student in school; this strengthens the statement that time spent completing homework is time well spent. Rather than giving students another hour of leisure time, doing homework entitles the student to an hour of enriched education; this can greatly benefit the student, as consistently finishing homework will reap great rewards such as a favourable test score or report card. Why are we posing such a ludicrous question about the possible abolishment of homework if doing homework is what it takes to succeed in school? It is a common emotion to students regarding the distaste of homework, but legions of teachers know better because they recognize the importance of homework in the success of students in school and outside of school. Not only does homework accomplishment benefit the student, it also benefits the teacher as well. Teachers receive the opportunity to see at what stage the student is by assigning homework. Furthermore, the teacher can identify the weaknesses of the student so they can ameliorate their study habits in hopes of pulling their grades up. On the other hand, if teachers were to abandon the idea of homework altogether, they would have to base the majority of the student's mark on tests alone. However, students fare much better in the homework column than the test column; otherwise, their marks would be lower Conclusively,that is the reason it should not be banned",

            "premise": "Right, before I begin my arguments, I shall do a short rebuttal of my worthy opponent's arguments. I said in my previous arguments, that homework in moderate or small amounts is beneficial. I have stressed that throughout my arguments. And then my opponent went on to say that homework can be too much, and too stressful. That the child won't have any time to do homework. Well, I will elaborate this in my rebuttal, however, I said in moderate amounts. In moderate amounts, 1 small assignment a night due in two days can't be too stressful, can it?Now onto my argument. Homework enables the day to be shorter. My opponent claims that the day is too busy for the child. However, the day would be even longer without homework. Homework enables teachers to get through work that there isn't time for in class, and to finish off class work from that day. Without homework, school days would be much longer. What proof of that is there? you might say. However, one does not need proof. Logic serves the mind just as well.If my opponent's claims that \"there is too much homework\", just pause to think about what would happen if that homework is eliminated. How much work is done at home as homework? How many assignments, and school work is done at home? How much studying at home? Well, imagine if homework is taken away. Then how many hours would be added on the set school day? If we aren't going to be finishing schoolwork in class, and teachers can't set is at homework, we would need longer lessons. And what about those major assessments, or in high school, that huge coursework? A teacher can't set that as homework, since we're abolishing it, so it must be done in class. And classes are already full of work already, where would one find the time to do it? The answer, the school days must be elongated. So that student's \"already busy day\" would be even longer. Of course, you may say students will just do the work at home on their own. And they can do it on their own. But let's be honest with ourselves, how many of us actually do that? How many of us would finish of the work we did in class at home, if it wasn't set? The sad answer, not very many of us. We can't find the motivation, or work up the trouble to do it, if it wasn't mandatory or required. After all, many students just can't be bothered half the time, me included.So, if homework is abolished, school days would be much longer, and who would want that? No one.",

            "premise": "Since my opponent has mostly dropped their position, and it's with a logical position: for some students, homework is good and others it is not. There is good logic in that. My opponent did ask about how students view homework, and this is what I found through a quick search: 65% of students view homework as a waste of time, 50% view homework as being overly challenging or simply too difficult, and 29% of the students believed homework was interesting[5]Now, this may not be able to tell us too much, because this is based on how homework currently is. These numbers would likely change if homework was made in such a way where the students got to have a say over what was involved in the homework. I think teachers should just have a overall guideline on what students need to know, and then the students could then create their own homework that teaches them this topic. This would likely increase the amount of students who would find homework interesting(as it's low) since they would get to have a say in what the assignment is. Thus, to reiterate some things, homework shouldn't be completely elliminated, but it should have input from the students so that the students get to do what they believe is most beneficial for them. We don't all learn things the same way, and that would be most beneficial in my opinion, Maybe some students would choose to go without homework, and I think that is fine.Sources:[5]http://ro.ecu.edu.au...",

            "premise": "My point of contention is that homework can be very beneficial given the right balance between the amount of homework and time available for students to complete it. I'm not sure how exactly to respond to your point about children having to do too much of it, as I don't know the country that you're based in or and I also don't know how you define a substantial amount of homework. These are the reasons why I think that it is beneficial and is not a waste of time if the above criteria is met: 1. It allows for the development of time management skills within students, since they have to manage their homework with the time constraints given. The source cited states that homework is important in the process of self regulation and control. [1] 2. Homework forces students to apply the knowledge that they learned in the classroom, which is especially important for development of intellect, as being able to apply knowledge of a given topic is what allows you to utilize it within your everyday life. While you may not be able to directly apply trigonometry into your life, the type of thought processes that mathematics hinges on can give students a better ability apply study skills in their everyday lives. [2] 3. Homework reinforces education, which while may not be directly applicable, it is crucially important for survival in an increasingly modern economic marketplace. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data that shows that the unemployment rate increases 3.25 times when comparing people over 25 with a doctoral degree and those who only have a high school diploma (1.6% to 5.2%). It also shows that the difference between these two groups when it comes to full time weekly earnings is that those with a high school diploma earn 2.41 times less than those with a doctoral degree. [3] 4. There is also a link between the amount of education one has and their estimated IQ. While IQ may not be the end-all-be-all determiner of intelligence, it gives us a good idea of one's general intellectual capabilities. On page 63 of Coming Apart, Charles Murray displays a graph that shows that the difference between those who don't have a degree and those with a high school diploma is 11 and 12 (82-89, 05-09), and the difference between those with a diploma and a PHD or its equivalents are 27 and 25 respectively, this shows that there are relatively significant differences in IQ between people who have radically different amounts of education.

            "conclusion": "should Students be given homework during the weekends",
            "premise": "Since this debate is coming to a closing and we\"re at round four, I though I should introduce new evidence to my case. As I've been researching why we should have homework on the weekends, I realized mainly that we should have it because it provides extra brain training over your two-day break so that you will remember what you\"ve learned during to week. To begin here is a list of ten benefits from homework in general. 1.It improves your thinking and memory 2.It helps you develop positive study skills and habits that will serve you well throughout life 3.Homework encourages you to use time wisely 4.It teaches you to work independently 5.Homework teaches you to take responsibility for your work 6.It allows you to review and practice what has been covered in class 7.Homework helps you learn to use resources, such as libraries, reference materials, and computer Web sites to find information 8.It encourages you to explores subjects more fully than classroom time permits 9.It allows you to extend learning by applying skills to new situations 10.It helps you integrate learning by applying many different skills to a single task, such as book reports or science projects (Brought to you by http://blog.eskool.ca...) I would like to thank the people at http://blog.eskool.ca.... That list states an excellent set of benefits from doing homework. Overall it\"s saying that homework prepares you through difficulties in life. With the skills and good habits you obtain from homework it becomes easier to overcome your problems. \"In a study conducted by Hill, Spencer, Alston and Fitzgerald (1986), homework was positively linked to student achievement. They indicate that homework is an inexpensive method of improving student academic preparation without increasing staff or modifying curriculum. \"So, as the pressure to improve test scores continues to increase, so does the emphasis on homework\"\" (Brought to you by http://www.studentpulse.com...) There is the evidence folks, and like I said before it helps people overcome their problems and to achieve goals such as higher test score (also known as growth in education) to help society function correctly, and with a wise mind. If you don\"t believe me about this test here is another test conducted carried out by the researchers at Duke University. \" DURHAM, N.C. - It turns out that parents are right to nag: To succeed in school, kids should do their homework. Duke University researchers have reviewed more than 60 research studies on homework between 1987 and 2003 and concluded that homework does have a positive effect on student achievement. Harris Cooper, a professor of psychology and director of Duke's Program in Education, said the research synthesis that he led showed the positive correlation was much stronger for secondary students --- those in grades 7 through 12 --- than those in elementary school. \"With only rare exception, the relationship between the amount of homework students do and their achievement outcomes was found to be positive and statistically significant,\" the researchers report in a paper that appears in the spring 2006 edition of \"Review of Educational Research.\"\" Cooper is the lead author; Jorgianne Civey Robinson, a Ph.D. student in psychology, and Erika Patall, a graduate student in psychology, are co-authors. (Brought to you by http://today.duke.edu...) Once again readers, there is the evidence that homework is beneficial. Therefore, there is no reason for it not to be beneficial on weekends. Ultimately, homework given to students on the weekend is beneficial. If I still do not have you on board with my side I suggest reading this extra evidence. Homework set prior to a lesson can aid understanding later in class. Homework also provides opportunities for reinforcement of work learned during school time and for children to develop their research skills. Children will need to seek information for themselves from reference materials such as encyclopaedias, books, CD ROMs and by doing so, are helped along the path to becoming independent learners. Having the responsibility of needing to meet deadlines promotes self-discipline, an attribute that will impact on schoolwork and beyond. (Brought to you by http://www.topmarks.co.uk...) Thank you everyone for staying tuned in on my side of the case for: whether or not students should have homework over the weekends. Yes they should. Hey, I appreciate everything you guys and hope to for the final round of this debate to wrap up my argument with an overall conclusion of my case and how this, being my first debate, has been. Once again thank you.",

Secondly, besides homework do you really think all teenagers do is go on Facebook, get into trouble, and surf the web? I think B.S. 1 in 3 teens actually have a job, and 1 in 2 teens have a source of income through labor. Funny isn't it? Don't you think that teens could go out and make some money, and do something productive? Thirdly, this idea that homework gets kids outside is also complete B.S. Homework does not get kids outside at all. For me, homework is really something that traps me inside. The average teen who does their homework does almost 70 minutes of it! Thats a good way to keep yourself locked up. Next, since so far all of your arguments are invalid, I will continue to point out that homework is not beneficial, as I said before (and you have not yet argued against) Here is a really good article that pretty much sums up everything: Add up all the time you spent doing homework. What would you say: a million billion hours? Roughly a trillion bazillion hours doing homework, over the course of your life? Well, as it turns out, it was a complete waste of your time: Research reveals primary school homework offers no real benefit - and only limited results in junior high school. Only senior students in Years 11 and 12 benefit from after-school work, associate professor Richard Walker said. \"What the research shows is that, in countries where they spend more time on homework, the achievement results are lower,\" Dr Walker, from Sydney University's Education Faculty, said. Okay, but, why does so much homework get assigned? \"At the moment homework (is often) an add-on because parents want it,\" says Dr. Walker. Haha. Here is the source: http://gawker.com...",

It helps the student to recapitulate the lessons done at school so that they don't lag behind. It also teaches them the art of planning and organizing their studies one after another to get good grades. Homework also helps the teacher to asses the ability of the student and she can help the student to improve his or her weaknesses. But most importantly it makes the students study and helps them to realize that even if they don not like to do the homework sometimes they have to do things in life they do not want to. So the pressure which is created is actually good because it helps them to face reality and also their life Thank you",

            "conclusion": "Students should never have homework on weekends.",
            "premise": "I will be arguing that it would be more likely beneficial for the students and the educators if homework was given out on the weekend. My argument is not stating that there is a direct causation of success and homework as that is currently still being debated [1]. However I am stating that homework in general is more likely a beneficial component in education rather than harmful. A. Homework is an important instructional tool. 1. Purpose of homework. There are two types of homework, instructional and noninstructional. In the case of instructional it is: preparation, practice, extension, and integration [1]. The purpose of instructional homework is to further improve on skills, knowledge that was or will be covered, and allow students to utilize their multiple skills to complete a complex project. Noninstructional homework is used to develop social interactions and behavioral skills. 2. Homework is correlated to be a benefiting factor with more positive effects. Extensive studies by Harris M. Cooper continually show a correlation between students who complete homework versus students that do not, especially on test covering direct material on assignments. His research simply states that, despite constant argumentation to dispute any correlation, homework does more good than harm [2]. In general, based on various studies, the effects of homework have shown a gain of 20-30 percentiles [3]. Even though, some may debate the benefits that come from homework, we cannot ignore that it is a potentially crucial and helpful factor in education. It would be like a team of athletes that are expected to perform better than other teams but never have practice after learning a new technique/play. 3. Alternative method that allows practice of skills and teacher evaluation of retention is lacking. Simply put there is currently no other well known method for encouraging students to study material outside of the classroom, as well as encourage self-involvement with learning. Furthermore, a new method would have to allow teachers to track the progress of the students and be effective in flourishing their knowledge. I will further discuss this later. B. Main Reasons that students, and some teachers do not like homework. 1. Time Management is an important factor. On the student side many arguments can be boiled down to homework is limiting to other leisure activities and family bonding that could be reserved for weekends [4]. However, in this article, they give testimony to a child that \u201ccan\u2019t usually start [her] hours of homework until 8:30 PM,\u201d meaning that homework is already limiting within the weekday; thus, reserving homework on the weekdays would only cause more stress to the child that has to finish everything during their most busiest of days. Another argument that was given was that the children do not sleep as well during the weekends, which should be a time for resting. However according to a study by Mary Allard, male and female students spend, on average, 5.7 and 4.5 hours a day on leisure activities after school respectively [5]. In addition, the students slept 2-3 hours more on the weekends than on the weekdays, despite jobs, homework, and other social activities. It is odd that even though given homework, children are still finding more ways to rest and be social during their time off of school. On the other side of the argument, some teachers argue about the amount of time spent grading [6]. While some teachers argue that they hate grading, and others say that it is important practice work, they clearly voice that the spend too much time on the homework given back, which causes them to judge student behavior or completion rather than correct methodology of work. On average, teachers spend around 782 hours per school year teaching (in classroom) which means that on average of 180, 6-8 hour, school days, the teacher are teaching for approximately 4.34 hours [7,8]. That is assuming however, that teachers are not distracted, victim\u2019s of Murphy\u2019s Law, or working with one student in particular that really needs help [9]. That is not a lot of time to work with students in-class, as well as grade, if a teacher is not properly oriented, thus they will get backed up on teaching and homework can help keep students if given after school or on the weekend. 2. Students get burned out Some teachers have stated that homework is \u201ctime consuming, dreary, and uninspiring,\u201d to the point that children will become less motivated and apathetic toward learning [10]. In so doing, some teachers have done the extreme and do not issue any \u201chomework\u201d for their students. This was done mainly by well time management of the class and the effectiveness of the teaching. However, it is important to note that: a. While teachers claimed benefits of not doing homework, the have no definitive causation that students did better in the same regards as they criticise students that have homework. b. There is more than one type of homework, as stated above, and an assignment that is meant to help children practice a skill is what practice homework enriches at home. Also, children were able to finish \u201chomework\u201d in school just as much as outside of school. Thus all the teachers are doing is allotting more class time to homework, assuming the children are retaining information or completing their work. c. Homework is more than just practice, as stated above, it is important social tool. Otherwise you are limiting a student from learning how to study intensely on their own in higher learning, thus they will also be less likely successful without proper time management skills when they start their careers [11, 12].

            "premise": "Homework encourages students to work and be more independently, as they will have to at college and in their jobs. Everyone needs to develop responsibility and skills in personal organization, deadlines, being able to research, etc. If students are always \"spoon-fed\" topics at school they will never develop study skills and self-discipline for the future. A gradual increase in homework responsibilities over the years allows these skills to develop. Homework is a way for you to practice what you are learning. If you didn't have homework, you would have to stay in school until you finished your practice, and since everyone works at different rates, you'd be there until the slowest people finally caught on. Also the best way to learn something is to recall it over and over again. If you learn something in class, and then do homework at home, you'll have a better chance of actually getting the knowledge. Homework serves a valuable purpose in education. Not only does it allow students to practice what was taught in class, thereby solidifying concepts, but most importantly it teaches responsibility. Best given as a few target exercises rather than pages and pages of mindless drill, homework is a way of teaching students responsibility when the teacher is not there to \"make them learn\".People learn by doing. No matter how many times you read about something or have something explained to you until you practice the skill on your own you do not truly possess that skill. A skill, which learning any subject is, is attained in the following way: Watch someone else do it Have someone else help you do it Do it yourself Until you master the last you do not have the skill. That is where the homework part comes in homework encourages students to undertake independent learning which they will be required to do when they get to University. Many people argue that schools spoon-feed their students, which makes them completely unprepared for what awaits them at higher education when all research and further reading must be done on the student\"s own time. By setting homework in the form of projects, students will be able to learn on their own and develop skills that will serve them well in later life. It also helps to teach the students responsibility and time management skills, seeing as the teacher is not there to make them learn. Also, a lot of students prefer to learn on their own and teach themselves, rather than having a teacher lecture them. Homework encourages children to do this and may also help them to revise it more thoroughly. Whatever students have learnt in the classroom can then be reinforced and solidified by completing homework tasks. Homework can also be beneficial for the teacher as when they collect homework in to mark it, it gives them a good idea of how much their students understand what is being taught. It gives kids responsibilities and discipline it also keeps them out of trouble as well as giving parents alone time it helps kids practice what they learnt in class lets just it lets teachers to have more time to explain the topic and not worrying about the work that should be done in class because it can be done for homework. Homework plays an important role in a student's education. It fosters independent learning, it develops one's study habits and it reinforces learning. How can students complain about not having not enough recreation time? A student could create some time within 24 hours for their recreation or relaxing. Homework can also be proof that a student is up to date with their curriculum. It helps memorise information and other work. If a student attends class and then goes home free of homework, what he previously learned in class that day could have been forgotten, so homework will then bring that knowledge keep it memorised.",

I was running out of time.So for this round, I am simply explaining how no matter how much homeowork you have, you may still have stress. Basically, stress applies to a spicific person, depending on how they experiance things. For example, a lot of homework may be normal to someone, but someone else could be stressed. So in the end, no matter how much homework you have, 1 person may see it as stressfull, even if it is just 1 page of homework. Lowering the amount of homework would not effect children when it comes to stress. But keeping the amount of homework already given would improve their learning, help with understanding concepts, and teach lessons for their everyday lives. Having less homework would diminish the amount of extra lessons their learn. In conclusion, homework is already at a good amount. Some people see the amount of stress put into to it differently, so lowering the amount would not apply to all students. So there is no point of lowering homework, considering there would be no benefit from doing such.",

            "premise": "My thanks to Bull Diesel for his response. Before I begin rebuttals and my arguments I\u2019d just like to remind readers of arguments that I presented in R2 that haven\u2019t been countered. These points were cost, reduction in general mischief and my working mindset / lack of agrarian workforce points. Granted, the rules themselves disallowed direct rebuttal (!), but it\u2019s important to note these extensions \u2013 they are all important points. Con had best rebut them this round lest they be considered dropped by myself and readers. This leaves my other points \u2013 memory retention and homework vs. instruction somewhat up for discussion, as well as my opponent\u2019s arguments which centre on the length of the school day, the components of homework and memory / motivation. Let\u2019s go to the arguments \u2013 Con\u2019s then a focus on mine. School day length Con\u2019s first point is that increasing the school day will put pressure on the time available for extracurricular activities. His second point is that reductions in homework have negative consequences. His choice of my poison makes no sense \u2013 either there\u2019s more time allocated to homework (this is incorporated into the extra school hours) under my model and pressure is put on extracurricular activities or there\u2019s less time spent on homework despite these hours and there\u2019s more time for extracurricular activities. He can\u2019t run both points simultaneously. If the net amount of homework is the same then these points both don\u2019t apply and things stay the same. That is... aside from all the other benefits of the scheme, particularly memory retention, which we\u2019ll touch on later. Also, there\u2019s actually extra time for extracurricular activities given no change in the time spent on homework, should the student organise their day appropriately. What am I talking about? Under the current model lunch, recess and all other breaks occur at set times \u2013 they are immovable to the student; it is bad luck if you\u2019d like to sacrifice a break at school for an equivalent amount of time outside school \u2013 you can\u2019t. Under my model, as readers may recall, you can. Recall in R1 how we had 80 minutes of break built into the day, and how 40 was automatically set aside for lunch. That left 40 minutes which students could elect to have at the start or the end of the day. If they chose the day\u2019s end then they could leave school at the start of that break. So, in terms of time which students can utilise freely (hint: free time) , my model provides 20 minutes extra for extracurricular activities notwithstanding any changes in the amount of homework. Of course, if Con argues for a change in homework amount (the extra time ought to cancel out the reduction) then he gets to drink the associated poison. The value of homework Con painstakingly lays out the case for homework and it\u2019s benefits. It\u2019s a formidable case. What\u2019s the issue with it? The case applies very strongly for work done at school as well! Indeed, many points for homework are made stronger when it is done at school. Let\u2019s take a look. On Con\u2019s list of 7 points: On preparation, school also prepares students. On scheduling, school more formally schedules a student\u2019s time than they do at home \u2013 there\u2019s less drifting and procrastination. On control and assessment, it is far easier to assess students and control them when they are there under a teacher\u2019s eye than at home! On love and care, homework can promote this, but it can harm as well \u2013 parents get frustrated at the school for impinging on their free time. From his 3rd article: \u201cIn the worst cases, children who fare less well in tests based on homework, get more homework to do. Peter Frost concludes that many children suffer from the effects of homework: it causes much conflict in the home\u201d . See above for why my model grants more free time for family time. Identity and status: Con says homework promotes a subject\u2019s importance; so does more lessons and homework done in school. On community, homework may promote contact between teacher and parent, but work at school promotes teacher-student bonds. It\u2019s a null impact. On work performance, children may carry out other tasks they deem more important than homework in the additional free time they have. Con then discusses how homework ought to be given out and how students whose parents have greater educational success do more homework. It\u2019s a good educational lesson, but Con doesn\u2019t specify how it makes homework done at home better. Then homework is given out at the same intervals, and it\u2019s done in a spaced manner (spaced presentation is better than massed presentation) . As to educationally minded parents encouraging the completion of homework being beneficial, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Parents without the right mindset can affect their children\u2019s future. That\u2019s why we need trained professionals in the field of education \u2013 teachers \u2013 to instill this mindset. Teachers also have more time, and incentive (they are getting paid) to do this as opposed to parents. Hence, my model actually encourages children from worse backgrounds to do more of their homework (and get the benefits) as per Con\u2019s logic. Memory retention and homework Con is 100% right to say that homework reviews what is done in the classroom and that this review is beneficial. I couldn\u2019t agree more, but again, Con\u2019s points don\u2019t argue for his model. They\u2019re applicable to both. Now, as to when and where this review is done in, as well as the emotional state of mind, that\u2019s a completely different thing \u2013 there are differences between home and school. In R2 I outlined how spaced presentation was superior to massed presentation for memory retention purposes, and how school promoted spaced presentation by virtue of the lessons being spaced out on the timetable. Indeed, school forces spaced presentation vs. the massed presentation of the home. This point was completely ignored by Con (he couldn\u2019t rebut last round though) and is critical to my case. But it doesn\u2019t end there for memory retention. I recently read Memory by Jonathan K. Foster (first published 2009), one of OUP\u2019s fascination very short introductions. To quote one part: \u201cOther things being equal, we tend to remember information better if we are in a similar physical context and emotional state at the time we wish to retrieve information as we were in at the time we were exposed to that information.\u201d School is more akin to work than the home environment, so as per a more similar physical context we remember better. This is specified in the encoding specificity principle. Also, the emotional state at school is more constant than at home, more like work. This again promotes better memory retention as the retrieval cue matches memories better. This sort of logic strongly explains why we can\u2019t remember dreams \u2013 the physical context is different, our emotional state different and our physiological state are also different. To recap, homework done at school is done in a manner of spaced presentation. This is superior for memory retention. Furthermore, recall is strengthened by a similar emotional state and physical context, which happens when learning is conducted more strongly in a given place, such as school. Memory is strengthened tremendously by shifting homework to school time. Homework vs. Instruction This wasn\u2019t considered \u2018not attacked\u2019 , but it was close to that. As said in R2, teachers can assist if homework is moved into school time. At home a student may waste time aimlessly, not learn the content as well, or worse cheat or copy answers if they can. Teacher supervision prevents cheating, assists in learning content and reduces time wasted. Professional instruction is beneficial for students vs. self learning in many cases. Conclusion Con must refute the points of this round + those of mine unscathed of mine by his R2 (in part as per the rules). Con has much work to do.",

Besides, even if it did, I think students would be bored if they had to do IQ tests every single day. It is not related to what they are learning at school and doesn't help them to understand they lessons.Quite the opposite, homework do. Homework make students think and in that way, it gives them better chances to understand classroom learning, to reinforce it. They are able to doing it by themselves which is a chance for them if they get a constructive return on their work. It also improves their brain's abilities as they are thinking about how they could solve a problem, or looking for ideas which develop their creativites, or also learning concepts which is good for their memory and to gain in working methods, while IQ tests are just something they would be getting tired of and they wouldn't do it seriously.",

No matter how much it is or how long it takes, I believe that if it is found to be beneficial for the education of children, then it is justified. Technology and the need for skilled workers continue to rise while the need for unskilled labor falls in comparison. This means that children - i.e. future adults - need a better education than older generations. You say that it has \"been found that little is learned from homework\". Well, the basics of homework is to allow students a chance to learn via repetition the skills they need, so they will remember them later when they need them. Also, even if the gain from homework is minimal as you claim, I believe that it is still important to allow these children to get this gain. In the worst case scenario, they are spending their time doing homework that still help them a little. In the best case scenario, they are memorizing valuable skills that they will use later.

I am still going to continue with my argument. Homework prevents the waste of time and gives students something beneficial to do with their time. Students waste a lot of time on social media, on the Internet, playing video games, etc. It is okay to use those things in with limitations when you are taking a break from something and trying to lower stress by doing something you love but mindlessly wasting their time and using these things to an over-extent is not something they should be doing. Studies show that students who have homework and do it get better test grades and overall grades in school than ones who do not have any homework. In my closing statement I would like to say that having and doing homework, but not too much of it, is beneficial in learning from a student and teaches them life skills they will use in the real world as well as giving them something useful to do instead of wasting their time.

            "premise": "\"Well Kids need homework to practice the skills they learnt and can be used as a study guide\" Although this is true, homework can also put a lot of stress on the students and as I said before it limits their free time and can cause sleep loss. If a student stays up all night doing homework doesn't it become hard for them to stay attentive in class the next day? Homework as I said before is not necessarily a bad thing. Yes it can be used as a guide for revision but it can also be a bucket of stress waiting to explode. The more stress put on students can limit their learning and ability to function during class. So in conclusion, homework can be useful and beneficial but it also has a lot of downsides to it which include stress,mental exhaustion,being tired,sleep loss and limits free time and social interactions just to name a few. Homework adds more pressure to already pressured students and adds load to their already stressful school career. It's been nice debating with you. Thank you for accepting this challenge and have a nice day/night.",

            "discussionTitle": "We Shouldn't have homework!",
            "conclusion": "We Shouldn't have homework!",
            "premise": "I thank Pro for sponsoring this debate and also for providing succinct arguments. First, there are three arguments for why homework is excellent and ought to continue in modern schools. 1. Homework aids doer-learners. It is generally accepted that there are three types of learners: those who learn by hearing, those who learn by seeing, and those who learn by doing. While many are content to hear or see instruction of a given subject, some need to actually do it. Thus, homework is beneficial for this latter group because the instruction is learn through action. 2. Homework reinforces instruction. Although many would probably be thrilled to not have homework, the quality of the education received would certainly suffer if it was removed. Whether the homework is assigned reading, term papers, etc., all of it is designed to reinforce the instruction in the students' minds. After all, those who do their homework are more academically successful than those who do not. I feel that this is a self-evident truth, but I'll leave it Pro to dissuade you. 3. Homework mirrors real-life demands. After high-school, there are mainly two paths for graduates to take: college or work. For both of these paths, assignments will be allocated and the professors/bosses will except to see them completed. Now, having done homework with deadlines before, graduates are used to these demands and are thus more likely to succeed. But remove homework and students will be unfamiliar with long-term assignments, deadlines, and the like. In short, homework helps to prepare graduates for real-life demands. I will now refute Pro's arguments: 1. \"Checking [homework] takes valuable class time.\" No, this is absolutely false. Instructors generally do not grade homework in class because it is a time for teaching, not evaluation. Instructors usually grade in their offices or homes and are paid (by salary) to do so. Class time is seldom, if ever, affected by grading homework. Pro's argument is ridiculous. 2. \"Kids cannot handle so much schoolwork with such a little attention span.\" Well, this is half-true. Kids do tend to have smaller attention spans compared to adults, but I would answer that the homework is tailored to their ability to perform. Here's what I mean: if a teacher knows that X student can only focus for Y time before pooping on the floor, then said teacher (assuming he/she is smart) will not assign more than X student can handle. Since I have family members who teach middle school, I can testify firsthand that the workload is intended to be manageable. What if it's not? Well, ideally, the kids and their parents complain and either the instructor or principal corrects the problem. Yes, some may refuse to reduce the workload, but that is rare and not a acceptable reason to abolish all homework everywhere. Homework is good, even if it's occasionally abused. 3. \"[Homework] takes away from family time.\" I find this argument ironic. How long is an average school day? About 6-8 hours. How long does daily homework take to accomplish? 1-2 hours at worst. You see, homework is not the main usurper of family time! Rather, it the length of schools days that's the real culprit. If a student is diligent, there still is ample time for familial interaction. Also, I find Pro's argument to be laughable simply because students generally avoid socializing with their families. Many would rather play Minecraft, Call of Duty, etc. than sit around the table exchanging stories. So, to wrap up, I have presented three reasons for why homework is good and have attempted to disprove Pro's arguments. I stand ready for Round 2.",

            "conclusion": "This House Believes That Homework is Futile in Today's Soceity",
            "premise": "It's basically forcing students to go home after a stressful day of school and activities and do pointless homework. Teachers should be teaching these things in class, not making the students learn it themselves. It's preventing children from leading balanced lifestyles, with a healthy amount of sleep and activities to keep them fit and active. How is a student supposed to do 3 to 4 hours of homework, study for a plethora of tests and quizzes, play sports, get involved in the community, eat food with nutritional value, and get an adequate amount of sleep, all in one day? That's not possible. The amount of stress homework causes kids is ridiculous, especially when they're already under so much pressure to get into a good college and do well in school, along with making friends and staying active. Homework is not necessary. Homework is pointless because kids do enough work in school and they don't need more. When they come home they want to chill out, hang out with friends, or do something. Kids are in school for 8 hours a day doing work, other than lunch and recess. Homework is not relevant for kids. I did a survey at school at resource, and a majority of kids say that homework should be banned in school because it is stressful and they procrastinate until the last second. There is no point in homework. It takes away from spending time with family. According to the text with research 'Homework Should be Banned,' \"Schools has increased from 9 to 3 with 1 \" hour of recess and lunch to 8:40 to 3:15 with only 30 minutes of lunch and recess.\" This quote shows that too much is just too much homework. Also, another reason is that, according to research, some of the smartest countries like Finland and Japan don\"t have homework. We can be just as smart as them without homework. This shows that homework has no academic benefits for grades. As a student, I don't get home from school until 4:30 or 5:00 and I am doing homework sometimes until 8:30 almost every night. It is very stressful when you have seven classes a day and homework in every single class; it becomes very overwhelming. On top of that, I have to get up every morning at 5:30 am just to catch my buss at 6:40. Many mornings are very hard for me because of lack of sleep from the night before staying up doing homework and studying for two or three tests the next day. If they banned homework, test scores might improve because then students would have more time to study and be prepared than if we have five different subjects to do on top of studying for a test the next day. Homework should NOT be assigned in schools. It is just a waste of time and is just too much. One reason why homework should be banned is because homework is just too much. Schools have been increased so there is no point into giving homework. According to the text with research Homework Should be Banned, \"Schools has increased from 9 to 3 with 1 \" hour of recess and lunch to 8:40 to 3:15 with only 30 minutes of lunch and recess.\" This quote shows that too much is just too much. Students should not cry because of homework. School has been expanded. Have you ever wonder why lunch has been a little shorter than in 1st grade? To include to that too much homework is bad for you. As they say \"Too much of something is not good for you\". Second of all, homework just makes kids hate school even more. According to the text Homework should be eliminated, it says \"Excessive or pointless homework turns children away from the joy of learning.\" Homework is the only word kid\"s fear. This quote shows that homework should be fun; it should not be a torture. Every time in school, at the beginning of the year, you\"ll hear \"Have fun\". Students cannot have fun when homework is torturing kids. Like Jia Ming said, it is no help. Learning needs to be a positive experience learn with a smile and you can walk an extra mile. Another reason why homework should be banned is because it is evil. According to the text Homework should be Eliminated, \"When students have hours of homework, they don\"t get enough sleep, sunlight, and exercise.\" This shows that too much homework can cause be things to happen. You don\"t spend time with your family, your backpacks become really heavy, and this explains why kids are obese. Kids spend so much time doing there homework they don\"t have time to even go to sleep. These things can cause a lot of pressure and stress in high school. Also another reason is that according to research some of the smartest country like Finland and Japan don\"t have homework. We can be just as smart as or smarter than them without homework. This shows that homework have no academic achievements towards grades. This is why kids should not repeat not have homework. Finally homework is just too overwhelming. After school, you either have to do chores or go to after school activities. According to the article \"Homework Should Be Banned\", it says that \"homework should vanish because sometimes when you have homework, you have other activities to do such as music lessons, or an after school job\". Homework is just too big. When you have a lot of after school activities you end up doing it at the last second. To prove it I sometimes see many kids doing homework during breakfast hmm\"Felix...Too much homework can cause stress and give kids a bad grade instead of helping. Inundating children with hours of homework each night is detrimental, the research suggests, while an hour or two per week usually doesn't impact test scores one way or the other. However, homework only bolsters students' academic performance during their last three years of grade school. \"There is little benefit for most students until senior high school (grades 10-12),\" Walker told Life's Little Mysteries. The same basic finding holds true across the globe, including in the U.S., according to Gerald LeTendre of Pennsylvania State University. He and his colleagues have found that teachers typically give take-home assignments that are unhelpful busy work. Assigning homework \"appeared to be a remedial strategy (a consequence of not covering topics in class, exercises for students struggling, a way to supplement poor quality educational settings), and not an advancement strategy (work designed to accelerate, improve or get students to excel),\" LeTendre wrote in an email. This type of remedial homework tends to produce marginally lower test scores compared with children who are not given the work. Even the helpful, advancing kind of assignments ought to be limited; Harris Cooper, a professor of education at Duke University, has recommended that students be given no more than 10 to 15 minutes of homework per night in second grade, with an increase of no more than 10 to 15 minutes in each successive year. Most homework's neutral or negative impact on students' academic performance implies there are better ways for them to spend their after school hours than completing worksheets. So, what should they be doing? According to LeTendre, learning to play a musical instrument orparticipating in clubs and sports all seem beneficial, but there's no one answer that applies to everyone. \"These after-school activities have much more diffuse goals than single subject test scores,\" he wrote. \"When I talk to parents \" they want their kids to be well-rounded, creative, happy individuals \" not just kids who ace the tests.\" That is why Homework is Futile!",

            "discussionTitle": "Homework Should Be Banned",
            "conclusion": "Homework Should Be Banned",
            "premise": "My opponent has called the 2006 study of Duke University \"outdated\", while countering it with a study done in 2003, which is clearly older, covering data only up to 1999 [1].He then proposes a \"study\" from September 2013 [2] as a more reliable and current source. This article relies on the 2007 \"The MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, 2007: The Homework Experience\", conducted by Harris Interactive.Since my opponent introduced this, the following is NOT a new argument. I quote from that very study he entered as evidence:\"MAJOR FINDINGSMost teachers, students and parents believe in the value of homework. A majority of each of these key stakeholders thinks that doing homework is important and helps students learn more in school.[...]Three-quarters of students (77%) believe that doing homework is important or very important and seven in ten (69%) agree that doing homework helps them learn more in school. [...]School-parent relations have improved since 1987, at the same time that parent-school contact is more common. [...]A majority of parents believe that the right amount of homework is assigned. [...]Lower achieving students and high achieving students differ in their approach to doing homework, with lower achieving students spending less time on homework and less frequently doing homework at home. [...]Students who do not believe that homework is important are lower achieving and say they receive a poorer quality of education than others. [...]Teachers assign homework to meet a variety of student needs, including skills needed for their current school work, as well as skills that can be applicable to their future schooling, employment and ability to successfully navigate life in general.\"I must admit that this study is indeed an eye-opener. Unfortunately, it is clear that this study does nothing to argue for the abolition of homework: \"This chapter explores students\u2019, teaches\u2019 and parents\u2019 evaluation of homework\u2019s benefits and challenges. In addition, the perspectives of a group of education leaders are incorporated regarding perceived problems and potential steps towards improvement.\"So, what the study referenced by my opponent says is that despite all his claims to the contrary, relationships between parents and school have improved over the same time that the amount of homework has increased.A vast majority of students accepts homework and acknowledges its value.My opponent chose to keep all these findings to himself, trying to base his arguments off of fragmented data.The fact that teachers abuse homework has already been addressed by me. This clearly calls for a regulation of homework. But again, there is no logical connection between the amount of homework increasing and having to ban it. As I said before: only because something can be taken to the excess, where it becomes harmful, this thing doesn't have to be abolished, regardless of what it is. Claiming otherwise creates a false dichotomy: either to have too much of something or have nothing at all. But that leaves a big space in between disregarded.So, students do more homework today. But the study my opponent introduced shows - see above - that those students who do more of that homework also achieve better grades. So it's not a bad thing at all.The poll by Gallup my opponent offers as evidence clearly says: \"stress due to activities\" before adding \"and homework\". So this poll isn't about homework exclusively, and thus contains data on activities beyond school as a reason for stress. Based on that compilation of data, we can sadly not discern what is considered to be the reason for that stress: activities or homework?My opponent concedes that homework is a good way of assessment.He disagrees with my argument about homework being a less stressful alternative to surprise exams, but does not provide any argument against it.He admits that a wide variety of approaches to grading is existent, which means he now concedes that not all homework is a danger to the students' success.My opponent claims that there is enough opportunity in class to check every single student for mistakes and understanding, but that is clearly not the case. Class is not the proper place to address every single student's problems individually, since the teacher can only discuss the problems of one student at a time. Revised exercises allow the teacher to address each pupil individually. If the students do their exercises by themselves, which is necessary for their independence, why should the exercise be done in school, while the teacher just sits around doing nothing? It would be a waste of time. School time is for instruction, homework for practice. This way, school time is used most efficiently.\"even if it means not showing them what working is like.\"Then what is the purpose of school at all? School exists to prepare children for their professional training and working life. As seen above in the MetLife Survey.Being in school is not the same as a working life. All the students have to do is watch and listen, they bear no responsibility except for themselves. The only time of the day a student spends in a way comparable to what working adults do is during homework, as far as school goes. So my calculation still stands. It's very easy: adults are regularly dispensed from WORK for TRAINING. So there is a distinction. School time simply isn't work.\"And long term projects and reports can serve a much larger lesson than 30 math questions. They have to compile information, and make sometimes presentations. Many businessmen do similar work, scientists always have to research, people based in political matters have to do research and sell what they think. Even teachers have to use presentation skills while teaching their students.\"This is a valuable lesson, too, which is why we have these assignments in addition to homework. But again, this creates a false dichotomy: it's not like these two lessons are mutually exclusive. Why should we rob students of valuable practice that improves their performance (as shown in the MetLife Survey)?\"Failing tests can put a load of stress on a student, but 2 hours of homework adds to it.\"That makes no sense at all. Completing one's homework is very reassuring and thus reduces stress.\"practice doesn't help in keeping calm\"That makes no sense either. Practice is known to reduce exam anxiety:\"4. Exam-taking preparation Practice on sample tests in the textbook or study guide.\"[3]Freezing or running off during exams is a well-known phenomenon: \"It manifests itself physically through episodes of sweating, nausea or \u201cbutterflies\u201d in your stomach, and psychologically through confusion, mental blocks and panic attacks.\" [4]So, in summary:My arguments still stand, while my opponent has done nothing to prove that any of his concerns actually necessitates or warrants the abolition of homework.His own sources - had he read them closely - say that homework is beneficial and accepted by an overwhelming majority of students, parents and teachers alike.There is nothing to be added.I thank for this opportunity to state this case and thank our readers for following us.

            "premise": "1. Well homework, meant to be done at home, takes over the worthy time which can be better used in broadening one's mind behind books and enhancing one's physical stature. Really? Homework does this. You have 24 hours a day minus the 7 hours for school and minus 7 for sleep. That's ~10 hours you have. Homework confines our thinking and working abilities to only what is taught in school, whereas instead of homework, research work turns out to be more beneficial.So?2. When students are given home work, they are meant to revise what is taught in school. Now suppose they are not given any homework, they\u2019ll be encouraged to pay attention in class more, and this will undoubtedly increase the concentration power. I highly doubt this. Also \"revise\"? What do you mean?3. Homework makes a child dull compelling her to look only through the doors shown to her. I actually disagree. It really does the opposite, especially if it's history.4. Homework, is an improved way of spoon feeding a child, because a child is always helped at home, by parents or professional tutors. A student needs to apply and not mug up. Great people or rather scientist do not mug up things, they apply concepts and experience. This is not homework's fault. 5.Takes too much time Especially when you move to higher classes students have a lot od different classes and different homework assignments to finish. When adding all off them it takes a lot of time. Students need time for other extracurricular activities and family time. Homework could potentially be a time consuming activity for many.It is also alot pratice you might need. 6. Homework should be banned I swear most of the time i am stressed and 99% its because of homework. I dont want to be the typical teen who says \"i hate homework its so boring and im so lazy\" but its so true. And in my school they either give you little bit of homework with lots of hard parts for it or on HUGE project or assignment on top of other homework from other classes. I can not even explain how angry homework gets me. Sometimes there are group assignments and there is never a time where im not paired with the lazy people so i end up doing all the crap and i have to worry about other classes too. NO. I can not. I need a break and i hate when teachers pack the most work on weekends. But no I have to use my only two days of rest on assignments on top of other work that im mentally crying about. Do not even get me started. I legitimately cried like two hours ago becuase all the homework i have to do. And thats not a good thing. School is supposed to be \"a fun learning experience\" and \"learning and doing good and no stress\" Appeal to emotion.",

            "premise": "Ok my opponent asked me to rebuttal his argument so I will.1. My opponent said that it helps teachers check there students class standing. The teachers can do that during the day/class they can review there subject then have the students to take a brief quiz and then grade the quiz after that she can review what the majority missed.2. Gives more practice.Yes doing more problems can be good practice but the students can practice during class In elementary school you got the whole day to practice. In middle school/high school they got about an hour per class to do the work of the day then review/practice for the rest of the time. 3. Helps students develop better study habits, and more independent work.Actually no it doesn't students tend to cheat regardless.Here I am going to give my last arguments 1.Homework has little educational worth, and therefore is a waste of students' time Homework has little educational worth and adds nothing to the time spent in school. Some schools and some countries don't bother with homework at all, and their results do not seem to suffer from it. Studies show that homework adds nothing to standardised test scores for primary/ elementary pupils. As Alfie Kohn notes, no study has ever found a link between homework and better tests results in elementary school, and there is no reason to believe it is necessary in high school.1International comparisons of older students have found no positive relationship between the amount of homework set and average test scores - students in Japan and Denmark get little homework but score very well on tests.2If anything, countries with more homework get worse results! 2. Marking homework reduces the amount of time teachers have to prepare good lessons.Irrespective of homework's educational value, marking it takes up much of teachers' time. Australian teachers have complained that 'homework marking can result in four extra hours of work a day and they are rarely rewarded for their effort'.1 This leaves teachers tired and with little time to prepare effective, inspiring lessons. If the lessons aren't to the standard they should be, the point of homework is lost as the students have little to practise in the first place. The heavy workload also puts young graduates off becoming teachers, and so reduces the talent pool from which schools can recruit. 3. Homework reduces the amount of time for students to do other activities.Homework takes a lot of time up. In America, they encourage the '10 minute rule', 10 minutes homework for every grade, meaning that high-school students are all doing more than an hour's worth of homework each night.1 Being young is not just about doing school work every night. It should also about being physically active, exploring the environment through play, doing creative things like music and art, and playing a part in the community. It is also important for young people to build bonds with others, especially family and friends, but homework often squeezes the time available for all these things. 4. Homework puts students off learning Homework puts students off learning. Studies have shown that many children find doing homework very stressful, boring and tiring. Often teachers underestimate how long a task will take, or set an unrealistic deadline. Sometimes because a teacher has not explained something new well in class, the homework task is impossible. So children end up paying with their free time for the failings of their teachers. They also suffer punishments if work is done badly or late. After years of bad homework experiences, it is no wonder that many children come to dislike education and switch off, or drop out too early. Teachers in Britain fear that poor children, because they lack the support to do their homework, will be turned off school. BBC News, 2008 This is why homework should be banned or atleast less then what they have now.",

Homework makes a child dull compelling her to look only through the doors shown to her. 4. Homework, is an improved way of spoon feeding a child, because a child is always helped at home, by parents or professional tutors. A student needs to apply and not mug up. Great people or rather scientist do not mug up things, they apply concepts and experience.5.Takes too much time Especially when you move to higher classes students have a lot od different classes and different homework assignments to finish. When adding all off them it takes a lot of time. Students need time for other extracurricular activities and family time. Homework could potentially be a time consuming activity for many. 6. Homework should be banned I swear most of the time i am stressed and 99% its because of homework. I dont want to be the typical teen who says \"i hate homework its so boring and im so lazy\" but its so true. And in my school they either give you little bit of homework with lots of hard parts for it or on HUGE project or assignment on top of other homework from other classes. I can not even explain how angry homework gets me. Sometimes there are group assignments and there is never a time where im not paired with the lazy people so i end up doing all the crap and i have to worry about other classes too. NO. I can not. I need a break and i hate when teachers pack the most work on weekends. But no I have to use my only two days of rest on assignments on top of other work that im mentally crying about. Do not even get me started. I legitimately cried like two hours ago becuase all the homework i have to do. And thats not a good thing. School is supposed to be \"a fun learning experience\" and \"learning and doing good and no stress\" This site will prove my point: http://www.education.com...Best of luck.",

We might even get the same results as Japan and Denmark if we make these changes. 2) Regardless of homework's educational value, marking it takes up much of teachers' time. This leaves teachers tired and with little time to prepare effective, inspiring lessons.

It might be forced upon you, but it is for your own good and you, as a person whose brain has not yet fully developed, are not qualified to classify homework as slavery. That is an insult to real African American slaves. Your second assertion is unproven. There is cheating with normal schoolwork. If a student takes a picture of homework and sends it to friends, then it means that the student is dishonest. The student is to be blamed, not the school. To blame the school would be a miscarriage of justice. Finally, your third assertion is only a repetition of your claim.",

            "discussionTitle": "Homework Should Be Banned",
            "conclusion": "Homework Should Be Banned",
            "premise": "Homework has been a reliable tool in education for a very long time. Motions to have homework banned are a phenomenon unique to the Unites States of America [1], where there has been a strong movement against homework.The international PISA study [2] has shown that US pupils perform at or slightly below the world's average, making the American system as it is not exactly a good example of efficient schooling.So, in order to arrive at a reliable conclusion about the use of homework, we may have to look at it on a global scale.1. Homework helps pupils to consolidate what they have learnedLet's first have a look at research. In 1989 and 2006, Professor Harris Cooper from the Department Of Psychology of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, conducted two reviews of a total of 180 studies on the topic of homework [3][4].His findings were consistent in that homework is beneficial to student success, unless it is overdone. \"Duke University researchers have reviewed more than 60 research studies on homework between 1987 and 2003 and concluded that homework does have a positive effect on student achievement. [...] Cooper said the research is consistent with the \"10-minute rule\" suggesting the optimum amount of homework that teachers ought to assign. The \"10-minute rule,\" Cooper said, is a commonly accepted practice in which teachers add 10 minutes of homework as students progress one grade. In other words, a fourth-grader would be assigned 40 minutes of homework a night, while a high school senior would be assigned about two hours.\"It's not exactly counter-intuitive, either: the more often a task is practiced, the better we get at it.Of course, there is - as with ANY training - always a risk of overdoing it. But that is only logical, too. So, there is a perfect amount of homework, and a \"too much\" just as well as a \"too little\" - as with anything in life.Abolishing homework would rob students of a chance to be better in school. There can be no doubt about that, and keeping people from improving would impede their civil rights.Homework is thus important and must be offered to pupils. It must be regulated not to overtax them. 2. Homework is an important diagnostic toolTeachers have limited resources. They can not be there for students all day, they need time to prepare lessons, review exams and be prepared to solve conflicts. They also have a right to a family life of their own, and should participate in continued training in order to be able to offer their students the best possible education. This means that ways have to be found to aid the teachers in their task of helping children get through school.Homework is an important part of this.Teachers work with their students in school teaching them subject matter. Assessment of their progress is necessary to ensure that pupils do not fail their exams. Homework is the perfect way of doing this. Students perform tasks without assistance from the teacher, under conditions not too different from an exam. By correcting these exercises, teachers can evaluate which student needs more attention and invite parents to consult them on how to support their child if the need arises.There simply isn't enough time in class to watch every student's performance. Besides, a vast majority of students is afraid of exams. Assessing students' performance in class would be just that: an exam. Homework is far less stressful, because it's usually not graded. Mistakes uncovered in homework don't harm students' grades, they are just a chance for pupil and teacher to realize where more work might be needed.3. Homework teaches more than subject materialSome people complain that homework is repetitive and seems to serve no purpose.But that is an experience all too familiar from professional careers as adults [5]. Many professional workers feel that their existence is filled with repetitive, useless work. This puts a lot of stress on them.Being prepared for this is something crucial for the process of growing up. For children, life is all fun and games. As adults, they have to set all of that aside during working hours. And when will they learn how to cope with that experience? Class is different from work, as there is always an authority in front of the students, talking to them. The students don't have to actually produce something, they are recipients of instruction. Homework, however, is quite similar to the actual working experience: being isolated, performing the same task over and over again, without any apparent reward. But homework - if put to use appropriately - only takes up a maximum of two hours a day, as opposed to a \"nine to five\" job. The result is that children are prepared for their later life and are less likely to succumb to the stress of a working life then. Routine is the key word here. Occasional reports or other long-term assignments just don't serve the same purpose of getting children used to this situation.But homework does even more than that.Doing exercises for practice in school with the assistance of a teacher makes students dependent on exterior help. They can never learn to think for themselves and solve problems on their own with a teacher always looking over their shoulder. I can sadly only offer my personal experience as a tutor in that respect. In my country, there are private schools that work without homework, where teachers assist students in school, even during exams. As a result, when these children transfer to a public school, they fail miserably whenever they are asked to perform any task all by themselves. But these skills are essential for students. At the very least, every student is completely deserted during the final exam. If the students have not learned by then how to cope with work assignments all by themselves. Homework is an important step towards self-sufficiency. And while long-term assignments do serve the same purpose, they do not really help children learn how to deal with the stress of close deadlines.The purpose of school is to get students ready for the working life. And we're not talking about rocket science here. Even hamburger vendors are required to work pressed for time. So if children are not introduced to that concept, they would fail miserably at any job out there.Is this a nice experience? No. But neither are hunger, fatigue or fear. Yet it is important not to be overprotective. Keeping any negative experience away from children harms their development [6]. Is it fair that sometimes we have to work things out all by ourselves? No, but that's how things are in LIFE. Suppose you're on a lonely road and your car breaks down. It requires practice to fight down the uprising panic, remain calm and find a solution to the problem. A child without that practice might just run off into one direction planlessly or curl up into a ball and hope that help will arrive all by itself. But the practice of overcoming fear and panic can only come from experience. Homework will help children acquire this important skill on a rather nonhazardous level. The worst thing that can happen is a little bit of humiliation and a second attempt at solving the problem.Homework is thus beneficial on multiple levels, and must not be banned for the sake of all students.[1]: http://www.sfgate.com...[2]: http://nces.ed.gov...[3]: http://tvoparents.tvo.org...[4]: http://today.duke.edu...[5]: http://hbr.org...[6]: http://everydaylife.globalpost.com...",

            "premise": "First off I would like to thank my opponent for accepting. I believe homwork should be banned for a few reasons: 1. It can put too much stress on the child and family. 2. The stress may cause a decrease in performance in school. 3. When students don't have the teacher they may not have enough help. Professor Sue Hallam of the Institute of Education at London University believes much of the friction for families is caused by increased amounts of formal written school work coming home [1]. Hallam has studied homework extensively. It is possible that too much homework causes too much stress, and subsequently lowered grades and test scores. The University of Virginia did a study on students with a lot of homework: and they found it was detrimental: except for students who said they do a half hour or more of math homework every night. Their math grades and test scores rose in math, but everything else got worse or stayed about the same [2]. Elizabeth Truss, who is a member of England's Parliament, and is in control of England's education system, delievered a speech at the Oxford Conference of Education about replacing homework with more math lessons at school, and scrapping time-wasting lessons to make the time [3]. She wants this in England because they are falling behind countries such as China. They believe it will help improve test scores so they can catch up with China. The US is also in a similar situation (falling behind China), yet we have yet to even think about a large reform, even though our system is outdated, being called a \"mid-twentieth century factory\" by some. Homework is not really needed if the US reforms because they can do what Elizabrth Truss wants to do in England and more: they want to cut out time-wasting lessons: the US can cut out time-wasting subjects, such as health and PE. Homework would just be an exercise done at the last few minutes of class, and teachers would be able to help in some subjects such as science. And finally, a student would do better with teacher help rather than having to do things on their own. This argument is based off of opinion and it seems it cannot be backed by sources. It is opinion based. And my opinion is that students may be assigned things they don't understand, and because there is more homework being assigned today than 50 years ago, and the homework is harder, many people don't put much thought to it. But a high school critical thinking problem given to a 7th grader may make the student stuck. They cannot ask their teacher for help when at home, and if they go into school the next day with the problem blank or horribly incorrect, some teachers may make the student redo the homework, and mark it late. The student's grade would then suffer because the teacher was not there to help. [1]: http://m.bbc.com... [2]: http://www.newsplex.com...?",

            "premise": "First, I would like to thank my opponent for starting this debate: Thank you Purplequeen2. Best of luck \u2013 this should be fun. My opponent has made the assertion that homework should not be allowed on Halloween. Starting from the beginning, it seems necessary to point out that I was befuddled by my opponents use of the word \"should\" in the title of the debate. As Dictionary.com defines: Should: Must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that. My initial suspicion was that my opponent actually believed that homework should be prohibited on Halloween. That is, he does not merely believe that it would be nice if there were no homework on Halloween, but rather that homework should be legislatively barred from assignment on Halloween. My suspicion was confirmed when I read this in my opponents opening argument: \"I believe that on Halloween teachers should not be allowed to give their students homework\u2026\" My opponent then creates a false dichotomy between secular and religious holidays. He makes the assumption that students are excused from homework on religious holidays but not secular. Balderdash. Points and questions that need to be addressed by my opponent: 1. Is it true that Teachers are not allowed to assign homework on religious holidays? If so, A. Where is the scholastic policy that mandates teachers to not assign homework on religious holidays? B. What religious holidays are stipulated? If this is not so, A.Why do you find it necessary to prohibit homework on Halloween if it is not prohibited on any other holiday? Secular or otherwise. B.Why try to limit the scholastic endeavors of a teacher by mandating a homework assignment bar? In all my Middle School and High School years, I never remember having no homework on Ash Wednesday, or Good Friday. I typically even had homework over winter break. Easter is always on Sunday, and I can even recall doing homework on some fine Easter days (when Easter did not occur during Spring Break of course). The idea that special benefits are extended to religious holidays is simply not true. Special benefits, if any, are typically extended to federally recognized holidays - a recognition which does not extend to Halloween. Among the eleven federally recognized holidays, only one of them is explicitly religious, and that is Christmas day. My argument for why homework should not be barred on Halloween day: 1.It extends special benefits to a celebration that is not federally recognized - benefits that are not extended to ANY of the actual federally recognized holidays. 2.It offsets the scholastic endeavors of teachers, keeping them from requiring what may be beneficial for student learning. 3.Teachers should not be limited in the assignment of homework. While it may be nice to not have homework on Halloween, a mandatory bar is both absurd and detrimental. Thank you for reading this debate. Now do what is proper and vote CON.",

            "conclusion": "Homework Is Unnecessary",
            "premise": "[ Arguments ] There are several reasons that people support homework:1. To reinforce what is being taught in the classroom2. To enable parents to engage in their child's education3. To help children prepare for tests and state exams4. To teach fundamental skills such as time managementHowever I will be arguing that1. Homework does not fuel academic success2. Homework inhibits family time and burdens parents3. Homework infringes on playtime and recreation time4. Homework fosters resentment that is detrimental and unnecessaryPoint 1 Let's begin with the supposition that homework is vital to one's education. In fact, there is almost no evidence that homework helps elementary school students achieve academic success, and little more that it helps older students. A study led by an Indiana University School of Education faculty member finds little correlation between time spent on homework and better course grades [1].Using databases like the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) we can see how homework impacts academic achievement around the world. According to TIMSS data, homework is not associated with high national or international levels of academic achievement [2].Adam Maltese and his colleagues analyzed the amount of time students spent on homework to their academic success. Research showed there was no relationship whatsoever between time spent on homework and course grade, and \u201cno substantive difference in grades between students who complete homework and those who do not\u201d [3]. Whereas the research showed a slight improvement in standardized test scores for students who did more homework, this improvement is described as being \"very modest.\" The fact is, you can't \"reinforce\" understanding the way you can reinforce a behavior. If you had a hard time understanding the lesson in class, chances are you won't have an easier time understanding it (if you can understand it at all) through the assignment of homework. I will be glad to expand on the research if my opponent challenges this contention.Point 2Homework places a burden on parents. After working all day, parents are required to go home and not only take care of their household, but help their child complete additional work. This is stressful and can often cause family conflict. Indeed many parents have rebelled against homework [4] and some have even taken legal action (and won) to not have to suffer the burden of this homework obligation [5]. Parents should be able to choose what the best way to teach their children is outside of the classroom, which may or may not be reviewing their day's lesson. Homework can cut into important personal and family time [6]. Rather than bonding by spending quality time with their loved ones, homework requires students continue working rather than strengthening their personal relationships. A Stanford researcher found that too much homework can negatively affect kids away from school, where family, friends and activities matter [7]. It can also emphasize the mentality that work is more important than family. Researcher Alfie Kohn notes, \"We parents, meanwhile, turn into nags. After being away from our children all day, the first words out of our mouths, sadly, may be: 'So, did you finish your homework?' One mother told me it permanently damaged her relationship with her son because it forced her to be an enforcer rather than a mom\" [8]. Moreover, each child has a different home environment. Whereas some parents have the time and resources to dedicate to homework monitoring and assistance, other parents do not have the opportunity to be as involved. Thus a shoddy homework response might reflect poorly on the child unfairly. Further, homework arguably places an unnecessary burden on teachers in addition to parents. Rather than spending time planning their lessons, grading classwork or working on their own self-improvement, teachers have to spend time grading \"busy work\" that they can't be sure the child has even completed on their own. While some suggest that homework teaches kids about responsibility, most of the time it needs asssistance from parents. In the early years especially, it often cannot be done without parental guidance (so much for teaching independence!).Point 3 After spending all day in school, children are forced to begin a \"second shift\" of work which can include hours of additional assignments. This deprives children of time for other physical and creative activities, or even time to rest. Homework leads kids to be frustrated and tired to the point of inhibiting their learning. For one thing they might become bored or impatient with the perpetual tasks; for another they might be too drained to focus on them. Homework consistently builds a hateful relationship with learning [9]. While we don't give slow-working children a longer school day, we consistently give them a longer homework day. Kids who take longer to read, grasp the work or work more slowly in general have less time for non-academic education compared to their peers. Learning an instrument, playing sports, working on the arts, and even general playtime has significant benefits to a child's health, wellness and intellectual development [10]. Recreational activities can teach all kinds of useful life lessons and skills that pertain to schoolwork and beyond. Point 4 Homework is known for \u201ccausing a loss of sleep, of self esteem, of cheer, and of childhood\u201d [11]. \u201cIt extinguishes the flame of curiosity.\u201d A child is not engaged through homework but rather disengaged through \"drill and kill\" methods that provide little to no utility. Homework also widens the gap between high and low achievers, and can increase pressure to do well. This in turn can encourage cheating and may disproportionately punish low-income or minority students in disadvantages situations. As for proposed alternatives, \"The best teachers know that children learn how to make good decisions by making decisions, not by following directions... At least two investigators have found that the most impressive teachers (as defined by various criteria) tend to involve students in decisions about assignments rather than simply telling them what they\u2019ll have to do at home\" [12]. As such, we can improve the status quo by asking students the best way to reinforce what they have learned in class. While this might include some work from home, it probably won't look like the standard version of homework that is uniform, repetitive and monotonous. Perhaps teachers and parents can work with each student individually to figure out their goals and best methods of learning based on their habits, skill set and home environment.

            "premise": "Rebuttal:In response to:1. It can put too much stress on the child and family.My opponent argues that it \"is possible that too much homework causes too much stress\".This is something I will admit. It is only logical. But I miss - and refute - any reasoning why homework should be completely banned on these grounds. By the same argumentation, ANYTHING would have to be banned, as there is a \"too much\" of anything.Too much water will kill you.[1]Too much oxygen in your lungs can kill you (commonly known as hyperventilation) [2]Should we ban those, too?The research I offered shows that the PROPER amount of homework is beneficial, leading only to one conclusion:Regulate homework instead of banning it.Even my opponent's OWN SOURCE doesn't speak in favour of banning homework:\"Teachers need to be much more clear about why they are assigning homework and what the homework is for,\" Tai said. \"If teachers aren't really incorporating homework into their teaching, it's unclear there is any type of benefit at all and it actually may end up hurting students.\"[3]This, again, clearly calls for a regulation of homework, not an abolition.In response to:\"the US can cut out time-wasting subjects, such as health and PE.\"Firstly, this is a plan by a politician. It is not backed up with any corroborating studies that this will actually help academic performance. So it is nothing more than pure conjecture that this will actually help students improve.Secondly, my opponent did not even provide a source for this claim. While he did put a tag \"3\", there is no source given under that tag.Thirdly, health and PE are not time-wasting, as a study from 1999 confirms [4]: \"These three studies provide encouraging findings about the effects of enhanced physical education on academic performance. Two studies reported academic benefits, and one reported no difference, in spite of 14-26% reduction in instruction time for subjects other than physical education.\"In response to: \"3. When students don't have the teacher they may not have enough help.\"One essential goal of any education is to make children able to work independently [5]. They must not be raised to rely on a teacher's help all the time. How will they ever learn how to pass an exam, if that will be the first time they may not ask their teacher for help?Homework is necessary to try out strategies learned in class by oneself, so as to see whether they have been understood.Even if the homework was graded, it would make no difference in favour of my opponent's opinion-based argument.Let's say we ban homework. The student leaves class believing they understood a topic, but they have overlooked something. There is no homework to tell the student that he got stuck, but he's still stuck nonetheless. The next day the teacher comes up with a surprise test. The student fails, never understanding why, his grades are bad nonetheless. So, banning homework will not solve the problem you propose.Summarizing:You have one argument that doesn't necessitate the banning of homework. You have basically conceded that the proper amount of homework is beneficial (by saying that too much may do harm you have accepted that there's an amount that does not do harm in contrast).You have one argument without a source given in spite of claiming so.You have one opinion-based argument that doesn't lead anywhere, as it doesn't add to any solution. I have countered it with a reliable source about the goal of education.Your argument is thus completely refuted.

Argument Structure1 Fairness1a: for students that already understood the material and could spent time otherwise1b: for students of non-supportive homes being left alone with the homework1c: for students of overly caring homes where parents involvement makes proper feedback impossible2 Learning Success Factors 2a: homework =!= understanding2b: time loss due to homework control/ review3 Benefits of Spare Time3a: self-esteem / mental health3b: positive learning experience with hobbies3c: ensuring physical health as basis for successful learningConclusionArgumentation1 FairnessWhy homework is discriminative and unbalanced1a: for students that already understood the material and could spent time otherwiseThere are many different subjects you have to take or voluntarily take at school. Math is very different than History or Business economics in terms of what you learn and how you remember it. But as teachers try to be fair, they try to give an equal amount of homework for each subject. Which turns out to be not fair. Because students, that already understood one subjects material will spent an equal amount of workload on subjects they are strong at as on subjects they are weak at. Which can mask the real problem they might have in a weak subject. Or cause frustration due to the overall workload that doesn't offer enough time to focus on the real problems while making the student do over and over again, what he already can and knows. Compulsory homework does not adapt the students individual abilities. It forces work on him/her that is therefore likely to be either too difficult or too easy. 1b: for students of non-supportive homes being left alone with the homeworkFamilies are very diverse these days. But generally schools assume that parents help the younger kids with their homework while they don't take their time for this when the kids are older. Which is an assumption that sometimes misses reality harshly.Kids from households of parents/single-parents that work a lot often face their homework alone from an early age, being left behind in school afterwards by kids that get extensive care from their parents. UE published a list of reasons they gathered from students about why they skipped homework and lacking the equipment and quiet place was also a common problem {1} . This is especially a problem for low-income households that they simply can't provided what is needed.One might say that homework is therefore discriminative against kids from poor and undereducated homes from the very beginning when skills are learned that really are mostly based on repetition rather than understanding (such a reading). 1c: for students of overly caring homes where parents involvement makes proper feedback impossibleOn the other hand are overly caring homes not that much better. They look better on the paper because the kids homework is usually proper, beautiful and correct. But how does a teacher actually know that the answers on the paper are the student ones? Parents might choose to push the abilities of their kids by giving them the answers without actually caring whether the kid understood the concept behind them, which gets more and more important around middle school, where this kind of parenting actively endangers the kids learning success {2}2 Learning Success Factors Once the kid enters middle school and has to understand complex ideas and concepts, repetition is no longer the only key to success.2a: Homework =!= UnderstandingRepetition of different problems all sharing the same solution method is necessary to develop skills in Art, Math or Chemistry or for Writing and Reading. But how fast these skills develop is a very diverse thing. That's why standardised homework assigns a broad kind of repetition often not targeting the individual problems. It is not necessary to understand the problem solution method, but requires it. One who did not understand at school will not be able to complete the homework successfully. Even for maths, studies have shown that homework has barely any relevance for the actual understanding and long term performance of the student {3}Independent reading and research to gain new skills is rarely the core of homework and requires especially supervision considering the problems of nowadays research methods such as the internet. A twelve year old should not be browsing on his own, the flood of relevant and irrelevant information is too big and it takes years to learn how to filter good sources from bad sources from irrelevant sources. 2b: time loss due to homework control/ reviewHomework needs to be checked. From the teacher to make sure the students actually did them (it's compulsory) and for the student to make sure he did not develop a totally wrong approach to the problem. This i. takes up relevant time at the beginning of the class that could have been better filled with supervised exercisesii. relies on the student actively participating in the correction timeORi. is done by the teacher which means students will get the results (and the message: you don't understand this) probably days after the topic was relevant and are thenii. left alone with the problem to solve this lack of understanding3 Benefits of Spare Time3a: raising self-esteem and reality-connection to prevent bullying /mental healthThe self-esteem of a kid is necessary to give them a positive learning environment. Or to say it different: happy people are better learners {4}. A kid that has time to develop a self-confidence outside the school can bring that in an is less likely to become bullied or be a bully or be a drop-out. Sport, a hug, art and nature, all this helps kids to feel peaceful, save and loved {4}. If we don't offer kids the time to do all this without feeling like they have to skip school work for it or without feeling rushed, we seriously endanger their mental health. Depression and Burn out becomes more and more relevant for school kids. The pressure of bringing the school home via homework contributes to this problem {5}.3b: positive learning experience Reality is beneficial. Talking to adults and mates freely is beneficial. Having the time to develop a hobby is especially beneficial. How people learn a positive image of learning on their own? By having something that makes them do research and learn on their own. If all the learning you ever do is what you are forced to, how can you have a positive image of learning?3c: ensuring physical health as basis for successful learningSport keeps you health. It's good for your teamwork-skills, self-discipline, goal setting {6} and it offers you to make new friends that don't go to your school, don't know that people there mock your for your nose and call you funny names. But especially: it keeps your body fit and shows you how to develop a healthy lifestyle {6}. Being constantly sick or suffering from physical problems early in life is likely to reduce your performance at school and later at work and the benefits of teaching children the joy of sports outside a forced environment like school can only be of long-term benefit. Something that homework should not interfere with.ConclusionHomework is therfore discriminative and ineffective and thus unncecessary waste of time.Sources{1} http://www.usingenglish.com...{2} http://www.theatlantic.com...{3} http://www.ernweb.com...{4} http://www.maggiedent.com...{5} http://edition.cnn.com...",

            "conclusion": "We need to get rid of homework",
            "premise": "Proof: http://www.findingdulcinea.com... A study has been show to state that homework does not increase student percentile of passing there test. Basically to break it down test score in the NYC are remained flat and has been dropping each time during a new benchmark exam and children have been getting homework each grade and the homework increases. Homework increasing =/= Passing most of your test Just to say practicing does not always make perfect. Another study has been also shown that students who don't do their homework get the same average grade as most of the children who do most of their homework. Here is an example and this is a real example When I was at school my friends were talking about report cards and what was their average. One kid in my class basically doesn't do his homework all the time and later on he got a 80.00% for his average. There is another girl in my class she has never missed a day of homework and her average was lower then the kid I mentioned with a 80.00% ratio. So basically homework does not improve your test it has been proven that homework is a chore for students 'There are also wide variety of useful skills that can come out of doing homework, such as time management, improving study habits, reviewing material, more opportunities to improve grades, etc.' Your response ^^^^ Like I said homework does not improve your grade. Its how you were born and how you study. I can just do a full fledge worksheet and I still remain the same smartness I am. I will give you another real life example. I barely do any of my ELA homework. And my grade improved. So just doing homework wouldn't teach children how to improve their test score. Later on your talking about time management. About most children in USA stay up through out all night doing most of their homework Time management ' managing your time in a efficient way' That's a definition and like stated about most children in USA stay up to do homework. Why do you think during the state test teachers basically don't give homework because they want you to get a good night rest '2) From a teacher's perspective, it allows the teacher to evaluate how their students are performing in class. This allows the teacher to see who understands the material, and who needs more help. This is especially crucial during lesson planning; there is no point moving onto new material if a teacher discovers that 90% of the class did not understand what happened previously.' That is the reason we have pre- exams and ready- exams to see what children need help on. You don't need homework to see how the well the teacher thinks your doing. The problem with homework 1) Teacher give a highly amount of homework that children have to stay up to do some children attend after school and it wouldn't be fair for them to have 6 homework's because they would have to stay all night doing it. Also they will not get a good night rest. Children who do not get a good rest do not perform well in school. It has been proven by studies 2) It gets in the way of family time. Some children want to spend time with their parents on the weekend. Basically they would not want to go to someone's house and sit there doing homework. Would you like it if you had three projects and later on you spend three full days doing it and you cant spend time with family on the weekend/? I bet you would say no. But family time is very important 3) Children do not have the correct device Lets say you did not know you had a typed up writing assiment to do and when you finished typing and you did not know there was no ink. What are you going to do? I bet you would say go to a library. What if your in after school and you came back at five o'clock. And your library closed at 5:00. Where is your time to print? Of course no answer. And everyone does not have a computer. And computers are expensive. Well that's my argument your turn pro I cant wait to hear your argument",

You say homework should be given when students are struggling. Homework is done at home, away from the person who is most familiar with the curricular requirements and key concepts-the teacher. Parents' assistance might not work; homework causes conflict in a third of families (2). Instead, students can ask their teacher for academic help.

Students who feel that they don't need extra practice normally do homework because they feel like they have to. In one study done by Miami University, students who excelled at a specific subject matter and got graded on homework were shown to have a better understanding of the subject matter than those who did no homework and took the test without studying at all. Homework doesn't necessarily need to be graded but homework should still be enforced and done. Many students blow off homework because they don't feel like they need to do it or because it won't benefit their grades very much. When the amount of homework done was correlated with the students test scores, many students began doing their homework more frequently. In one school, the teachers are required to write the number of missed assignments along with each students test score when they get their tests back. This way, students can see how the homework done correlates with their understanding and success of the subject matter. All in all, I think that homework should never be banned. Each student learns a little differently in the classroom so homework is a good way for students to review what they learned in the day and then teach themselves the way they understand so that they can score well on the test and get good grades. Homework should be done by every student because it is proven to help you succeed in school and develop good study habits for later in life.",

            "premise": "[ Arguments ] There are several reasons that people support homework:1. To reinforce what is being taught in the classroom2. To enable parents to engage in their child's education3. To help children prepare for tests and state exams4. To teach fundamental skills such as time managementHowever I will be arguing that1. Homework does not fuel academic success2. Homework inhibits family time and burdens parents3. Homework infringes on playtime and recreation time4. Homework fosters resentment that is detrimental and unnecessaryPoint 1 Let's begin with the supposition that homework is vital to one's education. In fact, there is almost no evidence that homework helps elementary school students achieve academic success, and little more that it helps older students. A study led by an Indiana University School of Education faculty member finds little correlation between time spent on homework and better course grades [1].Using databases like the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) we can see how homework impacts academic achievement around the world. According to TIMSS data, homework is not associated with high national or international levels of academic achievement [2].Adam Maltese and his colleagues analyzed the amount of time students spent on homework to their academic success. Research showed there was no relationship whatsoever between time spent on homework and course grade, and \u201cno substantive difference in grades between students who complete homework and those who do not\u201d [3]. Whereas the research showed a slight improvement in standardized test scores for students who did more homework, this improvement is described as being \"very modest.\" The fact is, you can't \"reinforce\" understanding the way you can reinforce a behavior. If you had a hard time understanding the lesson in class, chances are you won't have an easier time understanding it (if you can understand it at all) through the assignment of homework. I will be glad to expand on the research if my opponent challenges this contention.Point 2Homework places a burden on parents. After working all day, parents are required to go home and not only take care of their household, but help their child complete additional work. This is stressful and can often cause family conflict. Indeed many parents have rebelled against homework [4] and some have even taken legal action (and won) to not have to suffer the burden of this homework obligation [5]. Parents should be able to choose what the best way to teach their children is outside of the classroom, which may or may not be reviewing their day's lesson. Homework can cut into important personal and family time [6]. Rather than bonding by spending quality time with their loved ones, homework requires students continue working rather than strengthening their personal relationships. A Stanford researcher found that too much homework can negatively affect kids away from school, where family, friends and activities matter [7]. It can also emphasize the mentality that work is more important than family. Researcher Alfie Kohn notes, \"We parents, meanwhile, turn into nags. After being away from our children all day, the first words out of our mouths, sadly, may be: 'So, did you finish your homework?' One mother told me it permanently damaged her relationship with her son because it forced her to be an enforcer rather than a mom\" [8]. Moreover, each child has a different home environment. Whereas some parents have the time and resources to dedicate to homework monitoring and assistance, other parents do not have the opportunity to be as involved. Thus a shoddy homework response might reflect poorly on the child unfairly. Further, homework arguably places an unnecessary burden on teachers in addition to parents. Rather than spending time planning their lessons, grading classwork or working on their own self-improvement, teachers have to spend time grading \"busy work\" that they can't be sure the child has even completed on their own. While some suggest that homework teaches kids about responsibility, most of the time it needs asssistance from parents. In the early years especially, it often cannot be done without parental guidance (so much for teaching independence!).Point 3 After spending all day in school, children are forced to begin a \"second shift\" of work which can include hours of additional assignments. This deprives children of time for other physical and creative activities, or even time to rest. Homework leads kids to be frustrated and tired to the point of inhibiting their learning. For one thing they might become bored or impatient with the perpetual tasks; for another they might be too drained to focus on them. Homework consistently builds a hateful relationship with learning [9]. While we don't give slow-working children a longer school day, we consistently give them a longer homework day. Kids who take longer to read, grasp the work or work more slowly in general have less time for non-academic education compared to their peers. Learning an instrument, playing sports, working on the arts, and even general playtime has significant benefits to a child's health, wellness and intellectual development [10]. Recreational activities can teach all kinds of useful life lessons and skills that pertain to schoolwork and beyond. Point 4 Homework is known for \u201ccausing a loss of sleep, of self esteem, of cheer, and of childhood\u201d [11]. \u201cIt extinguishes the flame of curiosity.\u201d A child is not engaged through homework but rather disengaged through \"drill and kill\" methods that provide little to no utility. Homework also widens the gap between high and low achievers, and can increase pressure to do well. This in turn can encourage cheating and may disproportionately punish low-income or minority students in disadvantages situations. As for proposed alternatives, \"The best teachers know that children learn how to make good decisions by making decisions, not by following directions... At least two investigators have found that the most impressive teachers (as defined by various criteria) tend to involve students in decisions about assignments rather than simply telling them what they\u2019ll have to do at home\" [12]. As such, we can improve the status quo by asking students the best way to reinforce what they have learned in class. While this might include some work from home, it probably won't look like the standard version of homework that is uniform, repetitive and monotonous. Perhaps teachers and parents can work with each student individually to figure out their goals and best methods of learning based on their habits, skill set and home environment.

            "premise": "I will rebut my opponents case this round. I thank my opponent for going this far.Pro's framework\"Firstly, I would like to define homework as work that was meant to be done at home, but is now often done during class. Now, I would like to state my framework for this debate. The purpose of homework is to help students\" futures. Therefore, if the proposition proves that homework does not benefit the future, then they win this debate. I would now like to state my three contentions for this debate.\"I firstly disagree with Pro's framework. Pro says that the purpose of homework is to help stdent's \"future.\" Not only that, but homework is for students to learn about the topic they were doing, and also remeber and practice what they are doing at school. Basically, Practice Makes Perfect. If Pro shows that this is unimportant, he wins. If I show it is useful, I win. I disagree with Pro's framework. BoP is on Pro, which means that he has the burden of proof.RebuttalsContention 1: Income Inequality\"Income Inequality is when poor individuals do not have enough resources to do their homework while wealthier individuals are able to hire tutors or others to help them finish theirs. According to The Pew Research Center, roughly one-third (31.4%) of households whose incomes fall below $50,000 and with children ages 6 to 17 do not have a high-speed internet connection at home. This low-income group makes up about 40% of all families with school-age children in the United States which is a major disadvantage for poorer students. Also, according to the US Department Of Labor, nearly 46 percent of high school students in 2013 were part of the labor force, which has increased significantly. One student named Lincoln Rhodes quotes \" \"I need the spending money, especially with inflation, and money to save for college even if I have to forgo homework,\" says Lincoln, who plans to study engineering in college. As you can see, many of these students do not even have internet access which is often necessary to use during homework. In addition, some individuals have a hard time juggling homework and jobs which they need desperately to support their families. How can we morally obligate students to do homework rather than support their own families?\"My opponent says hat about 40% of people have a disadvantagbe of doing homework, when the other wealthier students can get help with their homework. This argument is irrevelant and useless if we just listen to what the teacher is talking about. Especially the poor ones. Then you can do homework by yourself. What is the big problem of doing homework with your tutor. Thats exactly the opposite of what the teacher is talking about. The teacher wans you to do it alone, if you do it alone, and get it wrong, the teacher won't be mad. Se will just learn you are weaker in those spots of learning.And how much time does homework take? Not that long. Sometimes you can just do homework at class if you tell your teacher that you don't have enough time to do it. Most schools give about 2 pages of homework every day. That \"literally\" takes about an hour depending on the homework.Many students may say that this is a long time. But lets think about this.School is around 7 hours for mostly every single kid. May be 7 hours and 30 minutes, you get the point though. Sleeping is 8 hours. Lets be nice and say that riding and going back to school is about 1-2 hours. This means you have 8-7 hours left to do your homework. Most homeworks \"literally\" take one hour. you have about 6-7 hours left. You can rest in that time. How can you not have time to do your homework. Think about it like that. You have tons of time to do your homework.Contention 2: Counterproductive\"Since many students do not understand the homework they are given, which causes them to feel pressured to cheat on assignments. According to the Brookings Institution, 2,900 six to seventeen-year-old children found that time spent each week on homework had increased from 2 hours 38 minutes to 3 hours 58 minutes since 2005. Additionally, 75 and 98 percent of college students surveyed each year report having cheated in high school. This is an enormous jump in kids cheating today and it can be directly correlated to huge increase in homework given to students now. In addition, forty-three percent of parents admitted to doing their children\"s homework at least once to ease the strain. Almost half the dads, 47%, owned up to doing the homework, while 39% of mothers did so. Homework is supposed to build character however it actually increases cheating and things like parents doing the work for the children. Furthermore, since many kids do not understand their homework, they do the problems blindly and do not learn from it. This will impact children\"s future negatively, since all of the concepts have not been bolstered.\"My opponent says that bcause many homework the students don't understand, which makes them cheat. Just listen at school. There is no need to cheat, you can learn from mistakes. s://learningmythsbusted.files.wordpress.com...; alt=\"https://learningmythsbusted.files.wordpress.com...; /> http://poppies.es...; /> http://b-i.forbesimg.com...; />You don't need to care if you get something wrong. Look at the pictures. Mistakes are merely just you learning. A mistake is if you do not learn from your mistake. It is a mistake if you don't make mistakes but need to make mistakes. Mistakes are learning. Don't cheat. Learn from your mistakes, no need to hide them.My opponent says that over an hour adds to the homework time. They still have 3 hours to rest. Thats a lot.My opponents assertion of 98% of cheating is wrong. Why do you think that 2% won't cheat. Logically, that is wrong. No sources, this is a bare assertion.Opponent says because of homework, they won't know skills. They will no skills. They will not learn the skills if they do not do homework.Contention 3: Ineffective \"There are several studies on homework and academic achievement. However, most have proved Inconclusive. Here is an overview of all of the studies. According to Homework Myth, by 2011, a reviewer tracked down 17 experimental studies, most of which produced mixed results and some of which suggested that homework made no difference at all. In 2012 another reviewer found five more studies. One found that homework helped, two found that it didn't, and two found mixed results. Yet another review was published a few years later, But another researcher with fifteen studies actually compared getting homework with getting no homework, and their results actually didn't provide much reason to think it helped. From four studies, we can conclude that the results are inconclusive and that homework does not help or harm academic achievement making it completely ineffective and a waste of time.\"I will rebut my opponent's case which is in the text.My opponent shows studies which show that homework is not beneficial. First, no one knows if Pro is lying. Next study can be biased. It can just make believe that people should not do homework. They might have tried hard or whatever, because Pro gives no evidence of how the experiment went, this argument is still wrong.",

Being pressured in middle school will prepare you for the load in high school, college, and will be a great benefit to prep for tests such as, NWEA, NYS tests math and ELA, and many others. Also, not all kids have pressure of homework, if they are smart they will finish their homework in no time and they will have plenty of time to hang with friends and play games,etc. If not enough time during the week there is always the weekend. As for parents having a hard time they can always hire a tutor, or if they can't afford to do so then they can send their child to extra help, or go to their local library and ask for assistance. As for entering just from elementary, the kids will be introduced to homework load and will have a lot more responsibility. Also not all kids have a curfew, and they will have more experience or begin to experience middle school life. As for Washington Post, homework does have a benefit, it gives you more experience, and knowledge. Also, it helps you get more practice on the topic. According to http://lessonplanspage.com... ten benefits of homework are: - Homework teaches students about time management. -Homework teaches students how to set priorities. -Homework helps teachers determine how well the lessons and material are being understood by their students. -Homework teaches students how to problem solve. -Homework gives students another OPPORTUNITY to review the class material. -Homework gives parents a chance to see what their child is learning in school. -Homework teaches students that they have to do things, even when they don\"t want to. -Homework teaches students how to take responsibility for their part in the educational PROCESS. -Homework teaches students how to work independently. -Homework teaches students the importance of planning, staying organized and taking action.",

            "conclusion": "We need to get rid of homework",
            "premise": "Thank you for the discussion! However I believe you have confused your argument. Much of the proof you have offered suggests that increasing homework load is not beneficial. However, the crux of our argument is whether or not we should remove homework altogether. I claim that it is your burden to prove to me that homework itself is counter-productive, rather than an increased homework workload. For example, if I were to adjust the homework amount from 3 projects to 1, or have the homework assignments be reduced from 6 to 3, I don't believe many of your arguments hold.Before I address your points, I'm going to preface the fact that your personal stories are not strong evidence. You keep claiming that it is \"real life evidence\". So are statistical data, as they are also gathered from real people. Personally, I have had a great experience with my academic performance and homework load, but that shouldn't count as \"real life evidence\" enough to counter your example. Since you're making the claim that we should remove homework altogether, make sure your argument works for all students, not just you or your friends.[Point 1:] You make excessive claims. Please cite your sources when you make bold claims like:-> \"Like I said homework does not improve your grade. Its how you were born and how you study.\"Source? Because my experience in college suggested the exact opposite. Perhaps you haven't been challenged enough in a class yet.-> \"About most children in USA stay up through out all night doing most of their homework\"A 2011 Study found that American High Schoolers only spend on average, 1 hour a day doing homework, so 7 hours a week.(Source: http://nces.ed.gov...) Your experience might be completely different, but it is not the norm.[Point 2:] The evidence provided is weak.-> \"A study has been show to state that homework does not increase student percentile of passing there test. Basically to break it down test score in the NYC are remained flat and has been dropping each time during a new benchmark exam and children have been getting homework each grade and the homework increases.\"Your own evidence refutes your claim. From the very same article you linked:\"Researchers from Binghamton University and the University of Nevada conducted a study showing that although homework may benefit some students\"particularly high- and low-achieving students\"it\"s counterproductive for students who are average learners.\"The article says in the beginning paragraph that for some people homework can be helpful, and for others, homework can be harmful. Much of the article talks about changing the quality of homework to be useful for everybody, rather than abolishing altogether. It would stronger if you provided evidence that no homework improved everybody's academic performance.-> \"Another study has been also shown that students who don't do their homework get the same average grade as most of the children who do most of their homework.\"Is this the article you are talking about? (Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com...)The study also says that there is a positive link between time spent doing homework and time spent performing on tests, so isn't that good marker of improving academic performance? The study also makes no claim about whether or not removing homework benefited students.[Point 3] Addressing Hypothetical Claims with Hypothetical SolutionsSince there is little factual evidence presented in the arguments you make based off of my second original point (the teacher's perspective), I offer similarly ungrounded counterclaims to show your argument holds little weight since it sways either way depending if the conditions are right. (AKA: Making a series of assumptions which cannot be shown to be held constant in every case).-> \"That is the reason we have pre- exams and ready- exams to see what children need help on. You don't need homework to see how the well the teacher thinks your doing.\"But a teacher has to modify his/her course daily or however many times they teach per week. Are you suggesting that we have daily/weekly tests in lieu of daily/weekly homework? Wouldn't that defeat the point of removing homework?Another issue is that the longer time between each pre/ready exam, the longer the exam is going to take (since it cuts into class time). Nevertheless, you would always be removing classtime that a teacher could be spending teaching, thus reducing the amount of material that can be taught over a semester or a year. In terms of classes that have standardized tests, this is especially bad for your class as they might not cover enough material for the exam. And if you're thinking about accelerating the pace of the class, that also makes the class harder for everybody, which i believe is counter-productive.-> \"Teacher give a highly amount of homework that children have to stay up to do some children attend after school and it wouldn't be fair for them to have 6 homework's because they would have to stay all night doing it\"This is only problematic if it happens repeatedly. As I showed in [Point 2], this is not the case for most students (high school at least). You also assume that you couldn't explain your situation to your teachers, that you had no say in the completion of the assignments, that somehow 6 classes all assign heavy projects on the same night such that you're forced to spend all night doing it, etc. There doesn't seem to be a complaint here if there isn't a lot of homework.-> \"Would you like it if you had three projects and later on you spend three full days doing it and you cant spend time with family on the weekend?\"Again only problematic if it happens regularly. If it happens once in a while, that is common for most students. See previous point about real time spent working for most American students. -> \"Lets say you did not know you had a typed up writing assiment to do and when you finished typing and you did not know there was no ink. What are you going to do? I bet you would say go to a library. What if your in after school and you came back at five o'clock. And your library closed at 5:00. Where is your time to print? Of course no answer. And everyone does not have a computer. And computers are expensive.\"There are two separate scenarios being presented in one paragraph. The first is a case where you suddenly and temporarily don't have the tools to hand in an assignment. The second is where you do not have the tools to do assignments, period.The solution to the first is easy. If I were that student? I'd ask to submit it by email. Or provide proof that the assignment was done and completed via said email. You could also ask others to print it. Or save it on a USB drive. There are a wide variety of solutions and assumptions being made here, so this case is moot.The second situation suggests it is not fair to assign homework that a student cannot complete (due to a lack of tools). You are correct. I would highlight a (non-comprehensive) list of assumptions you are making:- There is no method possible of getting a computer to use (library, school, friends, parents, work, etc)- You cannot explain your situation to the teacher or the school- The school does not believe you and lets you take the class and fail the grade- You basically have no way to control the situation in any way shape or form- There is no method possible of getting a computer to useAs you can see again, because I could add more information to suddenly make the issue much more easier to address, until either of us can provide factual evidence, the arguments are essentially hearsay.Hence I have demonstrated that the last 3 or 4 points you make are not a solid basis to suggest that we should remove homework.Looking forward to your response!",

            "premise": "pro:\"Time is valuable. We all need some time to ourselves. School already takes up a lot of time and it is necessary to have time which does not involve concentrating on learning. Education is not the only important activity in everyone\"s day; physical activity, play, and time with family are just as important as all teach life skills just in different ways. The internet makes it possible to be learning at home, there are even many computer games that help with learning. Homework clashes with these other activities. It can damage family relationships as it means parents have to try and make their children do their homework.\"The thing is, homework is not mandatory, you don't have to do it as i have previously mentioned. You will not get arrested. If homework is truly such a threatening issue to you, then don't do it to avoid conflict. It's simple. Yes there are consequences, but if you are in such dire conditions from doing homework, why even do it then?pro:\"Homework does not only take up time doing the homework at home but also takes up time in class. First there is the time that the teacher takes when explaining the task. Then more time is taken going through the homework when it is done and marked. This time could be better spent engaging with the class to find out what they do and don\"t understand. The answer to this is to have more time in class rather than boring homework.\"pro:\"homework to me, it\"s just something that causes unnecessary stress and in the end doesn\"t actually do much for you. Sure, some practice of graphing concepts is good, but why couldn\"t we just do board work in class? I think that we, as students, should not have homework for a number of reasons.\"Why couldn't you do it in class? Some teachers run out of time and homework is good for practice outside of class. My opponent pretty much conded that some practice is good, which means that homework is not actually futile. Also my opponent is contradicting him or herself. 1st, (s)he makes the point that homework is bad because your wasting time learning other concepts, then (s)he makes the point that they should've done the assignment in class. This makes absolutely no sense. Do we replace it with other education in that time or do we do it in class? i'm confused on the contradiction.pro:\"I agree in adequate quantities - however, in school, teacher push this to the limit and I certainly do not think 4-5 hours in an adequate stress level for a 15 year old boy. I rest my case!\"My partner has pretty much conceded that homework can be beneficial if in sufficent quantities. This flies into the face of his resolution which means is the homework is futile(pointless). Throughout this debate, my opponent has continued to tell us why homework is bad if there is sooo much homework that it consumes daily life. I completely agree with him/her that homework in overburdening quantities is not effective. I have proved the homework has some positive benefits and i have proved the stress in some quantity is good. My partner has not provided any evidence to which he can back his argument on as i see no links in any of his arguments (s)He has sited evidence but has no indication of where the internet link or research was done.Vote con for reasonability. I know you may not like homework but it can be a necessary evil for education. I hate homework too, but i gladly do it to practice and learn.",

Although your topic is not quite clear, I shall believe that as I am pro, I am saying that homework is good. Homework, especially in America, is a fundamental part of children's education. It is a necessary tool to go over what they learned during class. Most, if not all, of classes need to review topics. Listening and taking notes is not enough in school. If children do not have homework, would they actually go over notes? Would they really find worksheets to fill in, projects to make, essays to write, and problems to solve? Unless their parents enforce their kids to do work, if homework was optional, at least 90% of kids wouldn't do homework! Even for the children who WOULD do the homework, homework is an essential guide that leads them to success on their next test or quiz. To sum it up, homework is a necessary tool, most children wouldn't do homework if it was optional, and it will make them better students.",

            "premise": "Thank you for your welcome, and also your clarification, but I do know what utilitarianism and active & passive mean. While homework does have its benefits, which you mentioned, such as improving student's grades, scores, and futures, the cons of homework far outweigh them. Homework can clarify the subject, but if the concepts have not been learned once class is over, the homework becomes pointless. School is, and kids lives in general are, already immensely stressful without homework. Clear relationships between student's stress and ailments (physical and mental) have been found . I am again going to emphasise that homework should be limited. Though you make an excellent point about time restrictions, many teachers assign time-consuming homework that no one could complete quickly, no matter how intelligent they are or how well they understand the concept. If homework were to be limited to a few nights a week, this would open up more time for kids to be kids. I cannot speak for everyone when I say this, but at my school, we have at least four hours of homework total. Per night. Add in school, extracurriculars, meals, and sleep, and that leaves little to no time for freetime. No matter how well you manage your time, there will always be something that does not fit. If you were to try to squeeze in some freetime, you would most likely end up giving up some sleep, which would impair your performance at school the next day. As most kids enjoy having freetime, this is often the case. Therefore, I must say that, though homework is intended for a good cause (that is, improving ability), the ideals commonly get lost in the stress that balancing the different aspects of your life, and homework becomes more of a burden than a helper. You mentioned that homework benefits teachers, but I would have to differ. Homework does show teachers whether the material is clear or not, but it creates extra work for them (as well as the students). Now they not only have mountains of classwork, tests, and projects to grade, they have to grade daily homework as well. This is more evidence why even just limiting the amounts of homework would be beneficial. As for benefiting the nation, you yourself mentioned that the issue we have does not lie within homework, but rather within emphasis on athleticism. In that way, homework is unrelated, and not the fix for the issue: stronger emphasis on education through something such as more personalised learning is.",

            "conclusion": "Homework Should Be Abolished",
            "premise": "Time for the final round, the rebuttal round. Let me tell you what happened in this debate. Firstly, I told you that homework is beneficial in moderate amounts. My opponent then tried to rebut this argument, saying that \u201cmoderate is a relative term, and how can you ensure that this MODERATE happens\u201d however, I have already answered this, I regard moderate as one or two pieces of small homework due in two or three days and the occasional large coursework or studying for a test. Furthermore, the title of this debate is \u201cHomework Should Be Abolished\u201d, not \u201cHomework Should Be Regulated\u201d. Ensuring that \u201cmoderate happens\u201d is irrelevant. Also, just because some teachers can be mean and give large amounts of homework doesn\u2019t mean all homework should be banned. That is a rather extreme response to such a small thing, don\u2019t you think? I think so. Also, my worthy opponent said that \u201cany benefits homework might have given a child doesn't work as the child won't have done the homework because there isn't enough time in their schedule\u201d, however, as I have already shown you, moderate amounts will allow the child to do the homework. My opponent then tried to tell you that homework is time consuming, it can put unnecessary pressure on a student, and the student doesn't always do the homework. However, I have already answered the first point, as I have kept saying \u201cin moderate amounts\u201d which my opponent keeps brushing aside with a few remarks. Furthermore, my opponent said \u201cpupils will have to wake up early in the morning at say, 6:00 just to get to school on time\u201d, however, it takes an average of 45 minutes-> 1 hour to get ready. Taking the latest time, the student will be able to get to school at 7:00. Normally, school starts at 8:30, is there really no local school, and it takes 1 hour and a half to get to school!? Also, my opponent gave the example of a schedule. She gave the times 6:00am->9:00pm at the latest. If the student has such an extreme schedule such as this, the student is clearly overworking him/herself and should consider dropping a few extra-curriculars. But the majority of students don\u2019t have such extreme schedules such as this. My opponent\u2019s second point, again, has been rebutted as most schools don\u2019t give out heaps of homework, merely moderate amounts. My opponent\u2019s third point, however, is an extreme case. How many student\u2019s parents would do their work for them? Not many. The majority of parents are responsible, and would therefore make the child do their homework themselves. Your case is an extreme case, and not the majority, so your argument doesn\u2019t hold much credibility. Then I went on to tell you that homework enables school days to be shorter. Once again, my worthy opponent tried to rebut my argument. She said that \u201cAlso, teachers are known for giving their students a review sheet to do in class so they can be sure a student has fully grasped the concept. With this structure, homework is made obsolete. Therefore, a school day would simply remain the same length as homework would become non-existent.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t answer my point at all. She has claimed that with a review sheet in class, homework is made obsolete, so the school days would remain the same length. However, what about all the coursework and studying done at home, not to mention all the finished classwork. We can\u2019t guarantee the student will do it. So my opponent has not properly addressed my point. After all, one measly review sheet can\u2019t add up to work being done at home. In Round 3, my opponent tried to tell you that there is no need for homework and children can still work at home. To back up her point, my opponent tried to use my own source against me. She pointed out that \u201cThe value of homework has been the subject of various research studies over the years, yet there is still no conclusive evidence that it makes a big difference in helping students improve achievement. The most often-cited studies are those that conclude that there is virtually no evidence that it helps in elementary school but some evidence that it does improve academic performance in later grades. Yet this newest study looked at 10th graders and found no correlation\u201d, but very conveniently didn\u2019t emphasize a point in there, if you take a closer look, you will find in that quote these words \u201cbut some evidence that it does improve academic performance in later grades\u201d, so in fact, my opponent is helping my case, and supporting my case! Then, in the second part of my worthy opponent\u2019s quote, she said \u201cResearchers who looked at data from more than 18,000 10th-graders found there was little correlation between the time students spent doing homework and better grades in math and science courses.\u201d However, if you continue reading the article she found this from, (https://www.washingtonpost.com...,) you will find these words \u201cBut,according to a study on the research, they did find a positive relationship between standardized test performance and the amount of time spent on homework.\u201d As you can see, my opponent is cherry-picking from the article, choosing quotes which support her case, but leaving out the rest if it points otherwise. My opponent then went on to say that students can do work by themselves. However, let\u2019s be honest. How many of us would actually do that? How many of us, would, if given the choice, do work at home? Not many of us. Not I, and probably, not you. So homework must be mandatory to get things done. As you can see, I have addressed all of my worthy opponent\u2019s points. However, when it came to addressing mine, my opponent fell painfully short. She has not told us why:~homework does not have benefits, merely why the benefits are obsolete, which I have rebutted~there is not work done at home such as classwork, studying, and coursework that take up a lot of time collectively~students would do work at home given the choice, and teachers could trust them to do it and not have to stretch the school day So now, I will leave you with a quote to think over:\"Nothing is more powerful for your future than being a gatherer of good ideas and information. That's called doing your homework.\" -Jim Rohn",

The opposing side says that students will have a much better time without it but in fact, it will result to a reverse effect or exacerbate the situation more. I say this because what do most of the students do or most teenagers for that matter do after school? For those few who have clubs and are to the athletic side may go out under the sun and take in vitamin D but that is not the case for the other half (or majority to point out). Most teenagers really just stay home and fidget with their phones and computers. Im trying to say that they still stay and sit at home anyway. And it's not the homework's fault that makes most students couch potatoes. I would also like to point out that homework comes in different forms. Physical education or biology class can tell you to practice volleyball skills or go outside and observe nature and their process of photosynthesis. I also believe that students can't only do what they want to do. In life and especially in work, they will have to face the things they dont want to do. For example, writing a thesis or doing a project. It will help students in abasing themselves in order for them not to have a self-indulgent mind. Homework can really help a student be more organized and responsible as well as learn life lessons. In addition to the knowledge gained at the end of the day.",

Instead I feel school should be 8 hours a day and no homework after. In this point of my argument I will use facts and evidence to prove homework is not an asset to the Educational System but instead a pitfall. Now I won't say some homework is bad like what isn't finished in class is taken to be finished at home, but I will say the education system has not done that. Instead they overbear children with 3 or 4+ hours of homework a night. In doing so children lose a great deal on daylight outside, family planned events, sports, and the overall experiences of being a child. ,\"too much homework may diminish its effectiveness or even become counterproductive,\"writes Cooper in his latest research review [Harris Cooper, The Battle Over Homework, second edition, page 26, and Does Homework Improve Academic Achievement? A Synthesis of the Research 1987\"2003, the Review of Educational Research (Spring 2006)]. Most teachers do not take courses specifically on homework during teacher training. In fact, research shows that the great majority are unaware of the research on the problems with homework [Stephen Aloia,\"Teacher Assessment of Homework,\" Academic Exchange Quarterly (Fall 2003)]. That\"s why, as Cooper told the authors of The Case Against Homework, when it comes to homework,\"most teachers are winging it.\" I feel to avoid the situation of what is too much or too little we should merely just lose homework altogether. If children went to school eight hours a day they wouldn't have anything to bring home for homework anyways. Then they have all the time in the world to do as they please, like being children.",

            "premise": "As pro said or quoted, some people can do well at homework and it helps them, yet there are those that homework harms them because they can't do that well as those who excel. Which makes them feel bad which makes them fall down from other classes. Moving on; Another one of the many harms of homework is family time. Kids spend around 8 hours in school, when they get home it\"s around 4 o\"clock. Then they have to do homework which can take up to two hours, more if the student resists. Then they have dinner which is stressed if the child resisted on homework, because the child and parent might both be done with each other. Then they have to go to bed. The site \"Educational Leadership,\" states \"Homework squeezes family life. All parents have educational agendas for their children. They want to pass on their cultural heritage, religious beliefs, and important life skills. They want to teach their children how to be good citizens and how to share in the responsibilities of running a home. More homework makes parents put their own agendas on hold even as they often struggle to help their children cope with homework assignments. Additionally, families need time to constitute themselves as families. According to a 1998 survey by Public Agenda, nearly 50 percent of parents reported having a serious argument with their children over homework, and 34 percent reported homework as a source of stress and struggle. Parents often have conflicting feelings about homework, viewing it as a way for their children to succeed but also as imposing serious limits on family time.\" This also raises another point of view about family issues. Many kids and parents have \"heated,\" arguments about homework. Lets say that a student gets home and they don\"t want to do his/her homework. Then the parent tells them they have to better get it done now or they're going to lose privileges. So now the kid\"s mad and the parent\"s feeling frustrated at the kid, and now they have to sit down and do homework together for over an hour. Which won\"t go well, for either of them. Then from this point it could lead to bad feelings between them which could separate them .",

Homework isn't that beneficial, I wouldn't like if a teacher just slams paper on the table demanding you to do your projects and bringing it back next week. Here's your response or what you are saying in your head ' This kid is just lazy children in America these days are just lazy that's all they don't want extra practice' NOT TRUE!! A statement like that is false and you know it is. The reason children aren't doing homework is not because of laziness that's 1. 2. Children have other curriculum activities other than home work you know, and teacher don't understand that it isn't that easy to go to after school, end at 6:00 and then expect so much homework to be done. Homework is just a lazy way of teachers to give an excuse that they don't want to do a lesson. 3. Many adults who haven't finished school are like 'I did homework when I was young so should they' That's not true this is just like saying 'I starved when I was young so should my child' 4. Mainly children already have 8 hours of school, added with extra curriculum. Would you like to be doing 5 projects at 9:00 PM? I know how it feels because I just had 8 homework assignments. No you don't. I bet you people against this is like 'Oh he's a whiney baby' and ' Oh he just another spoiled one' I am just taking my personal experience People just get stuff off the internet that says homework is helpful and crap and that kids get smarter. Some websites say that but its not true at all if that's the case many children in my class would be as smart as me so your really playing yourself from getting things online as proof that home work is helpful but its not true Its better to get a person inside the situation",

            "premise": "Thanks Danielle! Observations OBV1: My opponent is affirming a change in the status quo meaning that my role is to defend the status quo. My opponent\u2019s burden in this debate is to show why the status quo should be changed and as a result of this they hold the burden of proof. Since my opponent holds the burden of proof here, I will not be providing a constructive case. I will merely be refuting my opponent\u2019s case. OBV2: Voters ought to vote pro if, by the end of the debate, they found Pro\u2019s case more convincing than mine. Voters ought to vote Con if, by the end of the debate, I have managed to refute my opponent\u2019s arguments (and therefore proven that the status quo is better than my opponent\u2019s proposed change). Counterplan I will be producing a counterplan upon the resolution. This counterplan will allow me to advance my burden and win the debate but by making a minor alteration to the status quo (and therefore giving me a small share of the BOP to defend it). The Center for Public Education (CPE) produced a balanced report showing both sides to the debate on the necessity of homework. The conclusion that they made was that homework can be bad and get rid of children\u2019s motivation when it is given in high quantity. Homework in moderate quantity produces better effects. With this information being considered, I present the following syllogism: P1: Too much homework is negative. P2: Homework in moderate quantity is positive. C1: Homework should be given in moderate quantity. This simple counterplan advances my burden and also improves the system of homework since it negates the arguments regarding stress, loss of motivation, etc. [Rebuttals] Point 1 My opponent\u2019s report collected data from 14 - 26 years ago [3]. The system of education in all countries has changed since then [2]. As well as the data being largely outdated it is also very limited, in that it only analyzed 0.00000947368% of children [3][4]. This is extremely low and cannot sufficiently prove that homework is a net detriment when 99.99999163742% of the children are excluded from this study. Furthermore, even the article my opponent cites claims that this isn\u2019t a reason to abolish homework - it is merely a reason to change the system [3]. The entire article that my opponent cites next (regarding TIMSS) is contingent on there being heavy homework loads. My counterplan explicitly deals with this issue. In fact the very study my opponent cites states directly after it speaks out the claim that my opponent uses: \u201cThe TIMSS can\u2019t be used to determine if homework is actually helping or hurting academic performance overall. But it can help us see how much homework students are doing, and what conditions are associated with higher national levels of homework.\u201d [5] This conclusively proves that the issue here comes down to homework quantity which is something that is negated already. Point 2 Next my opponent attempts to show that homework places a burden on parents. My opponent fails to explain the impact of this argument which is why it breaks down easily. She states that parents have rebelled and that some parents have gone to court and won. I am confused as to how this advances her burden in this debate. I could easily cite people going to court as proponents of homework and winning. I could easily also show that people have protested as proponents of homework too. It\u2019s a controversial issue - of course there will be people for and against it. That doesn\u2019t contribute or advance your burden in any way. One example is where a boy and his classmates demanded more homework and the parents agreed [6]. This protest negates my opponent\u2019s since this is all they cite to attempt to affirm this point. My opponent\u2019s next paragraph of point 2 is once again contingent on quantity. Homework can cut into family time but given that my counterplan specifically reduces the issue of homework in large quantity this point is negated. The same response can be made for the next point regarding the Stanford researcher\u2019s findings. The next sub point regarding the \u201cone mother\u201d is extremely minor and is once again refuted by the counterplan. Additionally, only 10% of parents find that their child receives too much homework (on a national level); 64% find that their children\u2019s homework is \u201cabout the right amount\u201d and 25% believed that their child was not receiving enough homework [7]. This ultimately means that this one scenario that my opponent cites is in the minority and this will be solved under my counterplan regardless. The next reason is precisely why I am introducing the counterplan. I am aware that people may not have the time to dedicate to producing excellent quality homework which is why I introduced the counterplan which (again) refutes the point. My opponent makes the unsourced claim that most of the time parents need to help out their children with homework. I will not be addressing the bare assertion here. If / when my opponent chooses to source this claim I will respond to it. Lastly my opponent claims that it adds an extra burden on to teachers. The fact of the matter is that teachers are paid to mark homework (as well as fulfill their other duties). If homework were to be removed the salaries of teachers would also decline. It is part of the responsibility of a teacher and it is a burden that they accept and are made aware of when they apply for the job. [8] Point 3 My counterplan partially addresses the point regarding too much time being spent however I will expand upon another point I wish to make. My opponent raises the (unsourced) objection of children losing time for activities and rest. Sutton Trust Research concluded that 76% of children of all backgrounds do a range of out of school activities [9]. This shows that an overwhelming majority of people manage to do homework alongside creative and physical activities (and this statistic only refers to out of school activities). Next my opponent talks about a hateful relationship regarding learning being an issue. This article specifically references to the quantity (which my counterplan addresses). In the conclusion it even recommends that homework should be given in smaller quantities as this is ideal and will help them to learn and to have time to do activities that will help to benefit them [10]. My opponent also lists many things that are beneficial such as sports, artwork and playtime. All 3 of these things are taught / applied at most schools [11]. With this information alongside the statistic that 76% of children participate in out of school activities this point is successfully refuted. Point 4 Again, the review my opponent cites in an attempt to prove that homework results in the loss of sleep, self esteem and childhood is refuted by the counterplan as it once again references to excessive homework and homework taking up valuable time from children. Voters should NOT buy my opponent\u2019s claim that it encourages cheating and creates a gap between the intelligent and academically struggling because this is once again bare assertion on my opponent\u2019s behalf. Afterwards, my opponent quotes Alfie Kohn in an attempt to show that there is a better alternative to homework. The problem is that the proposed change can be done within the status quo, thus making it unnecessary to ban homework. Involving students in decisions about assignments can be done within school and then the assignment can be set once those decisions have been made - this can and does happen [12]. In the final paragraph my opponent quasi-concedes. She says: \u201cAs such, we can improve the status quo by asking students the best way to reinforce what they have learned in class. While this might include some work from home, it probably won't look like the standard version of homework that is uniform, repetitive and monotonous.\u201d She says that the improvement might involve some work from home. My opponent attempts to distinguish this from homework by saying that homework is uniform, repetitive and monotonous whereas her work from home idea will not be. The fact is that homework is simply defined as: \u201cschoolwork that a pupil is required to do at home.\u201d [13]. Meaning that my opponent\u2019s proposition falls under the definition of homework and is therefore, in essence, a concession. To conclude, my opponent is unable to provide any good reason as to why homework should be banned. At best she manages to show that homework (at its current state) can be slightly excessive and can take away time from students. My counterplan addresses this and even if it didn\u2019t, this isn\u2019t a valid reason to ban homework, as this issue can be resolved within the status quo. On multiple occasions she fails to provide the impact of her contentions. I have successfully refuted my opponent\u2019s points and shown why homework should not remain as a part of the status quo. The resolution is negated. Sources [1] http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org... [2] https://www.oecd.org... [3] http://research.indiana.edu... [4] http://www.gapminder.org...

            "premise": "The amount that we eat doesn't keep on increasing, or else an 80-year old would be eating a lot. The teachers may have been children in their childhood, but 20 years is a long time for academic patterns to change. Teachers may not realize that we are getting too much work, for not all teachers are connected, hence the tiny assignments from many subjects adds up to a nearly impossible challenge. As for homework's importance, what I mean to say is that when there were suppose 5 assignments and my friend did 3, 2 teachers would still scold him, while there is not much praise for doing homework. The person may just give up and realize the futility of working all the time. As you say, Manjul Bhargava is a math genius, and is a good tabla player. But I ask why only he has succeeded? You call for effective time management, but then we have so less time. I reach home at 4:30 pm, and our travel is nearly 1 hour. Also, I am sure even such a genius hasn't won the battle for sleep. I used to sleep at 9, but now I have to extend it to 10 due to extra homework. This would reduce my ability to stay focus, no matter if I wash my face twice. Another reason why homework should be banned is lack of entertainment. More than often, homework involves usage of the mind. While it works well for a while, the continuous work calls for a break.But when we have weekend homework and weekday homework how shall I go watch my favorite movie? Though time management is useful for weekends, weekdays call for all work and no play. And we can't be into work all the time. I often forget about concepts in the 1st lesson when the 10th lesson starts, and once at home I forget everything. True, homework would reinforce my concept, but after sleeping I forget again. Although not everyone has a bad memory as mine, even conceptual learning has to be remembered. Severity of homework is determined by our mind, but most people lack the optimism to take it as a challenge, for who gives challenges everyday? Our schools made for us or we made for schools? We must think outside the horizons of learning, for geniuses like Issac Newton and Einstein did bad at school. You can look at this link to see more famous people who did bad at school but great in life. http://www.onlinecollege.org...",

            "conclusion": "Reduce homework, lengthen schooltime",
            "premise": "My thanks to the esteemed Stephen_Hawkins for accepting this debate; Con need not fear that my terms are Americanised as I am Australian, and the British and Australian school systems are reasonably similar. To clear up 2 uncertainties from R1, teaching will be as normal from 9-5 as per the model outline. On the scope, I\u2019d prefer this remain to higher years where it\u2019s more applicable \u2013 homework reduction + school extension doesn\u2019t work if there\u2019s no homework to reduce, as with younger students! However, I\u2019ll say that all students go from 9-5. However, the amount of free time would be greater for younger students because the homework reduction associated with increased school time does not exist for them; this time is transferred to free time. Let\u2019s not get bogged down on logistics though if possible.Let\u2019s go to arguments.Massed vs. Spaced PresentationOne of education\u2019s main goals is for students to retain what they learn at school \u2013 we ought to prefer systems which result in greater retention of knowledge as it\u2019s a goal for education. For instance, a good test score due to cramming, with the student later forgetting such knowledge is sub-optimal vs. a lower test score yet greater memory retention.How does this relate to the resolution? Being in school encourages spaced presentation, which results in better memory retention.This is all about the \u2018spacing effect\u2019 [1]. This effect details how humans more easily learn / remember things when studied a few times over a longer period of time (spaced presentation) as opposed to repeated study in a shorter timespan (massed presentation). However, and this is key - \"the benefit of spaced presentations does not appear at short retention intervals; that is, at short retention intervals, massed presentation lead to better memory performance than spaced presentations\" . SeeGreene, R.L. (1989). Spacing effects in memory: Evidence for a two-process account. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15(3), 371-377.School via timetabling tends to promote spaced presentation \u2013 lessons are not put back to back to back for the same subject. However, many students might do a mass of homework for a subject in one go because a) Their schedule promotes that, b) They remember as they go (ie. Ex 1. Is a prerequisite for Ex 2. And so remembering Ex 1 helps with Ex 2) along with other reasons. Essentially, students will tend to group together clumps of related homework and do them in go, which is more a form of massed presentation than spaced presentation. Ergo, school, by encouraging spaced presentation under the proposed model through putting \u2018homework\u2019 in class time in effect, is preferable.Homework vs. InstructionOn homework briefly:Much homework is sub-optimal, which can't be helped. Some homework is good but a student doesn't realise it. Some homework is simply beneficial. The issue in evaluating the value of homework is what students do outside of school - for some capable people homework is quite the restriction; many are just wasting their youth on trivialities; homework is good, no matter it's sub-optimal state, for these people.Textbooks are instructional to a point. However, a teacher\u2019s guidance at the ready + a textbook is superior. If a student doesn\u2019t understand their textbook\u2019s example (say, in maths) when doing an exercise (the type of homework being restricted) then they will perform sub-optimally (ie. Very short answers to written questions), waste an inordinate amount of time doing the exercise (vs. doing the exercise then something else productive) or they\u2019ll copy the answers. Some of those are diametrically opposite, but that reflects the student\u2019s beliefs being different. When a student is at school they will seek guidance from the teacher when stuck, eliminating time wastage (\u2018inordinate\u2019). They will have greater difficulty copying answers due to teacher supervision. They will be pushed to perform optimally not just by the teacher, but by their peers \u2013 iron sharpens iron is just as true in education.CostStreamlining students and workers to the same timetable reduces things like day care costs somewhat, debases tuition costs (private tutoring that is) and ensures maximal use of public transport on a wider basis (many buses and trains around school time are less cramped than during peak hours) . More importantly though, parents can work for longer. There\u2019s less concern for parents to be at home, supervising their children, if they can trust that their child is safe and productive at school, vs. potentially the converse at home.Reduction in general mischiefIt\u2019s a fact \u2013 youth disproportionately commit crimes. \u201cA comparison of the proportion of total offenders who were aged 10\u201324 in 2009\u201310 (48%) with the proportion of the general population who were aged 10\u201324 in Australia as at December 2009 (23%), clearly shows the higher proportion of young people in the offender population (graph S13.1).\u201d [2] What do youth have that adults have? A disproportionate amount of unallocated free time, which combined with various rebellious impulses and hormones results in crimes being committed. See the graph in the link for a visual explanation of the aforementioned.A solid school environment and a reduction in this poorly utilised free time (crime is a poor use of time with regards to the collective) will reduce crime. Furthermore, additional schooling increases the ability to get messages out to avoid drugs and the like. Government messages have been effective at reducing drug use, such as smoking [3] [4]. Education is cited as one of the main reasons for this decline in smoking. If we can combat smoking then a more effective message through a safe, controlled environment like school will also reduce illicit drug use, and legal, yet harmful drug use. Longer school hours can help achieve this through better education.Working mindset / Lack of agrarian workforce currentlyWhy did the US and many other countries originally adopt a 9-3 style of schooling? Why did the, now rather ludicrous, idea of summer vacation eventuate in the US? The reason that this occurred was that the US was formerly an agrarian society \u2013 children of agrarian society left school to go work in the field at home. Now we have no such demand on our time other than school. Let me quote YYW from the second link last round:\u201cChildren must be taught the importance of self discipline, the necessity of a strong work ethic and the importance of maximized productivity from birth. I'm not saying that kids should be pushed into the fields or factories, but rather suggesting that all the time wasted in the summer months is the opportunity cost of greater preparation for college, for grad school, for work and for life.\u201dGranted, this debate isn\u2019t about summer vacation, but why not have children work as their parents do? It instills the values of work, the value of free time, presents social mischief (see earlier) and gives children and teenagers a greater appreciation of their parents duties and workload, which increases familial harmony. This mindset in beneficial for future productivity \u2013 another goal of education. ConclusionEncouraging spaced presentation, increasing available instructional assistance, reducing cost, a reduction in crime and social mischief, the development of a working mindset and familial harmony are all good reasons to extend the school day.I eagerly await my opponent\u2019s response.Sources1- http://en.wikipedia.org...2- http://www.abs.gov.au...3- http://www.cancercouncil.com.au...4- http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au...",

            "conclusion": "A Homework Ban Is A Bad Idea",
            "premise": "(I typed up a case, but my browser crashed. Now I have to type it all up again so I am sad. Anyways, Happy Belated New Year!)Once again, I would like to thank the judge(s) and my opponent for putting in the time to make this debate possible.DefinitionAs my opponent states, \"Everybody CAN be wrong.\" This includes our views, such as \"The Earth is round\" and \"The Nazis were bad.\" I am doing nothing to advocate these statements, but we could be wrong despite thinking these are right. Rene Descartes once almost proved that he knew nothing because his sense could be fooling him, he could be in a dream, and an omnipotent being could be deceiving him. [5] This demonstrates the uncertainty of things, so Pro's belief in a \"commonsense defintion\" of \"bad idea\" is fallacious reasoning. I would like to proceed using \"bad idea\" in accordance to the general will.ValueSince the opposition has not provided a value of his own, we agree and are bound upon \"equality\" as our value. There should be no disputes, but I will address Pro's skepticism: read my rebuttal in Round 2. As you can see, my contentions that I use to back up my criterion/value does not apply at all to Pro's belief in a supposed \"Bad Equality.\" The only \"advantages\" I put out are impossible to re-create. This \"Good Equality v. Bad Equality\" is completely not applicable.My Opponent's ArgumentsAcademics v. SocializingWe are not ignoring people's needs. In addition, \"exceptions\" are irrelevant to our debate.Personal ResponsiblityThis is irrelevant. By using equality as a value here, we mean equal opportunity for people to learn. The learning environment should be made equal for everybody. Success is judged by the amount of effort IN this equal environment.College HomeworkMy point was that some college courses do not give homework. I am demonstrating this system and nothing else. My question to the opposition was to ask about his opinion upon this system. He has neglected to answer.Foreign LanguageIf homework was graded, a student with parents who are fluent in that language can pretty much tell all the answers to him/her. This is unfair to other students. Students should be given equal opportunity in an equal learning environment, but of course effort can be put in to guarantee success. The point here is that a Homework Ban would not be a bad idea in this case. Homework regulations are irrelevant because the opposition is supposed to be proving why a Homework Ban IS a bad idea.EssaysThe opposition says, \"The mind can't come up with a quality essay in that short period.\" Who said the essay is supposed to be written in that short period? Students will not necessarily be completed in a single period - contrary to the opposition's assertions. In a class, students can learn and practice. There would be enough time to prepare an assigned essay. In addition, I would like to point out a logical fallacy in the opposition's argument: \"a homework ban prohibits this [deep subject courses], leaving the most gifted to have to take less involved, more boring classes.\" I have already explained how the system after a Homework Ban could work.Homework ReductionTo summarize what Pro believes: More Homework, Less Effort = Less Homework, More Effort. That is not what we are aiming for. What we are trying to do is create an equal environment for students in order for them to determine their own successes through efforts. A learning environment based on equality is not the same as equalizing efforts. What is more important is equalizing the workloads for an equal leanring environment. If work is done at home, as in homework, there is room for inequality as shown in my contentions that I will restate later.Effort in SchoolworkWithout homework, teachers will be able to monitor students doing work. This is beneficial to diagnosing what the student is having trouble in. Nothing is difficult to implement there. If a kid was taunted for being \"stupid\" in the hallway, he/she will attempt to improve upon himself/herself. To do that, the kid will want to ask the teacher a question. If not, then while doing schoolwork, the teacher will see it and help.The NCLB Act coupled with a Homework Ban will result in teachers being more aware of how students are doing with subjects through schoolwork. Even if the kids don't talk to the teachers, the teachers will still see the trouble spots. The teacher will see the points that the students missed. This is actually more efficient. A Homework Ban is the best of both worlds.StressIf stress impacts whether or not you can follow along with the material in class as the opposition claims, then if the student does poorly, the teacher can catch it and quickly pay greater attention on him/her so that the student can catch up with the learning that might have been missed. This will take away distractions easily. Anyways, a more interactive teacher will have no problem getting students involved in learning instead of these distractions, and these are the teachers we are pushing for. Barack Obama, the president of the United States, has pledged to provide better quality education. His education policy includes hiring better teachers, and these are the kinds of teachers we are looking for who will make the classroom a more interactive environment. [6]The problem, though, is that there ARE distractions at home despite this \"personal responsibility\" material that is irrelevant.Using this, I can say: School = No Distractions, Home = Distractions. What should we opt for?Missing the PointI understand my opponent's point, but he has no evidence whatsoever to back up his IEP contention. As I have stated previously, schoolwork is the efficient way to judge whether a student is having trouble or not. With homework and its many factors (that I will re-address in my KVI), it is too unreliable to determine a student's real problem.Key Voting Issues/Contentions (KVI)The criterion I provide is that students should be given equal opportunity to do well in school.Homework is subject to many factors, which are my original contentions: Academic Dishonesty Time Money These are the supposed \"advantages\" that many students have other others, making homework very unequal.From this, it is possible to say that a Homework Ban is not be a bad idea. It would ban this \"inequality\" so that we can provide a more equal learning environment for students, supporting my criterion. ConclusionThe opposition has neglected to respond to most of my rebuttals in Round 2. He has also not sufficiently attacked my side, so a Homework Ban is still not a bad idea. Additionally, he has not supported our agreed value of \"equality\" very much. My opponent has also not provided a criterion to work towards. His contentions do little to support his side of the debate that states a Homework Ban is a bad idea. Especially without sources/evidence to back up any of his claims, I believe these are grounds to claim that the negation (Con) has won the debate.I stand in the firmest negation of this resolution, that people are not strictly against a Homework Ban, and I urge the judge(s)/voter(s) to agree and vote accordingly.Thank you very much. Have a nice day.[5] http://oregonstate.edu...[6] http://www.whitehouse.gov...;",

            "premise": "first in this debate we are just talking about homeowrk hinders leaarning not an abundance therefore it shouldnt matter how much, just homework period. I know how hard it is when your parents arent able to help you especially for foriegn language and math but we still learn on our own. and yes we do use internet for examples I mean do you really use google to actually do your homework, no, you get your ?'s answered but your still doing it yourself thus learning on your own with technology. and no one can use plagerism so we just ask for answers we get them but we learn at the same time and im pretty sure your parents dont just give you the answer they show you how to get it or explain it, therefore your learning. I dont know about you but I think almost every teenager does something fun on the weekend if they arent restricted by parents (like grounded for example) even if they have homework. I mean we wouldnt be debating this right now if you werent busy doing homework now, this is for fun (basically)... even if they can't do it for long they still have time because I dont know about over there but here we would have friday saturday and sunday to get all the work done so thats plenty of time thats atleast 48 and 10 hours of free time... I dont think homework takes that long therefore you still can find time to be a teenager Although homework may be tough and overbearing it helps you to know what you are learning and to know how to do it in the future because its practice. Plus not everyone tries, thats why teachers give homework to make sure we are doing it and to make sure we understand what they are teaching because if we didnt understand then how would they know what he/she is doing wrong without our concent.?",

            "conclusion": "THBT Homework should not be given out to students.",
            "premise": "Students are not meant to \"learn\" from homework. Homework is assigned to students to review a topic they've already learned previous to the assignment, and those students are expected to complete the assignment or review of what they've learned. This is only beneficial to a student, because homework is usually a sufficient study tool, mostly in preparation for various quizzes or tests. A study on this topic was actually conducted at East Carolina University by Department of Economics Professor, Dr. Nick Rupp. (Statistics on this study can be found at: https://blog.ecu.edu...) Dr. Rupp had separated the students in his class into two groups, each decided by a coin flip. One group was assigned a specific homework assignment which would count for 10% of their upcoming test grade, and the other group was assigned the same assignment but it was completely optional and had no score effect on the test. In conclusion of this test, Dr. Rupp noted that the group of students required to do the homework had \"performed a half-letter grade better, on average...\" Another notable point to his conclusion was that the majority of the group of students in the group required to do the homework had scored B's on the test, while the majority of students in the group with the optional homework had students with the majority of C grades. Dr. Rupp did indeed acknowledge that students in both groups had received grades of A's, but the major differences were in the B's and C's group. Another study conducted by the Associated Press in January of 2006 found that about 57% of parents thought their children had been assigned enough homework, another 23% of parents thought their students were given too little homework, and the final 19% had thought that it was too much. This shows that 81% of parents either agree with the amount of homework their child receives, or requested more homework for their students. A third study conducted by MetLife in 2007 concluded that 87% of parents interviewed had said that homework had given them an opportunity to talk with and bond with their children. In the same study conducted, 78% of parents interviewed had said that homework did not interfere with family time together, and 71% of parents interviewed had said that homework was not a major source of stress in their child. (Statistics for these studies are found at: http://www.sedl.org...) In a series of 35 studies, 77% of these studies had shown a positive correlation between a student's homework completion and academic achievement. This correlation is seen mostly in Junior High and High School students, and is hard to prove either way with Elementary School students. The National PTA and the NEA have created a parent guide named: \"Helping Your Child Get the Most Out of Homework\". This guide states that \"Most educators agree that for children in grades K-2, homework is more effective when it does not exceed 10-20 minutes each day; older children, in grades 3-6, can handle 30-60 minutes each day; in junior and senior high, the amount will vary by subject...\" In the same study, the learning of a student in grades 3-6 does not diminish from homework unless it exceeds approximately 90 minutes. The learning of high school students is not diminished by homework until it reaches between 90-150 minutes. (These facts were gathered from: https://today.duke.edu...) These are just a couple of examples paired with their sources of correlations between homework and academic achievement. With multiple studies coming to this conclusion of the correlation, and a study showing that parents feel that the amount of homework their child receives is adequate, or too little. That same study also shows that parents do not feel that homework violates family time. With the evidence coming from these studies, it proves that there is almost certainly a positive correlation between time spent on homework and academic achievement. Therefore, I use this to support the negation (Con) case of this argument, stating firmly that homework should indeed be given to students. I'm supporting this side of the argument using academic achievement, family (specifically parent) interviews, and previous experiences with homework, as well as various studies on the topic. Thank you for hearing (and actually reading this much of) my case of this argument.",

            "premise": "Like you I am also in year 10, going into year 11, but I live in Scotland so it's S3 going into S4. So here in Scotland the work in School and the work at home is very different. School work is usually more for learning, so most of the lesson the teacher is talking to the class, explaining concepts, then for maybe 15 minutes at the end the class would put what they have learnt into practice. Homework is not for learning, it is for practicing, this allows for the student to fully practice and understand what they have learnt in class so that the next time they go to class they can move on and actually use the teachers expertise and spend their in-class time on learning, not on revision. Now onto countering some of the points you made: Firstly \"it is stressful\". Well let's imagine that you go through school with no stress, when you get a job or go to college/uni you all of a sudden have to meet strict deadline, all very stressful. My point is exposure to stress is not necessarily a bad thing, sure too much of it can be harmful, but the stress caused by homework can actually help you learn to deal with stress before you are put into a real life situation where people are dependent on you (which is much more stressful). You then said \"it takes away from free time\". What is more important? Understanding and getting better at school work or playing Call of Duty. For me, along with many others, the answer is the former. School in general takes away from free time, but that's no reason not to attend school. Another point you mentioned was to do with IQ. As far as I know IQ is something that is fixed from birth, therefore of course homework isn't going to affect it, nothing will. And finally (because it would take me too long to counter everything) you said \"It can negatively affect performance\". I believe it could go either way - if you are good at managing your time efficiently then I believe it will have a very positive impact on your knowledge and understanding. Reading your closing paragraph I believe we have found a middle ground - I have no respect for teachers who give meaningless homework, I completely agree that meaningless, unmarked homework is a waste of time. Luckily for me I rarely get issued such homework (when I do, it is usually from a substitute teacher). However I believe that homework when issued effectively and marked afterwards is very beneficial for students.",

Math hurts the Brain:I ask the audience to please take a look at the research:\"The latest research shows that even the thought of arithmetic can trigger a physical reaction that looks a lot like pain in the brain.\"[3]\"...they noticed increased activity in the dorso-posterior insula (INSp), the fold of tissue in the brain that is activated when a person experiences physical pain like burning his hand...It\u2019s also the area that lights up in response to severe social rejection such as a bad romantic breakup, which can result in symptoms of physical pain as well.\"[3]Furthermore, anxiety caused by math disrupts memory in the brain:\"Worries about math can disrupt working memory, which students could otherwise use to succeed. Beilock and other scholars have studied this impact of anxiety on working memory on older students, but her current work is the first to explore the impact on students as they begin school.\"[4]\" \u201cEarly math anxiety may lead to a snowball effect that exerts an increasing cost on math achievement by changing students\u2019 attitudes and motivational approaches towards math, increasing math avoidance, and ultimately reducing math competence,\u201d Beilock writes in the article.\"[4]2. Math causes Brain Damage:Math causes anxiety and stress in students, and homework can only make it worse.Late-night math homework often leads to sleep deprivation. Recent studies show that sleep deprivation causes permanent brain damage:\"In mice, prolonged lack of sleep led to 25% of certain brain cells dying, according to a study in The Journal of Neuroscience.\"[5]Stress, another manifestation from math homework, also damages the brain. Doing math homework on a regular basis, therefore, can cause chronic stress:\"Long-term stress damages the brain, impairing everything from emotion and impulse control to certain big-picture analytical thinking. \u201cIn essence, with chronic stress, you become more primitive,\u201d says Amy Arnsten, professor of neurobiology at Yale University.\"[6] 3. Homework Not Necessary Anyway: A study in 2012 showed that homework is not beneficial to students: \"Researchers in Australia discovered that hitting the books at home offered no real benefit to children, and only slightly helped junior high students.\"[7]More research confirmed these findings:\"First, no research has ever found a benefit to assigning homework (of any kind or in any amount) in elementary school.\"[8]\"even at the high school level, the research supporting homework hasn\u2019t been particularly persuasive. There does seem to be a correlation between homework and standardized test scores, but (a) it isn\u2019t strong, meaning that homework doesn\u2019t explain much of the variance in scores, (b) one prominent researcher, Timothy Keith, who did find a solid correlation, returned to the topic a decade later to enter more variables into the equation simultaneously, only to discover that the improved study showed that homework had no effect after all\"[8]Homework effectiveness is \"least tenuous - with math\":\"when homework is related to test scores, the connection tends to be strongest \u2014 or, actually, least tenuous \u2014 with math.\" [8]Conclusion:Math homework is unnecesary and causes brain damage, so it should therefore be made illegal.

Like I said some careers entitle sacrificing your time outside of work to finish a project or papers, and that's the one thing that Homework teaches you at a very young age, the responsibility of sacrifing time and putting effort into something to better your future. I mean I actually never did homework as a kid, never like too, so I can see where the extra half-hour would be beneficial, but I've also grown up alot to see what the schools were really trying to teach. So to take away that factor of homework is slowly taking away from a preparing a kid for the future, which I'm not for sure about the UK but in the US, is a major issue, kids are lacking the discipline as it is, to take away more of the responsibility would be a bigger setback then you realise.",

            "premise": "First I would like to say that no one enjoys homework, but that's life, no one enjoys doing work after work. Although I do agree with the homework being stressful, we can see that it's worth it in the long run. I cant really say that we do learn from homework, its practice. The teacher teaches you the subject chapter ect. They give us homework so we can practice what we just learn to see if we are doing it correctly, or if we are doing something wrong, and we remember how to do it because we practice it so much, and if we dont get what the teach just taught us we can look at homework and ask the teach or another student who may explain it better. homework enables us to get a better understanding and much more practice for the future so we actually know what we have to do besides hearing it come from the teach. It's almost the end of the school year and this is when all the projects start popping up: english: grammar book spanish: poster about little me geometry: art project on triangles world history: italian renaissance art on top of all that I do speech and debate and cross country and science olympiad (after school activities) I get home around 430 do homework till about 830... but on thuesdays and thursdays i go to all state band from 6to10... though may days seem very busy I still find time to manage my stress levels Teachers don't know are daily routine after school, they give us homewrok because they dont want to see us fail they want us to succed... It's our fault if we do some sort of after school activity therefore not giving us enough time to do homework but teachers know that if we want to be somewhere in our lives we would do the work no matter how much it is And going to bed is the matter if you do or not and what time you do... I dont go to bed till really late because well I study because I want to be correct on what im doing and i want to be able to remember what im learning for tests and stuff... And i get up really early 4oclock, to run because although school may be a drag I find time to do what I love (I run) even if its at a horrible time, but im still alive and kicking and I never feel tired (but thats just me) homework is a good impact to us kids",
