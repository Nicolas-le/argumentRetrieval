            "premise": "Enacting more gun laws in the United States would not stop crimes or dangerous situations from occurring. In fact, according to the National Academy of Sciences, Justice Department, there is no apparent link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence, or even accidents with guns. Creating such laws would not stop criminals from committing crimes. As John R Lott, the author of \"More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws\", stated in 1998, \"States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest drops in violent crimes\". In other words, increasing the number of guns did not increase the rate of violent crimes but instead decreased. With this, it is clear that people should be able to own guns because doing so prevents more crimes from occurring than actual gun laws. University of Chicago Press. (1998). Interview with John R. Lott, Jr. Retrieved March 28, 2018, from http://press.uchicago.edu... WND. (2004, December 30). Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies.

Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly. The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation. According to the Los Angeles times, author Patt Morrison states in his article that was posted on August 2, 2017 that Americans who carry \"heat\" increase the rate of violent crime. After reviewing these articles and doing research it is clear to me that armed civilians are more likely to cause dangerous situations rather than protecting theirselves or others. 1.)

More gun control law enforcement is what is needed to prevent these tragedies. These laws are key to stopping tragedies that would occur in a no gun control world. In your world, a world without gun control, it would make it easy to obtain guns for any person. Whether they be a hunter or a killer. So why should there be no gun control laws? Also your \"evidence\" states that when gun control laws are enacted violence goes up, but you refuse to give the \"why\" to that argument. My evidence provides the reason why gun violence increases, and that reason is poverty. My stats directly answer yours for this fact. --- On your conclusion: Your first point says that poverty does not have any relation to gun violence. Again, that has been disproved by my stats and your own statement. Poverty is a leading cause to gun violence, and cutting down on gun violence the key reason for enacting gun control laws. On your second point I have an empirical example. England has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and their gun violence is extremely low per capita. Also, I sight Canada's 1977 gun control laws (see above argument) and show that Canada's gun violence is also extremely small per capita. On your third point, you have not proven why no gun control leads to less gun violence because you do not provide the \"why\" in your arguments. Saying that more armed citizens prevents gun violence is a falsehood. Look at Canada and England. --- So voters do not look to PoeJoe's logical non-sequiturs, but look to the empirical evidence that I have provided.",

Gun control is not the ban of guns. It's the \"regulation of the selling, owning, and use of guns\". The pro side has yet to prove that the regulation of the selling, owning, and use of guns is pointless and stupid. If you were to vote for pro, you would be saying that we should not regulate people with guns. That is beyond stupid. Gun control isn't taking guns away, it's making sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands. One more thing I would like to point out, pro never proved that EVEN BANNING GUNS was a bad idea. He just asserted. I'm not saying we should ban guns, actually, quite the opposite. Voting con is saying we should keep regulations of guns. Thank You",

That is irrelevant to this debate. Perhaps in addition to loosening gun control laws, we should also help impoverished cities that so happen to be riddled with gun violence. However, this is irrelevant. 2. You said it yourself. America is different. We shoot each other a hell of a lot more than other countries do. Perhaps it's the culture, or the media, or whatever Moore is pointing his (huge) fingers at at the time being. But it still should be known that we are different with gun violence. I agree, when some other countries (besides Switzerland and Germany) increase their gun control, gun violence does go down. However, all the statistics that are relevant to America, show that less gun control means less gun violence. 3. True at the extent of I-am-not-sure-of-why. As stated above, ask Michael Moore. However, I do know that what I say is true. All the evidence backs me up. Less gun control means less gun violence. ---- Now your turn: In your conclusion, find statistics that show that more gun control leads to less gun violence in America. I'd love to see it. ---- MidnightSpecial will probably not do the above requested. He has a knack at floating around the issues and making decent points out of that. However, given already three chances, he has never managed to dispute the fact that less gun control means less gun violence. If you support gun violence, then by all means, vote for MidnightSpecial.

Therefore, I will provide my rebuttals and my arguments in this round.ArgumentsOf course, gun control is a quite controversial issue. However, I will stand with the Liberal views on guns. I do not quite understand why Conservatives always claim that Liberals want to take their guns away. That is not what they want. The Liberals simply want to put regulations in place to ensure that criminals do not obtain a gun or another dangerous weapon. This is common sense. This is logic. The second amendment protects the individual's right to bear arms. It is indeed true that basic weapons for self-defense are acceptable, but I do not believe the amendment to be valid in other respects. \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" [1] We no longer have a need for a militia due to a risilient and couragous United States Military. Also, I will point out the amendment's original intention. At the time of the Constitution's framing, there were still many issues in the country. An issue was the lack of a strong military force. Due to this lack, the founders decided citizens need to be able of defending themselves. I agree with this view, but you cannot deny that an AK-47 in a typical American household is excessive. If you want a gun for self-defense, buy a pistol. Or, even better, obtain a dog. Dogs are better defense that guns. There are many ways the amendment can be interpreted, but I will point out that it has been misinterpreted for quite some time. I will rewrite the amendment in the way many citizens interpret it:\"A well regulated mob, being necessary to the security of a free people, the right of the people to keep and bear any arms at all, shall never be denied.\" Deny what I just wrote. Please, I welcome the debate. I don't, however, want to hear anything based on misinterpretations. I want facts, which many people opposing gun control surely lack. \"It is an absolute truism that law-abiding, armed citizens pose no threat to other law-abiding citizens.\" [2] Not all Americans are law-abiding. Due to the lack of sophisticated gun control, the crime rate in the United States has increased by a considerable amount. May I ask, why do Conservatives always bring up that gun control is taking away guns from law-abiding citizens but not criminals? This is completely unfounded and illogical. When a background check occurs on a law-abiding citizen, there will be no issues and he or she will obtain the weapon. A law-breaker will have a record and these will be shown in the background checks, thus ensuring he does not obtain a weapon. \"The rate of U.S. violent crime went up last year for the first time in nearly two decades due to a jump in assaults...\" [3] The second amendment must be enforced, but it must not be misinterpreted. There are multiple methods of regulating guns. I would like to focus on background checks, limited ammunition, and the regulation of gun production. Background checks should be expanded so that we can ensure that people with a history of crime and/or mental illness do not receive a gun. Alongside background checks, there should be limited ammunition. What if the background checks were conducted incorrectly? What if this person did in fact have a history of crime and planned to use his new rifle to kill innocent children at a school? Each magazine should include a limited amount of ammunition, depending on the exact type of weapon and the damage level of the ammunition. Also, the level of gun production should be reduced.Let me ask: While this crime is occuring, are you simply going to do nothing? If you are not going to enact gun control, what are you going to do? Are you going to arm children? Are you going to place security everwhere? This shall not work. I would like for you to view the bellow link:http://www.nationmaster.com...Germany is a nation with grandiose gun control measures. The United States is not. The crime rate, of course, is much, much lower in Germany, the nation I happen to come from. Do not ignore that. This is critical. Rebuttals\"The biggest thing is that gun control is not effective and if enforced at a larger level, it will continue to be ineffective. It has been proven that criminals will always be able to get their hands on guns no matter what. Here is a scenario proving this: The five US cities with the strictest gun control laws are New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, and Washington D.C. These are also the five cities in the US with the most murders by shooting. All that gun control does here is take guns away from law abiding citizens. If people in these cities had guns to defend themselves, there would not be as many murders.\"I essentially refuted this already. Gun control does not prevent law-abiding citizens from obtaining a gun. Tell me, what does \"background checks\" mean? It means that individuals will look through your record. If you have a history of crime and/or mental illness, you chance of getting a gun is slim. If you are law-abiding, there will be no issues. \"Also, gun control would not be good for businesses or the economy.\" Where is the proof of this? \"For example, if background checks were put in place, it would take longer for people to purchase firearms. This would slow down sales for the business owner and they might have trouble paying bills. In addition, if gun control was put in place, guns would be sold on the black market.\" My opponent has not proven that gun control has a direct impact on the economy. He will need to do so for this point to be valid. Are you simply going to allow criminals to get a gun that easily, completely without background checks? I find this to be representative of stupidity. \"Scenario: magazine size is limited, so assault rifles are now being sold on the black market. And who buys off the black market? Criminals do. I believe that the less items that are sold on the black market, the better.\" Again, this point may likely be true, but my opponent must prove so. The gun control system, of course, is flawed. However, it can change. There needs to be comprehensive gun control put into place. There must be a progressive reform of the gun industry. For me to be convinced otherwise, my opponent would need to prove that gun control has a direct negative influence on the economy, that gun control causes higher crime rates, and that gun control is simply ineffective. I am not convinced yet. 1. http://www.archives.gov...;2. http://www.lectlaw.com...;3. http://edition.cnn.com...;",

Making it incredibly difficult to attain a gun. Background checks are easy. What I am against is the extraction of any type of gun from the public. As you can see by statistics, it does not have any effect on the gun violence, violent crime, and homicide rates. Let me provide that for you. UK: The UK enacted its handgun ban in 1996. From 1990 until the ban was enacted, the homicide rate fluctuated between 10.9 and 13 homicides per million. After the ban was enacted, homicides trended up until they reached a peak of 18.0 in 2003. Since 2003, which incidentally was about the time the British government flooded the country with 20,000 more cops, the homicide rate has fallen to 11.1 in 2010. In other words, the 15-year experiment in a handgun ban has achieved absolutely nothing. Scotland is basically the same stat except after the gun ban the crime shot up exponentially and has stayed. To give you some more country's, Mexico, Cuba, Japan, England, France, Scotland, and Ireland are all great examples in which gun control has not worked or has not affected anything, at all. Now let me give you examples within the U.S. First of all, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting. It is also recorded in Chicago, that a person is shot every 2.8 hours despite the intense gun restriction. As well as Washington D.C., which has a similar stat.",

            "premise": "Closing Argument If we zoom out from the debate and look at the arguments in whole we see a clear picture. Gun control laws do not provide for a safer society. This is shown through multiple ways, either with honest comparables looking at violent crime and homicide rate, or crime trends before and after enacted laws. When compared with other countries using actual comparable populations, you find the United States is roughly in the middle of all developed nations for gun violence, or homicide rate. You can also see how violent crime has risen in areas where gun control has been enacted throughout the world. The simple fact that there has been a near 50% increase in guns owned in the United States since 1993, and an over 50% decrease in gun homicides shows that it is not the guns being the problem. You are safer with a gun than without one. In fact as most studies have shown you are 43 to 260 times more likely to defend yourself with a gun than be killed by one. Taking the gun out of your hand won\u2019t take the gun out of the criminal\u2019s hand. I have shown how the vast majority of criminals obtain their guns illegally, and most stated that they could have obtained an illegal gun if they were unable to purchase one legally. Disarming everyone else in an attempt to disarm the criminal is backward logic. This is also evidenced by countries that have a higher gun ownership have lower violent crime. Mass killings won\u2019t be hindered by gun control. Just turn on the news and you will see that places all over the world, even places where gun control has become gun bans, are having mass killings. Saying these ideological murderers will be stopped by laziness (not being able to buy a gun) is a lazy argument. You might not be able to prevent a radical from acting out radical ideas, but you can arm more citizens to stop them. Our founding fathers made clear the purpose of our 2nd amendment. We must protect our freedoms from anyone who would try and take them, including foreign powers, or domestic tyranny. An armed population is what prevents governmental powers from pushing their ideological pursuits on it\u2019s own people. To drastically reduce what the people can arm themselves with, compared to what the government has at its disposal, is directly contradictory to the 2nd amendment. How does this keep us safe? God forbid we become disarmed, and God forbid the government starts to push it\u2019s agenda, and all who oppose become enemies of the state, and God forbid they make the punishment for non-allegiance to their ideology anything up to and including death. But since history is replete with this exact system of take over, our founding fathers put a check and balance in the face of such unrestrained power, a gun in the hand of the citizen. The left will constantly pick numbers that show biased views, compare apples and oranges in terms of ratios or trends, or flat stats that are sampled from a small population with conclusions inarrivabile from their premises. The truth is, guns are tools. They can be used for good or bad, moral or immoral ends. Gun control is actually an obstruction to the safety of society. Thank you Pro for the debate.

            "premise": "I thank Pro for their response. I will provide a rebuttal and then present some alternate arguments. Pro changes their argument. In Round 1, my opponent states \u201cstrict gun control laws in the United States lead to less murders.\u201d Yet, now in Round 2 they say, \u201cgun control is only a factor in reducing gun crimes.\u201d So which is it? The first quote is what I assumed Pro's position was. The second quote is MY position. If my opponent now wishes to advocate the latter, then we both agree and this debate is now pointless. Pro misquotes my argument. My opponent states at the end of Round 2 that my position is \u201cwe shouldn't have gun laws.\u201d This is not my position. I state very clearly in Round 1 that, \u201cI am not opposed to regulating firearms . . . my goal is to show that merely making stricter gun laws does not by itself decrease gun violence.\u201d Once again, if this is what my opponent now believes, we should delete this debate because we are in agreement. Facts do not speak for themselves, they require interpretation. This is why, when Pro says in Round 2, \u201cthis website was about the facts, not the reasons,\u201d they admit to not making an argument. The reasons are what we\u2019re after here. For example, if I see a person running, that is a fact \u2013 someone is running. But this fact gives me no actual understanding as to why. Is he exercising? Is he running from the police? Did the tiger escape from the local zoo? I don\u2019t know, I need to do further analysis. To make facts useful, you must analyze them. My opponent, by their own admission, does not do this. My opponent absurdly states \u201cIn Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, there are many gun laws.\u201d Do we really think only 3% of Palestinians have access to weapons? Do we really think gun laws are enforced and followed in Afghanistan? I\u2019ve been to Afghanistan, and I can tell you the answer is no. Perhaps the reason \u201cthe amount of guns purchased is low\u201d in these countries is because people don\u2019t need to purchase them \u2013 they already have them, or they smuggle them in. And yet, according to my opponent\u2019s own sources, the murder rate in Afghanistan is still supposedly lower than America\u2019s. My opponent uses unreliable sources. I would not consider the Mack Family Blog (zeigen.com), Wikipedia, and a website that looks like a high school web design project (sunray22b.net) authorities on gun policy. There are lots of credible resources out there, I challenge Pro to use them. Now, on to some alternate arguments: More gun laws do not necessarily stop gun violence. According to the Cato Institute, the Columbine shooters broke around 20 different gun laws in order to amass the arsenal of weapons they eventually used (1). More laws didn\u2019t stop them. Maybe we need to focus on better enforcement of existing laws rather than adding new ones. According to the National Research Council 2013 report on gun violence, suicide accounts for 61% of all deaths from firearm related violence in the U.S (2). Maybe we have more of a suicide than a homicide problem. Maybe we need to look into more effective mental health programs, rather than simply more gun laws. Furthermore, stricter gun laws do not apply to people who don\u2019t follow the law anyway \u2013 criminals. Criminals are a major source of gun related crimes, and making more laws won\u2019t stop them \u2013 they will just make law abiding citizens easier targets. Although an exact number is hard to pinpoint, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 3,000,000 crimes are prevented each year by law abiding citizens using legal firearms for defense (3). Maybe we have a criminal problem, and need to focus on cleaning up crime infested areas, rather than simply more gun laws. As I hope I\u2019ve made clear, I am absolutely in favor of gun control. I think we need laws and they should be well enforced. I am combating what I thought my opponent\u2019s position was \u2013 that we should enact more and stricter gun laws because it will decrease murder rates. I apologize if my opponent was looking to debate someone who thinks \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have gun laws,\u201d but this is not my position. http://www.cato.org... http://www.nap.edu... http://www.nap.edu...",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control Laws",
            "premise": "----- The following is taken from my website, which can be found here: http://politicaljoe.net... ---- The idea of gun laws is very similar to Communism believe it or not. Communism at it's idea stage is a very, very great idea. But as with a lot of good ideas, it is often so that the idea is oblivious to the fact that humans are evil. As so, humans will find a way to manipulate that idea to make it a bad system. Communism, again, was one such idea that got screwed over by our inner-evilness. Communism is an extremely complex idea that many have written thousand-page theses on, but I want to focus on one aspect of it, that aspect being how people would work and consume. Communism basically took out money in a sense, and told people to work their hardest at their line of expertise. Then, if you needed anything, you would ask for it, and you would get it. Again, I'd like to state that this is way oversimplified. So for instance, if you were a farmer, you would produce crops your best and give your crops to people who needed it. Conversely, if you needed something, per say a car, (and communism taught not to over consume) you would ask someone who made cars to give you one. This in my opinion, is a great idea as an idea. However, people are evil, and corruption begins. People had to wait months to get car a because of all the under-dealings, and outside of this aspect of Communism, all hell broke loose. This is exactly the same with gun control laws. It predicts that if we make it so hard to get a gun, the bad guys will not be able to get guns, and we all can live under harmony. But we as a race are not quite bunny-sunshine. The bad guys would not just stop being evil, they would just start getting guns from the already hugely existent gun underground. And that underground would grow and grow and what else? Grow. Sort of like illegal immigrants and fake ID's, but that's a totally different story. Take for instance the Temperance Movement. They were a Christian movement in the early 1900s that successfully banned alcohol in the United States of America. They actually got the United States Congress to pass the Eighteenth Amendment of the United States of America, which only got being rejected by Rhode Island. Thank God it was short-lived being repealed thirteen years later by the twenty-first amendment, or else the damage it cause would have been quite multiplied. The Eighteenth Amendment of the United States of America, subsequently created such a massive alcohol underground, run by the Italian Mafia just for your information, that it became a joke to get drunk, thus forcing Congress to repeal it. However, in those thirteen years alcoholism increased fanatically, and countless thousands died due to alcoholism just because a group of Christian women thought it'd be a good idea. And that brings me back to the corruption of ideas. Gun control laws may be a great idea, but looking at historical evidence, it will, and has already become quite corrupted. In fact, according to a Time Magazine article entitled, \"Darkness Falls\" by Nancy Gibbs, 85% of crimes that involve guns are committed with illegally obtained gun. Want more? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the 1990's, reported that only 7% of armed career criminals obtained firearms from licensed gun shops. The simple fact is this. With or without gun control laws, bad guys will always find guns to use, and if they're going to get them anyways, I for one want to arm myself from them. In fact, according to an article entitled \"Recent School Shootings\" published in 1997 by the Washington Post, sixteen-year-old Luke Woodham stabbed his mother to death and then went to school with a rifle where he shot 9 students, killing 2 of them. However, Assistant Principal Joel Myrick raced to his car, retrieved a .45 caliber handgun, and used it to subdue Woodham until police arrived. Imagine how many lives he saved. So, some of you might be asking by now, am I implying that more gun control laws mean more violence, and that less gun control laws means less? No. I'm saying that. According to The National Center for Policy Analysis and safestreetsdc.com, in 1976, Washington, D.C. enacted one of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. Since then, the city's murder rate has risen 200% while their population dropped about 15%. It got so bad, D.C. was known as the \"murder capital\" of the United States. Switzerland practices total conscription, and it has one of the lowest crime rates in the world according to a 1996 Switzerland Census and just wide know knowledge. Florida adopted a right-to-carry law in 1987 and between 1987 and 1996, homicide rates dropped 36%, firearm homicide rate dropped 37%, and handgun homicide rate dropped 41%. New Jersey adopted what sponsors described as \"the most stringent gun law\" in the nation in 1966 and two years later, the murder rate was up 46% and the reported robbery rate had nearly doubled. Even using Hitler as an example, when he banned all guns in Germany... well you know what happened. So in conclusion, Gun Control laws, just like Communism and the Eighteenth Amendment, are great ideas as ideas. But humans are evil maniacal beings who love to manipulate. When an idea does not include prevention of evilness in it of itself, the idea will get corrupted. Gun Control laws will be more, but have already been corrupted as evident by all the statistics. So I ask this, why are we adding upon the already 20,000 gun laws we already have in the good ol' US of A?",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control in the United States",
            "premise": "Thank you for your response. I'd first like to address that gun control is only a factor in reducing gun crimes. I am not saying that enacting more gun laws would completely erase all gun crime, but is an essential component. As you stated, places such as New York, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Connecticut have had mass shootings, yes. But the vast majority of states with fewer gun laws, like Texas, have had mass shootings to. These are uncommon incidents that don't happen everyday. If you look at the bigger picture, the gun laws in places such as New York result in fewer gun crimes. My argument that gun laws reduce gun crimes is still valid. My opponent talks about how my source doesn't speculate why there are less murders. First of all, this website was about the facts, not the reasons. Secondly, it's difficult to comprehend why the murder rate is low in these states becuase there are many factors to consider. In my opponent's third paragraph, he explains that the source I used was against gun control. I was only showing the graph that showed how the United States has a far higher gun murder rate than any other country. I'd like to point out that my opponent stated that gun laws in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Palestine, are \"non existent,\" that is not the case. In Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, there are many gun laws. In Palestine, there are no gun laws but only 125,000 people posses a gun. Do you know the how many people reside in Palestine? 4,000,000. I'd also like to point out that in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq, the amount of guns purchased is low and the population in these countries is high. It's also problematic to compare Canada to Iraq because countries like Palestine are under military occupation, making it more difficult to obtain a gun. My opponent claims that Chicago has the highest amount of violence, I agree. But Chicago also has the highest amount of gangs in the United States. Also, Chicago is one of the many cities in Illinois and is only one area. http://www.zeigen.com... In the graph, you can see that there is a dip in 1934. In 1934, the National Firearm Act was founded and murder rate went down drastically. This was after the law was enacted. These might be reasons why murder rate went down. In 1990, the Crime Control Act was made as well as Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994. After those laws passed, gun violence went down again. As you can see, gun violence and gun laws have a strong correlation. Again, I want to remind my opponent and the audience that gun control laws and murder rate is only a factor. Lastly, I'd like to point out that my opponent didn't give any sources about the other countries laws and gave false information. He also didn't provide a claim on why we shouldn't have gun laws. Looking forward to your response. http://www.gunpolicy.org... http://www.gunpolicy.org... http://www.gunpolicy.org... http://www.gunpolicy.org... http://www.zeigen.com... http://www.infoplease.com... http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "premise": "I'd like to thank the opponent for accepting this challenge, he is a very skilled debater. I'd also like to apologize for sources, this is my first debate so I did not know. I will not make the mistake again Laws Do Not Apply To Criminals We\"ve all heard this one many times, but a point of contention that just won\"t go away must be quite convincing to some. Gun laws are all founded on the principle of making a nation safer by limiting its civilian population\"s access to guns, but laws against murder and violence do not apply to those who have given up on life and intend to die while killing as many people as they can. Laws against theft do not apply to a person who intends to steal something. The sole thing the criminally-minded care about is not getting caught. Some are reformed in prison, but in large part, those who want to break a law are not going to feel remorse when they are caught. Give them a chance and they will do it again. From this perspective, it is difficult to fathom the logic of enacting newer, stricter gun laws on an already lawful society. Most of us obey such laws. Sale of guns is forbidden within the city limits of Chicago, an ordinance that went into effect in 2010. For the year 2013, the city\"s murder count is 374. There were 432 in 2010 and 500 in 2012. The FBI has named Chicago the nation\"s murder capital. Thus, the city ordinance did nothing to reduce its murder rate. None of this is to imply that in areas of well-armed civilians, the violent crime rate must go down. That is not true. The highest crime rates in 2012 were in the South, where gun ownership is at its highest. But this fact as well corroborates that any imposition of gun control does not address the issue of gun-related crime. Maybe In A Perfect World . . . Let us disentangle ourselves from the trees and take a look at the forest. Because there is no national gun registry, the exact number of guns in civilian hands in the US cannot be determined, but a conservative estimate places it\"as of 2010, when the gun-buying craze was just reaching its peak\"at 270 million weapons. This was about 89 guns per 100 people, the most heavily armed civilian population in the world. Yemen was second with 55 per 100, and Switzerland third. As of 2013, Serbia is second. Another estimate, conducted by Congressional Research in 2012, places the total number of weapons in US civilian hands at 310 million as of 2009. By today, that means almost 1 gun for every single citizen, including infants. What would gun control even mean at this point? Assume this federal law: from 2014 on, no more assault rifles. Those who already own one may keep theirs, but such weapons will disappear from gun stores and pawn shops. Have we controlled much of anything? There are still at least 3 million assault rifles out there. In a perfect world, gun control would mean going house to house throughout the nation and taking away every single firearm, including muzzle loaders. That would be impossible. Regardless of its constitutionality, gun owners would either fight back until there were a nationwide civil war or simply hide their weapons and claim they have none. Since most of those in the US are unregistered, no one knows who has what. Owners could always claim they destroyed those that are registered. Thus, to debate gun control is a futile exercise. They cannot be controlled\"not anymore. The continuation of buying and selling them cannot make the situation any worse because criminals will never again have to go far to find one. \"By definition, the con is defending the right of the mentally ill to have guns. The mentally ill cannot be trusted with guns because they are incapable of handling them and may have outbursts. Adam Lanza, the man who perpetrated the Sandy Hook massacre was mentally ill. In fact, the NYTimes reports that Lanza's mental illness went largely untreated before the shooting. There is no reason to support giving guns to the mentally ill.\" Problem: in many states ( Arizona, Georgia,Idaho,ect...) the mentally ill are not aloud to have any ownership of a gun until 5 years after discharge and frequent visits from the police. so it not a mater of gun control for the mentally ill but it is for the state to decide. \"Guns that explode and kill the carrier (without warning or prior knowledge of the fact while buying the firearm) By definition, the con is defending the sale of these as well. If hypothetically these existed, the con would have to defend why we should sell them. The reason to regulate (ban) the sale of these is obvious: they are literally murdering and deceiving the user.\" Problem: before owning gun you must sign a form that recommends gun training, if a weapon is well handled ten the weapon will not \"explode\" unless putting your bullets in the cartridge in an incorrect way. \"How can you trust children/babies with guns. One could accidentally fire one and kill somebody.\" Problem: guns are only aloud to be bought by an 18 year old and up then it becomes the problem of the person who let the gun come into the hands of a child thus it is not the gun dealers fault or even the fact the we aloud to have guns. it is simply the actions of the owner of the gun that should be judged in this situation Source information. http://www.ncsl.org... http://listverse.com...",

According to this statement, my opponent posits that convicts have been bearing lead-plated bullets for a few hundred years into the past, which is an egregious statement. More technically advanced bullets were introduced in the 1800s and at that time, iron was much to sparse and commercially impractical to produce or meld on a large scale. [1] Lead cores for bullets were logically introduced long after guns and bullets were globally commercialized, ergo rendering Con's arguments baseless and illogical. Note to voters: I was dismissing Con's arguments because I had declared previously that the pricing of bullets at a higher price point was merely an analogy used to burgeon my argument. I'd also like to point out that some of my opponent's sources actually backfire on the premise he is trying to defend. For instance, my opponent sourced the following link to support his claim of reduced crime after gun control laws were enacted in Wisconscin, reducing crime rates. This is absurd! He is trying to disprove the effectiveness of concealed weapons laws and yet he sources a citation that establishes a correlation between gun control laws and reduced crime! Once again, I'd like to say that I disregarded a segment of my opponent's points because I had previously established that my argument was for analogous purposes and that it should not be taken in a literal sense.

Third Paragraph: You incorrectly state that the Columbine and the Virginia Tech shootings were the cause of not enough gun control. In both cases, the commiters received their guns illegally. And in the case of Seung-Hui Cho, he was suspected of being mentally ill. However, no one ever forced him to seek help. This is fault of the administration. Again, in both cases, more gun control laws would not have helped. Repeating a past statistic, 85% of crimes that involve guns are committed with illegally obtained guns. Fourth Paragraph: I never said there was no correlation between poverty and gun violence. However, you still seem to dismiss all the statistics that show just when gun control laws are placed, gun violence increases. You have still yet to show me any evidence that poverty coincidentally increased at the same time gun control laws were placed. To back up your claims, you take a quote representing the opinions of a few unknown people. Please adress my statistics. Fifth-Seventh Paragraph: Again, I never mentioned anything about unemployment. Perhaps there is a correlation, but you have yet to adress my statistics. ---- In conclusion: 1) MidnightSpecial has yet to adress why the statistics show that gun control laws lead to gun violence, and has misdirected the audience into talks of poverty, irrelevant to the topic of gun control. 2) MidnightSpecial has yet to prove how more gun control would lead to less gun violence. 3) I have proven how less gun control would mean less gun violence. ---- At the end of the day, the simple fact is this: I want more freedom and liberty. I also want less Americans to die. Less gun control means les gun violence. And although he probably doesn't realise it, MidnightSpecial is calling for more gun violence, more death, less freedom, and less life. All voters, look at all the statistics, and use your common sense.",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "1) I'd like to start with the Swiss crime rates. Like you said, other factors must be taken into account. the biggest factor in my opinion is not swiss gun control, but the prison and justice system there whxih is quite diffeerent and focuses more on education and rehabilitation, which has lead to much lower crime rates because the prisoners can go saftley back into society. You could argue that since this is true, then the answer is not gun control, but reforming the justice system. However a combination of these is needed to lower crime rates. The swiss dont threaten their criminals they theyll get shot by a good guy if they commit crime again, they just rehabilitate them. If you can greatly lower crime rates with a reformed justice system, then there really isnt any more positive needs for defensive firearsms. If you dont need them because of high crime rates anymore, the only use left is a dangerous use, hunting which doesnt need a gigantic weapon or giant magazine, or theyll just collect dust in a swiss guys basement. -in addition, you say their are other factors in low English gun violence because gun control is also present in other surrounding countries like France. That's not a case against gun control it shows that if gun control has widespread adoption it will greatly lower gun violence. 2) To address the idea that people could still buy guns from the black market even with gun control laws in place, this doesnt show that gun control would be ineffective. Maybe less effective than ideal, but still effective. Yes, you could get a three d printer. You could do a lot of things. Its still mich more difficult and leas likley to happen than what has happened woth the war on drugs. The simple fact that the black market is illegal would also help the idea of gun control because the simple illegality would discourage some, but more importantly it would allow for law enforcement to go after these distributers. Roght now you can walk down the street and get a gun. You can also walk down the street and but weed, which is the illegal ome of the two. The difference is if certain guns were illegal, they would be much harder to obtain. 3) Yes, it is one hundred percent true that the United Kingdom has a much higher violent crime rate than the United States. However, the very important distinction you are overlooking is that the murder rate, the rate at which lives are lost do to violent crime, is astronomically lower in the United Kingdom because they do not have guns. Guns are specifically designed for the purpose of ending lives, and they make it much easier to kill people and in some cases a lot of people much easier. 4) As for the government coming after guns, I will address the two examples that you gave. in the case of the Native Americans, I think it is a false notion that this country has not yet evolved to the point where we do not disarm ethnic groups in order to discriminate, relocate, and genocide them. As for the New Orleans example, that was wrong. But when you pass a law you can't ignore all of the benefits because of this one bad thing that could possibly happen under certain circumstances. in this case, the government siezed property, which is illegal. You can't not pass laws because somebody might break them. Otherwise we just wouldnt have laws. They did something that was illegal. If you register someone when they vote, you cant track them down and stop them from voting because you know they are registered. if the givernment did that it would be wring. Its the same with guns. but the benefits of registering people to vote outweigh the very unlikley possibility that soemething like that would happen. 5) I think magazine sizes should definetely be smaller. Again, the larger magazines would be harder to obtain. Also, Why on earth would an innocent civillian carry around a one hundred round magazine jsut in case a bad guy comes around and has a one hundred round magazine, even if they were legal. it just is not realistic that any signifigant amount of people would do that for self defense. The only people who would carry that around are probably not safe to be around. And not innocent civilian could defend themselves against that. Even if we said the bad guy ran across a good guy with the exact same magazine capacity. The bad guy is peobably going to fire first. Good guy has to take out the gun, get ready, then start shooting and hopefully are trained to use the weapon. If the bad guy has only six bullets, no matter what anyome else does, the risk of damage is still going to be much less. That and it is not the citizens responsibility to serve and protect. That would be law enforcement and the government. People have a right to walk the streets not feeling in constant guard with a firearm and we dont need any shootouts. We have never had the kind of gun control we need. If gun control ahs a chance of reducing murder rate and gun violence, why in earth wouldn't we at least try it for a sufficient length of time so we could see what the results are. i dint think anyone could convince me that there is a reason to prevent gum controlthat is more valuable than human life. over and out!

I'd also like to apologize for sources, this is my first debate so I did not know. I will not make the mistake again\" == No problem. Thanks for the timely response! -- \"Laws Do Not Apply To Criminals We\"ve all heard this one many times, but a point of contention that just won\"t go away must be quite convincing to some.\" == Just because an argument has been around for a while doesn\"t mean that it\"s a good argument. -- \"Gun laws are all founded on the principle of making a nation safer by limiting its civilian population\"s access to guns...\" == Not necessarily, since gun control is defined as \"laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms.\", not all forms of gun control do this. For example, by the definition agreed for for this debate, requiring all guns sold from here on to be functional and non-self-destructive is a form of gun control. Con needs to remember that we are debating about gun control in general and not about adding additional legislature on gun control in the US (However, if the Con wants that debate, I\"ll be happy to debate him on that in another debate). Since I will use this explanation quite a bit, I will refer to it as Explanation 1. -- \"...but laws against murder and violence do not apply to those who have given up on life and intend to die while killing as many people as they can. Laws against theft do not apply to a person who intends to steal something. The sole thing the criminally-minded care about is not getting caught. Some are reformed in prison, but in large part, those who want to break a law are not going to feel remorse when they are caught. Give them a chance and they will do it again. From this perspective, it is difficult to fathom the logic of enacting newer, stricter gun laws on an already lawful society. Most of us obey such laws. Sale of guns is forbidden within the city limits of Chicago, an ordinance that went into effect in 2010. For the year 2013, the city\"s murder count is 374. There were 432 in 2010 and 500 in 2012. The FBI has named Chicago the nation\"s murder capital. Thus, the city ordinance did nothing to reduce its murder rate.\" == Problems: 1) Murder count reduced overall 2) Doesn\"t explain the disadvantage of gun control (why not just implement gun control anyways since, my opponent pointed out, it doesn\"t increase murder by gun) -- \"Let us disentangle ourselves from the trees and take a look at the forest. Because there is no national gun registry, the exact number of guns in civilian hands in the US cannot be determined, but a conservative estimate places it\"as of 2010, when the gun-buying craze was just reaching its peak\"at 270 million weapons. This was about 89 guns per 100 people, the most heavily armed civilian population in the world. Yemen was second with 55 per 100, and Switzerland third. As of 2013, Serbia is second. Another estimate, conducted by Congressional Research in 2012, places the total number of weapons in US civilian hands at 310 million as of 2009. By today, that means almost 1 gun for every single citizen, including infants. What would gun control even mean at this point? Assume this federal law: from 2014 on, no more assault rifles. Those who already own one may keep theirs, but such weapons will disappear from gun stores and pawn shops. Have we controlled much of anything? There are still at least 3 million assault rifles out there. In a perfect world, gun control would mean going house to house throughout the nation and taking away every single firearm, including muzzle loaders. That would be impossible. Regardless of its constitutionality, gun owners would either fight back until there were a nationwide civil war or simply hide their weapons and claim they have none. Since most of those in the US are unregistered, no one knows who has what. Owners could always claim they destroyed those that are registered. Thus, to debate gun control is a futile exercise. They cannot be controlled\"not anymore. The continuation of buying and selling them cannot make the situation any worse because criminals will never again have to go far to find one.\" == Again, Con does not show why all kinds of gun control are bad using our agreed definition. Cross-apply Explanation 1. Also, it is important to note that most kinds of gun control don\"t involve rounding up guns. ** \"\"By definition, the con is defending the right of the mentally ill to have guns. The mentally ill cannot be trusted with guns because they are incapable of handling them and may have outbursts. Adam Lanza, the man who perpetrated the Sandy Hook massacre was mentally ill. In fact, the NYTimes reports that Lanza's mental illness went largely untreated before the shooting. There is no reason to support giving guns to the mentally ill.\" -- Problem: in many states ( Arizona, Georgia,Idaho,ect...) the mentally ill are not aloud to have any ownership of a gun until 5 years after discharge and frequent visits from the police. so it not a mater of gun control for the mentally ill but it is for the state to decide. ** \"Guns that explode and kill the carrier (without warning or prior knowledge of the fact while buying the firearm) By definition, the con is defending the sale of these as well. If hypothetically these existed, the con would have to defend why we should sell them. The reason to regulate (ban) the sale of these is obvious: they are literally murdering and deceiving the user.\" -- Problem: before owning gun you must sign a form that recommends gun training, if a weapon is well handled ten the weapon will not \"explode\" unless putting your bullets in the cartridge in an incorrect way. ** \"How can you trust children/babies with guns. One could accidentally fire one and kill somebody.\" -- Problem: guns are only aloud to be bought by an 18 year old and up then it becomes the problem of the person who let the gun come into the hands of a child thus it is not the gun dealers fault or even the fact the we aloud to have guns. it is simply the actions of the owner of the gun that should be judged in this situation.\" == All of the solutions to my contentions to my contentions that Con provided are forms of gun control. See explanation 1 for the definition of gun control. I look forward to Con\"s response Vote Pro!",

As for your argument that gun control rates increase with stricter gun control laws you fail to acknowledge alternate causes. Look at the places you cite as examples, D.C. and New Jersey. Both those places have huge poverty rates, some of the biggest in the nation. It is no surprise that D.C. and Jersey would have increased crime since the people there are so desperate. Here are some stats that tend to prove the foregoing point: In 1987, more than 3,000 men aged 15 to 24 were murdered with firearms in the U.S. (annual homicide rate in this age group was 21.9 per 100,000 people, three quarters of these gun murders). Canada, with about one-fifth U.S. population, had 17 gun murders in this category (overall rate, 2.9 per 100,000.) And Japan lost eight young men (overall rate 0.5 per 100,000.) As for humans being inherently evil, that is simply not true. Sociological studies show that humans come into this world tabula rassa, meaning blank slate. If you want to cut down on violent crime you have to attack the root of it, the poverty and accessibility of firearms to the public. So my position is not only for strict gun control laws, but more enforcement. The USFG should pass legislation to crack down on the illegal gun trade. Basically there is major laws dealing with stopping the illegal gun trade but the money and resources are not there. Proper funding and resources have to given to the members of the law enforcement community. There are only 22 federal gun control laws, of which 20 are not enforced due to the lack of funding. Third-Way.com explains it: \"The current Administration has not displayed anywhere near the same aggressiveness with the other 20 major federal firearms laws, even though enforcement of most of these laws could greatly reduce gun violence. Prosecutions for 11 of the remaining 20 major federal gun laws were either the same or lower in 2002 than 2000. For example, the number of corrupt gun store prosecutions dropped from 36 to 27. The number of prosecutions for illegally selling to a minor stayed at 7. The number of federal prosecutions for lying on the background check form did increase \u2013 from 501 to 587 cases \u2013 but that still means that 99.6% of violators were not prosecuted in FY2002, compared to 99.7% in FY 2000. During the first full fiscal year of the Bush Administration, the proportion of federal cases devoted to the two most frequently prosecuted statutes actually increased from 83% to 86% of total federal prosecutions. Crimes associated with corrupt gun stores, illegal firearms traffickers, straw purchasers, gun thieves, those who obliterate firearm serial numbers, sell to minors, bring guns to schools, and lie on a background check form to obtain a firearm were barely enforced under President Clinton and are still barely enforced under President Bush. \"",

            "premise": "For the final round, I will be rebutting my opponent's Round 3 responses to my initial arguments.= Final Rebuttals =More Guns, Less CrimeEngland and Wales' homicide rate jumped following both gun restrictions, showing that gun control does not work in eliminating crime. The graph doesn't \"look high\" because England and Wales' homicide rate per million people were together in one graph. Remember, we are measuring the murder rate over time and how the trend changes when gun control laws are implemented. I have clearly shown that the murder rate rose, and that gun control does not work, especially not in this instance. Pro drops the facts I showed about how the crime rates in European countries with various gun laws were higher with more laws and lower with less.Pro then goes on to examine my source and pulls out the Chicago graph that measured the murder rate in response to the strict gun bans. The graph did fluctuate a bit but was also cut off at 2007, so allow me to provide some missing info: An Illinois concealed carry law was enacted in July 2013. The Chicago homicide rate of the first quarter of 2014 saw the rate at its lowest since 1958[1]. This is a significant change that \"coincidentally\" happened right after the ban on carrying guns was lifted.It is true that the UK's murder rate is slightly lower than America's, but it has been rising significantly ever since gun laws have been enacted. America has the highest ownership rate of guns in the world, with 90 guns per 100 people. If more guns means more crime, then that should mean that the United States has the highest crime rate in the world. However, the U.S.'s homicide rate is not in the top 10, or the top 50, or the top 100 - it's homicide rate per capita is #111, despite having so many guns[2]. Most of the countries above the U.S. are progressive countries with gun control laws, so the mantra that \"more guns, more crime\" is a very false one indeed. Indeed, the crime rate can be affected by different factors, but gun control ultimately has the largest effect since it directly targets the amount of guns used for crime.The \"homicides with large anomalies unrelated to guns\" in the UK graph means that homicides were committed using knives and other non-firearm weapons. This shows that even if criminals don't have guns, they will still find ways to commit crime without them. The large spike was the result of the criminal response to the UK gun ban in 1997.We must note that my opponent has not provided any counter evidence to suggest that gun control does reduce crime, he has just stated his issues with my evidence.Self-DefenseTheoretically a criminal may have a harder time finding a gun with gun control, but they will put more effort into to obtaining illegal guns and non-firearm weapons that will not make the homicide rate lower, as we have seen with several examples above.As for the objections to my sources 5 and 6, the people who used guns for self protection were actually 9%, not .9%. This plus 7% makes 16%. We must remember that the study was focused on defensive gun uses, which is the polar opposite of offensive or criminal uses. The rest of the data is simply not noted, so it is wrong to jump to conclusions.Pro looks at the introduction of my round 3 source 5 study instead of reading the rest of it. The last line of the introduction reads, \"There is one study, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which in 1993, estimated 108,000 DGU's annually. Why the huge discrepancy between this survey and fourteen others?\" The next section is titled \"Dr. Kleck's Answer\" where he uses multiple paragraphs to answer this question. Pro clearly has not read the rest of the study.GunCite.com is not at all biased. Just because the name includes the words \"gun cite\" does not mean it is anything seriously leaning toward one side. My opponent has attempted to dismiss the site because it's pro-gun, but that does not refute the numbers or data collection. In doing so he has committed the Genetic Fallacy[3]. Lastly, the article may be made in 2003, but the numbers and data are still as true today as they were then, so this is not even close to making the article wrong.Thanks a bunch for the debate Pro! It's been a pleasure.[1] http://www.ijreview.com...[2] Pro's source, Round 3[3] http://www.nizkor.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Gun Control",
            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "Greetings, I would like to start by thanking my opponent for taking the time to debate this subject, and I hope it turns out to be a very good debate. I will commence with three contentions. However, do note that I will be arguing against all forms of restrictions on firearms such as background checks, bans, buy backs, registration, etc. Contention 1: Safeguard and defense against a tyrannical government My first contention will be on the issue of the defense of liberty. A well armed civilian population is the biggest safeguard in case our government crosses the line and decides to become tyrannical. The founding fathers put in place the 2nd Amendment for this very reason, so that the masses of citizens of our country may use force in the case the state tries on override the Constitution and seize our natural rights. So essentially, the right to bear arms is in place to protect all our other rights. History has proven every time a population is disarmed, the government almost always takes advantage of the chance and lays waste to its peoples rights. We see this in Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, and Mao's China. Every time, the people were unable to resist the tyrants and because that many hundreds of millions of people died at the hands of governments. It is for this reason that we should not disarm the population, but rather, arm it with even more then it already is. There is nothing worse then a government with nothing to fear. Contention 2: Gun Control is over all, inefficient and counterproductive My second contention will be that gun control of any all kinds are counterproductive. I will prove this using national and international cases that show that gun control generally backfires where ever it is instituted. Proof from the U.S. 1. In 1976, Washington, D.C. enacted one of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. The city's murder rate increased by 134 percent through 1996 while the nation murder rate dropped 2 percent [1]. 2. Maryland claims to have the toughest gun control laws in the country and it ranks #1 in robberies and #4 in both violent crime and murder. The robbery rate is at 70 percent more then the national average [2]. 3. New York has one of the most restrictive gun laws in the U.S. and also have 20 percent of the armed robberies [3]. 4. According to the federal government, gun buy backs have no effect [4]. 5. Buy backs remove no more then 2 percent of the guns from the community. And the ones that were removed didn't resemble the guns used in crimes [5]. From the rest of the World 1. In Canada around 1920, before there was any form of gun control, their homicide rate was 7% of the U.S rate. By 1986, and after significant gun control legislation Canada\u2019s homicide rate was 35% of the U.S. rate \u2013 a significant increase. 320 In 2003, Canada had a violent crime rate more than double that of the U.S. (963 vs. 475 per 100,000) [6]. 2. firearm use in crimes in the UK has doubled in the decade since handguns were banned [7]. 3. Britain has the highest rate of violent crime in Europe, more so than the United States or even South Africa. They also have the second highest overall crime rate in the European Union. In 2008, Britain had a violent crime rate nearly five times higher than the United States (2034 vs. 446 per 100,000 population) [8]. 4. Crime has been rising since enacting a sweeping ban on private gun ownership. In the first two years after Australian gun-owners were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms, government statistics showed a dramatic increase in criminal activity [9]. In 2001-2002, homicides were up another 20% [10]. From the inception of firearm confiscation to March 27, 2000, the numbers are: Firearm-related murders were up 19%, armed robberies were up 69%, and home invasions were up 21%. So as we can see from these facts from us and our gun controlist allies that gun control is very counterproductive. This should be no surprise however, common sense should tell us two things. 1) The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun. 2) And criminals simply do not obey laws, and that means gun control would only be disarming law-abiding citizens. Background Checks? Background checks are inefficient. The majority of criminals that are in prison today because of gun violence did not buy their guns from a licensed gun dealer. As a matter of fact a 2004 survey says that approximately 1/10 of prisoners bought their weapons from a licensed gun dealer [15]. There is also another problem with background checks. The criteria for stripping people of their 2nd Amendment are unfairly broad. They put pot growers, hubcap thieves, and guys who got into a bar fight 20 years ago in the same pile as violent predators. It's just absurd. With these problems it is no surprise that a 2000 study by criminologists Philip J. Cook and Jens Ludwig found no evidence that background checks had an impact on homicide rates [16]. Contention 3: More guns, less crime My third and final contention will be that more armed citizens there are the less crime there will generally be in any society, including the U.S. Guns prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year or 6,849 every day. Often the gun is never fired and no blood (including the criminal\u2019s) is shed [11]. A study found that 60% of convicted felons admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed. 40% of convicted felons admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they thought the victim might be armed[12]. In 1982, Kennesaw, GA passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate dropped 89% the following year[13]. So, I think we can see that there is no real reason to suspect gun control will do any good good. It has failed in other parts of the world and here in the U.S. and the statistics prove this. However, there is one thing that my opponent mentioned that seems to be throne up every time there is a discussion about gun control, school shootings. Let's look at 2 more facts: 1. Most schools are 100% gun free zones. 2.Over an eight year period, instates without \u201cright to carry\u201d laws, there were 15 school shootings; however, in states that allow citizens to carry guns, there was only one [14], I will now await my opponent's response.

These mass murders have occurred in places such as Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Washington, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. In these states, there are no requirements to have a permit to purchase a gun, provide firearm registration, and to supply an owner license. This shows that there is a correlation between minimal gun laws and mass shooting. The number of murder rates in Rhode Island, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Hawaii are very low. This is because of the strict laws of requiring a state permit, owner license, and carry permits. These states have the lowest amount of murder from the survey of 2010. This shows that strict gun control laws in the United States lead to less murders. In my research, I have found that other countries besides the United States have a low murder rate compared to the united state. This includes Sweden, Spain, Australia, and Canada. Why is this? This is because of the many firm laws. These laws include registrations and permits, psychological tests, and safety courses. As you can see, states like Iowa, Rode Island, Hawaii and countries like Canada, Spain and Sweden, all have low murder rate because of more rigorous laws. From the research that I have provided, gun laws and murder rates associate with each other.",

For example: \"* Based on survey data from a 2000 study published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology,[17] U.S. civilians use guns to defend themselves and others from crime at least 989,883 times per year.[18] http://www.justfacts.com... And \"More guns, less crime. In the decade of the 1990s, the number of guns in this country increased by roughly 40 million\"even while the murder rate decreased by almost 40% percent.7 Accidental gun deaths in the home decreased by almost 40 percent as well.(8)\" http://gunowners.org... There's no shortage of sources cherry-picking. I can throw out your sources for the same fallacy and sources remain inconclusive as I've stated in round 2 when I said \"Gun control statistics have been debated wildly with conflicting results from each side.\" By focusing your argument on the IDEA of whether or not gun control is stupid, you'd have to refute my claim that by enacting gun control you'd be taking guns from law-abiding citizens. Criminals, who are not law-abiding, will smuggle guns and use them on an unarmed public. So the IDEA of gun control is stupid. Any laws, restrictions, procedures, or regulations that ordinary citizens have to go through act as a disincentive towards owning a gun and less guns will be kept by law-abiding citizens as a result. I'm not using Nazi Germany as \"an appeal to extreme\" fallacy. I'm using Nazi Germany as one of many examples of a tyrannical government taking over an armless public. China, Guatemala, Turkey, Cambodia, Uganda, and the Soviet Union are all examples of genocide from a tyrannical government on their armless citizens. http://www.mercyseat.net... We were originally discussing why gun control was a stupid idea and the threat of tyranny historically shows that this is yet another example of this stupidity. Our government or any government for that matter is no exemption. By opponent doesn't even try to see the sense in my drug addict analogy. Let's condense this debate on the central issue: is gun control a stupid idea? Yes. Guns prevent a tyrannical government Gun controls are a disincentive for the vast majority of responsible gun owners to own guns It's common sense to believe that criminals won't obey gun laws and use them on an armless public. It's common sense to believe that robbers seek to rob in places where they know no guns can be found. The idea of gun control is stupid.",

But here are some more websites that back what I say (1) (2) (3). My opponent claims that if there are more gun control laws that people will be safer, but is that true. The top ten cities in the United with the strictest gun control laws are: Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas, Cleveland, Oakland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark,and Atlanta; and out of these cities 6 have the most gun violence ( New York, Los Angeles, Oakland, Philadelphia, Newark, Detroit). So gun control in America doesn't work there is an estimate of about 270 million guns in the United States and if gun control is enacted where do these guns go. Well they would go to the criminals who would have black market deals. Compare guns to marijuana, marijuana is illegal to own by federal law, but marijuana is still one of the Untied States largest cash crops (http://abcnews.go.com...) this shows that when someone wants something they can get if even if it is illegal like guns. Look at the logistics of enacting gun control, Australia destroyed 640,381 guns after they made guns illegal it cost the tax payers 500 million dollars now imagine the cost of finding and destroying 270 million guns and we are nearing almost 17 trillion dollars worth of debt, the United States can't afford gun control. While the gun murder rate in Australia is low it doesn't mean they are safe since the 1997 ban on guns accidental gun deaths are up 300%, the assault rate is up 200%, and immediately following the 1997 gun ban overall robbery went up 200% from 1997-2002 and has increased since than 20%. crime Australia is not safe from guns just because they made them illegal (2). Compare that to the United States who has had less crime since 1993. While any death is tragic aren't we going a little over board with it. In the US 3 people die out of 100,000 from guns that means 99,997 don't die from guns. Don't give up liberties for security like Thomas Jefferson said \"Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety,deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\" While the 2nd amendment can be amended the debate topic is not about amending the 2nd amendment. It is about gun control and he should have changed the topic. Pencils are a tool like guns if used right they are great if used wrongly they are not great. Gun control is not about guns it is about the government controlling you and me. Sources (1)http://dailycaller.com... (2) http://freerepublic.com... (3) http://www.justfacts.com...",

The truth is that gun control statistics vary wildly depending on the source and how the information is displayed given the context of the information. Gun control statistics have been debated wildly with conflicting results from each side. Laws are restrictions and could serve as subtle removal of freedoms. Over the course of Nazi Germany the Nazi's leveraged existing gun control laws to round up the Jews and other minorities that they despised without a threat The constitution allows Americans the right to bear arms as a personal right because the founding fathers recognized the threat of tyranny and the need for self-defense. The threat of tyranny still exists in our modern world today and is a very valid reason for having the rights to own and use a gun. \"So, here's my question: how is the right to bear arms affected by gun control? People are still allowed to bear arms, but not any kind. I mean, my opponent most certainly does not include nuclear arms in the \"right to bear arms\"? So, why the fixation on firearms?\" When the founding fathers wrote the constitution no nuclear arms existed and it's common sense to recognize firearms or any other kind of weaponry for that matter is within your right to have. Gun control commits the fallacy of assuming that guns in circulation will be eliminated once gun control laws are enacted. They won't. They'll be in the hands of criminals who disobey the law and out of the hands of the vast majority of responsible gun owners. Consider this: imagine you're a druggie and need money. The town you live in allow guns but the town right next to you doesn't. Would you rather rob a store in your hometown or go right next door the the one that poses a much lesser threat and more successful chance of getting away with robbery? Police can't be there the moment you are confronted with somebody posing a threat to your life. Guns are self-defense for the vast majority of responsible gun owners, protection from the threat of tyranny, and common sense to acknowledge guns won't be removed from circulation once gun control laws are enacted.",

            "premise": "My opponent has used his acceptance round to state his arguments. Based on this I will begin my rebuttals in Round One, and post my main arguments afterwards. R1 \"The current gun control laws in the United States should not be increased and if anything should be abolished. Guns do not cause violence, deranged individuals do.\" It is true that guns do not cause violence, they are simply the middlemen, so to speak. And it is also true that deranged individuals are often behind gun violence. These two statements are true, but that does not mean there shouldn't be gun control laws in America, as my opponent suggests in the first sentence of the quote above. If deranged individuals do cause gun violence, then there should be laws in place to control and hopefully prohibit said deranged individuals' access to guns. Gun control laws are already minimal in America compared to those in countries like Australia[1] or Japan[2], and to further lessen our laws and regulations is an invitation to an even greater ease of access for deranged individuals. R2 \"Statistics show that in areas with increased gun control there are more gun related crimes. Gun control only helps the criminal.\" This statement can be considered unreliable. One thing to note is that my opponent never cited a source with this information, and therefore cannot prove statistics do actually show this. More importantly, there can be many factors not taken into account when measuring such statistics. For instance, what if an area is experiencing a significant amount of gun violence, and decides to give stricter gun control laws a shot. The following year after this decision may not see much change, simply because the new laws take a while to have full effect, but people taking the statistics take a quick look at the area and say, \"Yep, they've still got gun violence.\" R3 \"The original purpose of the 2nd amendment was to be the last line of defense against tyranny, armed civilians are essential to protecting liberty.\" I'd like to stress the use of the word 'original'. The Constitution was crafted at a time very different than ours, when militias were relied upon to help fight in the revolution. The United States was a baby nation at the time of the writing of the Constitution, and the forces of law and order were few and far between, and so it was necessary for people to join into militias to provide protection. America is no longer at that stage however. We have a tangible police force to protect us now. A well regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free state. A complete ban on guns is not required, but completely free access to guns is no longer needed. R4 \"government does not have the right to tell an individual what they can or cannot have as long as they do not hurt another person or violate another persons civil liberties. Owning a firearm of any kind is a human right as firearms in the modern world are necessary for self defense from enemies.\" It seems my opponent's contention here is aimed at a ban on weaponry. I am not for a complete ban on weaponry in the US, so I cannot rebuttal this in its entirety. However I will comment on the idea that firearms are necessary in the modern world to protect oneself from enemies. Statistics show that legally owned guns are rarely used to stop criminals. In fact, legally owned guns are found to be used in socially undesirable ways, such as threatening spouses and children, illegal usage under purported claims of self-defense, and claims of gun self-defense are grossly exaggerated[3]. Legally owned guns are an instrument in all of those things more frequently than they are an instrument in self-defense. This is contradictory to my opponent's idea that guns are necessary for safety. Main Argument: Point 1 I do not argue for a complete ban on weapons in the United States. I argue for smarter and stricter laws regarding gun ownership, especially in gun acquisition. Currently 20% of gun sales are private[4], without background checks taking place. This is a huge loophole for potential deranged individuals. Point 2 We have seen many countries enact very tough gun laws, and been the better for it. My two biggest examples are that of Australia[1], and Japan[2]. Japan has virtually no civilian owned guns. The only weapons that are legal to purchase are shotguns and air rifles, and these are extremely hard to come by, due to the complicated gun acquisition process in place. Japan has had as few as 2 gun deaths a year. Compare that to the US's 12,000 firearm related homicides in the year 2008[2]. Or take Australia, which has seen significant reduction in gun related homicide since the NFA was enacted[5]. It is impossible to look at scenarios like this and claim it's due to chance, and that the same could not happen in America if stricter gun laws were introduced.

Right off the bat in your first paragraph, you assume, \"the good of having them and making it more difficult for criminals to obtain firearms far outweighs the difficulty of enforcement\". There are many things wrong with this statement, as its the statement you spew the rest of your thoughts out. I must address this. Reading that, I ask on what basis is taking away our second amendment rights good? You mention no statistics, no evidence. And when you try to redeem yourself, you briefly say that, \"Oh well... it will have worked only if we enforce them stronger. zOmG!!!\" Even dismissing D.C. and Jersey, what about Switzerland, Florida, and Germany? And also, are you implying that poverty just SPONTANEOUSLY increased in D.C. and Jersey when they added stricter gun control laws? Show me the evidence for that. The only real evidence you DO bring to the table, are the statistics that show Americans love to shoot people. I will not dispute this. However, you must realize your incoherent connection of thoughts. You say that the spontaneous poverty was the reason for D.C. and Jersey's sudden increase in crime, but then you follow saying that Canada and Japan have less gun violence. Several questions arise: 1. Wait, who has more money? 2. Who has the greater population? 3. And who failed to bring connection between lack of gun control enforcement and gun violence? You. This turn around, I'd love to hear you address one major point: Why do all the statistics show that more gun control laws, equal more gun violence?",

            "premise": "Thanks for responding. Now let me say something first. When my opponent talked about me saying Obama, I just wanted to comment on how Obama is intent on getting stricter gun control laws. First of all, let me refresh you on the topic. I said that gun control laws do more harm than good. I know that people don't feel safe about violence in schools, and neither do I. But once again, I believe that gun control laws are not the answer to this. To answer this, I have a counter-plan. More on that in the next round. My opponent failed to rebut any of my points, like how it goes against the Constitution. Nor did he/she rebut the point that Connecticut had some the strictest gun control laws, yet that didn't work. Secondly, I am going to talk about 'self-defense'. This is relevant, and I am going to bring it up. My opponent talked about an outdated study talked about how 2.5 million guns were used for self defense(1). However, I found a recent study saying the same thing. 2.5 million people use their guns only for self defense. And of the 2.5 million using the gun to defend themselves, the majority of them use it only to scare them off(1). Less than 8% of the time does the citizen harm or kill the attacker. (1). Guns are a way to protect ourselves from murder and/or rape. Now on to my own point. As I said before, guns are used for self defense. Once again, a recent study stated that 2.5 million gun users have their gun only for self defense. The main problem with gun control - criminals don't listen. Law abiding citizens who follow the law will get rid of their means for self defense if it is against the law. But the point is, the whole reason why criminals are criminals is because they break the LAW. Banning guns won't help anything. Think about it - during the Prohibition, alcohol was banned. During this period though, the rate of consumption of alcohol increased ten fold. People started making alcohol in their own backyards, and tons of black markets popped up. Think about what would happen should guns be banned. My friend's uncle is a gun maker, and he told me that people can't get enough of guns because they are afraid guns are going to banned. Do you think that a criminal would be more likely to break into a house that the owner might be able to defend or go in with the knowledge that they are unarmed and have no weapons? A Harvard Study has actually found out that in countries such as Russia that completely banned guns, the murder rate is 20.54 when other countries that have no gun control laws like Finland the murder rate is 1.98 (2). Just imagine what would happen to the U.S's murder rate if we banned guns. Sources: http://www.law.harvard.edu... https://www.gunowners.org...",

The thing I find unfair about this, is that you don't give the voters a choice in whom\u2026\u2026\" Ah, I don't believe this is unfair at all. You are supposed to argue for less gun control, and I am to argue for more gun control. That was stated both by imabench in his forum topic, and by me in round 1. You also stated before the debate started that I am to argue for gun control. The definition of gun control is, \"any law, policy, practice, or proposal designed to restrict or limit the possession, production, importation, shipment, sale, and/or use of guns or other firearms by private citizens.\" Throughout this debate I have clearly defined the problems with the current gun control system in the United States, and I have clearly argued why we must have more and why it would be effective. I have also refuted your arguments in regards to the US having more gun control. I have also clearly laid out why certain guns shouldn't be prohibited, and why other guns should not. By giving examples of what guns would be okay and in what situations, I have made it clear where we should strengthen gun control. This is not arguing both sides of the fence, as you put it, but arguing one side from different angles. So I ask the audience to not ignore these types of arguments, because they are the core of the debate and my opponent seeks to detract from that. Furthermore, before my opponent says anything, this is not semantics, because gun control has a clear definition. \"This doesn't make sense. So your saying you agree that people need self defence and thus guns are justified, but then go\u2026\" I am not contradicting myself at all. I've given clear cases where an individual should have access to firearms, and where they should not. An individual who has a reasonable chance of being the victim of violence should have access to a firearm, whereas a person who does not should not have one, because he is more likely to cause harm to himself, which outweighs the benefit of having one during a home invasion or mugging. \"Gun laws require that in order to obtain a fire arm in your home, you must have a safe to safely store them in. http://en.wikipedia.org...... This deters children from entering, criminals from entering, etc. The only person who should know the combination should be the owner of the gun. So this argument cannot be looked to as a child cannot harm themselves in this scenario.\" Firstly, your source says nothing about the gun safes being required by law, and you used Wikipedia. Secondly, they are not required by law in all 50 states. I can see why you'd advocate for their being required by law though, and I agree with your assertion that we must have more gun control over those who have weapons for self-defense. [1] So children are still at risk in some states while there is a gun in the home. This on top of the fact that the presence of firearm makes homicide and suicide between family members more likely in the home, shows that a firearm in the home is more likely to cause tragedy than prevent it. \"In order to own a gun, an individual must complete basic gun courses in order to purchase one. http://corneredcat.com...... You must show proof of completing the courses neccesary to own a gun as well, among having several other things. Gun laws are strict, and not so easy that any one and their kids can purchase one without the neccesary requirements being completed. People who own gun have a basic understanding and knowledge of how to operate them. Thus we would be giving the government too much power if they are the only ones who own guns. The reason we have gun laws in the first place is to prevent government intrusion. Just like in the revolutionary war, owning and operating guns will prevent government from transforming into a dictatorship.\" Gun safety training is not the same thing as military training. You know, the military training you'd need to take part in a \"well-regulated\" militia. Again, the arming of the citizenry in a time of conflict in best left to the National Guard, which can properly train the citizens and integrate them into the state militia. Also, I highly doubt that everyone owning a handgun or hunting rifle is going to deter the federal government if they ever decide to oppress us. \"So you do claim that a person has a right to self defence, and you give an example...\" The shopkeeper has a much higher risk of being mugged than the average joe walking the streets. That's the point I was trying to make. If there is a reasonable chance of you being the victim of a violent crime, then you should be able to carry a weapon for self-defense or have a weapon in your home for self-defense. As I've stated in this debate before, (and provided evidence for,) having a firearm in the home increases the chance of a member of your family being the victim of gun violence, so unless there is a good reason for you have a gun, you do not need one. \"Here you contradict your whole argument\u2026..\" I contradict nothing. Weapons used for showmanship shooting serve a purpose, just as hunting weapons do. Thus, they should be still be regulated, but not prohibited. They are less harmful than an assault rifle, or a machine-gun. It is absurd to suggest otherwise. \"Hand guns have the same ability to stop a persons life as an assualt rife does. When used the right way, and fired at the right part of the human body\u2026.\" No, no, and no again. I've already refuted this argument, I've given you examples of the capabilities of an assault rifle and the key differences it has from handguns. The ammunition used in handguns is not nearly as lethal, the handgun does not have the same rate of fire, the handgun is not as accurate and does not have the same range as an assault rifle. This is a clear absurdity. \"Again, as I have said before, You are thinking nationally. We must think internationally here. Just like criminals can still obtain drugs, they can obtain guns\u2026..\" Buying weapons internationally will prove much more difficult and costly than buying locally. The prices on illegal weapons will continue to rise, and less and less criminals will be able to afford the weapons. Again, basic market principal; if you lower the supply, the price will go up. Opponent's Arguments \"This is exactly why gun control is a horrible concept. It limits citizen protection from the exact scenario you are showing.\" This is why no gun control is a horrible concept. The last thing we want is a shootout on the streets, the last thing we want is to turn poorer neighborhoods into warzones, where the weapons constantly get bigger and deadlier as the citizens try to keep up with the criminals. Conclusion I've stated my case. I have argued successfully for more gun control in the United States. I have given you examples where guns are necessary in our society, where they serve for more good than harm. I have also plainly spelled out what is wrong with the current gun control system today, and how and why it needs to be improved. I have refuted my opponent's arguments, sometimes more than once. I thank my opponent for a strong argument, and wish him luck in the voting period. I believe my argument is stronger, and that you should vote Pro. [1] http://www.vaultandsafe.com...",

            "conclusion": "Gun control",
            "premise": "Okay, I will begin the second round with providing the reason why the 2nd amendment was enacted. Beginning with the Constitution and the primary reason as to why the 2nd amendment was enacted. 1) The second amendment was enacted as a right for all American citizens to protect themselves from future government leaders who could potentially oppress them by using military or government assets to control the American population. The Nazis did gun control to there citizens before taking control of all of Germany with minimal resistance. The founding fathers had common sense and enacted this basic right to own firearms to protect your safety from an unknown future of government leaders that could assume office and pose as a hazard to civil American Life. 2) Although government oppression is unrealistic for America as of right now, The 2nd amendment gives you the most fundamental and basic entitlement a human can possibly have. The right to competently and efficiently protect yourself and your loved ones with minimal resistance as to how you choose to do so. 3) I'll restate as I had stated before that intimidation on criminals (criminals rational fear of being killed by a firearm in the act of a crime) is the best deterrent to crime rationally. When firearms are granted to populations of individuals, With minimal restrictions as to how a person can use those firearms, Crime rates overall are lower as criminals fear of being killed becomes more and more rational. [1]https://www. Cato. Org/publications/commentary/challenging-dc-gun-ban 4) \"If you do agree then my point is proven, And if you don't then you are openly supporting school shootings and the average 96 deaths from guns in the US EVERY DAY\". If somebody disagrees with your belief system, That definitely does not mean that they support the negative outcome of there belief system. It simply means that they believe there belief justifies the end result. When it comes to gun control or bans, In America, Historically extensive gun regulations have resulted in there being more crime such as in Washington D. C. [1]. Statistics can and are often flawed to promote political gain for political parties. In other words, Even though statistics can be made to accommodate your beliefs, They are often manipulated and the end result is simply a false statistic or lie. Common sense should then replace false statistics. Common sense would tell you that if an individual is afraid to break into a house due to the reality of being killed, That individual is less likely to enter that house. [2]https://www. Google. Com/amp/s/www. Forbes. Com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/02/02/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-how-bad-statistics-are-feeding-fake-news/amp/ So overall the thought process that taking away guns and regulating guns saves lives though at first seems ideal and is well intentioned, The result is there being more violence and death in America. This means more than the average number of 96 people a day. Keep in mind that there are over 300 million people living America and that only 96 people being killed by guns a day is not an epidemic by any rational means. 5) \"As for the women and children thing, There is no link that leads to the internal link that means more women and children will be harmed, And thus your point has no impact. \" Okay, Again let's use common sense and point out that woman and children would be victims of violent crime as murder rates would increase. I would even dare to say that woman and children would be victized even more by criminals as criminals know it is easier to victimize unarmed woman and children than it is unarmed full grown men. Thus the result being violence on woman and children skyrocketing. 6) Now I will address a criminals ability to obtain firearms. A criminals ability will not be heavily impacted as guns are made more difficult to obtain. It may even become easier for criminals to obtain guns as gun dealers could become a very main stream illegal business if criminals or even law abiding citizens turn to illegal activity for being unable to purchase a gun at a store. Believe it or not there already are regulations for buying and maintaining gun ownership. Just like drugs trafficking, Even though drugs are illegal, People still get them. Not to mention that it's not easy to make drugs at home without there being reasonable suspicion from others. People already make guns out of everyday materials found in America, And even though it is illegal, It doesn't stop them. 7) For my final argument for round two, I am going to address some geographical and socioeconomic differences in countries and why just because a policy in one country works does not mean it will work in other countries. America has by far the highest gun ownership rate in the world. America also has the largest and most effective organized crime gangs in the world. Regulating or taking away certain guns from American citizens would open up a new business for organized crime groups further increasing gang violence as gangs compete for business, Resulting in even more death and violence. Even simple regulations such as \"being unable to keep your own firearm loaded while on your own property\" though innocent and we'll intentioned at first (yet highly controlling) could very possibly lead to people losing there firearm privileges and searching out illegal methods to obtain firearms for protection. Why should the government have a right to tell you how you can protect your own self or your loved ones. In conclusion, For the rationale stated above, I cannot endorse or support this idea that limiting law abiding citizens ability to obtain guns would save lives. Gun violence is by no means an epidemic in America, And taking away citizens rights to competently protect themselves isn't just counterproductive, It's unethical and wrong. [1]https://www. Cato.

            "premise": "RebuttalsI would like to begin by asking this question: If gun control is not going to be enacted, what else can you do to prevent crime? Are you simply going to stand there and do nothing, while allowing innocent individuals to die because of gun violence? I will not. I will not stop advocating gun control until every school, mall, movie theatre, and public space in the United States is safe. My opponent said that I have a \"lack of sources and information to back up claims\" and \"excessive use of the word 'logic.\" Okay, I must concede to that. If the voters wish to, they may give my opponent the sources points. However, I believe I made the better arguments. There should rather be a delay for criminals to obtain a gun than immediately obtaining that gun. The black market exists and is dangerous, I know that. However, background checks are the only gun control method we have discussed to far. I have plenty more rebuttals. There is one I just noticed and neglected earlier. In the third round, my opponent said this: \"As for how gun control would have a direct impact on the economy, I believe I have explained this in my previous argument. Obviously, you're not satisfied yet. During the recent recession, the gun industry created 37,000 new jobs with an average salary of $47,000 a year.\" What does this have to do with gun control? The industry itself will be doing just fine. The jobs are not going to magically disappear. My opponent needs to prove that this point is relevant.I will provide some more links now:http://listverse.com...http://www.huffingtonpost.com...;First, it seems that the support for gun control has risen, actually. Also, most massacres occur using legal weapons, not weapons from the black market. The more guns are available, the more suicides occur. My opponent is a Conservative. Actually, an individual that all Conservatives hail - Ronald Reagan - actually favored gun control. Here is his quote: Yes, he did indeed say that. Ronald Reagan, one of the most Conservative presidents we have had, favored gun control, particularly background checks. Now, tell me, is the below image rational?: An entire family is holding guns. Even the young boy in the image is holding a pistol. That is simply irrational, unecessary, and simply appalling. A young boy is not going to always make the right decisions. It just takes one wrong move and then he will cause chaos. \"Gun control harms the economy because it runs thousands of people out of their jobs.\" My opponent has not made a logical link between jobs and gun control. \"When you said Germany has great gun control, I'm guessing you meant in urban areas where guns aren't needed as much.\" I somewhat meant that, yes. However, Germany has a much lower crime rate than the United States - as I have shown earlier - and that means something. \"It doesn't interfere with law abiding citizen's right of getting a gun. However, it is an inconvenience to the buyer. If it is an inconvenience to the average buyer, and it does not prevent or delay crime, why do it?\" Gun control does delay crime. I believe I have shown this. I sincerely apologize if my arguments are somewhat bad. I have endured a lot of stress lately. I have a lot of obligations to take care of. I essentially rushed this argument. I apologize for that. I admit, my arguments could be better, but I tried. I really tried. I wish my opponent good luck on this debate, as well as his future encounters. The better debater shall win!",

Now, that said, gun crime in the US has reached significant levels. Every few days it seems we hear of a new shooting or violent crime involving guns. In this debate I will argue for multiple proposed gun control laws and attempt to convince my opponent and the readers that these laws are necessary to stem the levels of crime that we have in the States. 1. Ban on assault rifles. 2. Ban on handguns. 3. Requirement for development of \"Smart Guns\" and technology to enhance safety. 4. Federal and State mandated buy back programs. 5. Increase in background check scrutiny. 6. High capacity magazine bans 7. Ammo bans. 8. Closing loopholes. 9. Limiting concealed and open carry laws 10. Changing castling clauses to eliminate deadly force with firearms and institute duty to run laws 11. And the most controversial, federal confiscation measures. Those are the points I will be arguing. I will allow my opponent to challenge these points now.",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "Before my arguments, I will rebut what opposition said : 1) \"It is completely wrong to assume that all gun owners are denying people the right to live.It is not the gun that takes the life, it is the insane person wielding it.\" - I agree that all the gun owners are not denying right to live. but it simply means that you also agreed upon that some people denying others right to live intentionally or not. So why shouldn't we try to control those some people by controlling guns. Legislature is enacting the laws for everyone. So it's government's duty to protect everyone. Also it is not the gun by it self but that insane person took other's lives by using it. Someone is using something to hurt others, surely we should control it for the sake of others. 2) \"Next, why are rights not absolute. They should be\" - Actually it is not a fallacy. There are no country in the world which all the rights are absolute. you have freedom of speech. That doesn't mean you can insult others as you want. If you have freedom to bear arms, that doesn't mean you can go and kill everyone you don't like. Every right has a limit. That's called as harm principle. You said I was contradicting but you can see clearly I was not. You are talking base on an assertion which you said that \"If your rights are not absolute then you have do not have them\". It's actually a fallacy because if you have limits on your rights doesn't mean you don't have that. I proved above that every rights have limitations but still you own those rights. If someone is playing with other's lives, We should limit some rights in order to protect the most important right known as right to live. Actually the freedom to bear arms is not the most important right when you consider with right to live. Rights will prevail until it hurts for someone's rights. I am saying again and again. If you have guns on your hands, anything can happen. Youths are not the most mature people in the country. What will happen a teenager get a sudden anger or uncontrollable mental failure? Their gun could be a deadly weapon for hundreds or even thousands of innocent people. Without intention they hurt others right know as right to live. So I think it should be controlled to protect others. Also we have to understand that we are not stopping you from buying a gun. But we will control the facts like age and the other things to hold a gun. That's what we mean as gun control. Here we are not rejected your right to bear arms but we tried to control the guns for the sake of innocents lives. 3) \"Also the second amendment's purpose is to protect the people from the government\"- Who creates the constitution? The answer is we, the people. Then why we can't change that when their soul purpose of protecting people won't achieve in modern societies? When will you able to protect the people more? when every people hold guns including youth and shoot each other to protect from each other or when restrict the guns and give people a chance to talk before you use your gun to talk? If you have guns, Then it will mostly come before talks. Also you don't want a gun to protect your self from the government. Because the government will not come and kill you by seeing you have a gun or not. 4) \"The first steps all in communist takeovers started with a gun ban. Nazi Germany or Stalin/Soviet Russia.\" - Just because two/ three countries communist takeovers were started by a gun ban does not mean every country which control the guns is going to takeover by communist. Also in a country like USA, it more than hard to think that communist will come and takeover the country by using a gun control. 5) \"98% of all shootings happen in gun free zones. People with malicious intent will exploit any means to hurt or kill\"- That because most shooting were happened at schools and places like that. So normally if you have a gun it is not usually use for defense. it is very rare to see using a gun for defense. Those guns usually use to mass murders. Another reason why these shootings happen is that thanks to no control gun laws, people get guns easily and come to the gun free zone and shoot. But if you put limitation on that, then it hard for get a gun for immature persons like students. Also the countries which has gun control has fewer crime rate than USA. In USA there are several gun killings are happening regularly. But think about Asian countries. They don't give permission to hold weapons for any civilian. So the people can't come and kill the person whom they don't like.,",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for a good debate. My opponent starts off and gives us our rights, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. Did you catch that? It is the right of the people to bear arms, for personal defense, and or defense from corrupt leaders. The second amendment is built on these main facts:\" An American citizen's right to own guns is upheld by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. However, many people feel that the amendment is outdated, and that gun control is of utmost importance in an increasingly violent society. Gun rights activists have staunchly supported the Second Amendment and will continue to do until the government agrees with their position on firearms. Though gun control advocates seem to be unwavering on imposing further firearm laws and regulations, anti gun control factions such as the NRA have proven to become extremely influential and powerful political force to be reckoned with. It is the government's duty to protect the people and society, and stricter laws have proven to adequately offer for a safer environment. The background checks, must therefore, be conducted to only provide guns to lawful owners. Furthermore, if gun owners registered their weapons, it would more adequately provide law enforcement the necessary information to keep track of firearm purchases and make sure that all sales are legal. My opponent talked about society being weaker from gun control but I think we see that gun control has lessened our crime rate. These statisitcs rarely accouns for the grwoth on population and the increase in firearms themselves. While most Americans oppose an outright ban on all handguns, there is considerable support among the public for stricter laws governing firearms. http://partners.nytimes.com... :\"Are you aware that the gun related crime rate in the US is twice that of Israel?\": My opponent here attempts to compare the USA with Israel. There are many differences but the only one we need is the population difference. USA is one of the most populated countries in the world and will be top of any poll or rate. Americans continue to trend toward holding attitudes that are more in favor of gun rights. While solidly against a ban on handgun possession, Americans are nonetheless about equally likely to say they favor stricter laws on firearm sales as to say these laws should not change. I will like to conclude that guns laws are needed to protect society not halter it. I thank my opponent for this debate. Vote Con~",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for this debate. ==My arguement and rebuttal== ::\"My point still stand that if we are required to carry a sidearm at all times, criminals would be very cautious. Crime rates would plummet.\":: How do we know this is true. Maybe criminals would become more agressive and in return citizens would be more agressive. This would cause alot of distress on society. ::\"If you were a criminal, would you attack someone knowing they and there whole family had sidearms? \":: Maybe not directly! But I doubt this would halt the criminal but rather look for more secluded route to accomplish the fact that he is a criminal and will continue to be. 'Gun control\u2018 means the efforts of the government or the authoritarian body to keep a check on the selling-purchasing and using of the guns by the citizens within their jurisdiction area. They encompass the sale, purchase, ownership, usage and the distribution. The subject of gun control has always created a political and social debate regarding the restriction and availability of guns and firearms. In American politics for instance, gun control has been a controversial issue that has not been easy to manage or control. Gun control is a law that is used in deciding whether a citizen can own a gun or not. It is a law established to ensure that guns are not owned by criminal minded people but by people who are victims or are helpless against crime. :Pro stated: \"The point still remains that criminals are not going to heed these \"laws\". : Those people, who are in support of gun control, say that a gun is meant to kill and the less available it is in the society, the safer the society will be, while those against it say that whether guns are restricted or not, it does not change anything because guns do not kill, people do. Those in support say that gun control will ensure that guns will not fall into the hands of children and teenagers, while those against it argue that with gun control those children and teenagers will not be able to defend themselves in the face of crime because they are not protected. One of the common arguments for gun control is that it helps to reduce the ability of criminals, juveniles, kidnappers, bandits etc to own or posses a gun, firearms and ammunition. These advocates for gun control argue that the availability of guns can be successfully reduced only by strict federal measures. Many a time, crime and morality statistics are used when it comes to dealing with the debates on arguments for gun control. For instance the number of murders committed per year, with a gun, by people within the age range of 14-24 years, increased at a rate of 173% from the year 1985 to the year 1993 and later, it went down by around 47% from the year 1993 to the year 1999. On the contrary, my opponent is a segment of population that does not believe in Government imposing laws over acquisition of gun. :Pro states,\"If we let the government disarm us, whats next?\": What's next is the absence of guns altogether. The fact that there is a gun in a household is also a threat a family member can use it to perpetrate one crime or the other, which is why a lot of people are in support of the implementation of strict federal measures of gun control with penalties if anyone goes against the law. Federal government should insist and ensure that citizens comply with and adhere to those gun control laws, to reduce the rate of gun related deaths and make the society safe for citizens. ::\"No longer would we be shrinking behind the police, we would have the capabilities to stand up for ourselves.\":: This inclination by my oppoent is with this culture reflected in our movies, television, music and various other creative forms such as art. Which is based upon the theme of the so called \u2018gun culture'. Hence, they have been supporting the laws corresponding to the arguments about gun control and have been insisting the government to enforce them more strictly to lessen the chances of gun going into the hands of wrong people or children or young adults, so that the innocent people do not have to bear the brunt of fire-arms. I do not think my opponnt have given us a real good arguement for why 'gun control' is not needed. I thank my opponent for this debate. I send it back his way!",

            "premise": "I will organize my argument into the following sections:The Second AmendmentGun Violence in the United StatesGun Control MethodsConclusionI will now begin my argument: The Second AmendmentThe Second Amendment protects the individual's right to bear arms. It is indeed true that basic weapons for self-defense are acceptable, but I do not believe the amendment to be valid in other respects. \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" [1] We no longer have a need for a militia due to a risilient and couragous United States Military. Also, I will point out the amendment's original intention. At the time of the Constitution's framing, there were still many issues in the country. An issue was the lack of a strong military force. Due to this lack, the founders decided citizens need to be able of defending themselves. I agree with this view, but you cannot deny that an AK-47 in a typical American household is excessive. There are many ways the amendment can be interpreted, but I will point out that it has been misinterpreted for quite some time. I will rewrite the amendment in the way many citizens interpret it:\"A well regulated mob, being necessary to the security of a free people, the right of the people to keep and bear any arms at all, shall never be denied.\" Deny what I just wrote. Please, I welcome the debate. I don't, however, want to hear anything based on misinterpretations. I want facts, which many people opposing gun control surely lack. \"It is an absolute truism that law-abiding, armed citizens pose no threat to other law-abiding citizens.\" [2] Not all Americans are law-abiding. Due to the lack of sophisticated gun control, the crime rate in the United States has increased by a considerable amount. \"The rate of U.S. violent crime went up last year for the first time in nearly two decades due to a jump in assaults...\" [3] The Second Amendment must be enforced, but it must not be misinterpreted. Gun Violence in the United StatesAs stated in my above argument, violent crime has increased in the United States. This is due to a lack of background checks, limited ammunition, etc. You cannot deny the crime that has occured in this country. And now I will tell you why these crimes occured: lack of gun control. Gun Control is mandatory. No assault rifle should be in the hands of any ordinary citizen. Only law enforcement and military members should have such a weapon. I recognize I am being a little biased, but I can't help it. I believe that guns for self-defense should be pistols and maybe shotguns. I do not agree with rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and assault rifles for self-defense. I believe in the Second Amendment, but I will never have a gun myself. The best defense for a household would be a home security system and a guard dog. That is my view. Please respect that. If you can deny what I said in this argument, I would be glad to hear what you have to say. I welcome the debate. I am afraid, however, that you may go too far with your view. Nothing is impossible. Gun Control MethodsThere are multiple methods of regulating guns. I would like to focus on background checks, limited ammunition, and the regulation of gun production. Background checks should be expanded so that we can ensure that people with a history of crime and/or mental illness to not receive a gun. Alongside background checks, there should be limited ammunition. What if the background checks were conducted incorrectly? What if this person did in fact have a history of crime and planned to use his new rifle to kill innocent children at a school? Each magazine should include a limited amount of ammunition, depending on the exact type of weapon and the damage level of the ammunition. Also, the level of gun production should be reduced. I have a simple math equation for you that I came up with:more guns available = more guns soldmore guns sold = more guns in the hands of violent citizensmore guns in the hands of violent citizens = more violencemore violence = more deathsI have an alternative for you:less guns available = less guns soldless guns sold = less guns in the hands of violent citizensless guns in the hands of violent citizens = less violenceless violence = less deathsI have a challenge for you when you write the next argument: Deny it. Prove me wrong. I have another simple equation:Gun Control + Reform of our Court System = UtopiaConclusionThe facts are the facts. The truth is the truth. \"In religious and in secular affairs, the more fervent beliefs attract followers. If you are a moderate in any respect - if you're a moderate on abortion, if you're a moderate on gun control, or if you're a moderate in your religious faith - it doesn't evolve into a crusade where you're either right or wrong, good or bad, with us or against us.\" - Jimmy Carter [4] Let's put our political affiliation aside. I am a Democrat, yes, but that does not distract me from the facts. The facts are these: Gun Control will positively influence the crime rate, both domestic and foreign. The Second Amendment can be interpreted in many ways, and many of these interpretations are incorrect and unjust. When Democrats say that guns must be regulated, hardcore conservatives - the TEA Party members especially - claim they want to take their guns away. These misinterpretations of the facts must end. Justice must be served.

I have many other things to do. However, I will resume making points in the coming rounds. Now, it is my opponent's turn to make his main argument. In the rounds after that, we will make rebuttals. I look forward to that. Also, I would like to point out that I have limited time. Therefore, I may post my next arguments close to the deadline.",

            "premise": "Thank you, Pro.I have three points I would like to make in regards to this issue:1. Guns laws do not work.2. States with higher concealed carry permits have less gun related crime.3. We have sufficient laws.Gun laws do not work--In 1976, Washington DC city council instituted extreme gun control measures. This law prohibited residents from possessing fully functional fire arms in their own homes. Restrictions for legal gun ownership in DC during this time period were:a) All guns must be kept unloaded.b) All guns must be rendered temporarily inoperable via disassembly or installation of a trigger lock.During this period of restriction, the murder rate was 73% higher than when the law was first implemented, and 11% higher than the rest of the US. [1] --Chicago, Illinois implemented a ban on handguns in 1982. This ban disallowed civilians from possessing handguns except for those registered prior to the law. During the ban period, murders committed with handguns rose by 40%. [1] States with higher concealed carry permits have less gun related crimes\u201cLott and Mustard (1997) found those states with a less restrictive law saw a 7.65% drop in murders. The new study examines data from 1980 to 2009, one of the biggest time periods in research of this kind. It also looks solely at gun crime, rather than violent crime which is the case in similar research. State level data on gun related murder is taken from the Supplementary Homicide Reports from the United States Department of Justice and the information on CCW laws was obtained from a variety of United States bodies.\u201d [2]States with the most gun control had the lowest gun ownership, the highest violent crime and murder rates, and the highest non-firearms murder rates illustrated in chart below. [3]We have sufficient laws nowCurrents laws include: It is illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in prison for the following people to receive, possess, or transport any firearm or ammunition: someone convicted of or under indictment for a felony punishable by more than one year in prison, someone convicted of a misdemeanor punishable by more than two years in prison, a fugitive from justice, an unlawful user of any controlled substance, someone who has been ruled as mentally defective or has been committed to any mental institution, an illegal alien,someone dishonorably discharged from the military, someone who has renounced his or her U.S. citizenship, someone subject to certain restraining orders, or someone convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor. It is illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in prison to sell or transfer any firearm or ammunition to someone while \"knowing\" or having \"reasonable cause to believe\" this person falls into any of the prohibited categories listed above. It is illegal to \"engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms\" without a federal license to do so. It is illegal for any federally licensed firearms business to sell or transfer any firearm without first conducting a background check to see if the buyer/recipient falls into any of the prohibited categories listed above. It is illegal for anyone except a federally licensed firearms business to sell, buy, trade, or transfer a firearm across state lines. [1] The current laws clearly restrict gun ownership and handling in a reasonable way in a similar fashion to which pro desires. Conceal carry permits generally require a safety/training course to be completed before approval. If Pro would like to advocate enforcing current laws better I agree. However, adding news laws would be redundant and pointless.I will make rebuttals to Pros argument in the next round.[1]http://www.justfacts.com...[2]http://www.science20.com...[3] http://slgop.org...",

A voter must first look to my \"findarticles.com\" evidence that sights a scientific study done to prove that it is the lack of enforcement of laws, such as the Brady Bill, that have led to an increase in gun violence in this country. b. A voter must look to my evidence from Third Way that also points to the lack of enforcement of these laws c. A voter must also look to my evidence that supports my alternate causality that sights socio-economic factors such as poverty. 2) My empirical examples of Canada and England prove that stricter gun control laws lead to less violence. This has directly answered PoeJoe's indict of my argument. He says I need evidence that gun control laws lead to less violence in America. But look at my evidence that points out that gun control laws, when enforced lead to less violence such as in England and Canada. 3) I have told a more logical story and provided better analysis in the debate, unlike PoeJoe's logical non-sequiturs. ---- So basically the voter has no reason to vote for PoeJoe. Enforcing the gun control laws that are already on the books, just like Canada and England have, would lead to less violence in America. Since there is is no way the PoeJoe's policy can reduce poverty in this nation and solve for the root causes of violence repealing the gun laws this nation has will increase the death due to guns in this nation.",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control Laws",
            "premise": "Glad that you'll argue even if you're on the other side :P 1. Assault rifles are argued to be unnecessary due to modern technology and advancements in the gun industry since the 2nd amendment was put into place. However, we do not have the right to bear arms so that we can defend ourselves from home invaders and criminals, we have the right to bear arms to protect ourselves and rebel back against potential tyranny. 2. Handguns are involved in #1 as well, but are easier and more probable for everyday carry outside of your home. They are the most probable weapon for protecting yourself outside of your home, away from your assault rifles. 3. I'm not aware of the specific types of safety enhancing technology, but as long as the gun does not lose its ability to be drawn and fired immediately, I will likely not have a problem with it. 4. I would have no issue with gun buyback programs because I feel they wouldn't have very much effect. People who buy guns are going to keep their guns, with no requirement to sell your guns then I find it unlikely that anyone will with the exception of financial crises. 5. I disagree with further background checks because all it will do it allow the government to easily prohibit certain people from buying guns. They would use very very minor misdemeanors as excuses to keep people from buying guns with the end goal of having few people that own them anymore. The process of background checks would be abused to reach the goal of having less people that own guns. 6. I disagree with high capacity magazine bans because there is no strong need to decrease the amount of ammo that one clip can have. I can see arguments posed with automatic rifles, in which I may agree with a limit on the fire rate of a gun, (Ex. no more than 4 bullets per second), otherwise I see no need for restriction. 7. Ammo bans have no use other than to slowly ban certain guns by banning all of the ammo it could possibly use, a bullet is a bullet, its going to go through you whether its a 40 cal or .556... 8. This is just another attempt at limiting and controlling guns bought by people. Say you closed the gun show loophole, then the government decides to pass a law saying \"guns can no longer be shipped in packages due to interceptions by terrorists\" and opens a limited amount of gun shops so that people have to drive hundreds of miles to buy guns. See how its now extremely hard for someone to get their hands on a gun? Its a restriction that could have a domino effect, eventually eliminating all ways for people to get guns. 9. There are no reasons to limit gun carrying. Therefore we should not limit open or concealed weapon carrying. 10. Limiting deadly force with guns would essentially be limiting the use of guns to almost 0. In the case that someone else has a gun, and you have a gun, there would be no probable way of disarming them without killing them ESPECIALLY if they are shooting at you and know you are there. Even if you shot both of their legs and they were crawling they would still be able to shoot back at you and kill you. Allowing deadly force is essential to protecting yourself. 11. The government has no right to confiscate anything from its citizens, \"by the people for the people\" right? More like \"by the power hungry, for the power hungry\". Confiscating guns would only give the government extreme and high power and would likely end in a dictatorship, what is a country that can't fight off its own government if the need arose?",

            "discussionTitle": "Gun control laws",
            "conclusion": "Gun control laws",
            "premise": "In America, many people in the government are attempting to pass laws pertaining to the usage of guns. They include rules that restrict the everyday usage of guns, effectively limiting the safety and protection that they can give us. Some of these gun control laws should not be implemented in the U.S because it would cause many unnecessary regulations and negative effects. On the list to be banned are 157 specifically named pistols, rifles and shotguns. Yes, there are many, many more guns out there than this. However, the proposed legislation ( http://www.feinstein.senate.gov...) also states the following regulations: The legislation bans the sale, transfer, manufacturing and importation of: All semi-automatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least one military feature: pistol grip; forward grip; folding, telescoping, or detachable stock; grenade launcher or rocket launcher; barrel shroud; or threaded barrel. This may sound reasonable at first, until you consider the fact that nearly all semiautomatic rifles bear a detachable magazine; for those who do not know, rifles are guns with a large barrel and stock that are loaded by putting bullets into a rectangular \u201cstorage compartment\u201d, or magazine. It is very reasonable to let citizens carry at least some form of semi-automatic firearm, for defense. These are not the only \u201cwidespread\u201d bans either. These people also propose to ban semi-automatic pistols with a detachable magazine, ammunition feeding devices capable of using more than ten rounds at once, and semi-automatic rifles with a fixed magazine that can shoot more than 10 rounds at once. When most people think of a \u201csemi-automatic\u201d rifle, they think of a machine gun. They think that these guns can fire many shots every second, with automatic fire and huge bullet capacities. In reality, however, these guns only fire one bullet per trigger press. It then loads a new bullet into the chamber, ready to be fired. If you consider this, banning these rifles goes against their written intentions. Their reasoning for the bans is stated at the top of the paper: Mass shootings in Newtown, Aurora, and Tucson have demonstrated all too clearly the need to regulate military-style assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines. These weapons allow a gunman to fire a large number of rounds quickly and without having to reload. If this is true, they should get rid of all rifles and automatic weapons. However, it clearly states that \u201cThe bill excludes 2,258 legitimate hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns by specific make and model.\u201d By doing this, they give criminals another two thousand guns to use, making the ban completely useless. The article also gives us a few reasons why it\u2019s necessary, but these reasons can be negated from their argument easily. They tell us that a previous assault rifle ban in 1994, which expired in 2004, was very clearly effective. They supply us with the information that over 350 have been killed since it expired. 350 people were killed by rifle in the year 2010. However, that number pales in comparison to murders by pistol, a weapon that is not automatic, with 6,000 murders (http://www.theblaze.com...). Many people would argue that these confinements will stop people from having the guns to kill with. Although they may limit the use to most citizens, real murderers can and will find other ways of getting the outlawed weapons. As of now, thorough background checks are required to buy a gun. With this in place, how does any criminal get their hands on a gun? They cannot get them through normal means, so they must use illegal trades and the like to get them. Strict laws have never stopped people from breaking the rules. It is not like there were no mass murders in the time period where the guns were illegal. for example, in 1997, a time where the assault rifles were banned, this happened: After he was expelled for having a gun in his locker, Kipland P. Kinkel, 15, a freshman at Thurston High, went on a shooting spree, killing his parents at home and two students at school. Five classmates wrestled Kipland to the ground before he was arrested. If somebody sets his heart on doing something, there is no way to stop him, for better or worse. For many years now, people have been trying to lay down a ban on \u201cassault weapons,\u201d guns that can fire large amounts of bullets at a time. There are many, many reasons that this should not be implemented into our society, including the ones listed above. It is useless in a lot of ways, allowing people to access thousands of \u201csporting\u201d rifles which are \u201cstrictly for competition.\u201d The United States would be better off without the law.",

            "discussionTitle": "Gun Control",
            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "I will begin my argument by asking my opponent to define what kind of gun control we are debating as he began the debate and this makes a large difference on the outcome of the debate and the points argued. For the purposes of this debate, we will argue gun control in general. The argument I will present will show statistically why gun control can and has worked if implemented correctly. Opening Statement: To determine the constitutional burden of any such gun control law we must first establish what we are talking about when we use the term \"gun control\" as the supreme court has come down both ways largely depending on the restriction in question. There are many gun control laws that have been found to be constitutional, like keeping felons and the mentally ill from obtaining weapons. While there are also gun control laws that have been deemed unconstitutional, like laws requiring the weapon be disassembled at all times and the ammo kept in a different room than the weapon. Pro-gun advocates like my opponent, the NRA, and the RNC would have you believe that on the issue of gun violence in general, the person behind the gun is entitled to the entirety of the blame and the weapon used deserves none. In reality, they share the blame. Gun Control will result in less gun violence: My opponent does not specifically cite his first statistic about the number of gun-related deaths per year. But he does show that the United States has a problem with gun violence. He then makes his first point by assuming that someone whom cant obtain a firearm will simply use a knife or bat and not only continue out their originally planned crime, but kill as many people with a knife or bat while doing so. This is simply an irrational line of thinking and is not the case. Quoting the conclusion of a study done from 1981 to 2010 by the Boston University School of Public Health looking at the correlation between gun ownership and firearm homicide rates, \"We observed a robust correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and higher firearm homicide rates.\"[1] Again, I ask my opponent to cite his statistics. I would like to receive an actual peer reviewed study that shows that the supposed fact that 50% of American households have a gun prevents home invasions. My opponents claim that the United Kingdom is statistically worse that the United States and South Africa concerning violent crime is flat out false. The British definition [of violent crime] includes all \"crimes against the person,\" including simple assaults, all robberies, and all \"sexual offenses,\" as opposed to the FBI, which only counts aggravated assaults and \"forcible rapes.[2] This explains the disparities shown in my opponents sources. A look at exact numbers shows that in the U.S. you are nearly 4 times more likely to be murdered than in the U.K. [3] The U.S. burglary rate is also 184.3 per 100,000 higher than the U.K.[3] As for the notion that guns are a deterrent to home invasions and that statistics will lay on the side of the homeowner, I cite this studies conclusion, \"Guns kept in homes are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal accidental shooting, criminal assault, or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.\"[4] The rates of murder in Chicago and Detroit don't prove that gun control doesn't work, they underline the need for stricter federal regulations. The study I am about to cite looks at where the guns used to commit these murders in Chicago, Illinois are purchased. \"More than half of these guns \" nearly 10,000 or almost 58 percent \" originate from outside the state of Illinois. More than 3,000 guns come from Indiana, and another 1,000-plus come from Mississippi\".[5] So its not very simple at all. If you have a city with tough gun-control regulations but a state or surrounding states with lax gun-control regulations, it undermines the gun-control regulations put in place by that city because weapons can simply be procured in other city/states around it and brought in. Guns in Schools: The idea that when a shooting is going on and everyone is in shock, we need more guns in the area that could just as easily be used to kill even more people, accidentally or not just doesn't make sense. For example, how do we know that the armed guards you are proposing are immune to mental instability? So now, with armed guards, we could have a situation where the person going on this rampage is highly trained, knows the layout of the school, the schedule of the employees, exactly where children will be at certain times, where the closest exit is, etc. The same applies to arming teachers. Furthermore, Columbine had an armed guard. Something I would like to point out is that I can see you have put no thought into the cost of these armed guards. How many per school? Lets say they make $50,000 per year. There are 67,000 elementary schools in the United States.[7] If we hired 6 guards per school, that's about 400,000 guards. That's 20 billion dollars a year just for elementary schools. That's not including junior-high or high schools. Then what stops the gunman from just shooting up the soccer game down the street? The point is, the solution to gun violence is not more guns. A point you don't address when you make knives seem just as deadly as firearms is the skill needed to successfully use a knife in a manor which inflicts as much permanent damage as a firearm in the same situation. Then what about your range of motion with a knife vs. a gun? For a knife attack to be of any success the target must be within arms length. This then greatly restricts the effectiveness of a knife as a mass murder weapon. A knife may kill many on a subway, but how will it fare on an open campus where students are much more spread out and a firearm would allow one assailant to kill many people with relative ease. There's an old saying, don't bring a knife to a gun fight. Your \"Gun control not really gun control\" argument is not at all supported by the source you cited. Furthermore, we have democratically elected leaders to protect us from tyranny, armed combat where people lose there lives is never the first option. No one in the United States Legislature or myself is proposing enacting a police state and forcing all people to give up there weapons or receive the death penalty. That's just ridiculous and has no merit within this debate. Final Rebuttals and Closing Argument: We are not debating an all-out gun ban. We are debating gun-control. There is a large difference. Do you mean you will not abide by gun regulations or can you somehow speak for everyone who owns a gun? A gun buy back would be a start, but again, do you mean you won't sell your guns or do you have some ability to speak for the majority when you make these claims? Your last point makes absolutely no sense. What do you mean \"People won\"t sell their drugs, even when that\"s 100% illegal.\" Your now comparing two separate markets that are absolutely nothing alike. Guns are not addictive like most drugs are. Gun buyers don't continue to buy guns regardless of the price unlike drug addicts who will pay anything due to their immense addiction to them. If criminals don't follow laws, then why do we have laws? Why make murder illegal when criminals don't follow laws? Gun-control laws can and do work when implemented correctly.

Also, there has been many events in history where this was true - alcohol prohibition in the 1920's and video game ban in China. Guess what happened - people drank alcohol and played video games even more illegally. I agree that guns should not be owned by everybody, but if they are mature and responsible enough to not use it for criminal activity, then why not? You state that again you only want psychos and criminals to not have guns, yet you stated earlier that all should not have guns. Opponent appears to be contradicting themselves and constantly changes their stance of gun control. That is what I have said; put stricter laws only on psychos and criminals, and not on common citizens - you agree and disagree with me at once. I think you need to re-word your arguments so that they will not be used to opponent's advantage. Opponent says if all are allowed to have guns, that would ensue total chaos. Yet opponent keeps going back and forth, stating that only psychos and criminals should not have guns, then state otherwise. What are you trying to argue? Which side are you on? Please make it more clearer in the final round in order to understand what you are stating for opponent and voters' sake. Opponent then attempts to clarify things a bit by giving an example, but that example itself is flawed and hard to comprehend. How does making guns responsible for one person even if others use it related to gun control? Your example was great until the end; instead of that, opponent should have stated the obvious: that that person would have died for keeping the gun safe.",

The court cases you have listed - especially Heller v. District of Columbia - support my point: the second amendment must not be misinterpreted. That is what I have said in the previous round. It seems we agree on some issues, while we disagree on others. I will admit that there are some negative influences when you increase gun control, but there are also many benefits that one cannot simply ignore:\"There is no question, of course, that guns figure in countless murders, suicides and accidental deaths. Over the five years ending in 1997, the Justice Department says, there was an average of 36,000 firearms-related deaths a year. (Fifty-one percent were suicides, and 44 percent homicides.) Determining whether particular gun control laws would have, on balance, prevented some of those deaths is difficult.\" [1] There are three possibilities: 1. Gun Control laws decrease the crime rate.2. Gun Control laws increase the crime rate.3. Gun Control laws have nearly no effect whatsoever on the crime rate.I will support possibilitiy one and three. The crime rate will be influenced by gun control, whether it be a major influence or a minor influence. However, one cannot deny that there will be some influence. Some of the sources I will list will support me, some will support you, and some will support both of us. I do believe, however, that the sources I will list will strengthen my stance. \"However, the acts of violence themselves and gun control show that there may be a correlation between the availability of guns and crime. What the relationship is still undetermined for such contradictory data exists that can trump and repel arguments given by both sides of the gun control debate, pro gun control and against gun control.\" [2] You cannot deny that there will be a relationship between gun control laws and the crime rate. I will admit that some states have gun control laws that are too strict and that some states have too weak gun control laws. However, let's put party aside and work together for the betterment of the American society. We can begin by expanding a few aspects of gun control. You cannot deny that we need background checks, limited ammunition, and a regulation of gun production. We will need to improve security measures in order to ensure that schools, malls, movie theatres, and other public places are safe from violence. Both gun control and security measures will ensure that crime is DECREASED. The crime rate as a whole may stay about the same, but I assure you, there will be a positive influence once sophisticated gun control is enacted. I recognize that this debate is about gun control specifically, but I would like to point out some other ways to reduce crime: We need to reform our education system, increase spending in security, reform the tax code, and assist the people that are troubled, depressed, and maybe mentally ill. These measures, alongside gun control, will ensure that crime is decreased. I do not believe that the points you have are sufficient enough to support your claim. You will need to find new evidence.

A study conducted by Fox and Delateur asserts \u201cmass shootings have remained stagnant over 34 years, averaging 20 a year, and that few are committed by the sorts of mentally deranged individuals that are commonly portrayed in the media.\u201d [4] The study debunks the myth \u2018Mass murders are on the rise\u2019 by using FBI statistics and looking at any mass murders occurring between 1976 and 2011. Other sources such as \u201cMother Jones\u201d limit the definition of mass murders and show a distorted view unlike the Fox and Delateur study which is a comprehensive study. \u201cThe number of murder rates in Rhode Island, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Hawaii are very low. \u201c My opponent does not provide any evidence for this claim. \u201cIn my research, I have found that other countries besides the United States have a low murder rate compared to the united states.\u201d Pro has not provided any evidence for his assertions. In fact, the link Pro provided in his opening statements actually shows union gun control, prohibition, and post-JFK assassination gun control corresponding to increasing the homicide rate in the United States in the related time frames.

            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. My argument will be simple and to the point. Gun control doesn't work. I will provide my reasons and statistical data. I will also provide the positives to the right to bear arms. Introduction In the US the right to bear arms is a constitutional right. The framers and those who amended the constitution had a reason for doing so. Instead of banning all guns we, as a nation, need to keep guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens and take the guns away from the criminals and the civil disobedient. Democrats and other anti-gun ideology argue that it\u2019s the guns fault if someone is shot. Pro-gun advocates will argue that it\u2019s the person behind the gun that\u2019s at fault. Banning guns will cause a spike in violent crime and an incentive to attack others against their will. Guns allow people to rightfully defend themselves against an attacker. Taking away that right will only lead to more violence. Gun control will result in more violence There are 30,000 gun-related deaths a year in the US. If gun control was passed those 30,000 will turn into knives or bats. People will not stop themselves from killing someone when they don\u2019t have a gun at hand. People will resort to other methods utilizing knives, bats etc. The UK is one of the most Gun free countries in the world yet Britain is the most violent country in Europe. Britain is also statistically worse than the US and South Africa. In the US roughly 50% of households have a gun. This statistic acts as a deterrent to home invaders. If this statistic were to drop we would see a rise in home invasions/robberies. Not sure if you live in the US but two of the most democratic cities with imposed gun control, Chicago and Detroit, are the most violent cities in the US with some of the highest crime rates. Both of these cities are Gun free zones. Well its simple, if you take the guns out of the hands of the law abiding citizens then the civil disobedient folks will take that to their advantage. http://www.infiniteunknown.net... http://www.washingtonpost.com...; Mass shootings in gun free zones Mass shootings are more likely to occur in gun free zones. Most mass shootings in the past 20 years have occurred on school campuses (gun free zones). Schools became popular for mass murderers around the time when Gun Free School Zones act of 1994 was passed. Most of all mass school shootings have occurred after 1994. To stop these mass shooting we need to propose legislation that will allow schools to hire armed security guards. This will not only create jobs but keep school zones safe and act as a deterrent for mass murders. We need to keep the guns away from the mentally unstable. If guns were banned, people and the mentally unstable will find ways to inflict harm on the masses. Let\u2019s look at china. China is a strict gun-free zone. Yet we find many mass stabbings. A man in china killed 33 people on a knife wielding spree. He injured over 120. That spree is just one of many. Please see the links for more. http://www.nbcnews.com... http://www.american-partisan.com... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... Gun control not really gun control? The framers of the US constitution implemented the rights to bear arms to prevent a tyrannical government from being too powerful and controlling of its own people. Philippine\u2019sDictator Ferdinand Marcos, imposed strict gun control almost immediately after he took office. Those who didn\u2019t turn their guns into the nearest police station/military based would receive the death penalty. Like most dictators the purpose of these strict gun control laws are to weaken the power of the people so more power will be held to the central government. You can see this throughout Stalin and Hitler\u2019s time as dictators. Putting guns in the hands of the people will not only protect them from other people, but from an oppressive government as well. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Gun ban in the US A gun-ban in the US will be impossible. There are over 300 million guns in the US, including both registered and non-registered. Taking 300 million guns off the street will be an impossible task. Due to the American gun culture, people will not abide to any form of legislation that will take away peoples guns. Gun culture in the US is the stronger than any country. Some might argue that we should implement a gun-buy back. People will not be willing to sell their guns. People won\u2019t sell their drugs, even when that\u2019s 100% illegal. Illicit drugs in the US have always been illegal, exceptions for some drugs. People will always find a way to acquire them and use them. The law abiding citizens will abide by the law while those who don\u2019t will find ways to obtain guns. s://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com...; alt=\"\" /> s://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com...; alt=\"\" />",

            "premise": "Please forgive that my posts are not cleanly formatted. I am using my cell phone as my laptop is no longer functional. I will begin my argument by showing that American courts have repeatedly supported the rights of an individual to keep and bear arms. All of these cases should be viewed as an extension of the Second Amendment. The cases I am referring to are as follows: -Presser V. State of Illinois (1886) *1 \"But in view of the fact that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force of the national government as well as in view of its general powers, the states cannot prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security.\" Miller V. United States (1939) *2 \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \"shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment, or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State, 2 Humphreys (Tenn.) 154, 158. The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\" While this case appears to be contrary to my side of the debate, I would like to highlight two portions of the case. 1.) The milita is defined as all males physically capable of acting for the common defense. As women are a significant portion of todays armed forces and allowed to serve in a combat role, a modern militia would imply virtually everyone. 2.) \"When called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\" Thus supporting private civilian ownership of modern firearms. In regards to the aspect of the case regarding the legality of a sawn off shotgun, I wish to remind you that they are legal with the proper process and tax stamp as outlined in the gun control act of 1968. Heller V. District of Columbia (2008) *3 \"The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\" 2. \"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court\"s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller\"s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.\" Pp. 54\"\"56. -Peruta V. City of San Diego (2013) (posting a summary on this one as it does a good enough job explaining) *4 Plaintiffs filed suit challenging California's concealed handgun laws. At issue was whether a responsible, law-abiding citizen had a right under the Second Amendment to carry a firearm in public for self-defense. The court concluded that the right to bear arms included the right to carry an operable firearm outside the home and that carrying weapons for the lawful purpose of self defense was a central component of the right to bear arms. The Second Amendment required that the state permit some form of carry for self-defense outside the home. The California scheme did not allow the typical responsible, law-abiding citizen to bear arms in public for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Because the Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits eschewed history and tradition in their analysis of the constitutionality of such regulations, the court found their approaches unpersuasive. Accordingly, the court concluded that the district court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the Second Amendment claim because the County's \"good cause\" permitting requirement impermissibly infringed on the Second Amendment right to bear arms in lawful self-defense. On to a rebuttal. You stated that an AK-47 in a typical American household was excessive. Current estimates put the number of modern sporting rifles (semi-automatic, detachable box magazine) in America at somewhere around 30 million. Meaning that they currently are in fact typical in an American household. With the population at somewhere around 315 million, that is a MSR in one in every ten homes. Which is unquestionably \"in common use.\" According to FBI homicide statistics *5 from 2011, only 323 murders were committed using rifles in that year. For comparison, on average 77 people per year choke to death on hot dogs. By the numbers... an assault rifle is only 4x more likely to kill you than a hot dog. In regards to- \"A well regulated mob, being necessary to the security of a free people, the right of the people to keep and bear any arms at all, shall never be denied.\" I will not deny that there are those on BOTH sides who currently believe that is the case. I say on both sides due to the large number of liberals who are completely ignorant of past/current gun control legislation and believe fully automatic weapons are readily available for anyone at anytime. Which is just not the case. \"It is an absolute truism that law-abiding, armed citizens pose no threat to other law-abiding citizens.\" [2] \"Not all Americans are law-abiding. Due to the lack of sophisticated gun control, the crime rate in the United States has increased by a considerable amount.\" It is exactly because not all Americans are law abiding that the right to keep and more importantly bear arms is an essential right. Studies continually find that citizens with permits to carry a concealed weapon are responsible for a disproportionately LOW amount of crime. In response to your statement that assault rifles should only be owned by law enforcement and military members, nearly half of the owners of MSR's are present or former military/LE. I would argue that just as congress shall enact no law that does not equally apply to them as it does to civilians; gun control should not restrict any firearm from a civilian while permitting a police officer have it. I believe the opposite holds true as well. Not really a point of rebuttal, but you are correct in saying that a self defense weapon should be a pistol and maybe a shotgun. This is due to the over penetration which would result from using a rifle caliber. Over penetration is also the reason nearly all self defense rounds are hollow points. I wouldn't choose a shotgun simply because I can't control where that shot will go. Then again, a shotgun does have the advantage that you probably won't have to shoot after you pump. In regard to your equations which are a vast oversimplification of a larger problem... I present to you an excerpt from a harvard study on that exact topic. *6 \"\"the burden of proof rests on the proponents of the more guns equal more death and fewer guns equal less death mantra, especially since they argue public policy ought to be based on that mantra. To bear that burden would at the very least require showing that a large number of nations with more guns have more death and that nations that have imposed stringent gun controls have achieved substantial reductions in criminal violence (or suicide). But those correlations are not observed when a large number of nations are compared across the world.\" In regards to your closing statement, specifically: \"the TEA Party members especially - claim they want to take their guns away. These misinterpretations of the facts must end.\" I wish to direct you to look into what is currently happening in New York and Connecticut. Basically that is exactly what is happening. In a display of patriotism and testicular fortitude, Connecticut MSR owners have overwhelmingly ignored the mandated registration. Leaving gun control proponents in an interesting situation... how do you respond when you've just turned potentially as many as 100k citizens into felons? Do you act with force against previously law abiding citizens? Locking them up is certainly not an option as it would cost more than the state earns annually. They are left with a choice between not enforcing it/repealing it or sending SWAT teams against a significant portion of their population. Which would most certainly do more harm than maintaining the status quo. To the gun owners of Connecticut- Stand strong.

            "premise": "=====REBUTTALS===== \"If certain firearms serve no purpose other than to cause harm, or provide unnecessary firepower, then it is a sound and logical choice to ban them since they have the potential to cause great malice without serving a practical and benign need to the everyday citizen.\" This doesn't make sense. So your saying you agree that people need self defence and thus guns are justified, but then go on to contradict yourself by saying that we shouldn't allow them because they have the potential to cause harm. So I could say that they have the potential to cause good, by using them for self defence. We won't always be able to count on the police force in time, so why ban guns from citizens, when that may be their only lifeline? \"The presence of a weapon in the home, instead of increasing home safety, actually leads to a higher chance of someone in your home being the victim of gun violence; whether it be from domestic violence, a curious yet unfortunate child, or the escalation of force a criminal might use if you pull a gun on him.\" Gun laws require that in order to obtain a fire arm in your home, you must have a safe to safely store them in.http://en.wikipedia.org...This deters children from entering, criminals from entering, etc. The only person who should know the combination should be the owner of the gun. So this argument cannot be looked to as a child cannot harm themselves in this scenario. \"Again, this is why weapons handling and the bearing of arms is best left to the professionals in law enforcement agencies and the military.\"In order to own a gun, an individual must complete basic gun courses in order to purchase one.http://corneredcat.com...You must show proof of completing the courses neccesary to own a gun as well, among having several other things. Gun laws are strict, and not so easy that any one and their kids can purchase one without the neccesary requirements being completed. People who own gun have a basic understanding and knowledge of how to operate them. Thus we would be giving the government too much power if they are the only ones who own guns. The reason we have gun laws in the first place is to prevent government intrusion. Just like in the revolutionary war, owning and operating guns will prevent government from transforming into a dictatorship.\" If we were to interpret the second amendment in the most literal sense, we as citizens would be allowed to own and operate any piece of military equipment we could afford. Recoilless rifles, grenades, heavy machine-guns, mortars, etc.\" Okay so I get that in this point you are trying to say that the constition can be taken literally. This point is irrelevant however. We all have a basic understanding of what the constitution is saying when we can bear arms. Manipulating the meaning of the constitution is semantics. Most citizens operate with basic weapons that can be used for protection; Handguns, small semi-automatic weapons, etc. If you want to get literal, I could easily say that the government owes me a pair of bear arms, seeing as we have the \"right to bear arms\".http://www.google.com...Point is, let's not get to literal with this. We understand the constitution and it's moral values on society.\"I would like to reiterate that my position in this debate is that I want more gun control, not that I want to ban firearms outright\"I am sorry, but I feel like this is a little unfair. I would not have accepted this debate if I would have known you would be making these types of arguments. The thing I find unfair about this, is that you don't give the voters a choice in whom they vote for. You could easily play both side of the fence arguing this way, by saying \"Well all arugments fail. I never said I dis-agreed with this, just that there should be exceptions\". So you then put you opponent in a trap. I will argue on further, however, I would like the audience to please ignore these types of arguments. This is all with the utmost respect, mr.Brooks.-PERSONAL DEFENCESo you do claim that a person has a right to self defence, and you give an example of why they should use guns for self defence. But you start out saying that not every one has this right. I would like to why, and your reasoning behind other people going about their daily lives, and why they are not entitled to the same obligations as the shopkeeper.-HUNTING Agreed on all points. Argument says nothing about why we should add more gun control policies :)-SHOWMANSHIP Here you contradict your whole argument. You say that guns used for showmanship are absolutely no harm, thus they can be kept. What makes them less harmful than a normal fire arm? The can go off, or cause harm just like any other firearm. If these kind of guns can be kept, then all guns should be kept. \"Handguns are designed as personal defense weapons, and can be concealed on an everyday person for purposes of self-protection in cases where it is warranted.\"Hand guns have the same ability to stop a persons life as an assualt rife does. When used the right way, and fired at the right part of the human body, both potentially do the same thing. So again, if a person can have this type of firearm, then why not other legal firearms sold by gun shows and gun dealers. \"If you lower the supply and accessibility of illegal firearms, then the demand for them goes up and they eventually become unaffordable to criminals.\"Again, as I have said before, You are thinking nationally. We must think internationally here. Just like criminals can still obtain drugs, they can obtain guns through arms dealers throughout different countries. Or even create them, as drugs are created. Continuing use of guns is evident through continuing use of drugs. Banning or even regulating gun control will prove worthless. =====MY CASE==== RIGHTS\"As I stated in the counter-rebuttals, your rights end where another person's begins. The only reason gun control legislation can pass is because the courts and the constitution recognize this crucial fact.\" This argument works both ways. By not having and owning guns for self defence purpose we are susceptible we are allowing that principle to work against us. We can lose our rights by not having our own defence mechanisms. RESPONSIBILITY \"Crime will never cease, there will always be crime. It is crime that involves gun violence that is the main issue here, for that is what we seek to curtail by enacting further gun control legislation.\"Even you said early on in your rebuttals: your rights end where another person's begins. This means we have a certain responsibility to go along with the use of guns. Which you must agree with since you agree to owning guns for self defence.FREEDOM \"Imagine a nation where the Bloods and the Crips do drive-by shootings with .50 caliber machine guns mounted on their Cadillacs\"This is exactly why gun control is a horrible concept. It limits citizen protection from the exact scenario you are showing. \"Oh wait, it's okay because we can just give even bigger guns to private citizens and let them shoot it out.\"We have had the right to bear arms for about 200 years. My questions, how often do you see this happening with everyday life? Gun control is harmful because it is taking away our freedom before even allowing responsibility to take effect.====CONCLUSION==== I have accurately refuted all of my opponents points, and he agrees with me that gun control is detrimental. Please vote CON.Thanks.",

            "premise": "====FRAMEWORK====I will be going over rebutalls, before proceeding on to votes.===== REBUTTALS===== \"You are supposed to argue for less gun control, and I am to argue for more gun control. That was stated both by imabench in his forum topic, and by me in round 1.\"I agree with this, however I also agree that you have succesfully made arguments that have defeated your own case as you have argued pro control throughout this entire debate on several occasions. Thus I must assume that if you agree that some good control is good, there should be no reason why you should not think that ALL gun control is good. \"I have made it clear where we should strengthen gun control. This is not arguing both sides of the fence, as you put it, but arguing one side from different angles.\"To be honest, all me and the voters are going to see from this, is you conceding that gun control is okay. Which you have already done on several occasions. Thus since you believe that guns should be kept for some reasons, how are we going to regulate them so strictly, if we do not know most people's motives? Why complicate things and put any restrictions on gun control? Also what exactly are the restrictions were going to be supposedly putting on in the AFF world?\"I've given clear cases where an individual should have access to firearms, and where they should not. An individual who has a reasonable chance of being the victim of violence should have access to a firearm, whereas a person who does not should not have one, because he is more likely to cause harm to himself, which outweighs the benefit of having one during a home invasion or mugging.\" Glad you brought this up. You make gun control policies sound all fine and dandy, but you have yet to explain a situation of how we should enforce these policies. Even if you think we should restrict them to only certain people, how do we determine which people need guns? How do we determine which people are likely to have a home invasion? Given that the PRO requires BOP, and this is already the final debate round, all of the questions have gone un-answered. Even if the audience does buy your loopholey arguments that support the CON side, how are they ever going to see how enforcing gun laws is okay, if they don't even know how to enforce it, if you haven't given me or them, anything to look to?\"Secondly, they are not required by law in all 50 states. I can see why you'd advocate for their being required by law though, and I agree with your assertion that we must have more gun control over those who have weapons for self-defense.\"Even if you agree that we should have gun safe, this in no way helps your case in the slightest. Your goal is to prove why we shouldn't have guns. We have hundreds of safety procedures in act that go along with our gun rights, but removing or controlling them is not the answer. \"So children are still at risk in some states while there is a gun in the home.\"You can safely cross applt my resposibility Contention here. Every person has a basic right. Once that right is taken away, we lose it. But that doesn't mean we should never get the right in the first place. Responsibility means keeping the firearm a safe distance away from a child who may happen to wander upon a firearm. Also, even if not every state is confined to keeping weapons in safes, most laws require that a firearm not be loaded when being stored. If a firearm is not loaded, a wandering child should not have this problem. National law also requires that children be under direct supervision. So again cross apply my responsibility contention here as well.\"Also, I highly doubt that everyone owning a handgun or hunting rifle is going to deter the federal government if they ever decide to oppress us.\"I am sure thats what the british thought too during the revolutionary war. Independence can always be breeched when needed, there are plenty scenario's all over the world. India, Pakistan, The United States, etc. Guns enforce our freedom from government tyranny.\"The shopkeeper has a much higher risk of being mugged than the average joe walking the streets. That's the point I was trying to make. If there is a reasonable chance of you being the victim of a violent crime, then you should be able to carry a weapon for self-defense or have a weapon in your home for self-defense. As I've stated in this debate before, (and provided evidence for,) having a firearm in the home increases the chance of a member of your family being the victim of gun violence, so unless there is a good reason for you have a gun, you do not need one\" This claim is highly unsubstantiated for a few reasons. 1. You still have yet to offer a plan to carry this out.2. Why is a shopkeeper getting guns over anyone else? What about lawyers, doctors, Contractors, or any one else for that matter? Are they not entitled to their own safety and rights? How are any of them less likely to be mugged then a shopkeeper?3. This claim is unsubstantiated and lacks the evidence neccesary to be a proper argument. Thus it is a logical fallacy. \"I contradict nothing. Weapons used for showmanship shooting serve a purpose, just as hunting weapons do. Thus, they should be still be regulated, but not prohibited. They are less harmful than an assault rifle, or a machine-gun. It is absurd to suggest otherwise.\"Not in the slightest. They all serve the purpose of protection. Didn't you say that protection was an okay way to use gun control? \"I've already refuted this argument, I've given you examples of the capabilities of an assault rifle and the key differences it has from handguns. The ammunition used in handguns is not nearly as lethal, the handgun does not have the same rate of fire, the handgun is not as accurate and does not have the same range as an assault rifle.\"A guns purpose is to stop someone life. That is the point of your own self defence argument. So what difference does it make on how that gun is used to complete that action. Contra-diction. \"Buying weapons internationally will prove much more difficult and costly than buying locally. The prices on illegal weapons will continue to rise, and less and less criminals will be able to afford the weapons. Again, basic market principal; if you lower the supply, the price will go up.\"I explicitly cited drug abuse for this reason. Price doesn't matter. The people who will own and operate guns illegally are criminals. Price doesn't matter. Self defence is depleted when any sort of criminal owns a weapon and civilians do not. So you again contradict yourself.====MY CASE==== RIGHTS:ALL ARGUMENTS DROPPED. PLEASE EXTEND.RESPONSIBILITY:ALL ARGUMENTS DROPPED. PLEASE EXTEND .FREEDOM: \"The last thing we want is a shootout on the streets, the last thing we want is to turn poorer neighborhoods into warzones, where the weapons constantly get bigger and deadlier as the citizens try to keep up with the criminals.\"I have already refuted this. WE have had gun control for about 200 years. While there is a couple cases here and there where incidents have happened, having them has proved to be much better as we have used them for selfdefences. Our average civil life with gun control is not a gun control, so we have no reason to believe that it will ever be after retaining these rights for so long.====VOTERS====I feel I have won this debate for the following reasons. 1. In order for my opponents gun control policies to be effective, he requires a BOP strategy of how to implement them. He has not done so, thus we have no alternatives, or evidence to alternatives.2. My opponents arguments contradict his arguments. My opponent has conceded several occasions that guns ought to be held for self defence, hunting ans sports, yet also doesn't define who particulary gets these rights.3. My opponent has dropped 2 1/2 of the arguments on my case. Thus we must look to those when evaluating the round.I had great fun in this debate. Good luck to my opponent in the voting period, it's been a pleasure.",

            "premise": "Thank you for responding. R1 I need to clarify my position, gun control laws should be lessen back for law abiding gun owners. Why should law abiding citizens be punished because of the actions of deranged people. I would certainly not want someone who is mentally ill or violent to own a firearm, but there is nothing we can do about it other than arming ourselves to protect us from them. If someone wants to own a firearm they can get one illegally. Adam Lanza the Sandy Hook shooter broke 41 laws that day, more laws would not have stopped him. This also shows that gun control does not work as Connecticut already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. R2 \"This statement can be considered unreliable. One thing to note is that my opponent never cited a source with this information, and therefore cannot prove statistics do actually show this.\" \"In 1976, the Washington, D.C. City Council passed a law generally prohibiting residents from possessing handguns and requiring that all firearms in private homes be kept unloaded and rendered temporally inoperable via disassembly or installation of a trigger lock. During the years in which the D.C. handgun ban and trigger lock law was in effect, the Washington, D.C. murder rate averaged 73% higher than it was at the outset of the law, while the U.S. murder rate averaged 11% lower.\" The murder rate did not just average 73% higher over the span of 1 year, rather it rose exponentially over 30 years. This shows that areas with increased gun control there are more gun related crimes, specifically murder. DC is not the only example, numerous other cities have shown the same results such as Chicago. When the handgun laws of DC were overturned in 2006 the murder rate in DC has dropped exponentially. R3 The original intent, remains the same today, \"We have a tangible police force to protect us now\". The reason the right to bear arms exists is to protect us from the police and government forces. \"A free people ought to be armed.\" George Washington once said, without trying to make an ad hominem argument, I think the principle behind that quote remains true to this day. The right to bear arms is essential to protecting our liberties from enemies, even if the enemies are those who swore to protect us. R4 My argument here needs clarification, I understand you are not calling for a complete ban of firearm, my point here is that nobody has the right to limit my freedom to own a firearm. Yes, I will acknowledge that firearms are used for terrible things, but to judge all gun owners on the actions of the few is irresponsible and unfair. It is like judging freedom of speech by the actions of neo-nazis and the KKK. It simply isn't fair. \" illegal usage under purported claims of self-defense, and claims of gun self-defense are grossly exaggerated[3].\" \"legally owned guns are an instrument in all of those things more frequently than they are an instrument in self-defense.\" A government survey from the 90's shows that \"Government figures from the National Survey of Criminal Victimization suggest 100,000 uses a year of guns in self-defense against crime, the vast majority of these uses being the display of weapons to deter or dissuade.\" This was during a time of higher crime rates in the United States than today, also it is very difficult to measure how many firearms are used in self defense and protection because you cannot measure crimes not committed due to knowledge of firearms in a home or on a person. MAIN POINTS REBUTTAL P1 In order to argue against this I need clarification on what your overall position and what \"gun control laws\" are we debating. Specifically background checks or something else. P2 Foreign Nations: In order to understand why other nations with gun control laws have lower gun crime rates one must look at many factors specifically, culture and overall crime rates. In many nations such as Britain who have fewer gun murders than the US, when their gun control laws were enacted, the homicide rate rose in which guns were used and not used. Britain since has one of the highest violent crime rates in the western world. Also, the 12,000 statistic is unreliable as it does not consider how many of the firearms used were illegally purchased. Also while on the issue of other nations, Switzerland's gun related homicide is (for 2010) 40. In a country where people are required to own semi automatic weapons. Every male is required to own(http://en.wikipedia.org...) a SIG SG 550(http://en.wikipedia.org...) A 550 is capable of fully automatic fire. You have completely ignored the culture issue that is much larger than laws. Sources: http://www.justfacts.com... http://www.justfacts.com... http://www.cnn.com...",

            "premise": "Thank you for the arguments Pro, I am hoping for an insightful debate.Homicides vs AssaultsPro has only given one example of what he believes is a gun control success: Australia. Although the statistics he cited are true, it is only one part of the story. It focuses on a few factors alone. Joyce Lee Malcolm of the Wall Street Journal states, \"In 2008, the Australian Institute of Criminology reported a decrease of 9% in homicides and a one-third decrease in armed robbery since the 1990s, but an increase of over 40% in assaults and 20% in sexual assaults.\"[1] Pro has addressed homicide rates only, and has been silent about the amount of aggravated assaults.A quote taken from Source 2 states: \"Home Invasions \u2013 a crime for which Australia didn\u2019t even have laws before the gun ban because it never happened \u2013 are UP 21%\".What needs to be pointed out here is that guns can and are used to defend people from crime. Criminals can just obtain guns from the black market, so banning gun laws really isn't going to help. If anyone honestly thinks that criminals are going to follow the law, they are very wrong. In fact, it will paint civilians as targets since they won't be able to defend themselves. They will become more vulnerable to crime and assaults, as we have seen above.Australia vs United KingdomInterestingly enough, the UK struck down on guns the same time Australia did and seemed to have the opposite effect to what my opponent claims happened in Australia. In the graph below, we notice a spike in gun-related homicides shortly after the ban.In 1968, Britain put restrictions on possessing guns by requiring citizens to get a certificate from the police allowing them to obtain a shotgun. Following that law, the homicide rate average in England and Wales rose 52% higher since the law was put in place.[3] In 1997, the same year that Australia introduced its gun law, Britain confiscated nearly all guns in England, Scotland, and Wales. Subsequent to the 1997 law, the homicide rate rose another 15%.[3] If gun control works, why are we seeing the opposite effect in the UK? Let's take a more detailed look on the homicide drop in Australia...Closer Analysis on HomicidesAlso interesting is the fact that the homicide rate in Australia was decreasing at the same rate before the ban as it was after. Let's take a look at the following graph[4]: Here is a quote taken from Source 4:\"...Whether or not the homicide rate went up or down in Australia as a result of strict gun control laws imposed in 1997 is a fact that could have been checked by Times researchers. But they didn't, because facts wouldn't have given them the answer they wanted.Needless to say, the effect of Australia's gun ban has been extensively researched by Australian academics. As numerous studies have shown: After the gun ban, gun homicides in Australia did not decline any more than they were expected to without a gun ban.Thus, for example, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology, the homicide rate has been in steady decline from 1969 to the present, with only one marked uptick in 1998-99 -- right after the gun ban was enacted.\"My opponent is making a flawed contention by claiming it was the gun laws that lowered crime. As we have seen above, that is simply false.Concerning homicide rates, we can conclude that gun control has had little effect on Australia and a negative effect on the UK. We can conclude from this data that gun control just doesn't work.SuicidesGenerally the same thing has happened with firearm suicides. They began falling en entire decade before the buy back program began[5]. Obviously the drop in suicides isn't a result of the gun ban, but rather something else. Concerning mass shootings, it isn't that surprising that a country with 7% of people in proportion to the U.S.'s population hasn't had one in the last dozen-and-a-half years. It is a baseless assertion to credit gun laws with the lack of mass shootings, especially after seeing how ineffective it really has been on Australia's crime rates.Statistically speaking, car accidents kill more people than guns do. So according to my opponent's logic, we might as well ban cars too.Sources1. http://www.wsj.com...2. http://www.shtfplan.com...3. http://www.justfacts.com...4. http://johnrlott.blogspot.com...5. http://johnrlott.blogspot.com...",

            "premise": "-This post is based on laws in the USA- Gun Control Laws are designed to prevent incidents like Columbine and Virginia Tech from occurring. If an individual is so mentally unstable that they desire to shoot random classmates, it is not feasible to believe that a gun control law will stop them. If an individual truly wants to harm others, then they will try to do so regardless of laws or regulations. This greatly prevents the laws from serving their purpose (to prevent gun crime). If anything, gun control laws will increase crime. A saying often muttered in the Southern United States is, \"If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.\" This statement is often ignored but it is true. Criminals rarely go through the legal channels to obtain their firearm so it is easy to conclude that criminals will barely be affected by gun control laws. The average citizen will be the one affected. The only real accomplishment gun control laws will have is hindering law abiding citizens from exercising their 2nd Amendment right [[http://www.pierrelemieux.org/artaubin.html]] If citizens are heavily hindered from getting guns they will have a harder time protecting themselves. I believe that citizens should rely on law enforcement, but on average Seattle's emergency crews took 8 minutes 46 seconds to respond (by respond, I mean arrive and begin helping victims), Oklahoma City 7 minutes 36 seconds, Tulsa 8 minutes 48 seconds, Columbus, Ohio, 7 minutes 49 seconds, Charlotte 6 minutes 56 seconds, and Fresno took 22 minutes 11 seconds [[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/ems-day2-cover.htm]] . If you have no protection, what could happen to you in that time? In conclusion, I believe that gun control activists mean well but, in the end, these laws will cause more trouble than they're worth. If someone is determined to commit a crime using a gun, a law will not stop them. If they break one law (murder, robbery, etc.), they will not mind breaking another (gun control law).",

            "premise": "I must thank my opponent again for his full dedication to this debate.Rebuttals:\"Yes, a 1 \u2013 10 ratio. However, the crime difference is about a 3-8 ratio. Using this, we can see the ratio then becomes 3.75 \u2013 10.\"As I mentioned in the previous round as well, my opponent is the winner of the debate if we assume that petty crimes and major crimes count as equals. If however someone looks at my original reference another timehttp://news.nationalpost.com...and considering the agreed upon 1-10 ration between Canada and USA one can see that the corrected ratio between Canada and USA regarding the gun related crime stands on 1730/10129 a 5.85 ratio in favor of reduced gun related crime in Canada and a .51/2.97 a 5.82 reduced number of homicides with guns. As you can see introduction of gun control has clearly succeeded in controlling its target, that is reducing the major gun related crimes.\" Criminals would not follow the law and could obtain weapons without permission via black market. \"The problem with this statement is self revealing. It is true anyone can have access to guns if he tries really hard. But one has to admit that it is far more risky to get engaged in illegal black market gun trafficking and purchasing than it is when you can simply go to a sport shop and order your weapon of choice. The law enforcement can enact cracking laws which would make life hell for whoever traffics weapons in to the country. In Canada the penalty for possessing illegal arms is heavy and the trafficking of illegal arms is considered a capital crime. The advantage of control is incontrovertibly clear.\"Listen to this: My opponent has admitted guns deter crime.\" Now that's a disappointing argument from my opponent. Apparently after 3 rounds of debating my opponent sill has difficulty grasping the idea of the debate and my stand. I need to state it again. The debate is about gun control. not about forbidding the gun ownership. There is no point of argue that in a place where is considered private such as the privacy of one's bedroom and where the law enforcement cannot be trusted to act fast, it is the right of any citizen to defend himself and his family. There is nothing about gun control that prevents one from this. Still gun control proceeds with making clear that if it's about defending your household you won't necessarily need more than a handgun or a shotgun with limited ammunition at most. The lack of gun control on the other hand results in for instance and elderly lady buying the weapons mainly designed for the war zone, with virtually unlimited amount of ammo that her mentally unstable kid can use for committing a carnage in a school or other in a cinema. I hope firstly the audience and secondly my opponent realize the difference of the case and the importance of gun control from this perspective.\" \u201cThe law was rectified rather as a future measure than to address a problem. No wonder that the crime rate did not show a sharp change, since the law was not there to address an immediate problem.\u201d False, Canadian crime rate [3]:\"Unfortunately either my opponent failed to read or he didn't care to bring the amendment to the above phrase that he copied from my argument. That is the increased terrorist acts committed in the province of Quebec during the peaking intervals. That part of the country at that time was in a state of semi civil war. With military deployed in large cities such as Montreal. Thus the sharp increase in your census. But it wasn't an issue directly related to the public. If the terrorist groups such as FLQ proceeded with bomb terrorizing the country, that cannot be put on the census of the ordinary citizens. It is wrong to count political terrorist activities as ordinary civil gun crimes. \"2) this is a lie. And mass shootings have actually become more common since the 1970s [6].\" http://en.wikipedia.org...Above I've brought the same reference brought by my opponent with which he called my argument a lie! I request the audience to review the charts again and make a sound comparison to see if one can compare 3-4 shootout incidences with maximum 1 casualties to any of the carnage that one hears coming out of the States on a regular basis? Based on a sound judgment I clearly rest my case!=========\"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Chiefs of Police have not yet provided a single example in which tracing was of more than peripheral importance in solving a case.\"Considering Canada gun control laws I perceive that my opponent has confused two parts of the gun control. The Canadians do not consider the essence of gun control not to be effective, the part of the gun control law that the Canadians deem to be less effective yet still rows after rows of governments have refused to scrap, even though they keep giving promises to do so, is the long gun registry. The above phrase to my knowledge refers to the long gun registry problem. Still it's not hard to see the importance of the above sentence. No registered gun has to our knowledge been used for committing a crime. In other words no single person has gone to a sports shop, bought a gun and went to a mall for a shoot out! Gun control doesn't elliminate the gun related crime but properly applied and enforced it makes it extremely hard for the criminals and ill minded to exact their plans.Conclusion:Based on my arguments I have shown that gun control succeeds in reducing the crime in the field that is destined for. Gun related crimes. I leave it to the fair judgement of the audience to vote for the side with the stronger argument.",

In this year there were 7,910,100 crimes comitted, about 700000 were comitted with guns. There have been too many suicides because of guns. Also school shootings people! Innocent kids died because teenagers easily obtained guns! And this is why we should get rid of guns. We need too have compassion, we should have gun control laws that prohibit civilians to own guns, but the police and armed forces should be allowed to have them. With these laws murder rates will go down, according to www.justfacts.com there were 10,615 murders with firearms. Also there have been far to many accidents. Because of laws alowing us to carry guns, many children have died. In the case of Sandra Smith a 9 month old baby crawled up her dad's bed were there was a gun and shot herself by accident when playing with it. When people talk about that we need guns for protection, the government can start a program to trade firearms for tazers, that are not lethal. People could still be safe, and we could develop tazers that could shoot from a long range for more protection. In my opinion guns are to over-rated! We think we need guns for everything that involves protection, but guns have only brought trouble and disgrace into our nation.",

            "premise": "Rebuttals and New PointsYou wrote: \"So with that being the case, it could be easily be concluded that increased gun ownership has a direct effect on crime rates. In that they go down...\" I will disagree with you on that issue. If people have guns, there will obviously be a part of the population that is violent and has a criminal background. Now, if you were to increase the amount of guns being sold and reduced regulations, more people would have guns and, assuming the proportion remains the same, there will be a higher amount of criminals with a gun in their hand, thus resulting in more crime. Guns for self-defense are acceptable, but I will not agree with you when you say that 'more guns = less crime.' Yes, people should have the right to protect themselves, but regulations must be put in place in order to ensure violent individuals do not obtain a weapon. You write that \"banning them [assault weapons] would have a very small impact on the actual crime rate.\" That is true, yes, but wouldn't you save a life if you had the opportunity? Banning assault weapons may not impact crime by a large scale, but I will tell you this: Every life is precious. We must try to preserve every single one we can. The crime rate in the US is at a considerable height. Due to a lack of sophisticated gun control, the crime rate has increased over time. However, the Democrats are enacting intelligent gun control that has slowly began to impact crime. Please look at the following links to see statistics: http://www.policymap.com...http://www.andhranews.net...I will now respond directly to some of your points. \"Nations with stringent anti-gun laws generally have substantially higher murder rates than those that do not. The study found that the nine European nations with the lowest rates of gun ownership (5,000 or fewer guns per 100,000 population) have a combined murder rate three times higher than that of the nine nations with the highest rates of gun ownership (at least 15,000 guns per 100,000 population).\"I acknowledge that.\"Britons suffer 1,158,957 violent crimes per year, which works out at 2,034 per 100,000 residents. By contrast the number in notoriously violent South Africa is 1,609 per 100,000. The U.S., meanwhile, has a rate of 466 crimes per 100,000 residents, which is lower than France\"s, at 504; Finland\"s, at 738; Sweden\"s, at 1123; and Canada\"s at 935.\" These are other countries, not the United States. And also, I do acknowledge the numbers. However, I interpret the numbers in a different way than you do. \"Even with enhanced gun control there are over 300 million firearms in America. Guns don't just go away, with proper maintenance they can and do last over 100 years. Gun control would also fail to stop mass killings. Recently in China, 26 people were stabbed to death and another 140 were wounded. Bad people will always do bad things.\"First of all, this is China, not the United States, you are talking about. Secondly, I will acknowledge that violent crimes can be done with nearly any object: a knife, a rock, a rope, etc. However, gun control is the first step into the right direction. Once gun crimes have been reduced, we can focus on increasing security, police salary, education quality, counselor programs, etc. All problems in the universe can be solved. That is my belief. I support the second amendment in its original interpretation, but I do believe that there need to be regulations put in place to ensure that future crime can be prevented. Gun control can increase crime, yes, but it will have positive influences. Also, another measure of gun control I have addressed was decreased gun productions. If there are less guns available, there will be less people buying those guns, and less people using guns to violently kill other people. This you cannot deny. Now, gun control is essential. The American system is full with flaws. You can go into any gun store, show your driver's liscence, pay the money, and you have that gun. There needs to be a system similar to what Germany has. \"In Germany the possession of any firearm with a fire energy exceeding 7.5 Joule requires a valid firearms ownership license for any particular weapon.\" [1]If we were to implement this policy and added a few of the measures I proposed, we would be a nearly crime-free nation. I can assure you that. And also, I will post a link to prove to you how different the crime rates of the two countries are: http://www.nationmaster.com...I hope you are convinced.

            "premise": "Thank you Con for this debate. I do not argue to disarm law-abiding, responsible gun owners. I do not argue to strip American's of a constitutional right. I argue that we take sensible action and implement regulations that make it less likely that unstable people and those seeking to do us harm have easy, legal, \"no questions asked\" access to the weapons of their choice. Why you should vote Pro: 1) What We Have Does Not Work: As Con conceded, Guns are more prevalent and easier to access in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Let's assess how this has worked. We can choose to allow Con to compare the U.S. to war-torn, crisis-ridden countries far beyond saving from just gun control, and to just remove the deaths of thousands of African and Latino-Americans from the conversation to result in middling standings for the U.S. But the stats show that the U.S. is the runaway leader in homicides and firearm-homicides among countries of comparable HDI (the metric he introduced). One goal of lax gun control proposed by Con is better self-defense against crime. We can choose to believe the widely discredited studies and numbers provided by Con, based on a couple hundred phone calls and in which pulling out a gun during a vocal argument is considered \"self-defense\". Or we can believe the FBI, Department of Justice, Harvard Injury Control Research Center, and Stanford Law Review that showed us guns are used in self-defense in less than 1% of crimes, guns are used for aggression far more than they are for self-defense, and over the course of a decade and over 100 mass shootings, police and even unarmed citizens were far more effective at neutralizing mass shooters than armed citizens were. When I see these statistics, when I turn on the T.V. to see kindergartners and club-goers massacred, it's pretty clear the U.S. has a gun violence problem. Not a bomb violence problem, or a pressure-cooker violence problem, guns are the preferred weapons. If criminals had no preference for guns, and the weapons don't make any difference, they wouldn't be used in 69% of homicides. There is no minimizing the problem. And if guns are not to blame for these problems and they are unrelated to crime than they cannot be praised and credited for reductions in crime. Even worse, the only proposed alternative is that we further the failed experiment and make guns more prevalent and invariably increase the tens of thousands of accidents, suicides, etc. not even mentioned in this debate involving guns. 2) Gun Control Can Work: Gun control implementations around the world have resulted in safer societies. Comparison wise, I have shown countries of reasonable comparison to the U.S. like the U.K., Canada, and Japan to have vastly lower crime and gun crime rates than that of the U.S. Trend wise, Australia is hitting record low murder rates, significant drops in firearm homicide, and not a single mass shooting has occurred since its gun control implementation 20 years ago. Clearly these results benefit society. Within the U.S., I have shown that states with strict gun control on average have lower gun deaths and gun homicides than states with lax gun control. It is not always perfectly implemented and its effects are oftentimes obstructed by problems caused by lax gun control (i.e. Indiana guns in Chicago), but these examples clearly show gun control has benefited various societies and Con has done nothing to dispute that. 3) Gun Control Does Not Infringe Upon Americans' Rights: Constitutional rights are subject to regulation and Con has done nothing to show how \"common sense\" gun control unduly infringes upon the 2nd Amendment or actively disarms law-abiding gun owners. Con proposes the goal of the 2nd Amendment to be prevention of government tyranny, yet throughout the debate insinuates that the government has and is actively committing tyranny. Hasn't the 2nd Amendment failed then? Tyranny is prevented through our checks and balances, our independent branches of government, our state and municipal governments, our other constitutional rights, our right to vote, our Constitution. All of these things are subject to constant regulation and review so the duty to prevent tyranny does not grant immunity. Are precious assault rifles really going to hold up when the hypothetical, tyrannical U.S. government comes knocking at our doors with tanks, fighter jets, and battleships? No. It is our voices, votes, and law-suits that keep the people in control over the government. 4) Common Sense Gun Control Is Common Sense: Statistics supporting gun control and indicting America's current gun policies as failing are abundant, but logistically the case for gun control is even more clear. Why should people investigated for terrorism and deemed to dangerous to fly be allowed to legally and easily purchase firearms? Why should felons? Why should the mentally unstable? Why should background checks be voided by online and gun show purchases? Why should weapons designed for assault, be protected for self-defense? Con argues because \"criminals don't follow the law\". Why have any laws at all then? Con argues the black market would be unstoppable. It's been stopped by the U.K., Australia, Canada, etc. Are criminals just to smart and too powerful for us to confront through laws and law enforcement? Con also failed to rebut my argument that many mass shootings are not the result of intricate coordination by criminal, underground-connected masterminds. If these laws and their enforcement by our police forces, courts, and governments could prevent even a fraction of crimes, mass shootings, homicides, etc. then the safety of society has benefited. The right's refusal to take action because \"criminals are criminals\" and to block what the majority of Americans believe should be implemented is cowardly and costing lives. We need to do our best to ensure that responsible citizens are the only ones allowed to legally purchase and own guns. Thank you for taking the time for reading. I hope you vote Pro and I hope the discussion of how to best keep Americans safe continues, regardless of your opinion.",

            "premise": "You fail to answer my main argument, backed up by statistical data, that states: The spike in gun violence is not due to the gun laws themselves, but rather the lack of enforcement. This is extremely damaging to your entire argument and failing to answer this major argument puts me way ahead in this debate. Now to the line by line: In your third paragraph your true colors show. By saying that \"taking our 2nd amendment rights\" you show that this argument is not about your original statement but about the 2nd Amendment. The statistics I present are apparent in my first statement, citing the deaths due to gun violence in this nation. And with the recent amount of gun-related deaths in this nation do you not believe that gun control laws are needed? How many deaths will it take until we make it impossible for killers to get dangerous weapons? How many Virginia Tech, Columbine High School, Omaha Department Store-esque shootings are going to have to occur? In your fourth you attack the correlation of gun deaths to poverty. Do you honestly think that there is no link? A 1992 study into the relationship of poverty and gun violence stated: \"The major association for firearm fatalities is with socioeconomic factors such as poverty levels and alcohol consumption. Unless this country directs its efforts toward the socio-economic ills which appear to bear the strongest relationship to violent deaths by firearms, the fatalities likely will remain high whether this country has gun control laws or not. (http://findarticles.com...)\" Also: A relationship between unemployment and criminal violence has been relatively well documented (Lofftin et.al, 1989; Parker, 1989; Vold, 1986). A relationship between ethnic group membership and criminal violence has also been established (Gurr, 1981; Lane, 1968; Lenton, 1989; Monkonnen, 1989; Williams, 1984), although this may, in fact, be due to structural poverty. So once again, it is seen that the lack of enforcement of current gun control policies leads to an increase in the death rates, not the laws themselves. So more evidence for my position: \"The multivariate statistical regression model suggests that the existence of gun control laws indeed have a deterrent effect on firearm deaths, although this relationship is weaker than previously reported. If, however, the United States had had a uniform gun control law similar to the 1977 Canadian law, the impact may have been stronger than that found here, which relies on systems of laws that vary significantly between states. Accordingly, it appears that the Brady Bill, if implemented properly, may have significant impact on deterring the number of deaths associated with the firearm use. (http://findarticles.com...)\" In conclusion: 1) I have established through analytical and statistical arguments that it is due to the lack of enforcement, not the actually gun control laws themselves, are to blame for gun-related deaths. 2) I won that human being are not inherently evil. 3) Poverty rates are also a substantial factor in gun-violence. So anyone who is going to vote in this round have two options: A vote for PoeJoe is a vote for doing nothing to prevent gun violence in this country. A vote for my policy of enforcement solves for most gun-related violence in this nation preventing another Virginia Tech, Columbine, and Omaha.",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "Yes, it is true that you have given some relatively convincing statistics but you conveniently left out the other side of the argument. To represent my side, here are some statistics quoted from a website: There were 464,033 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2013: 270,237 suicides (58.2% of total deaths); 174,773 homicides (37.7%); and 9,983 unintentional deaths (2.2%). Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (66.6% of all homicides) and by suicide (52.2% of all suicides). Firearms were the 12th leading cause of all deaths, representing 1.3% of total deaths topping liver disease, hypertension, and Parkinson\"s disease, as well as deaths from fires, drowning, and machinery accidents. However, everyone can quote statistics, so now, I will be moving on to the main pointers of my arguments. In present times, it has never been more pressing to impose gun control laws not only in the United States but also in the world. People are becoming increasingly radicalized in today's society, with the rampage of ISIS groups and supporters throughout the world. Maybe the part about removing all radicals from the US is highly improbable but why then. should we provide these radicals with unrestricted access to firearms? Have you ever wondered how easy it is to acquire fire arms in America? With the present gun control \"laws\" in America, it makes America extremely prone not only to external threats but threats within the nation itself. This is evident from the number of shooting cases happening in recent years. Therefore, doesn't the government's reluctance to impose stricter gun control laws similar to digging our own graves? Sure you may argue that guns are necessary to protect our individual rights, but at what cost? At the cost of a few thousand other lives in America? At the cost of our sovereignty? At the cost of the whole country? Think about it, an individual won't exist without a nation and a the fragile concept of a \"nation\" can easily be destroyed by the mere spread of radical ideologies and a few more shooting cases. Take Singapore for example. This country has extremely strict gun control laws and yet its crime rate is one of the lowest in the world? This proves that gun control is not an absolute criterion for the safety of individuals as other measures can be put in place. I am proud to propose",

My opponent claims that gun control does not work for the simple reason that guns are still accessible through illegal means. But this alone is not a reason for abolishing gun control laws. Gun control works, at the very least, to some degree. While we are constantly perfecting the legislation on the books, the laws we have produce positive results. In the past decade, more than 1.3 million criminals have been blocked from buying guns at licensed dealers (http://www.bradycampaign.org...). It may be true that we can't prevent crime from happening, but these laws do make a difference, and the benefits are worth the restrictions. Assault weapons bans are another valuable gun control law. There is no good reason for anyone to possess a gun that can shoot that many rounds. This is another example of a positive gun control law. Gun control does work, the United States has one of the highest rates of firearm ownership and, as a result, one of the highest rates of homicides in the developed world. Guns cause more problems than they solve. Unfortunately I have to go, sorry for the short post this time.",

            "discussionTitle": "Gun Control Laws affect blacks negatively",
            "conclusion": "Gun Control Laws affect blacks negatively",
            "premise": "CON has failed to regonize the context of discrimination. discrimination- treatment or consideration of, Or making a distinction towards, A person based on the group, Class, Or category to which the person is perceived to belong. My argument was that gun control laws is discriminative which isn't always with racist intent. As well as the title should've implied the context provided. The question you provided is interesting. Does the historical context apply? , Is White on White Crime bigger than Black On Black? , Are there parallels with blacks and whites? , Do many of the variables apply? First, Lets dive into the history! {--SOUTHERN GUN CONTROL--} Gun control existed in North America even before the creation of the US and was racially motivated in its earliest forms. The first law in the colony of Virginia that mentioned African-Americans was a 1664 act that barred free blacks from owning firearms. Another pre-Revolutionary example is \"An Act for the Better Ordering of Negroes and Slaves\" signed by South Carolina in 1712 which included provisions addressing firearm ownership by blacks. The Nat Turner rebellion in August of 1831 was the realization of slave owner\"s greatest fears. Over 70 slaves and free blacks took part in an uprising that killed at least 57 white people before it was finally put down. This prompted a number of Southern states to adopt measures that would restrict blacks from owning guns. For example, Delaware instituted a law in December of 1831 that required free blacks to obtain a firearms license if they wished to have weapons. In the same month Maryland and Virginia passed laws that prohibited free blacks from carrying guns. Georgia soon followed by barring free blacks from firearm ownership entirely in 1833. The racist laws passed following the rebellion were reactionary response passed primarily out of fear of blacks, Free or not. This trend of restricting the firearm rights of those perceived as a threat to the established powers of society will continue throughout the history of the United States. The Civil War and the passage of the 13th, 14th, And 15th amendments were supposed to give African-American\"s the same rights as all other US citizens. Just as the South found ways to keep black people from voting, It also found ways to ensure that they remained unarmed and vulnerable to coercion by violence. The adoption of \"Black Codes\" by Southern legislatures directly contradicted the spirit and letter of these newly enacted amendments, But were enforced anyway. Although Black Codes applied to many different aspects of life, One of its major aims was to keep blacks from possessing firearms. For example, Mississippi Black Code states: \"Be it enacted. . . That no freedman, Free Negro or mulatto, Not in the military. . . And not licensed so to do by the board of police of his or her county, Shall keep or carry firearms of any kind, Or any ammunition. \" There are many more examples but I think you got the point. Gun control laws have been racist to blacks in the past and in the south. {--GUN CONTROL IN THE NORTH--} Efforts to tighten gun control laws in the North only began in response to a dramatic rise in immigration. Prior to this period it was socially acceptable for an upper class man to carry a small pocket pistol to protect himself from criminals. The perceived need for stricter gun control laws coincided with the arrival of Eastern and Southern Europeans who were commonly viewed as \"criminal elements\" in society. Armed robbery was frequently attributed to immigrants and \"foreign-born anarchists\". These prejudices were perpetuated by groups such as the Immigration Restriction League and the American Protective Association, Which supported a ban on all firearm ownership by aliens. The first widespread restrictions on firearm ownership in the North came in New York City, Which was the hub of European immigration. Efforts had been underway for a number of years to slowly push the public into accepting gun control. For example, A newspaper editorial from the time states that pistols were found \"chiefly in the pockets of ignorant and quarrelsome immigrants of law breaking propensities. \" The culmination of these efforts was the passage of the Sullivan Law on May 29, 1911. Senator Sullivan declared the bill would \"do more to carry out the commandment thou shalt not kill and save more souls than all the talk of all the ministers and priest in the state for the next ten years. \" The year before the Sullivan Law was passed there were 108 homicides in New York City, And the year after its implementation there were 113. Despite its shortcomings, The idea of police issued gun permits spread throughout the United States. Between 1911 and 1934 Arkansas, Hawaii, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina and Oregon all passed laws similar to the Sullivan Law. California and New Hampshire went as far as banning aliens from owing firearms. A 1918 ruling by a New Hampshire court which upheld the alien gun ban So in conclusion: Gun control laws have historically been discriminatory. {--CURRENT RESTRICTIONS--} New York City is still home to some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation which are in effect highly discriminatory against the poor. The city still requires a permit to purchase a gun, Just as it did when the Sullivan Law was passed in 1911. At that time, The police could simply deny certain people permits based on ethnicity, Something that would not be allowed today. Instead, New York City has created a set of requirements that virtually ensures that the poor will be unable to secure a permit. The process of applying is time consuming and complicated. The city requires that the permit be submitted in person, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a. M. To 3:30 p. M. At the licensing division. This means if someone works a 9-5 job that they will have to take time off from work and get to Manhattan to submit an application. Taking time off work may be impossible for poor people. New York City still makes the permitting process difficult for immigrants as well. One requirement is: Proof of Citizenship/Alien Registration: If you were born outside the United States, You must submit your naturalization papers or evidence of citizenship if derived from your parents. All other applicants born outside the United States must submit their Alien Registration Card. If you have lived in this country less than 7 years you must submit a good conduct certificate, Or equivalent, From your country of origin and two (2) letters of reference that certify to your good character. No rationale or justification could be found for the additional requirements imposed on alien residents of less than seven years, And the seven year standard appears on its face to be arbitrary and simply intended to discourage foreign born people from applying for a gun permit. The most effective measure to keep the poor from owning guns is the cost to apply for the permit. The application fee is $340 and the applicant must also be fingerprinted at an additional cost of $94. 25. These costs seem deliberately prohibitive considering that it costs less then $100 to register a car in New York. Public housing often experiences disproportionately high rates of crime, So removing guns from these areas appears to be a well meaning remedy. Public housing gun bans therefore results in law abiding residents being disarmed even though they were committing a minority of the crimes in the area and were frequently the victims of the crimes involved. Many black communities have been hit by poverty and crime. Getting a gun is the only way to protect yourself. Blacks with guns have been discriminated in some cases of Police Brutality as well as jurisdiction sentences. Today, White people are 14x times more likely to own a gun than blacks and its showing. Places with a majority black or hispanic population with strict gun control, Don't help blacks but hurt them.",

            "discussionTitle": "Gun Control",
            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "I should start this debate by saying that the Gun Control policies most people are advocating for are specifically to stop mentally disturbed people and violent criminals from obtaining weaponry. We are imposing limits on who can obtain weaponry. These types of gun laws will not pose much of a difficult for law abiding stable citizens. Few people care if these people have guns as well. \"Gun Control\" and \"Gun Elimination\" are not synonymous. I am Pro-Gun. To have a platform that says no gun control should exist and to simultaneously say that mentally disturbed individuals are the problem is to hold contradictory beliefs. Here are arguments for gun control, Again, Not gun bans or gun elimination. 1. Reason for Regulation If for no other reason, Guns should be regulated to prevent people with demonstrated mental instability, Violent crime records, Et cetera. These people have proven themselves dangerous, And at risk of being school shooters/et cetera. Many of the people who commit mass shootings would have been prevented with stronger or improved background check measures alone. (1) The majority on this list would've been prevented from getting a gun from background checks alone. Others get their guns from their parents. Gun safe requirements for households with children is an easy common sense requirement. 24+ hour waiting periods prior to the acquisition of one's first gun (not guns after the first) will prevent some crimes of passion or suicides, While constituting only a small burden on law abiding citizens. None of these requirements prevent law abiding citizens from acquiring weaponry. This is what we call 'common sense' gun control. Closing off the gun show, Or private sale, Loopholes, Is also common sense. If we can show many cases where mass shooters would've been stopped from acquiring weaponry with stronger background checks, One can easily see why private sellers should be required to background check prior to weapon purchase as well. You cannot simultaneously hold the position that mass shooters are mentally disturbed individuals and say we should not regulate guns. To say we shouldn't regulate guns is saying we should be OK with the mentally disturbed and violent criminals getting easy access to weaponry. To say that 'they can get their weapons even if its illegal' is a moot point. People can get drugs even if they're illegal. Should we not have laws against any drug? People will abort their children even if it illegal. Should it not be regulated? This is an argument you use for nothing else. Why do you use it here? The argument is that legal acquisition of things makes them easier to acquire, And some people will either not be able to afford the higher cost of obtaining weapons illegally, Or will give up prior to this. No one want to take a knife to a gun fight. The argument that 'they will switch to knives' is also asinine when it comes to regulation, Not bans. 2. Efficiency of Gun Regulation Whatever freedoms we have as individuals will come at a societal cost. There will be lives lost due to guns if we allow them to be legal. This is simply the price we pay. However, With moderate controls you can limit this negative cost while allowing law abiding citizens the right to their arms. A law in Connecticut in 1995 required a license as well as a background check prior to purchase of firearms. This required 8 hours of safety training to acquire said license as well as the passing of said background check. The check was conducted by local law enforcement, Not the sellers of the weaponry. The result was a 40% drop in firearm related crime. The repeal of a similar law in Missouri was met with a 25% increase in firearm related homicides. 3. Dangerous Ammunition We require licenses for people to drive vehicles. If you believe this is a good idea, But licensing guns is not then you have a serious problem on your hands. You can only kill so many people with a car, And you'll largely be taking yourself out at the same time. Guns are relatively cheap and efficient at killing. Even relatively untrained individuals can kill dozens of people before they are stopped. To require licenses for driving but not for owning weaponry and understanding its maintenance and safety (probably saving the person money in the end on both these fronts) is to hold contradictory positions based on little more than a literalist interpretation of the constitution. Dangerous ammunition such as Dragon's Breath (3) should certainly be regulated. If we're regulating RPGs there's no reason not to regulate these. They present serious fire hazards particularly in drought zones. Ensuring people understand the danger behind this kind of ammunition should be mandatory for public safety. To conclude, The position that weaponry and ammunition should not be regulated at all is untenable. You have to believe that mentally unstable and violent criminals should be allowed easy access to weaponry. That we should watch children have easy access to weaponry and punish the parents not at all. That we shouldn't even make an attempt to prevent mass shootings by said unstable individuals when the background checks that can prevent many are barely a minor burden on law abiding citizens. Waiting periods for one's first gun, Licensing requirements for one's first gun, Etc are hurdles that are undeniably beneficial. Law abiding citizens will not have problems getting weaponry even with GUN CONTROL measures in place. May your thoughts be clear, -Thoht",

            "premise": "After the horrific Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a sense of fear gripped the nation. Stores pulled guns from their shelves. Cities organized gun buyback events. Lawmakers pledged to tighten gun laws. Bulletproof backpack sales spiked, and some kids even took guns to school for protection. Through it all, the national debate turned once again to gun control: Should citizens even have guns? And what can we do to prevent future shooting tragedies? The Democrat party responded with clamor for more gun control. On Jan. 16, President Barack Obama signed three memorandums and announced 23 executive actions to help \"reduce gun violence.\" His plan emphasizes stronger background checks, bans on \"assault weapons,\" and more emergency resources in schools. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced the \"Assault Weapons Ban of 2013\" that would ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing and importation of more than 150 types of firearms, including rifles, pistols and shotguns. Feinstein is known for her anti-gun stance. She championed the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004 and only banned 18 specific firearms. Although gun violence did drop in the 1990\"s, a University of Pennsylvania study shows that the 1994 ban had too many loopholes and had no statistical effect on the number of mass shootings. Murder and violent crime rates continued to fall even after the ban expired. In addition to pressing for useless gun regulations, many Democrats also engage in political doublespeak. They talk about banning \"assault weapons;\" however, there is no set definition of an \"assault weapon.\" It is whatever a given individual wants it to be. Gun control advocates are against \"military-style weapons,\" but these guns bear a purely cosmetic resemblance to military weapons and would never be used by the military. They speak of the dangers of \"semi-automatic weapons,\" which sounds scary until you realize that \"semi-automatic\" refers to any gun that can shoot more than once without reloading (nearly every gun that shoots is semi-automatic). They talk about \"reducing gun violence\" and promoting \"gun safety\" (can you really argue against reducing violence or promoting safety?) instead of what they\"re really doing, which is attacking our Constitutionally-guaranteed right to bear arms by tightening gun control laws. But no matter what terminology they use, gun control is not going to work, and here\"s why: Reason #1: There are already 300 million privately-owned guns in the U.S. In theory, a more strict gun law could work. In 1996, Australia implemented a strict assault weapons ban with few loopholes. The country banned all semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and spent $500 million buying approximately 600,000 guns from private citizens. But this isn\"t Australia. There are almost 300 million privately-owned guns in America, or about nine guns for every 10 people, which eliminates the possibility of a mass gun-buyback movement. Also, stringent gun control laws have long been politically unpopular in the U.S., especially among Second Amendment advocates. Gun sales soared, and over 100,000 Americans joined the National Rifle Association in wake of a possible gun crackdown. Reason #2: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" The Second Amendment guarantees the people a way to defend themselves, should the need arise. In past times, arming the population was a safeguard against possible government tyranny and dictatorship. Today, many citizens still see their right to bear arms as an important means of self-defense; they also fear that gun control would be the first step towards the people\"s rights being removed little by little. You can\"t carry your guns around in public. Now you can't own these specific guns. Now your guns need to be under lock and key at all times. Soon you can't have any guns at all, time to amend the Constitution. That's an exaggeration, but you get my point. You give an inch and the government could take a mile. Reason #3: Mass shooters don\"t follow the law. Studies show that most criminals come by their guns illegally, often by theft or underground purchases. This allows them to completely bypass stringent background checks and other regulations. For example, Connecticut has one of the nation's strictest gun laws. Gun owners must be 21 or older, apply for a local permit, be fingerprinted for a background check, wait for a 14-day period, and take a gun safety course. But that didn't stop Adam Lanza from simply stealing guns and killing 20 children and six adults at the Newtown shooting. Additional gun regulations would not have done anything to prevent the tragedy. Additional gun laws would also be difficult to enforce. in the end, it's only the law abiding citizen that would be harmed by gun control.",

            "premise": "I posted an R2 argument and it was deleted 20hrs after I posted it. How strange. I will be more brief than I was before. In my view, Your final statement has conceded the debate to me. That is the only point I previously brought up and you accepted it. This should be noted by our readers, But I will expand to multiple points to see if there is any common sense gun control that you don't like. You have a strange idea of what \"Common Sense\" gun control is. Common sense refers to the fact that the forms of gun control it suggests are not hotly contested by the majority of the public. IE about 80% of the population when asked are FOR these things. One or two of these are a bit more contested than that, But exceptions can be made for these to mostly accept as well. The only ones who do not accept common sense gun control are extreme constitutional literalists who believe 'shall not be infringed' means we cannot make any laws surrounding guns at all. An AR Ban is not part of common sense gun control. It is on the fringe, It is not comfortably inside it, In my view. Arguments can be made for it, But if that is the only thing you're against then you aren't Con Common Sense Gun Control and you've lost the debate before you've started. 1. Common Sense Gun Control Policies. 1a. Strengthening Background Checks. If you look up where most mass shooters get their weapons, (1) you will notice a trend for the majority of them. They get their guns despite histories of violence, Psychiatric admittance, Problems in the military, Violent crime, Et cetera. Some are prohibited some kinds of guns but allowed to use others. Strengthening background checks consists largely of holding the FBI, Psychiatrists, The military, Judges, Et cetera to a higher standard of reporting these negatives on people's record so they can be prevented from getting guns. You have already said you agree to this. 1b. Ending Private Sales/Gun Show Loopholes In many states, Private sellers don't have to run background checks. If you agree with background checks to screen for crimes et cetera listed above, You should also be for this. 1c. Licenses/Permits A small step above background checks. This may require training with the weaponry before purchase, But not necessarily. We require licenses to operate dangerous vehicles, Additional tests for larger vehicles, Et cetera. Requiring training prior to allowing people to purchase guns is the same. This could be a lifetime certification that needs no renewal, And the 2nd gun you go to purchase would not require licensing. This has been shown to reduce crime directly with no corresponding increase in crime via other weaponry. (2) When these laws are lifted, It also shows crime increases afterwards. (2) These are not insignificant margins, And it is a fairly insignificant barrier to entry. 1d. 24-72 Hour Waiting Periods This is mostly to stop spur of the moment suicides as well as crimes of passion. A cooldown period. An exception could be made that if someone already owns a gun they are exempt from the waiting period, Because it would follow that this would not stop them if they already have a gun. 1e. Requiring Gun Safes for Households with Children Many shooting 'accidents' would be easily preventable if adults locked away their guns properly in households with children. CPS already notes many dangerous things about the household that constitutes a dangerous environment. Having legal grounds to prosecute parents whose children gain access to their weaponry should absolutely be mandatory. There are several mass shootings that have happened that would have been potentially prevented because of this. 2. The claim that guns save 2. 1m people a year. I'm going to need a source for this. If this includes cops, Then it is an irrelevant point. Cops will not be prevented from having access to guns. Cops with backgrounds of mental instability should not be cops. They can be replaced. 3. AR Ban. Hunting Rifles? As I said prior, AR bans are not under the umbrella of 'common sense. ' (3) Some fringe elements of people suggest banning all guns. This may be common sense to them, But it is not something the majority believes in as the majority does common sense reform. Hunting rifle have never been discussed outside of a total ban. \"Gun Control\" does not necessarily mean \"Gun Elimination. \" Either way, Most people accept hunters as an exception to these kind of things. Guns are a requirement for safety for many. To conclude, As my profile says, I'm Pro-Gun. I believe guns are mandatory to protect civilians from invasion of other countries, To protect themselves when the police cannot, To protect themselves from government, And for fun. Most freedoms, However, Come with a cost to life to pay for those freedoms. There are a lot of statistics people use to say guns should be eliminated that are fraudulent, Or flawed. I do not make those points. I make the point that these simple steps that pose no extreme difficulty to law abiding citizens can save a lot more innocent lives and are well worth the cost of 1. Waiting a few days before getting your first gun. 2. Taking a class on guns that would probably be tons of fun and save you money via better information. 3. Keeping your guns locked up away from your kids. None of these are particularly controversial points. If you wish to continue the debate, You have to have a problem with 1b-1e. You've already accepted 1a. Lets say for argument's sake that I have conceded an AR ban to you, Although I have stated why I don't put that under 'common sense' gun law. So now it is on you. What between 1b and 1e do you disagree with? If you accept 1a-1e or the majority of those, You are not con common sense gun control.

            "premise": "I accept this challenge.Opening Statement:I will argue on the grounds that gun control would be detrimental to society.First, I will define the term 'gun control'[1]:Gun control: 'Regulation of the sale and use of rifles and handguns.' Opening Argument:The Idea that we have to regulate firearms makes sense, however, it can lead to various unwanted effects.For instance, crime rates would increase. Not necessarily the murder rate. As an example, let's make up a scenario. If I were to break into your house, and you were unarmed due to laws preventing you from owning a gun. But I have a gun that I gained through an illegal market (note this, I will come back to the illegal market concept), how are you going to defend yourself? The fact is, you wouldn't. I would be able to steal everything you own, then leave without the cops suspecting a thing. I wouldn't have any need to kill you, which is why the homicide rate would be so low. However, in a country where there are tighter gun control laws, you are more prone to a variety of other forms of crime.However, if you were living in a country where everyone had a gun, then you would be able to kill the criminal who invaded your house, then call the police. Thereby meaning you would be safer in a country with less gun control laws, than more. If countries with stricter gun control laws have lower crime rates, then how do you explain countries like Brazil[2]? Who have some of the highest crime rates in the world.Also, returning to the illegal market concept. By banning guns, you are just opening up a whole new market for criminal organizations like cartels. You can make a parallel between this and the selling of narcotics. Since narcotics like marijuana are illegal, the black market is the biggest source for this product, but passing legislation on this product does not limit the needs of the consumers. It doesn't stop the selling and buying of this product. It only drives it to be sold by criminals.So, by passing gun control laws, all you are doing is arming criminals, while disarming law-abiding citizens. Thereby making the environment more dangerous for law-abiding citizens. The UK for instance, which is well known for it's strict gn control policy, was named the 'violent crimes capital of Europe' by the European Commision[3].Therefore, by passing gun control laws, you would make an environment that is more dangerous to the average civilian.Sources:1- http://www.thefreedictionary.com...2- http://en.wikipedia.org...3- http://www.express.co.uk...",

            "conclusion": "We Should Have Stricter Gun Control",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his response. My final round for this debate will be short and sweet, as I feel that the readers will have already have my previous arguments in mind; there is no need for me to be redundant. My main point in my final round is that my opponent has not met any of my challenges, and the argument that he produces for gun control is ineffective. Moreover, he is casting off *two* of my arguments, even though they are obviously pertinent to the subject of this debate. 1) Stricter gun control laws do not reduce crime. For my opponent's responses on what constitutes gun control laws as effective, he said \"much more extensive background checks (there are obviously levels), a longer waiting period, a more extensive test, a limit on what kind of guns can be bought\". Background checks do one thing; they check for a criminal record. There are no levels to this. What pertinence is, say, what job or education level a person has in correlation to how eligible they are for a gun? Our current gun control laws already do this. Moreover, what on earth would a longer waiting period achieve? How would that help with hindering the gun-attainment for criminals? There is no purpose to longer waiting periods. Also, do you mean test by ability? What tests are you talking about? I think that as long as a person learn the basic safety features of a gun and how to shoot it, beyond that, how can there be more extensive tests? The limit of types of guns should also be elaborated on, because I don't see how much relevance it has to why that would limit criminal activity. If we're talking about most of America, then we're talking about handguns; shotguns and so forth would only be relevant to recreation and hunting (in fact, shotguns are a bigger pain to carry and shoot than handguns are). I hope it's common sense that our current gun control laws do not permit machine guns and so on (aka militia guns). The purpose of my breaking down my opponent's laws is that it is obvious that stricter gun control laws DO NOT WORK. My opponent cannot even come up with the very laws that he argues to defend. My point about attaining guns illegally is pertinent because I am arguing that it doesn't matter if we have stricter gun control laws, because it will not reduce crime. No matter how strict the laws are, people will get guns, and that's where the gun-related crime rates come from. Isn't that the whole purpose of this argument? My opponent is wrong because there is no rational reason to have stricter laws; it does not reduce crime. My point is shown through his proposal of very ineffective laws; there simply is no rational stricter gun regulations that will reduce crime. 2) Guns save lives. This is probably the most pertinent argument of this debate, as not only have I shown how obviously fruitless stricter gun regulation is, but to make attaining guns harder would be to hinder many citizens the ability to defend themselves. The laws pertaining to stricter gun control such as a longer waiting period, what point is there to that law? Why should the government impose such unnecessary laws that would only make it harder for citizens to gain the ability to better defend themselves? 3) Guns are a form of liberty. Guns are not liberating in the sense that it is the weapon that makes Americans liberated, but the power that they represent. America is built on the mission that the government is for the People. The more power the government has over the people the less liberated we are, and weapons are a *very* big form of power. Examples I can say off my head that were in my previous arguments are that Hitler explicitly acknowledged that to take away weapons from citizens is the best way to control them. Even America has been guilty of this, as shown from their instances of taking away the possessions of anyone of Japanese descent during the second World War. Stricter gun control won't turn our government into Nazis, but it is far too naive to say that our government wouldn't gain a stronger hold on us if they tightened how they regulated something as big as arms. 4) Conclusion My opponent cannot even come up with laws that would effectively reduce crime rates. Everything about stricter gun regulations just screams unnecessary. I've never said that stricter gun control would deny liberty or safety, and my opponent concedes that \"it does lower it to some extent\". When there is absolutely no reason to impose stricter gun control, why should our government lower our liberty and safety? My last two arguments are absolutely relevant as they relate to us citizens as Americans and the foundation of our personal safety and our liberty. The main point that my opponent fails to argue for is that the amount of criminals with weapons will NOT decrease. Stricter gun control does absolutely nothing, my opponent has shown no reason why it will, and I've shown plenty of reason why it *doesn't* work and in fact hinders America's safety and liberty. I've had a very fun time with this debate, and I thank my opponent for a riveting debate. I'd like the voters to keep in mind we have a gun violence problem, but stricter gun control laws will do absolutely nothing to help reduce gun crime. Thank you, and vote for Con.",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and look forward to a spirited discussion. Firstly I will be addressing the legality of gun control and the logic and meaning behind the text of the second amendment of the US constitution. The second amendment states, \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" Many interpret this text to mean that it is an inalienable right for every individual to own a firearm. This is incorrect, the second amendment gives people the right to collective security and the right to form state militias. This right is exercised through the National Guard in each of the fifty states, which serves to counter federal military power and to protect the citizenry from tyranny. [1] This is why it is constitutional for counties and states to enact gun control legislation, because it is the duty of the state governments to organize and carry out the collective security of the people. Individuals cannot afford the ordinance, supplies, and defensive systems that are required for a practical and pragmatic defense against a tyrannical federal government or foreign army. Thus, we must consider the spirit of the second amendment and what it means, as well as how it applies to modern society. Does every individual need a weapon when the needs of collective security are already met? The answer to that question is no, because not only is there no point in it, but a heavily armed citizenry can actually be a detriment to the public health and collective security of the states. An armed citizenry with access to military grade weapons would be capable of forming paramilitary groups, which if left unchecked could substitute civil discourse with forceful discourse to influence the government and terrorize the populace. Of course we do not interpret the constitution to allow for independent militias to form on our soil, we recognize that it would be disastrous to interpret the constitution in such a way. Unfortunately that same argument in regards to arming citizens is ignored. Some political parties and advocacy groups assert that it is the right of every citizen to own a firearm, because they choose to interpret the constitution in the same literal sense that we as a nation recognize to be absurd in relation to the right to form militias. In lieu of the fact that personally bearing arms meant for the contribution of the collective security of society is impractical and dangerous to the public health, we can agree that ownership of a weapon for this reason is not legitimate and that we should work against the proliferation of firearms in society. Not only do we need more gun control to achieve this goal, but we need a national plan that supersedes any local legislation. We must recognize on a national level and codify it into law that there are only three legitimate reasons for personal firearm ownership. 1)Personal Defense. 2)Hunting. 3)Competitive shooting and similar gun based sports. By recognizing the legitimate reasons for personal firearm ownership we can limit the types of weapons that people can own to two categories; handguns with magazines not in excess of 10 rounds for self-defense, and hunting rifles and non-combat shotguns for hunting. With legislative recognition of legitimate civilian firearms, we can rule out the legality of certain weapons, such as assault rifles. Successful gun control will require a national plan and initiative, because of the nature in which illegal guns are obtained. For the purpose of this debate we will recognize an illegal weapon as the following; a class of weapon outlawed by legislation in the district that it resides in, or an unregistered or stolen registered weapon. Criminals are able to obtain illegal weapons despite gun control laws, because they can easily purchase these weapons in states or counties with lax gun control legislation and bring them into the cities, where gun control is stricter. Criminals will often simply buy guns from gun shows held outside the cities with tight gun control legislation, or buy guns illegally from gun dealers with federal firearms licenses. By making it harder for firearms to be purchased on a national level, and by removing firearms from the market by buying them back from the populace, we can drive up the cost for illegal firearms and eventually make them unaffordable to the average criminal. [2] Furthermore, we should increase the size and funding of the ATF. The ATF is responsible for enforcing federal gun laws, yet it only has 1,800 agents to monitor an estimated 77,000 gun dealers. Currently it would take 22 years for the ATF to inspect every federally licensed gun dealer. There is a very clear problem here, when the organization tasked with monitoring this form of commerce is woefully undermanned and underfunded. [3] The most important thing is to have a national gun control plan and to enforce it. Attempts to institute meaningful gun control have been undermined by governmental incompetence, and the giving in to gun lobbyists. With a strong ATF and a national policy leaning toward gun control, we can finally bring gun violence down to an acceptable level. I thank my opponent, and look forward to his rebuttal.

            "premise": "Washington DC proves that handgun bans are effective in preventing homicides and suicides The Philadelphia Inquirer, 2007 [What a handgun ban didn't do for D.C.: Is there a \"smoking gun\" that proves the efficacy of gun laws? Or are such claims based on illusion,\" April 9, Lexis] The D.C. law banning the purchase, sale, transfer or possession of handguns by civilians was enacted in 1976. In 1991, a group of researchers from the University of Maryland published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that examined the effect of the law on the frequency of homicides and suicides by looking at the period 1968 through 1987. The study concluded there was a \"prompt decline\" in homicides and suicides by firearms in D.C. not replicated in adjacent Maryland and Virginia jurisdictions without a handgun law. The data suggested that, after the law was enacted, an average of 47 deaths per year were prevented in D.C. Handgun bans are enforceable Leftwich, senior counsel of Legal Community Against Violence, 2006 [Juliet A., Pro-Gun Logic Is Wrong on the Facts, Sept 22, http://www.lcav.org...] Kates is also wrong when he claims that laws restricting access to firearms in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom are \"unenforceable.\" On the contrary, it is because these laws have been so effectively enforced that gun-related death rates in those nations pale compared to those in the U.S. According to \"The Global Gun Epidemic: From Saturday Night Specials to AK-47s\" (2006), the 2001/2002 rates of firearm death per 100,000 for the countries in question are as follows: U.S.: 10.27; Canada: 2.6; Australia: 1.68; and England/Wales: .38. What this means is that I have evidence on gun control and you don't, shows it is enforceable and I already talked of the impact in my last post. All of your arguements fall, because I have proven gun control can work and be enforcable. I'm am not basing it on assumption either gun control leads to less guns in the hands of people, leads to less harm to people. States with the greatest number of guns in the home also have the highest rates of homicide, a new study finds. The study, in the February issue of Social Science and Medicine, looked at gun ownership in all 50 states and then compared the results with the number of people killed over a three-year period. The research, the authors said, 'suggests that household firearms are a direct and an indirect source of firearms used to kill Americans both in their homes and on the streets.' The researchers, led by Matthew Miller of the Harvard School of Public Health, drew on data gathered by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2001, the agency surveyed more than 200,000 people and asked them, among other questions, whether they had a gun in or near the home. In states in the highest quarter of gun ownership, the study found, the overall homicide rate was 60 percent higher than in states in the lowest quarter. The rate of homicides involving guns was more than twice as high. Although homicide rates may not rise \u2013 private handgun ownership increases suicide rates and accidental shootings which are not represented in homicide statistics The Philadelphia Inquirer, 2007 [What a handgun ban didn't do for D.C.: Is there a \"smoking gun\" that proves the efficacy of gun laws? Or are such claims based on illusion,\" April 9, Lexis] Miami Police Chief John Timoney, whose reign as top cop in Philadelphia brought a reduction in homicides to below 400 for the first time in a decade, said that if the decision overturning the handgun ban is affirmed, there is likely to be a rise in the number of suicides and accidental shootings. \"And it won't necessarily be reflected in the homicide rate, because suicides and not-fatal shootings won't show up in those statistics,\" Timoney said. \"You'll have an increase in those shootings . . . and opponents [of the ban] will say that the homicide rate didn't rise.\" Statistics Report 49, no. 8 (2001): 68. Myron Boor, \"Methods of Suicide and Implications for Suicide Prevention,\" Journal of Clinical Psychology 37, (January 1981): 70-75. For all our fear and fascination with guns and homicide, the fact remains that most firearm deaths in America are not the result of homicide (10,828 for 1999), but suicide (16,599 for 1999). It is estimated that only 10 percent of suicides by firearms are committed with firearms purchased specifically for the act. Gun owners are more likely to commit suicide than non-gun owners Duggan, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Maryland, 2003 [Mark, \"Guns and Suicide,\" in Evaluating Gun Policy etd by Jens Ludwig and Philip J Cook, p 65] Individuals who own a gun are more likely to commit suicide than are other individuals. The results presented in this chapter demonstrate that much of the relationship between state-level gun ownership and suicide rates seems driven by a positive correlation between suicidal tendencies and gun ownership. The finding that the male-female suicide ratio is significantly greater in places with more gun ownership suggests that instrumentality effects may also partially explain this relationship, though one cannot rule out the hypothesis that gender-specific suicidal tendencies vary with the availability of guns. Finally, it appears that reductions in gun ownership have not been the driving force behind the fall in the suicide rate. Firearm-related domestic violence has disproportionately bad effects upon children Arthur Kellermann, MD, MPH, et al., \"Firearms and Family Violence,\" Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America 17 (August 1999): 699-716, citing Ernest N. Jouriles et al., \"Knives, Guns, and Interparent Violence: Relations with Child Behavior Problems,\" Journal of Family Psychology 12, no. 2 (1998): 178-194. The effects of firearm-related domestic violence last long beyond the actual crime. In a study on child witnesses of marital violence, the authors noted that children who observed incidents of domestic violence involving the use or threat of a firearm exhibited higher levels of behavior problems than children who did not. Firearm ownership negatively and disproportionately affects women James E. Bailey, MD, MPH, et al., \"Risk Factors for Violence Death of Women in the Home,\" Archives of Internal Medicine 157, no. 7 (1997): 777-782. A 1997 study that examined the risk factors for violent death for women in the home found that when there were one or more guns in the home, the risk of suicide among women increased nearly five times and the risk of homicide increased more than three times. The increased risk of homicide associated with firearms was attributable to homicides at the hands of a spouse, intimate acquaintance, or close relative. Empirical evidence supports the conclusion that fewer guns mean fewer deaths Leftwich, senior counsel of Legal Community Against Violence, 2006 [Juliet A., Pro-Gun Logic Is Wrong on the Facts, Sept 22, http://www.lcav.org...] Kates rejects the \"quasi-religious belief that more guns (particularly handguns) mean more violence and death, and, concomitantly, fewer guns mean fewer deaths.\" Yet this is precisely what the empirical evidence shows, as discussed by David Hemenway, director of Harvard's Injury Control Research Center, in his book \"Private Guns, Public Health\" (2004). Numerous studies have found that having a gun in the home is associated with an increased risk of unintentional firearm injury, suicide and homicide. Thus gun control leads to less guns, equals less death, meaning even suicide rates equal out gun violence, We need to cut that death down. Also I also have proven that gun ownership leads to a negative effect on women and children. Gun control works, and please, understand me, don't just base, a vote for the neg is a vote for more gun deaths and that is not safe to me.",

            "premise": "The main problem with your response is that guns actually are safe, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. Should we punish all gun owners for parents not securing their firearms? Let\"s look at another common way children die: window coverings. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (a more reputable source than Slate.com who does not reference their sources for statistics) states that approximately 349 children died between 1981 and 1995 due to strangulation from window covers/blinds. These children were left in a safe place by their parents/guardians, such as a crib or bedroom, and died anyways. While those two things seem unrelated, when applied to gun control, should we outlaw window coverings just because they killed almost 350 children over a period of 14 years? That\"s more children killed by blinds than guns. I agree that there are ways for criminals to purchase guns illegally. However, extensive background checks are required for people who purchase guns LEGALLY. Have you ever purchased a firearm? I have. You stand in the store for approximately 30-45 minutes while the licensed firearms dealer runs your background to see if you are a felon. In some states, it\"s even more complicated than that wait time! The only combat to criminals purchasing firearms is to patrol heavily and crack down on previously known illegal distributors of firearms. Gun shows, which aren\"t even addressed in your rebuttal, are the most common ways that criminals obtain firearms. I disagree with their existence and although they are huge revenue producers, they should require background checks. Gun control laws are an issue because it violates the 2nd Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that possessing firearms is not just the right to form a militia. It\"s the right to keep guns in your home, the right to carry a firearm in places that allow, and it\"s the right to protect yourself from anyone who tries to hurt you. Gun control is an issue because it DOESN\"T WORK. Taking away the rights of law-abiding Americans is wrong and in a country that was founded on freedom, it seems to me that everyone would want to protect that freedom as much as they can. Gun control laws don\"t hurt criminals. They hurt the people following the law. \"The Number of Children Who Strangle in Window Cords Has Been Under-reported According to a New Study in JAMA.\" U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. 3 June 1997.

In other countries like Canada, they have stricter rules on having/carrying guns, and they have WAY LESS crimes and murders then the united states.

If someone comes on my property with a gun and starts shooting isn't there other weapons I could use besides a gun? I could use a knife to defend myself, why do we need the guns. In the Second Amendment it does say we have a right to bear arms, but this right should be limited. We cannot have people going around buy guns and killing people. When you buy a gun , you have a background check, but what about the people who get the guns illegally? What are we going to do about them, there are billions of people in the world how are we going to stop this person from buying illegally a gun. This is exactly why we should gun control. America has a very low level of gun control already, and if we have people buy guns with bad intentions they are putting others in harm. THE WORLD ALREADY HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH GUNS ARE WE HONESTLY GOING TO INCREASE THE PROBLEM BY LETTING PEOPLE BUY MORE AND MORE GUNS? How many people have been killed by a gun in the past year alone, does it matter? NO IT DOESNT BECAUSE GUNS ARE GUNS AND THEY ARE USED TO HARM, THREATEN, AND KILL PEOPLE.

            "premise": "I did not initially title this debate that well so let me define what I mean \"gun control is bad\". I mean that gun control is a flawed policy that should not fully be implemented within the United States. \"One of the great mistakes is to judge policies by their intentions rather than their results\"- Milton Friedman. I believe these words have never been truer, especially on a topic like gun control. On paper, gun control sounds like a good idea, but in practice, it falls flat on its face. I will explain why. First, gun control is in itself, a policy that perpetuates a logical fallacy. Unarming law-abiding citizens does not protect law-abiding citizens. 2.5 million citizens protect themselves using guns every year (hoplofobia.info). If their guns were taken away, those 2.5 million citizens would not have had the protection they needed and would have had whatever violent crime committed against them. Not only that, but when a citizen with a gun intervenes before the police, 1/8th the number of casualties occur. We have no reason to implement a policy that takes defensive measures against law-abiding citizens. (Auditing Shooting Rampage Statistics, Davi Barker, July 2013). We also must consider the fact that gun control doesn't work. This is evident because in almost every place gun control has been implemented, disasters have been grave. 92% of mass shootings occur in \"gun free zones\" (crimeresearch.org). That alone should showcase how inefficient this policy is at keeping crime from happening. Not only that, but the U.S. government itself has \"found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes\" (First Reports Evaluating the Effectiveness of Strategies for Preventing the Violence: Firearms Laws, CDC, Task Force on Community Preventive Services, October 3, 2003). Washington D.C. has some of the strictest gun laws in the country but is reported to be one of the most dangerous places to live in. If we examine policies in other countries we could find similar results. A 2007 British journal of criminology study and a 2008 Melbourne study conclude that the temporary gun ban that occured in Australia had no effect on the gun homicide rate. There was actually an 89% spike in gun crime from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, all of this occurring after the gun ban. This isn't my lengthiest argument, but the points I bring up are still valid. Gun control does not have a history of actually being effective at stopping crime but it is effective at disarming innocent people. For these reasons a pro vote is the only logical outcome.",

            "premise": "Hello, Hope you are doing well today! I have to disagree with you on this matter as it is well documented that countries will less gun control are statistically less safe. The findings of this peer reviewed article in the American Journal of Medicine concluded this: \"The number of guns per capita per country was a strong and independent predictor of firearm-related death in a given country, whereas the predictive power of the mental illness burden was of borderline significance in a multivariable model. Regardless of exact cause and effect, however, the current study debunks the widely quoted hypothesis that guns make a nation safer.\" Source: http://www.amjmed.com...(13)00444-0/fulltext For instance, take the United Kingdom and the United States, let's compare the total fire-arms related deaths per 100,000 populations. UK: 0.25 USA: 10.3 Source: http://en.wikipedia.org... And this predictor can be used to determine any two countries not just with the USA and UK, for predicting firearms related deaths in a country with high gun control (UK) or a country with low gun control (USA). The current gun laws stem from our Bill of Rights. \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Source: http://www.archives.gov... This law is given in the context of an organized militia, and the right to bear arms was to obstruct oppression from possible totalitarian governments. Yet, people take our Constitution and hold it up like some kind of religious document when it is MEANT to be changed and changed if a portion of it is no longer necessary and not working. Therefore, this \"liberty\" to own and carry a weapon should be determined on it's overall good for the society rather than simply accepted as a fundamental \"right.\" Such arguments are nothing but special pleading. Also, we can note that in these foreign nations with strong gun control or gun bans we do not see increased inclinations toward a totalitarian government. Again, the UK has a democratic process not too different from our own and it was not some prime group or dictator who said guns will be banned, but the people themselves (with little debate) decided to make their society gun free. Thus have benefited from it. It would not be proper to say increased gun control is an indicator of a society's proclivity to becoming a totalitarianism, correlation is not causation. What matters is the means and purpose for which guns are controlled or banned, and in totalitarian dictatorships it is to ease the oppression of the people. And in a democratic society such as our own and many other Western Nations it is for the safety of the general public. I also find it interesting how he claims this will create \"a higher rate of socialism,\" of course since the word \"socialism\" had a negative stigma in our politics since the Cold War this seems to be a rather emotive argument at it's core I believe. And most importantly it is an ideological difference, which is refuted by the fact that countries with less gun control are less safe. It also is a slippery slope fallacy in that higher gun control laws do not essentially cause a country to all of the sudden become more like a social state. However, at the end of the day that is for the people of America to decide on by electing their representatives to support their values. It should not be asked by our great nation this question: What is of greater significance to our great nation, the ability to choose to own a fire-arm? Or the overall safety of our people, who are constantly threatened with rampant shootings happening in our homes, schools and public places? I highly suggest that you conclude along with the facts that increased gun control in America is the right thing to do, regardless of your political ideologies as this regards people's lives and not just choices.

            "discussionTitle": "Gun Control",
            "conclusion": "Gun Control",
            "premise": "=====REBUTTALS======Okay so as con, I feel it is my duty to prove that gun control is bad in all cases, and that it limits our freedom. The pro's goal in this debate, then is to prove that gun control is inevitably a logical choice, that doens't inflict on our rights and freedoms. \"Does every individual need a weapon when the needs of collective security are already met? \"Sure why not? I see no logical reasoning that should limit us from gun use. What happens when 'collective security' fails? What do we have when we can't get to the phone in time, to call the police? What happens when they show up late? A gun may be next to the only option of survival. Guns can be used to provide self defence and security, and are a fail safe in case the world ever turns corrupt. We have rights, not only constitutionally to bear arms, but instinctually. Every human has the right to protect him or herself, and if a gun has the ability to do this, then I see no reason as to why we should ban them or regulate them. \"Some political parties and advocacy groups assert that it is the right of every citizen to own a firearm, because they choose to interpret the constitution in the same literal sense that we as a nation recognize to be absurd in relation to the right to form militias.\"I would have to argue here, that this is not the viewpoint that is shared nationwide. It is a privilige granted by the US constitution. What reason do we have to doubt the US constitution on this issue? Even you concede that hunting, self defence, and sport use of guns would be practical use of firearms. So then we must assume that you yourself agree that banning or regulating guns would be harmful, and extremely un-beneficial. More on this next.\"We must recognize on a national level and codify it into law that there are only three legitimate reasons for personal firearm ownership.1)Personal Defense.2)Hunting.3)Competitive shooting and similar gun based sports.\" This argument in and of itself, proves that gun laws are silly. How are we supposed to keep firearms for self defence, hunting, and sport, while having are rights to bearing them revoked? If we cannot keep a firearm, then we cannot use a firearm, for any of your three reasons above. Also I would like to ask, if not one of those three things, really what else does a human have the need for a gun? This argument is abusive as it almost demands that I advocate gun control in a world where civilians use guns to perform acts of crime. No, as pro, your goal in this debate should be to prove that Gun control is harmful in all situations. \"With legislative recognition of legitimate civilian firearms, we can rule out the legality of certain weapons, such as assault rifles.\"I have to question whether or not the legitimacy of this argument bears any sense or reasoning. An AK47, or any other assault rifle, have the same potential of causing human death as an single handed firearm does. The question of this debate isn't which guns should be allowed, and for what specific uses, the question you should be trying to answer is whether it is moral or logical to even use them at all. \"By making it harder for firearms to be purchased on a national level, and by removing firearms from the market by buying them back from the populace, we can drive up the cost for illegal firearms and eventually make them unaffordable to the average criminal.\"We cannot do this, because this simply will not deter criminals from crime. Just as people have the ability to buy and sell illegal narcotics and drugs, people will still have the ability to purchase firearms. The national level will be irrelevant, as such purchases can be made benificial to others at an international level.We are taking away the guns from the innocent, the ones who have more need for them, and placing them inadvertantly right into the hands of the criminals. Security measures when breaking into ones home, now become empty and meaningless to any criminal. ======MY CASE======OUR RIGHTSGiven that this debate is a challenge on what ought to be rather than what is, I am arguing that owning and operating fire arms are rights indivually granted to us. These are god-given rights, not just constitutional ones. Guns are something that most people are supportive of, from all parties, Even democratic ones. Are gun rights more than just some political issue? What significance to they play in our lives? Statistics show that people own guns for the following reasons: 67% say protection against, another 66% own them for target practice (sport), and 41% own them for hunting.http://www.justfacts.com... Guns make people feel safe. Every individual has the right to feel secure. Every individual has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Guns enable those rights to better be established, as they help us to protect each one of those qualities. RESPONSIBILITYRights should be taken away when someone violates their privileges. That way we can take away the guns from those who have justifiable reasoning to take them. An alternative to taking guns away, would be to regulate who recieves them. Those who complete gun safety courses can take psychiatric exams before gaining the privilege to own and potentially use their firearm. Taking away guns from those who own them with moral intent, is abusive to our nation and it's people.We as humans deserve the right to protect ourselves. Removing guns will just add to the problem.http://en.wikipedia.org...;Removing guns is not the answer anyway. Practically any item can replace a gun and prove to be just as harmful. People will find other ways to use weapons to commit crimes, even if they cannot get guns internationally. Removing guns is not the answer, it is strengthening the criminal justice department to better seek out criminal behavior on learn effective ways to stop it in advance.http://ricksparks.blogspot.com... MORE LAWS RESTRICTING FREEDOMGun control is putting our personal freedoms at risk. We who live in America pride ourselves on being a free country, but are slowly losing our grasp on that freedom. The more laws that are made, the more freedoms that are violated. We should be looking to protect the remaining right we do have, rather than seeking out to destroy the foundation of what our great country was built on. Taking away gun rights is limiting or nations and state soveirngty. We cannot let the act to take away guns, be a vehicle taking us down the path to communism. We need to realize that the constitution, the bill of rights, was made to enact and justify our freedoms. We need to stay strong in ourselves, and protect our freedoms. Limiting our rights should be a crime worse than any. Every day we lose more and more of what little freedeom we have left, as each new law is passed. Let us protect what is left that belongs to us, such that we can create a better country with what we have. ======CONCLUSION===== I feel that I have succesfully fulfilled my burden as Con in advocating against gun control policies.I would like to note that my opponent more or less agrees in several of his arguments that gun control is unneccesary for a few reasons. This means we must look to the fact that guns are essential means for protection, as my opponent points out.We cannot take away gun rights because we are giving guns to the criminals, and furthering the problem.So we must look to my three main points when evaluating this round.1. Our rights will be violated by removing guns.2. We as humans have the burden of responsibility, that should define our use or possesion of guns.3. And finally, we need to stop limiting our few remaining freedoms. In order to remain fully free, we should hold on to the freedoms that are most important.It is for all the reasons I have stated above, that I urge to to vote in negation to the resolution. Thankyou.",

            "conclusion": "Gun control is a stupid idea",
            "premise": "I would like to remind the audience that my opponent carries a clear burden of proof. To show that gun control is a stupid idea.On round 1, he didn't offer any proof at all. He just claimed to know the future.On round 2, he CLAIMED the ability to provide proof against mine but didn't, FALSELY claiming I would not accept that as evidence (see below). He then went on to expand his still unproved resolution to extremes, straining the inevitable Nazi comparison and some irrelevant ideas about the mind of drug addicts and conveniently absent police.On round 3 he has now introduced statistics and data he HIMSELF declares \"cherry-picked\" and only \"seemingly unbiased\", which makes it totally worthless for offering proof. He even admits that he considers all sources \"inconclusive\".My opponent has NO proof to offer at all, he is content with false propositions and \"common sense\", which is the truly classic \"argumentum ad populum\" fallacy.I will explain in detail:Data: The data aggregated on http://www.gunpolicy.org... comes from a great variety of sources, most notably, as far as my citations about Germany go, from this official report of the WHO on mortality: http://data.euro.who.int...Anybody accusing the WHO of \"cherry-picking\" would have to do more than provide sources he calls unreliable himself. I have thus shown that the number of people killed by guns in Germany has decreased consistently, with Germany having one of the strictest gun controls in effect. This statistic was even used by a website OPPOSING gun control. It can thus not be seen as cherry-picked.It is hence not subject to the same exemption my opponent would apply to all \"cherry-picked\" sources, as it's clearly and evidently unbiased - it is used by both sides. His proposition that all \"gun control statistics vary wildly\" is disproved.My opponent also has left the report and analysis from Australia unrefuted. It is thus conceded, proving gun control and gun buyback programs work. I admit they may not be as effective in the USA, but that is NOT the topic of this debate. The question is whether gun control is stupid as an idea, and saving people from homicide and suicide is never a bad idea.\"The threat of tyranny still exists in our modern world today and is a very valid reason for having the rights to own and use a gun.\"Despite me asking for proof for this, my opponent has linked to a site showing alleged examples of tyranny through gun control ( http://www.mercyseat.net... ), which are examples from 1915 to 1981. That's more than 30 years in the past, so hardly \"in our modern world today\". So, this point has been dropped and conceded.My opponent insists that I pick up on his drug-addict parable.Drug-addicts behave irrationally, especially under the influence of drugs. Very often, before a drug addict commits a crime to obtain his drugs, they will consume the drug to overcome anxiety, which means they do not act RATIONALLY anymore:\"These crimes include those that are consequential to the ingestion of a drug by the victim or offender, causing irrational or violent behavior ... and intentional ingestion of a drug to \"relieve anxieties and stimulate courage\" in preparation for acts of violence (Goldstein, Brownstein, & Ryan, 1992).\" from: http://www.safetycops.com...Which means that if I imagine I were a desperate drug addict, I would stop at nothing to get my drug or the money I need to buy it, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. After all, I'm ADDICTED. I would most probably rob the nearest store, as my top priority would be to fulfill my need. My opponent insists that the police won't arrive in time, so I won't have to worry about the cops. And being a \"druggie\" I would certainly forget to check whether the drugstore owner has a gun or relies on deterrence alone.My opponent wants me to refute his unfounded claim that gun control will take guns away from law-abiding citizens. That is quite easy, actually. \"Gun control: regulation of the selling, owning, and use of guns\" from Merriam-Webster's dictionary.Gun control regulates OWNING of guns. As in, the STORAGE of guns, too: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov...Gun control is actually what SEPARATES the responsible gun-owners from the irresponsible ones. Guns need to be stored safely, and this is already part of laws in effect, which my opponent has accepted by calling those who obey these exact laws \"responsible\".341,000 guns are stolen every year in the USA, according to US Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Guns and Crime, 4/94). Gun control on safe storage could thus keep all these guns in the hands of the \"responsible\" owners, who don't have their guns conveniently lying around for criminals to kill innocents with. This is the exact opposite of what my opponent claims, in facts and numbers - against his \"common sense\".Nazi Germany: The link my opponent provides makes it clear: http://www.mercyseat.net...\"The major German gun control law (which was not replaced by the Nazis until 1938) was enacted ... in 1928.\" - \"On November 9, 1938 and into the next morning, the Nazis unleashed a nationwide race riot. Mobs inspired by the government attacked Jews in their homes, looted Jewish businesses, and burned synagogues, with no interference from the police. [34] The riot became known as \"Kristallnacht\" (\"night of broken glass\"). [35] On November 11, Hitler issued a decree forbidding Jews to possess firearms, knives, or truncheons under any circumstances, and to surrender them immediately.\"The \"Kristallnacht\" was not due to gun control. Both parties, Nazis and Jews, had at that time equal access to weapons. The problem was that police did not intervene according to that law and stood by and watched. Gun control aimed at Jewish people was released AFTER that fateful night, making no difference at all, as the site continues:\"These Jews' passivity doubtless was the result of centuries of victimization in Russia.\" It was thus not the result of the gun control laws of 1928. My opponent's sources:\"Research has found ... that higher rates of household firearms ownership are associated with higher rates of gun suicide, ... that firearms are used defensively many times per day, and that some types of targeted police interventions may effectively lower gun crime and violence. [...] The committee found that answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods, however well designed. For example, despite a large body of research, the committee found no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime\" http://books.nap.edu...I admit that guns ARE used in self-defense. The statistics say nothing about whether the use was adequate. It's all based on surveys of gun-owners. I checked repeatedly and came up with nothing.I wish my opponent had supplied more (relevant) statistics to discuss. What he offered mostly refers to the reports of John R. Lott Jr., and the report I quoted right above is mostly in reply to those reports, and actually confirms my opponent's claim that THOSE are inconclusive. No doubt remains about the suicide numbers. As I presented above.The condensate:\"Guns prevent a tyrannical government\" is a false induction. Tyrannical governments have been established in a few countries where gun control was in effect. But tyranny can rise in countries without gun control laws. Iraq, most famously:https://www.lewrockwell.com...http://www.slate.com...So, tyranny did not arise in the UK and Germany - which have gun control laws - but in Iraq - which hadn't.\"Common sense\" makes no argument, it's the \"Ad-populum\" fallacy.My opponent has failed his burden of proof.Thanks all, take care!",

America's pervasive gun culture stems in part from its colonial history, revolutionary roots, frontier expansion, and the Second Amendment, which states: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Proponents of more gun control laws state that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that gun violence would be reduced; that gun restrictions have always existed; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new gun restrictions. The is in fact not true! The Second Amendment protects an individual\"s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense from threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime.

            "conclusion": "The US Should Have Better Gun Control",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for this debate. What makes the United States so great, I believe it is our freedoms and rights; are freedoms and rights are listed in the Bill or Rights in our Constitution. The definition of a Constitution is an established law, custom, or the supreme law of the land(1). Which means the laws in the Constitution and the articles and amendments that are written in it are supposed to be held above any other law that is made in the land. Among the 27 amendments the 2nd one is the amendment that states \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed (2).\" It states in the Constitution reminding all those who read this that the Constitution is the higher law of the land that the rights for people to own and have guns shall not be infringed so any gun control legislation should by law be illegal. But besides the Constitution argument lets look at the real statics. If I asked the readers whether they think gun crime has gone down, up, or stayed the same since 1993 most would answer it has gone up. The real statics is that it has dropped by 49% that shows that it is getting better not worse like many people claim it is like my opponent (3). 99.9% of all guns in the United States will not be used for violence which shows that gun control is punishing everyone for the acts of the 0.01%. Enacting gun control won't stop criminals from getting guns, 96% of all guns used for crime was obtained illegally by theft, black market sales, or illegal manufacturing. Going off my opponents argument of Australia and the United Kingdom the fact is when they banned guns armed robbery is up 40% in UK and 44% in Australia and in the UK most of their robberies occur when the victim is at home because criminals don't fear home owners without guns.(4) My opponent is trying to throw out the argument of \"guns don't kill people, people kill people.\" Guns are a tool for self defense and I have a good analogy for this argument. If I take an exam for school and I fail whose fault is it? Can I blame my pencil, well I could my teacher would probably not buy it and fail me. But if someone kills another with a gun it is the guns fault and should be banned. Does that make sense of course not people need to take responsibility for their actions and people need to hold them responsible. Guns don't kill people, people kill people.

            "premise": "Thank you, con for making this debate possible. I look forward to seeing the outcome of this debate. Let me start by disregarding how important gun control is for the creation of a stable society, we can all agree that a stable crime free environment, is imperative to a utopian model stable society. I understand that we need rules to prevent criminals from doing more criminal activity, however it is imperative that to the overall masses, there needs to be gun laws to prevent future crimes. Criminals are people who have already committed a crime, but this bracket removes the possibility of future criminals from the masses. It is important to notice this difference. Rules should apply to criminals, of course. However rules should apply to non-criminals to create difficulty for future criminals to use such a weapon as a medium to carry their evil deeds. Let me also highlight, the simplicity of people using guns to carry out their deeds. All it takes it to grab a weapon, a few rounds and with little to no planning, time and effort you have a dozen dead people in a mass shooting, as well as the cops chasing you down furiously. Now, I understand that if we do impose gun laws that criminals will find other ways to enact their violence, but this does come with it\"s benefits, for example as I mentioned before, the simplicity of becoming a mass murderer with a gun. Other methods take a lot more time and effort than just picking up a firearm, and clicking the trigger. Bombs for instance, require hours, days or weeks of effort, and with this time, it gives people more time to notice their evil deeds and other suspicious activities. By making the criminals have to go to longer lengths, it makes the community able to pinpoint suspicious activities and to catch the criminal at hand. Regardless of how they conduct their methods, the amount that they do it is more concerning. By placing gun control, it removes the simplicity of merely picking up the firearm, holding the trigger, and having dozen bodies scattered in front of you.",

            "conclusion": "Gun control is a stupid idea",
            "premise": "So, my opponent chooses to simply declare my sources unreliable.http://www.liberales-waffenrecht.de...Well, this picture is taken from the official police statistics in Germany, and it is found on a site called \"Liberales Waffenrecht\", and even people who can't understand German will be able to tell what \"liberal\" means. This site advocates a liberalization of gun control, yet provides the same statistic: a decrease in gun related deaths in SPITE of German gun control.Here's the article to which this relates, you can clearly see the title above.http://www.liberales-waffenrecht.de...So, despite my opponent's desperate claims, my statistics are factual and official, and are even used by opponents of gun control.The resolution claims gun control to be a stupid IDEA. Ideas are not bound to national borders, nor has the opening resolution shown any indication of national restrictions.In Germany and the UK, gun control has proved to be a very good idea, with the death rate by guns being significantly lower than in the USA.My opponent now wants to expand on his original argument.He claims that laws serve as restrictions to freedom. So, we are now arguing that all laws are bad because they limit freedom? Did my opponent not say that \"Criminals don't obey laws\" anyway?So, the discussion about laws is - by the parameters set by my opponent - totally irrelevant and serves as a mere distraction here.Then my opponent talks about Nazi Germany, which is the classic \"appeal to the extremes\" fallacy. We do not live in Nazi Germany. And to believe that gun control was a substantial part in the genocide is totally unfounded. Germany, as opposed to the USA, has never had a history of armed resistance against the government.We were originally discussing \"one thing\": \"What would stop criminals from illegally obtaining guns and using it on an armless public?\"Now we are apparently discussing \"tyranny\"? Another distraction.But Germany has had the worst tyranny ever, and despite gun control the tyranny has not broken out again. So, there's no indication that gun control leads to tyranny. In fact, Germany and the USA are allies.\"The constitution allows Americans the right to bear arms as a personal right because the founding fathers recognized the threat of tyranny and the need for self-defense.\"Oh, do we have witness accounts for that or is that just an inductive conclusion?\"The threat of tyranny still exists in our modern world today and is a very valid reason for having the rights to own and use a gun.\"I say it's not in our society. Tyranny can be found in countries where armed militia roam the streets and there is no gun control in effect. Provide proof of your allegation.As for my explicit SIDE-NOTE:Thanks for your opinion on this. It does, however, not pertain to our debate, so I will not delve much deeper into this.\"Gun control commits the fallacy of assuming that guns in circulation will be eliminated once gun control laws are enacted. They won't.\"My opponent does not know the future. In Australia, guns have been collected and the number of gun related deaths has decreased.\"In 1997, Australia implemented a gun buyback program that reduced the stock of firearms by around one-fifth. Using differences across states in the number of firearms withdrawn, we test whether the reduction in firearms availability affected firearm homicide and suicide rates. We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80 per cent, with no statistically significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The estimated effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude, but is less precise. The results are robust to a variety of specification checks, and to instrumenting the state-level buyback rate.\"http://ftp.iza.org...So, fact again goes against the precognition of my opponent.I will under no circumstances try to imagine how the mind of an addict works. Only an addict can understand that.\"Guns are self-defense for the vast majority of responsible gun owners\" - which, as I pointed out, will not be negatively affected by gun control.\"protection from the threat of tyranny\" - criminals, about which this debate is, will not protect society from tyranny.\"and common sense to acknowledge guns won't be removed from circulation once gun control laws are enacted.\" And fact in Australia and Germany goes against this alleged \"common sense\".A final question for my opponent: If we do not control guns, will that not just mean guns are far more easily accessible to NON-RESPONSIBLE gun owners and criminals? Will this not put the RESPONSIBLE gun-owners who can easily obtain a permit under gun control in disadvantage?My opponent's arguments make little sense in that regard. Gun control is not about taking all guns away, it's about leaving guns only in the hands of responsible gun owners.It is thus not a stupid idea.",

            "premise": "I will start off with debating my opponents argument that allowing more gun ownership adds fuel to the fire, my opponent is assuming that if people are allowed to have guns, they will use them. Some people just want guns to feel more powerful and protected. We have no proof that if we allow people to get guns easier than they will use these to commit crimes. I am not saying that anybody should be allowed to have a gun. Obviously if you have committed a crime before you should not be able to get a gun, but the real thing is either way people are going to get guns. People get guns illegally all the time, how do you think people in gang wars, or drug dealers get guns? Do you think they get their guns legally? My answer is no, they get them illegally in the streets. I am not saying that we should give guns to criminals, that is not my intention. All i am saying is people are going to get guns regardless of the laws. Wouldn't you rather them get them legally so we can track the guns than illegally? Your argument saying that it creates more crimes is not true. Here are some facts i found about strict gun control laws put in place with the relationship to crimes: In England, which has the strictest gun-control laws of the developed nations and which had outlawed all handguns and most firearms, the Sunday Express of June 20, 1999, reported, \"In recent months there have been a frightening number of shootings in Britain's major cities, despite new laws [Firearms Act of 1997] banning gun ownership after the Dunblane tragedy. Our investigation established that guns are available through means open to any criminally minded individual.\" http://www.fff.org... My opponent says that more guns create more crimes when it is actually the opposite, less guns equal more crimes. I have the facts, i dont see any sources or backing in my opponents argument saying that more guns will create more crimes. However i have a source that shows less guns create more crime. All my opponent is trying to do is argue against my arguments, when this debate is about loose gun control. I urge you to vote pro because i am giving support to the main argument, not just arguing my opponents arguments.",

            "premise": "Guns are certainly a major social issue in the United States however they are often abused by the insane and criminals; thus, it gives the wrong impression that guns do not protect humans. In fact, they are quite the opposite of what many people assume. Stricter gun control laws are not necessary to moderate guns because they only promote the illegal use of guns; only certain minorities will use guns in unethical/illegal ways; and there are many benefits that come along with passive gun laws. Prohibiting or limiting the use of guns will only make gun users want to use them even more. Just as parents trying to limit an activity will only make children become addicted, so will with guns. As humans are wired to be curious and become addicted to things that are purposely limited to them, it will only make matters worse as gun owners will attempt to use guns even more with such laws. This has been proven throughout history as anything banned by the government would only make them be used even more by the people. Only certain evil or crazy people will use guns. Instead of trying to limit gun use, the government should only try to prevent guns from getting in the wrong hands. They should create laws that are fair and only limit those that are crazy/evil, such as requiring a gun license and attendance at certified gun training facilities to purchase a gun. As opponent said, only the insane and evil abuse such a privilege, so the government should only make laws to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. There are also many benefits that come along with using guns as a citizen. You can use it to protect your own or others' lives when there are criminals or crazy people that have illegally purchased guns to kill people. You can use it as self-defense against not just people but with animals and with objects in certain situations. Having a gun also makes you feel safe in case your country gets invaded; that's the reason why Japan never invaded U.S. in WWII.",

            "premise": "Rebuttals My opponent makes a single comparison: Canada vs. US crime rates. However, the problem with his source is that is only measures gun crime, not overall crime. Now, when looking at a mere comparison of rates, the only country that should be compared with the US is Canada\u2014sociologists have argued our societies are very similar\u2014however the way my opponent does it is very flawed. Comparing a mere rate of these two nations is illogical due to the fact Canada has the same population as California, and the only way that would be valid to measure the effect of Canada\u2019s gun laws is two fold: 1) Compare the crime trends of the USA and Canada, far different from the rate. Ask which country had larger drops in crime. 2) See if Canada\u2019s crime rate dropped One, although is semi-credible, is still flawed as comparing statistics may fall into endogenous factors among other problems, however is much more credible then comparing the rate. Number two is the most credible way to measure the effects of gun control. This erases any problems of comparing societies and are much more specific, and can tell us how the law affected the crime in Canada that a mere comparison would fail to accomplish. I will now use both of these methods and prove Canada\u2019s gun laws have been a failure. 1) Comparing the crime trends of the USA and Canada Starting with their 1970\u2019s laws, these restrictions have been a failure. Interestingly, although gun crime fell overall crime rose. (my opponents source only measures gun crime. If gun crime decreases but overall crime increases, this would prove gun control cost lives). David Kopel Notes in his 1991 law review, \u201c{Criminologist] Blackman observes that in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while Canada was enforcing its new strict controls, America added no new federal control and relaxed control at the state level. Nevertheless, northern-tier American states (arguably the most comparable to Canada) saw a much slower rise in the robbery rate than did Canada. \u2026 Only 13% of United States residential burglaries are attempted against occupied homes. Most Canadian residential burglaries occur in the nighttime, while American burglars prefer daytime entry to reduce the risk of a confrontation. When an American burglar strikes at an occupied residence, his chance of being shot is at least equal to his chance of being sent to jail.\u201d The first emphasis (mine) showed although both saw increases in crime (the 80\u2019s was a time of increased crime for unknown reasons) the USA had less of an increase. Using Criminologists Blackman\u2019s study, who controls for many variables, found Canada had a larger increase in crime, meaning Canada\u2019s gun control has little effect (or an effect that increases crime) on their crime rates. The second emphasis (mine) shows American robbers are shot fairly often. In the words before that, it shows robbers in the US are deterred by people in the home, likely because people can shoot back, whereas in Canada there is no such deterrent effect and robbing homes with occupants with no means to defend themselves is not \u201cscary\u201d. That basic comparison shows guns have a capability to deter criminals and, therefore, save lives. Kopel further points out \u201cDomestic homicide fell in Canada, and dropped even more sharply in the United States.\u201d[1] As we can see, as the US loosened gun laws and Canada made them more strict, the USA experienced a larger drop in crime, giving more data for the deterrence hypothesis and the Canadian gun control failure. Further study by Gary Mauser finds the Canadian gun control had, at best, no effect on crime. He further noted the US had extremely faster rates of crime decline, and in cases when crime increased, a slower increase. His basic comparison proves the Canadian gun control has failed and that these comparisons prove gun control has had no success [2]. 2. Looking at Canada itself Canadian crime rates have remained fairly stable before and after their gun laws were passed, proving their gun laws have been ineffective. After the 1977 law, homicide did drop BUT homicide was dropping since 1975, and actually stabled the year after, and as stated above its drops in crime were negligible compared to other countries. Canada\u2019s gun control has been a failure [3]. Case Is it possible that more guns causes less crime? Interestingly, many studies believe this is so. According to the most credible studies, gun defensive usage (DGU\u2019s) range from 1.5 million through 2.5 million, but other small studies have actually reached the number of 4.5 million DGU\u2019s per year. A 1999 study by Lawrence Southwick, using measurements from deterrence studies done on the death penalty and other crimes (which is a good proxy when measuring if criminals can be deterred, and by how much), finding that the 299 justified civilian killings of criminals would have prevented 2,200 murders that year. However, when you add in the fact criminals often thwart criminals without killing them, often through injury, and other numbers provided by Kleck 1991, the number increases to 8,900 murders deterred. When going through every single variable, study, and violent crime, Southwick concludes 800,000 crimes deterred each year by gun owners, merely by them being there (no confrontation of anyone), and 400,000 would be a lower estimate (using NCVS data). If Klecks study is preferred, the number becomes 1,700,000 \u2013 3,300,000 violent crimes deterred by gun owners, meaning with guns existing crime is hugely decreased [4]. Some more facts: --In the UK, murder was 52% higher after the 1968 ban and 15% higher after the 1997 ban. --In Chicago, handgun crime increased (but depending on the data I use, the data either claims an increase in crime or a slight decrease. But all of the data agreed initial after the law crime increased). --In Washington DC, the homicide rate was 73% higher after their gun ban. --In all of the conceal carry states listed, crime decreased. All from [5]. Conclusion: Here is a fact: Gun control does not decrease crime Here is a data point: there is some evidence that gun control increases crime The resolution is negated. 1. http://www.guncite.com... 2. http://www.fraserinstitute.org... 3. http://www.saf.org... 4. http://saf.org... 5. http://www.justfacts.com...",

            "premise": "The U.S government is taking gun control reform too seriously and the best idea is to stop gun control laws. I would like to thank my opponent, whomever it is for his argument and his time. Now I shall begin my argument: 1) Contrary to popular belief, the places with more gun control reform actually have more deaths per year than places where there are less gun control reform such as London. Why? That is because in those countries with more gun control reform, the criminals know that the citizens do not have weapons on them, making thm an easier target for burglary usually using knives. However, when criminals are in an area with less gun control reform- and lets say they own a gun too- they know the risks of breaking into a house where the owner owns a liscensed firearm and they will not risk being injured or killed. 2) The Second Amendment is one of America's oldest laws and it states that: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" 3) Though some people say that it is the government's right to protect the people, it is also the citizen's right to overthrow he government when they find i not fit to lead. How can civilians fight off a trained military? With firearms. 4)Though some say less gun control reform makes for more terrorists attacks, that is also false due to the thorough background checks. The background checks involve seeing if a person has been to countries of dispute for suspiciously prolonged periods of time and whether or not if that person is mentally ill or if they have a criminal record.",

            "conclusion": "there should be more gun control",
            "premise": "looking for a debate on the topic, especially with those who say no more control, at all. here are my initial thoughts/rants.... why isn't meaningful legislation already passed? most people on news shows seems to offer the same ideas, no guns for mentally ill and criminals, background checks on all guns, and assault rifle, automatics type bans. hardly no one says we should just ban all guns, it's a red hearing from gun advocates to get on their grandstand. -background checks. 74% of NRA members think all guns should have checks. on the point about background checks, 40% of guns sold in the country \\are without checks, through gun auctions etc. this could surely help cut down on access to guns to the wrong people. the NRA officially is against any more control on guns. saying we should have more guns, guns for principles etc, not that i'm necessarily against such measures. but if the folks within the NRA actually like more checks, shouldn't we just take the NRA's official points as being merely political grandstanding? there's no reason we can't put guns in the hands of the right people, while at the same time taking steps to remove them from the wrong hands. it's worth a shot. -it's nearly unanimous that certain mentally ill people shouldn't have guns. the NRA says we should have better mental health institutions, but doesn't add how restricting guns to certain mentally ill wouldn't help, too. -most people think assault rifles should be banned. there's far fetched theories that hitler will come back and wreck havoc, exagerrating for effect... but we have a problem now as it is, we should focus on current reality, not possible far fetched scenarios. and if most agree to ban... there should be no hold up. -a lot of people like to say murders etc would happen anyway. it wouldn't be tothe same extent, though. they say timothy mcveigh built a bomb anyway, that hammers cause as many deaths as assault rifles. most gun deaths are from normal people with a gun... if they didn't have the gun, they wouldn't have killed, and they almost certainly wouldn't have made a bomb, even if a few people might have. hammers might cause as many deaths, but there's probably at least one hammer for every person in the country... 350 million, while there's only around a million assault rifles. statiscally then, assault rifles are hundreds of times more likely to cause a death etc. and, at the end of the day, if assault rifles were illegal, many wouldn't have them.... such as teh recent school shooter's mom, very likely. if she didn't have it, the son wouldn't have got it, and there'd have been very many less deaths. it's pretty straightforward, pretty simple, here. a guy went on a rampage in china, with a knife at the same time of the recent school schooting. gun proponents like to say it's proof something would happen anyway. but twenty some were injured only, instead of killed. yes there are always other ways to kill people, but reducing guns reduces most violence that couldn't otherwise occur. most people don't and woudn't be timonthy mcveight, for example, creating his own bomb, finding other ways to kill at least on a mass scale or beyond what's at least reasonably defensible without a gun like knives etc. sure criminals won't give up their guns just because the g overnment asks them to... but the reality is most or many deaths wouldnt have occurred if they had no gun. -while no one thinks we should ban all guns, there's something to be said about it. at least in so far as showing that it's posible to reduce gun violence here. the USA is the worst in this regard, japan is the best, and there's many shades in between. would you give up your right to a gun if you knew it'd overwhelmingly cut down on murders etc? in japan last year, with a ban on all guns, they only had eleven gun deaths... and with a third of our population, that'd translate into 33, down from the 120000 plus that we currently have. i'm not sure how we'd ever get to a point of outlawing all guns, so in the mean time i'm against it. but when we look at the shootings at the school or random domestic violence... are we willing to say that those deaths are simply the price we pay for the right to have a gun? if guns were inevitable and we sometimes felt we had to have guns as to protect ourselves, sure, though japan etc makes one wonder of course there are second amendment arguments, but based on what the law should be only, i had always been one to think self defense is my right, and i'd never think to take the right from others either, and hunting etc etc. plus i do think guns are kinda cool. but if we're only needing guns for self defense because we protect gun rights for the bad guys to begin with, i'd probably be willing to forgo that right, and i might expect most others would too, if it's anything like japan. we have to recognize, afterall, that gun rights are basically protecting the rights of a minority at the expense of the safety of the majority, if japan etc and all that is true. most people don't have guns, and don't care to (though yes, it is still their right even if they choose not to exercise it) we are still in effect protecting the minority at hte expense of the majority... we have to admit that school shootings and such are the price we pay to protect the right to guns. sure criminals won't give up their guns just because the g overnment asks them to... but the reality is most or many deaths wouldnt have occurred if they had no gun. -in fact, most gun situations don't infolve self defense. in fact, when you have a gun in your home, statisics show that it will likely be used on yourself, or someone in your family. a situation where if you didn't have the gun to begin with, you'd be safer for it. it's true... if the football player who recently shot his gf and self didn't have a gun, if the scghool rampage shooter didn't have a gun.. they wouldn't have been able to do their crime. some might suggest everyone who's legal having a gun would lower violence, but if this is all true that having guns causes problems to begin with, it'd probably just encourage violence when there's domenstic disputes that otherwise wouldn't have occurred.... people often feel the need to use a gun, when they have it, just because they have it.// -so when people say \"guns don't kill people people kill people\" what are they really accomplishing, and establishing? that the mentally ill and criminals etc shoudln't have guns? that's self evident, and nearly everyone agrees. a step further, that we should allow guns as rights, given they aren't inherently dangerous and allow for self defense? well, as said, maybe they aren't inherently dangerous, but i'd argue the rights of a few who can't practice self defense is worth the safety of the few who are actually killed in those situations, were things really like japan, anyway. -i'm not saying to outlaw all guns at the time being, so can we and how do we get there from here? ultimately i'm not sure, but i'd suspect that if they can do it, we can do it. but it's all too culturally engrained at the time, and guns are everywhere, and second amendment considtruations... so this won't be and probably shouldn't be in my lifetime to say the least. -i'd argue guns should be more like driving a car, training, licenses, databases etc. perhaps society at large doesn't need to know how many guns or the kinds y ou have but it's not to much to ask that it be inventoried so that officers who could know, do know. that way we know that John has guns, when he goes crazy or on a rampage, or that the gun he has after he does all that, is illegal. this would surely reduce gun violence significantly. it's worth the loss of privacy given we are protecting teh safety of the majority at the expense of the minority rights. if even NRA members think what they do, and public polling is as it is... what's the hold up on legislation, and why isn't this the law of the land already?",

            "premise": "I'm going to assume, based on the way you worded the topic, and by your use of the constitution to back-up your position, that you would concede to the fact that the US government is a necessary entity, and one of its responsibilities is to create and enforce domestic laws in the interest of protecting it's citizens. The constitution makes black and white statements about human rights, such as the right to bear arms. But as soon as you admit that the government needs to create and enforce law, you also admit that there are cases where individuals forfeit certain freedoms, and those freedoms need to be removed by force if they are not surrendered. For example, when someone commits a crime, they go to jail, lose basic human freedoms. So rights, such as the right to bear arms, are there, but can be lost. I'm not sure if this is bad form, but a quick Google search yielded these statistics from BBC.com: \"Mass shootings: There were 372 mass shootings in the US in 2015, killing 475 people and wounding 1,870, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, which catalogues such incidents. A mass shooting is defined as a single shooting incident which kills or injures four or more people, including the assailant. Source: Mass Shooting Tracker School shootings: There were 64 school shootings in 2015, according to a dedicated campaign group set up in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Connecticut in 2012. Those figures include occasions when a gun was fired but no-one was hurt. Source: Everytown for Gun SafetyResearch All shootings: Some 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms in 2015, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and 26,819 people were injured [those figures exclude suicide]. Those figures are likely to rise by several hundred, once incidents in the final week of the year are counted. Source: Gun Violence Archive\" So there is clearly a problem here. I think its obvious that guns are not committing crimes. I've never heard anyone defend that ridiculous claim. But, people are definitely using guns to help them commit horrible crimes. As soon as you admit that the government is responsible to create and execute legislature to reduce gun related crime, you concede the debate. Anything you do to lower the above mentioned numbers, as well as the other huge numbers for gun related crimes not listed above, is, in fact, gun control. You mentioned women using guns to protect themselves. If any of those women are using guns to protect themselves from someone intending to use a gun to harm them, then they are actually controlling gun use with their guns. If you think its good to use guns to deter gun related crimes, then you concede that gun control is a good thing. Therefore if you think the American government is responsible to control crime, then you concede that gun control should be implemented into American law.",

What I mean by \"no to gun control\" is no to unreasonable and unproven (sometimes disproven) methods of doing so\"Well, then Con needs to define exactly what gun control measures he considers \"unreasonable and unproven\", or I don't really have much to work with...\"[Some gun control measures] can and eventually will lead to permenant gun bans\"That is a conjecture. Con will need to provide some sort of evidence or his assertion will not be accepted. Gun control laws do not automatically lead to permanent gun bans.\"The founding fathers would have agreed\"The Founding Fathers also agreed with slavery. It's not that I don't respect their opinions; they were all brilliant and deserve utmost respect. However, they lived over 200 years ago, and times have changed.Now, Con has already anticipated my usage of this argument and has provided a counter-argument:\" war, crime, and the human desire to get ahead -sometimes by unjust and illegal means- hasn't changed science the early stone age. Men and women need to defend themselves, however likely or unlikely the need to may be. To strip this right away from people is un American and unjust.\"I agree that people who want to defend themselves should have the right to do so.However, remember that I am not arguing for a total gun BAN; I'm arguing for gun CONTROL.One Gun Control law I support would be making the possession of assault rifles and other heavy artillery illegal altogether, as such firepower simply isn't necessary for \"self-defense\".\"America is losing the moral code it has thrived on for hundreds of years. And gun \"control\" is contributing to it, big time. It's not more, corrupt laws we need right now. It's enforcement of current law that has the true potential to stop this.\"Con needs to provide some proof of this. I agree America has seen better times, but I see no link at all between Gun Control laws and America's prosperity.We are in dire need of gun control. Never before have we seen such frequent rate of mass-murder in our country, and it needs to stop here and now.",

            "premise": "I realize that this is not my rebuttal statement, but I would point out that my opponent did not limit the issue of gun control to just the United States in his opening statement, and therefore cannot do so now. In my opening statement I will provide some definitions that will be useful for the remainder of this debate:Gun control-Through legislation, the limiting of access to and use of weaponry and associated items such as ammunition. This can include regulating who is permitted to buy and use guns, when and where they are allowed to be displayed/used, the sale of guns and ammunition, as well as determining which guns are allowed to be bought and sold. Essentially any laws \"controlling\" guns.My opponent will be arguing that gun control is ineffective and unnecessary. I will take the position that it is \"needed\" and certainly can be effective.Need (vb)-Something required or wanted [1]Effective (adj)-Successful in producing a desired or intended resultIn this case, I will be be arguing that gun control laws are desirable/wanted/needed in order to produce the desired result of reducing shootings and unfortunate events. My argument is that gun control is, in some instances, and can be helpful in keeping dangerous weaponry out of the hands of dangerous people such as the mentally insane. Also, citizens should not be allowed to have military grade weaponry, such as a GAU-19/A Gatling gun for example. In order to support my position, I must simply show that there \"should\" be at least some gun control given the definitions and explanation I have already provided. It seems self evident to me why mentally insane people should not be allowed to by guns. Unless my opponent can give reasons why this is not the case, I conclude that I will have won.As for their effectiveness, I argue that they certainly have been effective at preventing dangerous people from acquiring guns. Simply because they have not been perfect in doing so does not mean that we should get rid them. Also, just one other example are laws that prevent people from openly carrying firearms. As my opponent has taken the position that there should not be gun control, he must support the position that there should be absolutely no restrictions on who guns are sold to, and that even children and the mentally insane should be allowed firearms. He must also provide support for the position that gun owners should be able to do what they want with their guns wherever they want (for example, take one into a bank and make a withdrawal). He must also provide reasons why gun control is not effective and can never be effective.In conclusion, I feel I have already met my burden of proof (assuming burden of proof is shared in this debate and not completely on my opponent who holds to the more radical position that there should be no gun control).[1] thefreedictionary.com",

I hope this will be a thought provoking experience for both of us and may pragmatism win the day! It may not be necessary to call out, but I did mean to clarify that I am arguing against gun control in the US. Using other countries examples is fine, however, since my opposition to gun control isn't necessarily inclusive of the entire world, I would like to limit our debate accordingly. My apologies if this proves to be disagreeable, I assume full responsibility and would forfeit to you for a more appropriately titled challenge if needed. I'll dive in by listing my main opposition to American gun control as pithily as possible. 1) Civilian gun ownership is too prevalent to attempt to effect any realistic control of firearms: Given the American gun culture, The 2A with its recent affirmations by SCOTUS, the multi-billion dollar gun industry AND the fervent support from a host of formidable political rights groups, I believe a substantial percentage of civilian gun ownership in the US is, and ever will be, completely inevitable. Just facts.com estimates roughly 33% of adults owned firearms as of 2010, by the same sights estimations that's about 100 million people. Given the natural capacity for human error and want of self gain, particularly over such a large group, it is my contention that gun control could never effectively prevent access to guns by criminals in conjunction with incontrovertible American laws and values. 2) Gun Control Laws do little to deter criminals and much to encumber lawful citizenry I am genuinely hard pressed to think of a single example of gun control that isn't laughably ineffective to one who is willing to run afoul of the law. No concealed weapons? Gun free zones? UBGC? (Which couldn't even pass a democratic held senate). I'm no criminal, but logically one could get his brother to buy him a gun, hand it over, shave the serial numbers, and conceal that gun illegally wherever they go without regard for the law. Inversely, a lawful citizen pays for a background check and proper training for concealed certifications and is disarmed in a number of environments where a criminal would otherwise be free to carry. I do not wish to suggest that a law should not be made because it will not be obeyed, but rather that it should have a reasonable expectation of compliance via a defined and effective system of enforcement. Legislation aimed at readily available tools, rather than those that would use them inappropriately, is doomed to be hopelessly ineffective and only serves to stiffen the resistance of gun rights supporters that bear the sour fruits of these failures.

            "premise": "Over the past months, the debate over gun control has taken bounds through media; after the sandy hook shooting this trend is more easily observable. The Obama administration is now slowly moving closer and closer to gun restriction and confiscation, but is it a rational move? Today, out of every 100 Americans, an estimated 88 people own guns; which takes the figures well into the millions of people; yet arguably the vast majority of whom are law-abiding citizens. More Freedom Means Less Crime: Much like any other matter in our social life, Freedom to bear arms leads to more peace and security and it does not necessarily mean that every single person has to have an AR-15 for this to happen but precisely this freedom to bear arms alone guarantees less crime. Statistically speaking, in nearly every city more gun freedom means and has meant less crime. This is an undeniable, irrefutable and an unquestionable fact that the \"anti-gun\" media never stops to address. The example of this is very easily observed in the southern states like Texas, where some of the least restricting gun control laws are prevalent and not so surprisingly they have very low violent crime rate. For example after the city of Kennesaw, Georgia, passed a law requiring every home to have a gun, the crime rate dropped by more than 50 percent over the course of the next 23 years. Also see point 5 for the case for Switzerland\"s gun control. The issue of guns and gun control could not any simpler if people only understood the above fact. When we reflect on facts and statistics many of our arguments actually settle by themselves. In this case we can easily refute the notion that views guns as an \"evil\" piece of machinery, which is thought to be evil in the hands of regular citizenry and good when used and monopolized by the government, the military, and criminals. On the other hand where there is more restrictive gun control laws there is much more crime. States like New York and Illinois have some of the worst crime rates not only in the US, but in comparison around the world. The city of Chicago has the most strictest gun control laws in the United States yet it has become one the centers of overall crime in the US and deadliest Global cities! The harder gun control laws get, the higher crime rate soars. So the question must be asked: has the imposed gun restriction reduced crime? The answer is absolutely not. The murder rate in Chicago was about 17 percent higher in 2012 than it was in 2011. For any wise reader, who is able of some rational thinking, the above mentioned facts and examples should be enough of an argument to the end this debate, but let\"s not cease here as I have nine more points to cover.",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control Laws affect blacks negatively",
            "premise": "To begin this debate, I would like to dismantle your argument to make it easier for readers (including myself) to comprehend. If you see any flaws with what I believe is your argument, Feel free to correct me. Here goes: The title of the debate is \"Gun Control Laws affect blacks negatively\". Upon reading this, My initial conclusion was: \"Oh, He must think gun control laws were made in a racist manner, Or with racist intent\", But considering that my objective is to provide a counter argument, I have to analyze every possible debate. Due to the way the title is worded, You could easily argue that racism isn't involved at all, And that gun control laws simply happen to affect African Americans (and yes, I'm sure somewhere in the world, Some African American has been affected negatively). However, In Round 1 of the debate, You mention discrimination, And gun control specifically targeting \"ethnic minorities\", So for the sake of the debate, I will assume you are arguing that gun control laws are, In fact, Made with racist intent towards African Americans (feel free to correct that) The primary flaw I see in your argument is what is seemingly an inability to distinguish the difference between economic discrimination (specifically with gun control laws), And gun control laws targeting ethnic minorities. When you say gun control was used in a racist manner in the past, I assume you are referring to the \"Black Codes\" the southern states passed after the civil war in order to disarm slaves and maintain white supremacy. This is obvious racism, But more importantly, It is NOT what is happening today. As I said before, I believe you fail to distinguish the difference between economic discrimination and racism, So I would like to separate them for you: Racism, By definition, Is prejudice, Discrimination, Or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. Economic discrimination on the other hand, Is the concept that raising the price of a certain product will prevent minorities from using it. Since most crime comes from the lower levels of the economy, It would seem like raising the prices past what they can afford is an easy solution. To an extent, Yes, This is discrimination, But it is NOT racism in any way. This concept was put in place to keep the guns out of the hands of the criminals, And into the hands of hard-working citizens (whether or not it works is another argument). Just because African Americans may be the minority, And Caucasians may generally be higher-class citizens does NOT mean these laws were put in place to discriminate. Nobody sat in congress thinking to themselves \"How can I create prejudice, Discriminate, And antagonistic laws directed against African Americans to maintain my own racial superiority? \" to come up with the idea of economic discrimination. And if you really think it's as simple as: less guns for poor people + African Americans are the minority of poor people = racism, Then you have to reevaluate what you consider racism. To end this round, I want you to ask yourself: \"If Caucasians were the minority, And African Americans were at the top of economic discrimination, Would I still think it's racism? \" I apologize if I came off blunt in some of my arguments by the way, I get passionate when I write. As I mentioned, I had some difficulty understanding your initial argument, So feel free to revise as needed. I wish you the best of luck. . .",

            "discussionTitle": "The United States should impose Stronger, More Effective Gun Control Laws",
            "conclusion": "The United States should impose Stronger, More Effective Gun Control Laws",
            "premise": "Before I proceed I want to thank Baus for being brave enough to accept this debate. My objective with this debate is to educate both debaters and the readers about firearms violence inside the United States and how it compares to other industrialized nations, and about troubling weaknesses in federal gun control laws and the loopholes specific prohibited individuals use to get their hands on these powerful, remarkable weapons.Loopholes & Weaknesses in current Federal Gun Control LawsAs I discussed in the previous ROUND, there are certain limitations with current federal gun control laws that make it difficult for the ATF and law enforcement to reduce gun violence in our nation and to sometimes quickly apprehend a culprit following an incident of gun crime or violence. Among the restrictions placed on law enforcement are the Tiarht Amendements, which prevent law enforcement from creating an electronic registry of gun purchases and gun owners at the federal level (therefore limiting the ATF and other national law enforcement agencies from being maximally efficient in their work and prolonging gun crime/violence investigations) [1]. The Amendments require law enforcement and the ATF to destroy records following gun transaction background checks and they prohibit law enforcement agencies from diseminating what information they might have (such as forms 4473, collected after firearms dealers go out business) to the courts [1]. Furthermore, firearm sales between individual persons is hardly managed at all by current federal gun control laws and such transactions do not legally require a background check to take place [1], providing convicted felons and other individuals prohibited from owning/operating firearms with an opportunity to get their hands on one. Indeed, the ATF estimates that a whopping 40% of all gun sales in the U.S. are made by individual, unlicensed sellers who do not have to perform background checks [2].But, as I will demonstrate in this ROUND, current federal gun control laws are also weak in other ways and they're presently riddled with loopholes that make it easy for some prohibited people to get their hands on these lethal weapons of war.Currently, millions of fugitives across the country can pass federal background checks and buy guns illegally because police departments are not required to enter names into a national database that tracks criminals on the run [3]. This dreadful gap is largely a byproduct of the fact that police and prosecutors are often unwilling to spend the time or money to pursue fugitives across a state border. Because state law enforcement has no intention of pursuing these fugitives of justice in a different jurisdiction, these criminals travel relatively forgotten; the fact that there's no federal law requiring state law enforcement to enter fugitive names in the FBI fugitive database--the National Instant Background Check System--makes this problem a serious weakness of current federal gun control law [3]. Investigative reporter Brad Heath of USA Today recently found that in five states alone, law enforcement agencies failed to provide information to the FBI database for at least 2.5 million outstanding arrest warrants, according to police and court records on file [3]. What's shocking is that tens of thousands of these fugitives on the run are wanted for violent offenses and felonies [3]. According to USA Today, the federal databases used to perform background checks are missing more than 900,000 Michigan arrest warrants, 150,000 Ohio arrest warrants, 184,000 Washington arrest warrants, and many more from other states [3].In response to this alarming discovery, Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has said, \"It is...not surprising to me the extent to which there are holes in our system, given Congress' lack of success in addressing them\" [3].In many cases, entering fugitives' names in federal databases would be as simple as checking two boxes in a state law enforcement's computer system, but the lack of courage by Congress to pass additional gun control laws, such as requiring state police to report names to the FBI database, allows this major lapse in background checks to continue [3].And fugitives on the run are taking this opportunity because of Congress' inaction. Fugitive Deandra Smith, who was already wanted for a nightclub shooting (and multiple felony charges), was able to purchase a variety of guns at an Arkansas Pawn Shop in 2013 because his name was not entered in a federal or even a state database [3]. To quote his lawyer, \"Without that [entering his name in a database for background checks], it wouldn't matter how many background checks...[firearms dealers] ran [3].\" Every year, hundreds of thousands of fugitives on the run and people prohibited from owning firearms, like Smith, attempt to take advantage of the current set-up [4].According to a new report by the UC Davis Violence Prevention Program, which observed 78 gun shows in 19 states, loopholes in present gun control laws allow for easy access to guns that can be purchased by just about anyone, whether legally prohibited from purchasing a gun or not [5].Among the findings [5]:--illegal purchases, where surrogates buy a gun from a licensed dealer, is common at gun shows--anonymous, undocumented gun sales are common--parts used to make untraceable guns are widespread and easily attainable at gun showsGaren Wintemute, professor of medicine at UC Davis School of Medicine, found that \u201cillegal\" purchases \"were often conducted entirely out in the open\" [5]. Wintemute asserts that more has to be done to prevent both unregulated gun sales and illegal guns sales at gun shows; \u201claw enforcement needs to have an expanded, proactive program at gun shows to prevent the illegal sale of guns\u201d [5]. If not, individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms, like the dangerously mentally ill, minors, and convicted felons, will find gun shows to be an excellent source to obtain firearms--weapons the law states they shouldn't have.Currently, 44 states have laws regulating the sale of firearms to the mentally ill, but few states submit the names of prohibited mentally ill to the national database for background checks; in fact, just seven states account for 98 percent of all names prohibited for mental illness [4]. A frequently cited example is that of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooter who passed a background check to obtain the gun he used with which he killed 32 people on the university campus (and wounded 17 others), despite being declared mentally ill two years prior [4].Different states also have varying degrees of additional gun control laws in effect, but some have very few, almost entirely relying on current federal gun control laws (some state governments have also tried to abolish federal gun control laws within their state borders, even calling for the arrest of federal agents who dare to enforce firearms legislation; something not permitted by the U.S. Constitution [6]).What Federal Gun Control Laws Ought to DoCurrent federal gun control laws do not go far enough to prevent fugitives, convicted felons, the dangerously mentally ill, and minors from obtaining weapons they clearly shouldn't have. The Tiarht Amendments, though understandly trying to protect the anonymity of gun owners, create a stumbling block for the ATF and other law enforcement agencies charged with apprehending culprits of gun crime/violence. They frequently act to prolong the time between an incident of gun crime to final apprehension of the assailant, and in the case of new criminals or fugitives/convicted felons, like Deandra Smith, that's simply more time for them to engage in gun-related criminal activity.It would better serve law and order in this country to establish an electronic registry that law enforcement can use to link an individual gun owner with a registered firearm make, model and serial number. We can still protect the rights of gun owners to defend themselves while more effectively restricting criminals and others prohibited from owning guns. We shouldn't have to make the ATF and other law enforcement agencies jump through hoops and expand their investigations just to determine the individual that owns a gun make with a specific serial number. Determining who owns what gun should be as easy as it is to link a driver with a specified, registered automobile, especially for criminal investigations.Gun transactions between unlicensed individuals should still require a background check; it's simply way too easy for someone prohibited from owning a gun to purchase a firearm through these transactions. The ATF estimates that 40% of all gun sales in the U.S. are made by individual, unlicensed sellers who do not have to perform background checks--well that's just an incredible opportunity for minors, the mentally ill, fugitives of justice, convicted felons, drug peddlers and others to abuse! Gun Control Laws need to be expanded so that all gun transactions require a federal background check.Federal law should require state law enforcement to register a fugitive's name in the FBI fugitive database to better enforce current restrictions with gun laws. Our current gun laws would be so much more effective if this was already the case. Likewise, the names of the prohibited mentall ill should be required to be submitted to the national database for background checks.(Additional recommendations exist.)[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[2] (http://cdm16064.contentdm.oclc.org...)[3] (http://www.usatoday.com...)[4] (http://usnews.nbcnews.com...)[5] (http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu...)[6] (http://www.nytimes.com...)",

            "premise": "Resolution: The United States should impose Stronger, More Effective Gun Control LawsThe U.S. Supreme Court has consistently ruled that U.S. Congress has the right to pass gun control legislation as long as it doesn't violate the Second Amendment--but how is this possible? Easy. It's because most people don't truly understand the Second AmendmentBefore we get into the lively discussion of why U.S. Congress should impose sensible, more effective gun control laws than are currently on the books, I'm going to briefly explain that U.S. Congress has this power, and that the U.S. Supreme Court has historically and consistently ruled in favor of this interpretation [1][2]. Furthermore, the implied powers granted to U.S. Congress via Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution--the portion I'm referring to known as the \"Necessary and Proper\" Clause--give Congress the authority to pass gun control legislation, as long as it does not violate the Second Amendment [3][4].First of all, in order to understand why the U.S. Supreme Court has historically ruled that gun control is not unconstitutional, we have to look at the exact wording of the Second Amendment--which brielfy states the exact motive for having it inserted in the Bill of Rights.\"Amendment II. A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. [5]\"There are actually several ways to interpret this, but the most conservative U.S. Supreme Courts (and by extension, U.S. Congress) have interpretted this to mean that people have the right to arm themselves for the purposes of self-defense--but not necessarily for anything beyond that [3]. In other words, the Second Amendment grants people the right to arm themselves in self-defense--but not to maliciously and criminally injure others, to rob other people's property, or to act against law enforcement or state and federal governments [3]. Of course, this fits in line with the most conservative rulings of the nation's highest court, but historically the Court has also interpretted the Amendment to mean that having arms is only constitutionally protected for military purposes [4]. In fact, this is a position held by several sitting members of the current U.S. Supreme Court, and also the recently retired Justice John Paul Stevens [4].Either way, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that there is nothing unconstitutional about having moderate (conservative rulings) to abundant (liberal rulings) national gun control laws, because the Constitution doesn't guarantee the unrestricted, unconditional right to own firearms [1][3][4].In fact, because of historical U.S. Supreme Court rulings, U.S. Congress has already passed various laws restricting gun ownership or requiring gun registration and background checks on some gun purchases. As early as 1934, Congress passed the National Firearms Act, which required certain firearms and destructive devices to be registered with the U.S. government and which imposed a tax on sales of such devices; failure to comply with the act had criminal penalties, including up to 10 years of incarceration and between $10,000 to $100,000 fines for individual violations [6]. Over the years, congressional legislation signed into law has made it a crime for convicted felons, those convicted of certain misdemeanors, and for fugitives of justice to own and use firearms; people who illegally use drugs are prohibited from owning/operating a firearm, as are people who have been committed to a mental institution and who suffer a dangerous mental illness (however, not everyone diagnosed with a severe mental illness is prohibited from owning firearms); others are outlawed from owning and using firearms as well [1].Current Federal Gun Control Laws and Their Limitations In the last paragraph, I explained that certain people are probited from owning/operating firearms under federal law in the U.S. These people include [1]:-convicted felons/people convicted of certain misdemeaners-fugitives of justice-unlawful users of drugs-non U.S. citizens/non-permanent legal residents-people committed to mental institutions and diagnosed with dangerous mental illness-those with a criminal history of domestic violence (a single misdemeaner incident or more/greater)-some othersBut current federal gun control laws also place legal responsibilities (punishable with a fine and/or incarceration for not complying) on people who engage in the business of selling and buying firearms, also known as gun dealers.Current national law requires gun/firearms dealers to be licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and federal restrictions make it a crime for them to sell firearms to people under 18 years of age and other people prohibited from owning/using firearms [1]. It is a crime for a gun dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a firearm without the transaction first being approved by a prescribed source, after a background check has been conducted; the dealer is also required to document the sale of the firearm with federal form 4473, which identifies the purchaser's information and the make, model, and serial number of the firearm [1]. However, form 4473 is kept by the dealer, and the ATF is not allowed to put the purchaser's information in an electronic registry that can be later used by law enforcement; furthermore, current laws (the Tiahrt Amendments) require that the ATF destroy records on background checks after 24 hours that it approves a gun sale, and the ATF cannot use tracing data in some legal proceedings to revoke or temporarily suspend a dealer's license [1]. The ATF can only investigate dealers on an individual basis with regards to purchases, and can only collect 4472 forms after a gun dealer goes out of business [1].It's these limitations that place great strain on the ATF and that prevent it from more effectively carrying out its work. Because the ATF cannot create an electronic registry on gun purchases and must destroy information after it approves a gun sale (background checks are performed soley to determine if the gun purchaser is someone prohibited from owning/operating a gun), crimes committed with firearms take longer to investigate and provides the assailant with more time to break the law. The lack of an electronic registry on gun purchases in some cases allows assailants who use guns to avoid ever being detected and be brought to justice.The Bradley Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reports that the current weak guns laws in place at the federal level have allowed tens of thousands of guns to leave gun shops without checks or records, one of the reasons being the severe restrictions placed on the ATF's role during transactions and the follow up [7]. Requring gun dealers to better keep records of all firearms in their possession and to register all gun purchases in an electronic registry would allow the ATF and other law enforcement to better track guns in this nation and would vastly reduce gun crimes and violence; it would also shorten the time between an incident of gun crime and apprehension by law enforcement.Gun sales and transactions between individuals is even less strict and unfortuneately a background check and federal form 4473 are not legally required in such sales, which increases the probability that someone prohibited from owning a firearm will obtain one through such a transaction, such as a convicted felon or a minor. It also makes it more difficult for the ATF and other law enforcement to track a gun sold in this way used in a criminal incident [7]. In point of fact, firearms sold by \"occassional sellers\"--people not required to abide with the federal background check--were used in the Columbine School massacre that killed 12 students and 1 teacher, not including the two young perpetrators [7], who committed multiple felony violations of federal in the days leading up to the school shooting [8].Firearms sold by \"occassional sellers\" in the U.S. have also found their way into the hands of terrorist organizations in the middle east, including the Lebanese branch of Hezbollah, and across the Southern border into Mexico, where rivaling drug gangs have used the weapons to mow down each other and countless innocent bystanders [7].Shockingly, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence reports that more than 90% of the guns used by Mexican drug cartels originate in the U.S; 2000 guns are estimated to cross--illegally--the Southern border into Mexico per day [9]. Mexico, where guns are strictly outlawed, has seen over 100,000 people lose their lives in a drug war partly fueled by illegal firearms being shipped in from the U.S. [10]. The ATF estimates that 40% of all gun sales in the U.S. are made by unlicensed sellers who do not perform background checks, and that this is one major reason why guns are flowing across the Mexican border at such an alarming rate [9].But, as we shall see in the next ROUND, the U.S. is also suffering a major crisis all its own, for its weak/inefficient federal gun control laws currently in place.[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[2] (http://online.wsj.com...)[3] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[4] (http://www.businessweek.com...)[5] (http://www.ushistory.org...)[6] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[7] (http://www.nytimes.com...;)[8] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)[9] (http://cdm16064.contentdm.oclc.org...)[10] (http://en.wikipedia.org...)",
