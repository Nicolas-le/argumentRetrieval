            "conclusion": "Violence in video games does not significantly contribute to real world violence.",
            "premise": "What began the controversy:It is obvious that violence has been a major issue in society today. Events such as the school shooting in Newtown and the bombing of the Boston Marathon have made people begin to wonder what exactly pushed the guilty individuals to commit such atrocities. Many people have concluded that one of the major factors that promotes violence today are video games. Jay Rockefeller is one of the activists against video game violence. Minnesota Post explains that Rockfeller introduced a legislation instructing the National Association of Sciences to investigate the effects of violent video games on children, saying, \u201cPeople believe that violent video games are no more dangerous to young minds than classic literature or Saturday morning cartoons. Parents, paediatricians, and psychologists know better.\u201d (1) The effects of video games on the minds of young children has been studied for years, and the data quite contradicts Rockfeller\u2019s conclusion.What really causes violence in teens:Serious CrimesAdam Lanza, the gunman from the Sandy Hook shooting, played violent video games regularly. This caused many to believe that this is why he committed his violent crime. However, this was not the case. Eric Huey explains, \u201cIt turns out that delinquent peers, depression, and an abusive family environment account for actual violence incidents\u2026\u201d (2) Obviously, mental disorders would be another thing that promotes such violence. Here we can see that video games did not compel him (or most other school shooters) to commit the crime.AggressionA common argument against violence in video games is that violence in video games cause aggression. This is actually not the case. Carol Pichefsky notes that aggression is not caused by violent video games; rather, it is caused by a competitive environment (3). So, a game of MarioKart would be just as likely to result in aggression as a game of Call of Duty. This is not exclusive to video games either, competitive sports and competitive debate (especially on this website) are just as likely to result in aggression. So, it is certainly not the violence in video games that causes such feelings. The last thing I would like to note is that aggression and violence are two different things. Aggression is an intention. Violence in an action (4). My opponent showing that video games cause aggression is simply not enough.Violence rates:Here is the most important point of this debate. Logically, if violence in video games significantly contribute to real world violence, violent crime rates would rise as video game sales rise. This, however, is untrue: Now, I don't claim that this decrease is due to video game sales (a lot of other factors could have affected the decline). However, this decrease makes mockery of the idea that video games have legitimately contributed to the rise of violence in society today (5). Video game's effect:Releasing AggressionStudies suggest that video games give individuals an outlets to release aggression; there was a study done on inmates. An observer notes \"If you give them video games, they\u2019ll be less likely to start fights. So once a week we\u2019d hook up a bunch of TVs in a classroom so all of the murderers and rapists could play Halo. There\u2019s nothing more interesting than seeing guys who have killed multiple people deathmatching each other (6).\" The inmates clearly were able to release their aggression in a way that doesn't hurt other people. This can be applied to other people as well. Logically, if violence in video games makes inmates less violent, they won't have an opposite affect when it comes to kids.Enjoyment of ViolenceThis is an important part of the debate. Many people don't become violent because of violence in video games. Rather, they play violent video games because they enjoy violence. In order for con to win this point, he must prove that the violence in video games causes the violence. A simple correlation between violent people and people that play violent video games is not enough.(1) http://www.minnpost.com...(2) http://www.sfgate.com...(3) http://www.forbes.com...

            "premise": "There is possibly some things I didn't bother to clarify enough in my arguments. Particularly how desensitization caused by violent video games leads to an increase in violence outside of a military setting. I'll get to that and we should be crystal clear after that. Another thing I'll be hitting on is a logical fallacy my opponent has been using, which is basically her entire argument. AFFIRMING A DISJUNCT My opponents logical fallacy is called affirming a disjunct. Affirming a disjunct would look like this: Either A or B since A it's not B. Or if I wanted to write a more easy to understand example, here it is: Me or Debatability are debating. Since Debatability is debating it must mean I'm not. Anyway I'm not the best at writing examples, so if you're confused read the link that I'm using as a citation to prove my opponent's logical fallacy. http://www.fallacyfiles.org... Here is how my opponent has used this logical fallacy. \"A common argument against violence in video games is that violence in video games cause aggression. This is actually not the case. Carol Pichefsky notes that aggression is not caused by violent video games; rather, it is caused by a competitive environment \" This doesn't prove that violent video games don't significantly contribute to real world violence. It merely shows that competition contributes significantly to real world violence. Both desensitization and competition can contribute significantly to real world violence. This isn't one of those either or situations. Competition is a huge reason for violence. If this weren't the case than evolution would have never occurred. VIOLENCE RATES The chart my opponent provided isn't really well cited. I can't pull up what those numbers even mean is it a chart showing international or national video games sales and crime? It doesn't even matter. Violent video games can contribute significantly to real world violence, while the crime rate decreases. The chart really just boils down to correlation stats as opposed to causation stats. VIDEO GAME'S EFFECTS \"Studies suggest that video games give individuals an outlets to release aggression; there was a study done on inmates. An observer notes \"If you give them video games, they\"ll be less likely to start fights. So once a week we\"d hook up a bunch of TVs in a classroom so all of the murderers and rapists could play Halo. There\"s nothing more interesting than seeing guys who have killed multiple people deathmatching each other\"\" The article referenced no such studies of inmates. The quote my opponent grabbed was on cited from an author of a cracked.com article. It's just a funny story a former prison guard was recounting. The article did cite a few articles that showed some positive effects of violent video games, but none showed a decrease in aggression or violence as a result of playing them. NOT BORN TO KILL \"Killing simulations that promote competition can have the same effect. So, it may not necessarily be the violence in the simulations that made the kill rates go up; it could be the competitive factor.\" You miss the point these are training exercises and according to the research you've provided aggression is only increased for a short period after the competitive endeavor. The competition on the shooting range is always going to be there regardless of whether the target is shaped like a human or like a dart board with the red circle in the middle. According to my opponents own research showing that aggression only increases for a short period of time after competition, we must assume something else is going on there. I say and the research suggests it's desensitization. It's easier to shoot a real person when you've simulated the event 100s of times and have gotten rid of that natural repulsion of doing so. DESENSITIZE ME My opponent brings up a study that. Contradicts mine and suggests that very little if any desensitization occurs. Let's examine this study closer. \"The study involved 122 male and female undergraduate students who fell into two categories: 45 participants who had some video game experience within the last six months and 77 students who reported no video game exposure.\" http://www.newswise.com... The students were asked this question on a survey. (Probably more, but relevant to this debate) 1. Have you played a video game within the last 6 months? So how many of these students only played 1 game the previous 6 months? How many had had less than 3 total hours of videogaming those 6 months? How many of the non videogames players were exposed to a ton of other forms of violent media, such as slasher flicks? These types of studies need to have participants chosen more carefully. The study I showed uses people that play videogames a lot vs people that play rarely or if at all. It's a far better indicator of the effects of violent videogames. The study I've shown indicates that a lot of exposure to violent videogames makes it more likely that somebody will pull the trigger. \"2. This study involves a large amount of competition. This is what really makes this study invalid. The competition is what could really be promoting the regular gamers to push the button. When constantly being exposed to competition via video games, one is more likely to show aggression, as I have proven in my constructive. So, rather than the aggression being caused by video game violence / desensitization, it is caused by the regular competition provided by video games.\" The study I've shown though small indicates that exposure to a lot of videogames caused participants to be less concerned about the well being of their opponents. My opponents studies have shown that aggression is only temporarily increased due to exposure of competitive videogames. The study I linked to shows an increased willingness to pull the trigger. So something other than the temporary increase of aggression must be considered. That something is desensitization, as indicated by the decreased response to violent imagery. DR. BRUCE \" So, desensitization (if indeed caused by video games) results in reduced responsiveness to actual violence, not violent crimes themselves. For this point to stand, my opponent must prove that (a) video games actually desensitize individuals and (b) desensitization significantly contributes to violence.\" What desensitization does isn't necessarily cause people who aren't predisposed to violence to become violent. It actually contributes significantly to a culture of violence. Psychopaths are about 1% of the population and have a lack of concern for other individuals. They also make up over 30% of the prison population. http://news.uchicago.edu... The 1% number is on the conservative end as well. Some psychologists have them at 4% of the population. These people will slice your throat and not feel an ounce of guilt about it the next day. Most of them probably won't do that, but they still account for a disproportionate amount if the violent crime taking place in the United States. Common sense tells you that with an increase in apathy about violence going on right in front of your face that more people inclined to commit violent acts will feel free to do so. We have what's called the bystander effect that occurs all the time and we keep seeing. New cases of it on television all the time. http://m.psychologytoday.com... Bystander effect is actually where witnesses to a violent crime, do nothing to stop it or alert authorities to the situation. Sure some of this is caused by fear, but a large amount is caused by apathy. People just aren't bothered watching a man knock a woman's teeth out and take her purse. Psychopaths now feel safe committing violent acts in front of others due to the bystander effect. Another violent trend taking place across the United States is called \"The Knockout Game\". This is where a group of kids go around punching people as hard as they can in hopes of knocking them out. The targets are usually little old ladies or other defenseless people. http://newyork.cbslocal.com... All it takes is one psychopath leading a bunch of desensitized teens just wanting to fit in, and committing the act of violence in front of a mixed crowd of desensitized and scared people. Half scared to step in the other half just isn't bothered by it. Desensitization creates a culture of violence. It makes people inclined to violence more likely to be violent and contributes by making violence less repulsive and by extension more acceptable. \"The violence in video games isn't what actually causes violence. What really causes violence is various factors such as delinquent peers, depression, abusive family, and (as I have stressed on in my rebuttal) competition. Video games can give already aggressive individuals a way to release their aggression. Surprisingly, video games don't actually cause desensitization; moreover, desensitization hasn't been proven to cause violence.\" Those things mentioned are certainly factors, but just as important a those things is the culture of violence caused by desensitization. I've already proven that violent simulations (aka videogames) contribute to more violence on the part of the government and. If we look at the numbers to see how many deaths the government participates in, we can see that is a huge number. I've also shown that the desensitization caused by violent video games contributes significantly in direct and indirect ways. Please vote Con.",

            "premise": "I'll do a couple short rebuttals and then move on to some voting issues.MY CASELogical Fallacy- Affirming a DisjunctMy opponent accuses me of using this logical fallacy throughout my case. The problem with this point is that in order for me to be using this fallacy, I would have to have no evidence which shows how video games do *not* cause violence. I have shown this in a couple places. First, lets look at my statistics point. There I illustrated that as video game sales have gone up, violence rates have gone down. This essentially makes mockery of the idea that violence in video games significantly contributes to violence. However, if you, as a reader, do not buy this point, I'll clarify for you a bit more in my next point. Second, look at my point which explains the aggression release coming from video games. This suggests that violence in video games can actually lower violence rates, which is supported by my statistics. Through these two points, I hope you will all see that I have not used this logical fallacy. Really, studies on video games alone have so many variables that could be causing violence. It is inaccurate to blame the violence variable for any aggression / legitimate crime that comes from gamers.Violence RatesMy opponent explains that even if violence goes down as video games sales go up, the violence in these games could still be significantly contributing to real world violence. I would agree with this. These statistics are mainly there to support my release of aggression point. This point also illustrates how unlikely it would be for violence in video games to actually be contributing to real world violence in a significant way. I don't think my chart covers the military kill rate (I will talk about this soon). Later on in the voting issues, I'll elaborate more on the idea of significance.Video Game's EffectsBasically, my opponent attacks my source, as opposed to my argument. I would agree that my source could be considered inaccurate; I'll go ahead and bring up a couple more points to further elaborate on the idea of violent video games being used to release aggression. My first source notes that 42% of boys play video games because it helps them release anger, and 65% of boys say these games help them relax (1). My Gilsdorf source elaborates, \"If some of these men are hopelessly mentally ill, then we need to do all we can to prevent their access to real guns. But sane or depressed, many men feel powerless. Many feel angry. Many feel disengaged. They just want a stake in the action. Video games might be the best outlet they\u2019ve got.\"OPPONENT'S CASENot Born to KillThe first thing to look at here is the difference between video games and these \"killing sessions.\" My opponent essentially drops this argument. We have to realize that the video games kids are playing today are quite different from the simulations used in the army. Really, my opponent has only proved that military murder simulations increase violence in the military. This is not the topic we are currently debating. Even if these simulations could actually be compared to common video games today, these activities didn't make officers more willing to shoot because of desensitization (as a result of violence). The reason firing rates went up is because of the implementation of a method known as \"point shooting.\" Point shooting was effective (even without a video simulation) because it was similar to real combat situations (3). Essentially, my opponent has yet to prove that these simulations are (a) similar to real video games and (b) the violence factor of this simulation actually causes violence.Desensitize MeMy opponent points out some flaws in my desensitization study. Here is why my study really is more accurate.1. My opponent's study has multiple variables since it involves the actual playing of a video game. Essentially, the competition factor is very present in this study. There is no way of knowing whether the violence, the desensitization, or the competition caused the willingness to push the button.2. The study basically admits that it shows a correlation, not a causation. Look at this quote directly from the study:\"These relationships do not establish causality, as desensitized children with lower empathy may simply be more drawn to violent games, or a third factor, such as suboptimal parenting practices, may be responsible for this relationship. Potential mediating relationships should also be considered. For example, children who seek highly arousing experiences may be especially drawn to playing violent video games.\"and this quote: \"Children\u2019s estimated exposure to video game violence was not associated with aggression vignette responses.\"We can't look to a study with multiple variables that shows, at best, a correlation rather than a causation. My study further weakens this point by disproving the correlation between desensitization and violence in video games.My opponent also notes that while aggression is short lived, desensitization lasts a longer time. The thing is, since this study involves individuals actually playing some sort of a game. Obviously, spurts of aggression due to competition (or even violence) can be expected. Just remember, aggression is not the same thing as violence. Dr. BruceMy opponent brings up a new argument known as the \"bystander\" effect. He basically explains that this is caused by desensitization, and will ultimately contribute to real world violence. I'd like to make a couple points:1. The bystander effect is not a new thing. It has existed way before the time of violent video games. \"In the famous 1964 \u201cKitty Genovese\u201d incident, a young woman named Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death outside her home in Queens, New York. Many of Kitty\u2019s neighbors heard her desperate screams for help, yet no one called the police until too late (4).\" 2. Let's get to the real question, \"What causes the effect?\" The bystander effect is certainly not caused by desensitization. It is rather caused by a term known as \"diffusion of responsibility.\" To clarify my source continues, \"One reason that the bystander effect occurs is the social influence process known as \u201cdiffusion of responsibility\u201d. Through numerous studies, psychologists have found that bystanders are less likely to intervene in emergency situations as the size of the group increases.\"We can safely conclude that violence in video games does not contribute to such a psychological phenomenon.CONCLUSIONLet me bring up a few points to summarize...1. My opponent has made no empirical claims. This is perhaps one of the most important points. He cannot prove video games significantly contribute to violence if he fails to provide any numbers which show \"significance.\" Elaborating on what I said earlier on, all my opponent has shown is an increased kill rate in the military due to kill simulations. In reality, these simulations are not what promote the elevation of the kill rate, rather it is the new training methods (whether they involve videos or not).2. Video games don't cause desensitization. I have pointed out the various flaws in my opponents study. Essentially, there is no causation has been shown between desensitization and violence in video games.3. Other factors cause (at best) aggression. There are too many other variables in video games to pinpoint violence in video games as something that significantly contributes to real world violence.4. Video games can help release aggression. Hence, the lower violence rates. If you, as a reader, do not buy this argument, look to the fact that my opponent's case has not shown any significant contributions from violence in video games outside the military.5. Already violent people (or at least those who crave violent / arousing experiences) may play violent video games, hence the added violence from gamers. My opponent's desensitization study even suggests this... \"Children who seek highly arousing experiences may be especially drawn to playing violent video games.\"For these reasons, vote pro!!

            "premise": "Thank you Liz for thinking of this interesting debate topic. I've been meaning to explore some things that coincide with my arguments and this is a great opportunity to do so. TRAINED TO KILL I'll explain this more as I go along, but the fact is kids are being trained to kill. Everyday they are on their video games simulating acts of murder over and over. Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto all these games work to desensitize kids to violence and murder. It infects their brain and they lose their conscience. I hope by the end of this debate, I've convinced a lot of people to expose themselves and children to these violent forms of media significantly less. NOT BORN TO KILL Humans despite being a violent species are disgusted with violence. They can't bring themselves to kill people. Experts say that in World War 2 when solders would get within killing range of an enemy combatant only 1 in 5 would take the necessary shot. According to Army historian Brig. Gen. S.L.A. Marshall this has nothing to do with cowardice. Soldiers would still do feats of heroics, but just have a repulsion towards murder. Recovered muskets from the civil war showed that 90% were fully loaded. This means most of those simply weren't fired. Soldiers were pretending to shoot at the enemy. In the 1960s law enforcement was shown to have a similar problem. Cops just weren't shooting at suspects even when civilian lives were in danger. Psychologists stepped in to help the government create more efficient killers. How did they do it? Well look at a quote from the article this whole section is sourced from. \"Target practice on hollowed cabbages filled with ketchup to mimic the way a bullet rips open a human head. Marching to chants of \"kill, kill, kill.\" Video game simulations that reward points for every successful \"shot.\" These are among hundreds of techniques that experts say can recondition the human brain.\" That's right. The government uses video games to desensitize soldiers to acts violence, so killing becomes more palatable. This stuff actually worked. By the time Vietnam rolled around the kill rate was at 90% and is likely even higher now. The kill rate jumping from 20% to 90% in military operations aided by violent video games meant to desensitize people clearly fulfills my portion of the BOP, but let's take it a step further. http://m.sfgate.com... DESENSITIZE ME It's not so much Video games being directly responsible for real world violence so much as violent video games being a major contributing factor. The more kids play violent video games the more they become desensitized to violence and the less empathy they have for victims of violence. http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net... It's simple. The more you see violent images, the less it bothers you to see violent images. This desensitization makes it easier to either commit violent actions or to stand by and do nothing when violent acts are being committed. So it contributes in 2 major ways. I'm not the only one that sees this connection between violent video games and real world violence. \"In fact the surgeon general, the National Institute of Mental Health and multiple professional organizations \" including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association \" all consider media violence exposure a risk factor for actual violence.\" http://mobile.nytimes.com... I'm not saying that an individual that plays violent video games is going to be violent, but it certainly increases their chance of becoming violent, which in turn has a huge real world effect when taking into account how many people are exposed to this desensitization. In one recent study over 30 people were exposed to different images before playing a game where they could harm their opponent by blasts of sound. The people exposed to the most violent images, were far more likely to punish their opponent more than the ones not exposed to them. http://videogames.procon.org... DR. BRUCE Dr. Bruce Perry an expert brain development in children provides a useful list of things that contribute to kids becoming violent scholastic.com z His first cause directly blames desensitization to violence as a result of violent media (aka video games). Number 2 is becoming detached from people which could also be a result of playing violent games too much. His number 5 reason is because we are becoming more practiced at killing and specifically mentions violent video games as helping with the practice. http://teacher.scholastic.com... If you think that video games aren't good at teaching anything check out this article. http://www.wired.com... A man actually saves a life from the practice he got on a military recruiting game called America's Army. FACT OR FICTION According to psychologists, up to 25% of the population can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy. http://healthland.time.com... Maybe on an intellectual level they can, but these violent games are desensitizing them worse than anybody else. These people are at particular risk of going too far after being pushed. Violent video are a major contributor to real world violence. CONCLUSION I'll post my rebuttals next rebound and anxiously await my opponent's arguments.",

            "premise": "Thank you Wylted for your arguments. I'll go ahead and attack each of my opponent's claims.Trained to KillHere, my opponent basically explains the arguments that he will run during the debate. He brings up two points:1. Kids are desensitized by playing video games.2. This desensitization contributes to violence.By the end of this debate, I aim to prove both of these things untrue. Not Born to KillFor this point, my opponent explains that humans do not like killing. He gives an example of the kill rates before and after the beginning of training soldiers with killing simulations he claims that are similar to some of the video games played today. Here is why this argument doesn't hold up. Firstly, we have to realize that these killing simulations are not as similar to the popular video games children play as my opponent makes them out to be. Shooting targets while listening to \"kill kill kill\" over and over in one's head is more likely to result in acts of violence than popular video games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto. Gilsdorf explains, \"They offer a hunt/shoot/kill scenario as a way to solve problems (1).\" So we see that today's violent video games provide a scenario that involves thinking and problem solving rather than just repetitive killing. Another thing to look at is the various factors involved in this killing simulation besides violence. Ultimately, a system that rewards points will lead to some degree of competition. This is part of what may have caused the added motivation from the soldiers to kill. It may seem a bit extreme to suggest that competition leads to violence (or in the case of the military, murder). Psychology Today explains, \"Competition among men leads to a high level of violence (murder, assault, and battery) among them (2).\" Essentially, men are motivated to be more violent due to various sources of competition (such as women or sports). Killing simulations that promote competition can have the same effect. So, it may not necessarily be the violence in the simulations that made the kill rates go up; it could be the competitive factor.Desensitize MeMy opponent begins by explaining that video games desensitize individuals. However, from a psychological standpoint, this is not necessarily the case. A study was conducted by Reyerson University. Two large groups (active gamers and non-gamers) were shown various images with good, bad, and neutral connotations. Many of these images could be considered violent. It was hypothesized that the gamers would be less sensitive to the bad pictures, especially the violent ones. However, it turned out that both groups had similar reactions. Bowen notes at the end of the experiment, \"The findings indicate that long-term emotional memory is not affected by chronic exposure violent video games (3).\" My opponent's next point brings up various figures of authority who support the idea that video games significantly contribute to real world violence. This is a common logical fallacy known as appeal to authority. Just because someone important believes something, doesn't mean that the belief is correct. This point ultimately falls because no evidence is provided as to *why* these people support con's stance.Looking at my opponent's last point, we can see a study is cited that is rather similar to mine above. There are a couple problems with this study:1. The sample size is very small. 30 people (probably 15 gamers and 15 non gamers) is not enough to measure whether or not video games desensitize (or cause violence).2. This study involves a large amount of competition. This is what really makes this study invalid. The competition is what could really be promoting the regular gamers to push the button. When constantly being exposed to competition via video games, one is more likely to show aggression, as I have proven in my constructive. So, rather than the aggression being caused by video game violence / desensitization, it is caused by the regular competition provided by video games.Dr. BruceMy opponent addresses some claims made by Dr. Bruce Perry; I'll go ahead and cover each the claims that are relevant to this debate.1. Desensitization causes violence (desensitization comes from video games). I'll begin by cross applying my point that explains how video games do not result in desensitization. What I'm going to focus on is the claim that desensitization causes violence. Let's take a look at exactly what desensitization is. It can be defined as, \"the potential for reduced responsiveness to actual violence caused by exposure to violence in the media.\" So, desensitization (if indeed caused by video games) results in reduced responsiveness to actual violence, not violent crimes themselves. For this point to stand, my opponent must prove that (a) video games actually desensitize individuals and (b) desensitization significantly contributes to violence.2. Video games help kids become efficient killers.Now, I would agree to an extent that video games are a way of teaching kids how to handle various combat situations. However, this does not mean that such a game will give kids the desire to use an actual gun. I'd like to bring up my point about releasing aggression from my constructive: \"Logically, if violence in video games makes inmates less violent, they won't have an opposite affect when it comes to kids.\" If children are interested it weapons and violence, it is much better to allow them to play video games than to let them store up such aggressive feelings up to the point where they can gain access to a real weapon. My first source continues, \"If some of these men are hopelessly mentally ill, then we need to do all we can to prevent their access to real guns. But sane or depressed, many men feel powerless. Many feel angry. Many feel disengaged. They just want a stake in the action. Video games might be the best outlet they\u2019ve got (1).\"My opponent ends this point by explaining that video games are effective in teaching by showing an example of a man who saved lives using a technique he learned in a video game. The problem with this point is that it actually has nothing to do with video games teaching violent practices. The given video game in this example has promoted something useful, as opposed to violence. Fact or FictionThis last point does nothing to further my opponent's case. My opponent explains that a large amount of people cannot tell the difference between reality and fantasy saying that, \"These people are at particular risk of going too far after being pushed (by video games).\" I have proved through my rebuttal that video games don't actually give this extra push; rather, they can discourage it in some cases (through aggression release).To sum everything up...The violence in video games isn't what actually causes violence. What really causes violence is various factors such as delinquent peers, depression, abusive family, and (as I have stressed on in my rebuttal) competition. Video games can give already aggressive individuals a way to release their aggression. Surprisingly, video games don't actually cause desensitization; moreover, desensitization hasn't been proven to cause violence.For these reasons, I am pro.(1) http://cognoscenti.wbur.org...

            "premise": "I would think that you would understand by now that it is the voters who ultimately decide who wins the argument, not you. Anywho, my response: \"The title of this argument is \"Video game violence does not contribute significantly to school shootings.\" The kids who are predisposed susceptibility to the emotional deterioration ultimately are the ones who shoot up the schools, ergo video game violence in theory does significantly contribute to school shootings. Therein your evidences are invalidated and I win the argument.\" Con has not addressed my initial evidence, nor has the slightest hint of evidence to back up his claim. If violent video games were the cause for these school shootings, then tell me: what happened to all of the other factors that caused the earlier shootings? Our school systems today have undoubtably learned to combat them significantly, but not completely. Another thing that I must present is the likeliness of violent video games influencing students to commit these crimes. Video games, as well as the violent ones, are imbued into our society. They provide entertainment and satisfaction for millions of teens in the United States. Although it has been shown that they can cause aggression in certain cases, for the most part, they do not play a significant role. \"School shootings are not a simple issue with a single solution. This violence is rooted in psychological imbalances within the students themselves, poor parenting and a decay in significance of traditional institutions along with the guilt forces they rely on for effectiveness - to name a just a few.\"[1] With nearly all statistics on school shootings, these factors that contribute to the crimes appear in virtually every case. The part that video game violence plays is very insignificant indeed. Conclusion: Most, if not all school shootings are rooted in psychological imbalances within the students themselves, poor parenting and a decay in significance of traditional institutions along with the guilt forces they rely on for effectiveness[1], not violent video games. The real cause lies significantly more with the student and his/her social environment, rather than the entertainment activities(violent video games) he/she partakes in.

            "premise": "Violent video games do not cause individuals to take real violence lightly. Habitual video game players are not physiologically numb to real violence. You cited a paper arguing for this conclusion with serious methodological flaws and are attempting to use it to draw a conclusion it does not actually permit. Ones physiological responses to any stimuli diminish after prolonged exposure to a stimuli. If you play violent video games or watch snuff you will have a reduced response to it. The study in question establishes quite well that video games and videos of violence are processed in the same way. I'm sure you could use violent movies to find the same triggers. The huge flaw here is that such studies assumes humans cannot contextualize stimuli. Watching hardcore porn is a different experience than having sex. Similarly, watching violence, either computer graphics, movies, or snuff is completely different than \"real violence\". The study in question is finding that videos of violence and video games of violence are processed as similar ways. Duh. If one wishes to properly find a connection to show such stimuli it shouldn't be done purely in a cushy lab. Have one set of people play violent video games for an hour and then rush in, point a gun to their head, proceed to beat them with baseball bats, and rape them. Do the same to the control group without the violent video game and see if there is a difference. -- Implicitly even reading this you should be horrified in exactly the same way and realize that the video game is a moot point. Humans aren't stupid. We understand that it's a video game, that movie monsters can't hurt us, and that videos are images of things not happening now and not threatening us. This line of psychological work is seriously flawed. The video game industry is massive in Japan. Seriously, that's where we get our video games. They have an astoundingly minute amount of violence. Many soldiers in Iraq and other places have grown up playing violent video games. Seeing real violence first hand they are returning with post traumatic stress disorder in droves. Nobody ever gets post traumatic stress disorder from a video game or videos of violence. Video violence, violent movies, and video games are terrible analogs for the real violence.",

            "premise": "Thank you debatability for challenging me to this topic. It's been a pleasure. INTRODUCTION I think pro has came at this debate the wrong way. Since the start of round 3 she has been on the defensive, which is really bad. The reason being is because, depending on the judge's voting style she'll typically either have the full burden of proof or at least share it with me. She has spent most of this debate attacking my arguments while barely defending her own and at the end of the day when the dust clears. My arguments still stand and hers have completely fallen. AFFIRMING THE DISJUNCT My opponent claims she hasn't committed this particular logical fallacy, and she is absolutely wrong. She has on multiple occasions stated that video game doesn't significantly contribute to real world violence because poverty does or because videogames cause aggression not violence. What she doesn't realize is that every statement she made could be true and it wouldn't show that violence in videogames doesn't contribute to real world violence. Remember pro has a certain amount of burden to show that videogames in fact do not contribute to real world violence. She hasn't met it. Revisit her arguments. They all make use of the logical fallacy I've mentioned. some arguments from pro; In round 2 pro asks \"What really causes violence in teens?\". She answers this by saying serious crimes and aggression does. The truth is this doesn't rule out violence in videogames being a significant factor. This is her first real argument and is entirely affirming the adjunct. The 2nd argument in round 2 discusses a chart which she admits after posting it means absolutely nothing. her 3rd and final argument discusses \" Video game's effect\". summed up she says that people play video games to release aggression and also that people who love violence may be attracted to them. This is yet another case of Affirming the Adjunct. Just because violent people are attracted to them (which she hasn't proven) and they help release aggression doesn't mean that they don't significantly contribute to real world violence. These are her opening arguments. This is the foundation for her entire case. Her case is a chart she admits doesn't mean anything and 2 arguments affirming the adjunct. She has some BOP in this debate and she has came nowhere near meeting it. NOT BORN TO KILL My opponent misses the point with the government training. I'll take this point by point. PRO-\"The first thing to look at here is the difference between video games and these \"killing sessions.\" My opponent essentially drops this argument.\" I never dropped this argument at all. I attacked it head on. Go ahead to the last round and reread what I said. The differences made in training to up kill rates was a replacement of circle targets with human looking ones. Not only in the shooting range, but also the ones that pop up in simulations. Also video games that soldiers participate in to simulate killing. This is science at it's best, in practice. A bunch of people noticed a problem. The problem was a huge amount of soldiers not killing in battle or police officers not taking out a suspect who is an imminent threat. After seeing the problem, they came up with a hypothesis that if true could help. hypothesis- Simulating killing humans will desensitize people and make them more likely to kill. test- This hypothesis was tested out by replacing shooting range targets with human shaped targets and the popup targets in simulations with human looking pop up targets. Also some videogames were added in. repeat- This test was repeated with several government organizations and proved successful. That is the scientific method and the scientific method is common knowledge so I won't cite it. The scientific method has proven that simulating violence causes people to be more likely to act on violence. Videogames simulate violence. Those simulated experiences desensitize people to violence and makes it more likely that they'll commit acts of violence. \" The reason firing rates went up is because of the implementation of a method known as \"point shooting.\" This is a new argument and should be completely disregarded, but I will briefly touch on it. My studies have shown that people in the civil war weren't even firing their weapons but only pretending. I can buy that point shooting will increase accuracy in close combat situations, but it isn't increasing the percentage of people pulling the trigger. DESENSITIZE ME \"My opponent points out some flaws in my desensitization study.\" Yes, and I urge voters took look at the prior round to see those flaws. None of them have been addressed. \"1. My opponent's study has multiple variables since it involves the actual playing of a video game. Essentially, the competition factor is very present in this study. There is no way of knowing whether the violence, the desensitization, or the competition caused the willingness to push the button.\" It wasn't the competition that caused it. There was a close to an even number on each side. Half being avid violent video game players. Half not being. They all participated in the competition, so it's not a factor. The violent gamers were more willing to dish out physical pain to their opponent. They all participated in the game. If competition was the only factor than significant differences should not have been noticed in their willingness to dish out pain. The study proved that people who play violent videogames have less qualms about hurting you. That part is indisputable and has been shown in several similar studies. \"We can't look to a study with multiple variables that shows, at best, a correlation rather than a causation. My study further weakens this point by disproving the correlation between desensitization and violence in video games.\" I've shown the flaws in your study, and they were ignored. I welcome the voters to take another look at the previous round. The study alone may be brushed away as correlation, but when taken with all the other evidence It serves as some damning evidence in my favor. DR BRUCE What I've tried to get across to the voters as well as my opponent, is that Violent video games contribute significantly to an overall culture of violence. In the famous Kitty Genovese event what is known as the bystander effect took place. Though the concept known as diffusion of responsibility certainly played a factor it wasn't the only factor. As Dr. Bruce mentions in the article I cited. Growing up in rough urban environments can cause desensitization, just like videogames. A lot of people just didn't give a damnn if that girl was being murdered outside their windows. CONCLUSION My opponent hasn't really upheld her BOP in this debate. She is attacking my arguments but not doing enough to defend her own. I should win this debate, because I've proved that violent videogames have increased state violence. I should win, because I've shown it increases not only the likelihood somebody will engage in violence, but also that it contributes to a culture of violence. My opponent has largely ignored my arguments concerning the overall culture of violence and psychopathy. For all the reasons mentioned. Please vote con.",

            "premise": "My opening I like your reasos but to make your argument more convincing you should have had girls and boys together so here's my argument . 97% of 12-17 year olds in the US played video games in 2008, thus fueling an $11.7 billion domestic video game industry. In 2008, 10 of the top 20 best-selling video games in the US contained violence. Violent video games have been blamed for school shootings, increases in bullying, and violence towards women. Critics argue that these games desensitize players to violence, reward players for simulating violence, and teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. Video game advocates contend that a majority of the research on the topic is deeply flawed and that no causal relationship has been found between video games and social violence. They argue that violent video games may reduce violence by serving as a substitute for rough and tumble play and by providing a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings. The debate over violent video games can be traced back to the 1976 release of the game Death Race. [40] The object of the game was to run over screaming \"gremlins\" with a car, at which point they would turn into tombstones. Controversy erupted because the \"gremlins\" resembled stick-figure humans, and it was reported that the working title of the game was Pedestrian. After protestors dragged Death Race machines out of arcades and burned them in parking lots, production of the game ceased. In 1993, public outcry following the release of violent video games Mortal Kombat and Night Trap prompted Congress to hold hearings on regulating the sale of video games. During the hearings, California Attorney General Dan Lungren testified that violent video games have \"a desensitizing impact on young, impressionable minds.\" [14] Threatened with the creation of a federal regulatory commission, the video game industry voluntarily established the Entertainment Software Rating Board on Sep. 1, 1994 to create a ratings system. Based on the video game's content, the ESRB assigns one of the following ratings: \"Early Childhood,\" \"Everyone,\" \"Everyone 10+,\" \"Teen,\" \"Mature,\" or \"Adults Only.\" In a Pew Research Center 2008 survey, 50% of boys and 14% of girls aged 12-17 listed a game with a \"Mature\" or \"Adults Only\" rating in their current top three favorite games. The controversy over violent video games resurfaced following the massacre of 13 people at Columbine High School in Jefferson County, CO on Apr. 20, 1999. The two teenage shooters were revealed to be avid players of weapon-based combat games Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Following the shooting, 176 newspaper articles across thecountry focused on the allegation that video games were the cause of the tragedy . A 2005 resolution by the American Psychological Association called for the reduction of violence in video games marketed to youth because of possible links between video games and aggression towards women. [30] In response to the discovery of disabled but accessible sexual content in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, then-Senator of New York Hillary Clinton introduced a bill in 2005 to criminalize selling \"Mature\" or \"Adults Only\" rated video games to minors, arguing that video games were a \"silent epidemic of desensitization.\" The bill died in committee at the end of the 109th Congress.",

Nicholas Carnagey, an Iowa State psychology instructor and research assistant, and ISU Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Anderson collaborated on the study of \"The Effects of Video Game Violence on Physiological Desensitization to Real-Life Violence\" with Brad Bushman, a former Iowa State psychology professor now at the University of Michigan, and Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. 257 college students, 124 men and 133 women, were tested individually. After measuring their heart rate and galvanic skin response and asking questions about their video game preferences and general aggression levels, a participant were exposed to of eight randomly designated violent or nonviolent games for 20 minutes. The four possible violent games were Carmageddon, Duke Nukem, Mortal Kombat or Future Cop; the non-violent games were Glider Pro, 3D Pinball, 3D Munch Man and Tetra Madness. After the 20 minute duration, the test subjects were subjected to the same tests. Participants were then asked to watch actual violent episodes constructed from TV episodes and commercially-released films in the contexts of courtroom outbursts, police confrontations, shootings and prisons fights. Physiological differences were observed throughout the entire viewing. When viewing the actual images of violence, participants that played the violent video games had a significantly less skin response than those that had played nonviolent video games. In addition, the participants that had played the violent video games had a lower heart rate than those that played noviolent video games. The people that participated in the experiment had no discrepancy in heart rate or skin response before the beginning of the study or immediately after playing the assigned games The results demonstrate that only 20 minutes of exposure can cause people to be less aroused by violence.

Here is an article for you to read http://liti4.wordpress.com... - in the article this 17 year old claims that he thought if he shot his parents they would respawn. Now if this guy is telling the truth, then that proves beyond doubt that the violent video game (Halo 3 in this case) was the cause of the violence, and even if he was lying, the reason that he shot his parents was because they WOULD NOT let him play Halo 3, so he killed them. This shows an addiction to the violent video game that allows for extraneous violence to occur, therefore proving that the violent video game caused violence, thus proving that violent video games CAN lead to violence. That is to say, violent video games do not ALWAYS cause violence, but CAN in some cases. Now, your argument used the term 'psyche', which is defined as the human soul. You claimed that violence is not caused by playing a violent video game, but by the person's soul. Therefore, burden of proof is on you to prove that humans have souls. If you cannot prove that humans have souls, then, as you have not given any other reason that violence may occur, you are accepting that kids who have played violent video games and then become violent are violent due to those violent video games. I look forward to your argument.",

We are talking about mental strain, as that is the argument you are using here.). 2: If playing violent video games increases violent behavior in children, as your argument stated, then why is that South Korea, a country that plays over two times more video games than the United States has ZERO shootings out of a sample of 100,000?

            "premise": "Violent juvenile crime in the United States has been declining as violent video game popularity has increased. The arrest rate for juvenile murders has fallen 71.9% between 1995 and 2008. The arrest rate for all juvenile violent crimes has declined 49.3%. In this same period, video game sales have more than quadrupled. [7] [8] A causal link between violent video games and violent behavior has not been proven. [34] Many studies suffer from design flaws and use unreliable measures of violence and aggression such as noise blast tests. Thoughts about aggression have been confused with aggressive behavior, and there is a lack of studies that follow children over long periods of time. A 2004 US Secret Service review of previous school-based attacks found that one-eighth of attackers exhibited an interest in violent video games, less than the rate of interest attackers showed in violent movies, books, and violence in their own writings. The report did not find a relationship between playing violent video games and school shootings. [35] The small correlations that have been found between video games and violence may be explained by violent youth being drawn to violent video games. Violent games do not cause youth to be violent. Instead, youth that are predisposed to be violent seek out violent entertainment such as video games. Playing violent video games reduces violence in adolescent boys by serving as a substitute for rough and tumble play. [36] Playing violent video games allows adolescent boys to express aggression and establish status in the peer group without causing physical harm. http://videogames.procon.org...",

So with that said, I'm going to be posting my arguments for the first round. Here we go; -The Supreme court itself even said that video games do not cause violence. I just wanted to point this out. I would also like to add that the supreme court definitely wouldn't make a claim without actual concrete proof. Because they ARE the supreme court after all. -US news article states that video games do not cause violent. http://www.usnews.com... I'm just going to let you read that by yourself. -From my own personal experience playing all of the violent and bloody video games, I can safely say that they haven't influenced any kind of dramatic or over the top behavior that has influenced me to do violent things. I would also like to add that I am in fact a minor as well. Not going to go into any more specific details. - If video games actually DID cause violence, then wouldn't we be seeing more crime on the news? Think about it. Wouldn't there be more shootings, fights, and robberies? Of course not. Though occasionally, there maybe some person who DOES decide to commit murder because of video games. But it happens RARELY. Very rarely. -If video games did cause violence, then wouldn't movies, television, and comics cause violence as well? There is definitely plenty of violence going on in all 3 of them. Though ironically, the people who accuse video games of causing violence, usually don't think that either of those 3 things mentioned cause violence either. And I do understand the violence is being accused mostly for the kids. But haven't you ever seen a little boy or girl coming into the movies watching something like the avengers, or something like James Bond? - There are a HUGE variety of video games out there in the world. And not all of them are violent. Heck. some of them are the exact opposite of violent. So when your saying that video games cause violence. then maybe you should specify which type of video game genre it is. Because just saying that video games as a whole cause violence is wrong, because not all video games are even violent. But I know what you're thinking con, so in the next argument. I'm going to be going over why the violent video games don't cause violence. -Violent video games actually RELIVE yourself from stress. http://www.makeuseof.com... -I myself would like to ask the con an honest question about video games, have you yourself ever played a violent game like call of duty or halo? And have you ever felt any signs of aggression after you did? I just wanted to ask that. Well, those are my arguments for this round, and as always, I wish my opponent, good luck.",

            "conclusion": "Are Video Games the main cause for Violent Juvenile Crimes",
            "premise": "Increasing reports of bullying can be partially attributed to the popularity of violent video games. The 2008 study Grand Theft Childhood reported that 60% of middle school boys who played at least one Mature-rated game hit or beat up someone, compared to 39% of boys that did not play Mature-rated games. [2] Video games often reward players for simulating violence, and thus enhance the learning of violent behaviors. Studies suggest that when violence is rewarded in video games, players exhibit increased aggressive behavior compared to players of video games where violence is punished. [23] Violent video games desensitize players to real-life violence. It is common for victims in video games to disappear off screen when they are killed or for players to have multiple lives. In a 2005 study, violent video game exposure has been linked to reduced P300 amplitudes in the brain, which is associated with desensitization to violence and increases in aggressive behavior. [24] A 2000 FBI report includes playing violent video games in a list of behaviors associated with school shootings. [25] Violent video games teach youth that violence is an acceptable conflict-solving strategy and an appropriate way to achieve one's goals. [26] A 2009 study found that youth who play violent video games have lower belief in the use of nonviolent strategies and are less forgiving than players of nonviolent video games. Violent video games cause players to associate pleasure and happiness with the ability to cause pain in others. [3] Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence, and without a framework for ethical decision making, they may mimic the actions they see in violent video games. [4] Violent video games require active participation, repetition, and identification with the violent character. With new game controllers allowing more physical interaction, the immersive and interactive characteristics of video games can increase the likelihood of youth violence. [5] Playing violent video games increases aggressive behavior and arousal. [27] A 2009 study found that it takes up to four minutes for the level of aggressive thoughts and feelings in children to return to normal after playing violent video games. It takes five to ten minutes for heart rate and aggressive behavior to return to baseline. Video games that show the most blood generate more aggressive thoughts. When blood is present in video games, there is a measurable increase in arousal and hostility. [28] Playing violent video games causes the development of aggressive behavioral scripts [29]. A behavioral script is developed from the repetition of actions and affects the subconscious mind. An example of a common behavioral script is a driving script that tells drivers to get in a vehicle, put on a seat belt, and turn on the ignition. Similarly, violent video games can lead to scripts that tell youth to respond aggressively in certain situations. Violence in video games may lead to real world violence when scripts are automatically triggered in daily life, such as being nudged in a school hallway. A 1998 study found that 21% of games sampled involved violence against women [23]. Exposure to sexual violence in video games is linked to increases in violence towards women and false attitudes about rape such as that women incite men to rape or that women secretly desire rape. [30] Several studies in both the United States and Japan have shown that, controlling for prior aggression, children who played more violent video games during the beginning of the school year showed more aggression than their peers later in the school year. [31] Exposure to violent video games is linked to lower empathy in players. In a 2004 study of 150 fourth and fifth graders by Professor Jeanne Funk, violent video games were the only type of media associated with lower empathy. Empathy, the ability to understand and enter into another's feelings, plays an important role in the process of moral evaluation and is believed to inhibit aggressive behavior. [32] When youth view violence in video games, they are more likely to fear becoming a victim of acts of violence. According to a 2000 joint statement by six leading national medical associations including the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, this escalated fear results in youth not trusting others and taking violent self-protective measures. [33] Violent video games can train youth to be killers. The US Marine Corps licensed Doom II in 1996 to create Marine Doom in order to train soldiers. In 2002, the US Army released first-person shooter America's Army to recruit soldiers and prepare recruits for the battlefield.",

            "premise": "1. School shootings. While there has never been any links from violent video games to school shootings there are some patterns that cannot be ignored. Before 1975 there were 139 recorded school shootings the first of which was in 1764 (the second was in 1853). I picked this year because it was the official release of \"Death Race\". Some background before I continue. \"Death Race\" is considered the arcade game that sparked the first controversy over video game violence. The game consisted of up to two players controlling cars with the objective being to run over \"gremlins\" (who resembled humans very closely) in order to earn points. The public response was outrage. NBC as well as CBS's 60 minutes reported on the violent effect it could have on teens as well as The National Enquirer and Midnight magazines. There are even reports of angry mobs dragging the arcade game out of stores and lighting them on fire. Since 1975 there have been 199 reported school shootings. Keep in mind that both of these figures count both accidents and single suicides (i did not have the time to sort those all out). This seems to be ample proof that there has been a significant growth in school shootings. While there is no proof that connects school shootings to violent video games it cannot be ruled out. 2. Level of violence. I completely accept your provided definition of the word itself from Webster however the context you later employ I do not. You ask why there has not been an increase in the number of armed robberies. I argue that video games do and have caused a rise in violence in the real world but not quite to that extent. I highly doubt that any grand theft auto video game has caused any significant rise in actual car thefts but that doesn't mean that these types of games hasn't contributed to increases of violence at a much lesser level. I have seen first hand the anger and frustration that is created by an extremely difficult level on some video game and have also seen that taken out in physical violence. 3. The ESRB The ESRB was created in 1994 in order to regulate the age at which children were allowed to play certain types of games. I'm not talking about any type of pornography or language but the violence section. Why would a federally funded and controlled program worry about the AGE of which certain children can play violent games? Because they fear that the children could be affected by the violence and are not yet ready for the games. That is the conclusion of my first rebuttal. I also can't wait to see yours. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://controversy.wikia.com...",

            "conclusion": "Video Games are a primary source of violence",
            "premise": "Before I state my arguments on the matter, I would like to say I am aware that the reoccurring of this topic is getting annoying and it's repetitive. However, I've never talked about this controversial topic before, and I want to try debating on it. Schedule Round 1: Acceptance and Arguments Round 2: More Arguments and/or Rebuttals Round 3: Rebuttals Round 4: More Rebuttals Round 5: Conclusions and Goodbyes Thesis Statements Even though video games does cause violent acts sometimes, that doesn't really mean it's a primary source of violence. Don't just stereotype the gaming industry just because, sometimes, people use video games to do violent things. That assumption is ambiguous, it's full of fallacy, and I'll prove that it's fallacious. Arguments 1. There is no statistical evidence supporting claim. According to the information on Harvard Medical School's website, the research that is conducted to support the \"video games cause violence\" claim \"relies on measures to assess aggression that don't correlate with real-world violence. Some studies are observational and don't prove cause and effect. Federal crime statistics suggest that serious violent crimes among youths have decreased since 1996, even as video game sales have soared.\" (http://www.fbi.gov...) (http://www.washingtonpost.com...) (http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org...) (http://www.washingtonpost.com...) Researchers have made assumptions that the reason behind this decline of crime rates is because of video games because violent video games has been used as a substitute to express anger and other strong emotions to a virtual world instead to reality. Chris Ferguson, chair of psychology and communication at Texas A&M International, has conducted several studies on video game violence and its affect on youth. He actively believes that video games DO NOT cause real-world violence. Quoting, \"Video games is just not a common factor among mass homicide perpetrators. Some have been players, other have not been.\" 2. The killer who was involved in games either had some sort of mental illness and/or had poor parents. (Mostly, it's the parents fault). In almost every single shooting where violent video games were blamed, the individual involved was mentally unstable, ill, . But of course it's way more appealing for the media to blame violent video games and pay no attention to the fact that most of these tragedies are linked to mental instability and/or poor parenting. The blame on the matter at hand should be directed to the parents because there are ESBR ratings on the front cover of every single game you purchase. GameStop warns the parent and the child that there is mature rated content and asks if the parent consents on allowing the child to play the game. Therefore, it is the parent's responsibility to facilitate on what the child is playing. According to HuffingtonPost, studies have showed that the majority of parents don't care if their kids play violent video games. Quoting \"The majority of parents don\"t check age restrictions on video games and don't think violent games affect their kids, according to a new poll. The study, conducted by gaming price comparison and swap site www.Playr2.com. 1,221 parents of children aged 17 who frequently played video games were surveyed. The parents were surveyed, and were asked if they checked the age restrictions of their children\"s video games before allowing them to play. Just under two thirds (64%) answered no. The majority of these parents, 55%, agreed that they did not think that age restrictions mattered on video games. Similarly, they were not concerned that their under-18s could be playing grown-up games. Asked \"Would you be concerned if your child was playing video games with an age restriction of 18?\", 51% said no.\" \"Richard Wilson, CEO of TIGA, the trade association representing the UK games industry, told The Huffington Post: 'Age ratings exist to provide parents and consumers generally with information about games and the suitability of games for children. Just as parents should not buy 18 rated films for minors, so they should not buy 18 rated games for children. Parents must take responsibility.'\" I'm not stating that just because someone is mentally unstable will most likely become extremely violent. But, studies have shown that mass murders have occurred because of mental illness. Aaron Alexis, the murderer of 12 people in the Washington Navy Yard, was mentally unstable. The lawyers of James Holmes, shooter of the Denver theater at the premiere of the Dark Knight Rises film, had repeatedly stated that he is \"mentally ill.\" 3. The very vast majority of gamers are not violent. Just because video games only affect that small percentage of players, doesn't mean that video games cause violence entirely. You can say the exact same thing for films. Most of movie watchers are not violent themselves even though they watch violence all the time. I really don't need to go full into detail on this point as it's self-explanatory in itself.

            "premise": "Thanks Con for this good topic. The following argument will have: Why Video Games, are Influencing, and Causing Violence amognst kids. Some Rebuttals on what Con had stated. Violent video games are causing children to have the mindset that, it ok to deal with your problem(s), in a anti-social way. The 2008 study Grand Theft Childhood reported that 60% of middle school boys that played at least one Mature-rated game hit or beat up someone, compared to 39% of boys that did not play Mature-rated games. http://videogames.procon.org... Con has stated examples of Violence in Children. \"Many people after the Sandy Hook Shooting blamed violent video games on the shooters behavior because he tended to play them a lot.\" \"I myself play a lot of violent video games, assassins creed, black ops, GTA, and others yet feel no compulsion to go and shoot out a super market or stab random people on the street. If a child plays a lot of call of duty, it does not mean that he is going to try and kill someone at school. \" However these occurances are rare as it is. We dont see another replica of the Sandy Hook incident everyday. We dont see kids going out and shooting other people. BUT, the perpitrator, during the Sandy Hook shooting, was mentally ill! So this impared his ability to judge how realistic these games he was player were! So this brings the question -- Could he have thought he could did this no problem? I think YES. Cons argument basically says that Video Games arent causing EXTREME violnece suvch as shootings, and murders. But there are other types of small violence that are coming from video games that just arent making world headlines. Bullying is a type of Violence that is extermely commom amongst kids these days and these game can turn kids INTO bullys. Games are making kids change thier thoughts, on how to deal with small everyday problems. To hit or punch a kid because he mad you mad THATS VIOLENCE. This can be influenced because lets say this kid was playing Battlefield thother day and when he got mad at other player online, he KILLS them. So thought before he hits someone is \"I can kill people in Battlefield or Call of Duty! I can hit this kid\" Its a small form of violence, but it is still violence. Many children playing games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, and especially GTA, are UNDER THE AGE OF 12. So many of these children are not realizing that in Real Life, you can not just punch someone and run away. You have to answer for what you did. In these games you would never see that. People kill other people, and think like its no big deal. Yes, this will not translate into someone going to shootout a scholl, BUT IT WILL TRASNLATE INTO KIDS COMMITING SAMLL FORMS OF VIOLENCE AMONGST THEMSELVES. Con states: \"Therefor, if a child does cause harm, the parents are the ones to be to blame as they bought the game for their child and are responsible for the outcomes of what happens to their child.\" Not true. If a parents buys a violent game for a child, this child will be influenced by THAT GAME. Unless the parents are teaching them that its ok to enflict harm on other people. (Which we all know that hardley ever happens) This game is what made/contributed to making that kid commit violence. Not the parents buying the game.",

            "premise": "Can Video Games Kill?The definition of violence is behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something. For example, in Grand Theft Auto V, the three main characters are all thieves, or something along the lines of that work. In the game, they go around robbing people of cars, money, and other possible objects. It does have a wide range of weapons to use in case they get into trouble. Do video games cause this violence? No, not always. Violent video games will not always make gamers aggressive or violent. People say that because they play something like GTAV, they will become human-murdering monsters, or a thief. Violent video games do not directly make people violent as the... \u201c... arrest rate for juvenile murders had fallen 71.9% between 1995 and 2008. The arrest rate for all juvenile violent crimes have declined 49.3%. In the same period video game sales have more than quadrupled\u201d (Crime in the United States). The teenage arrest rate has significantly gone down while video game sales have risen. Therefore, the violence in video games has not affected the teenagers\u2019 feelings and/or violence. Though people have tested their theories and got results that would make it seem the opposite than the facts, \u201cmany studies suffer from design flaws and use unreliable measures of violence and aggression\u201d (Internet Fantasy Violence). Therefore, most of those studies are not reliable. Difficult levels and practice (or lack of) make players aggressive, like in this study, \u201cLack of practice, awkward controls and games that were unnecessarily difficult all caused frustration\u201d (Violent Video Games\u2026). So the violence does not cause the player to 'rage quit' or scream at the television, their experience and lack of skill, will. Games can make the player aggressive, just not in the way it seems. One study \u201cenhanced\u201d the game Tetris making it able to know what piece is needed, and not giving it 78% of the time. After playing the subjects had their anger tested. Those who used the super hard version had a lot more anger than those who played the regular version (Violent Video Games). So even Tetris can make the average player angry, probably one of the least violent games in video game history.Violent video games are also safe outlets for players to let out anger. Here it states\u201c...that 45% of boys played video games because, \u2018it helps me get my anger out\u2019 and 62% played because it, \u2018helps me to relax\u2019\u201d (Journal of Adolescence Health). Here it states that many kids/teens use video games to rid them of stress, so they don\u2019t act out on others. \u201cVideo game players understand they are playing a game... [this] prevents them from emulating video game violence in real life\u201d (An Exploration of Adolescents\u2026) This tells that people and hard-core gamers know that it is just a game. They know not to terrorize people, or hurt others. They need video games to relieve themselves of stress. Now people might say, \u2018What if they do not know the difference?\u2019 People (mainly parents) need to trust others (or in some cases) their own children, because more likely than not. They understand it is just a game.Remember there is not a strong connection between aggression and violent video games. Also, violent video games do not directly make people violent, difficult levels and practice (or the lack of) make players aggressive. Violent video games are also safe outlets for kids to learn about world issues and a safe outlets for relieving stress. \u201c...if we\u2019re worried about the effects on kids of video games... we should not be encouraging them to play less.

            "premise": "Humans are fantastic at contextualizing things. We can experience roughly the same thing and treat the experiences completely differently based on a great understanding of the bigger picture. This holds true for violence in video games being different from violence in real life. To desensitize is a permanent effect to make them less able to react to a given situation. It actually occurs in real life. When people are the victims of real violence on a regular basis they actually do become desensitized from it. They employ an array of coping mechanisms as well as departmentalizing the violence. None of this occurs for video games because they are video games. They are placed in their proper context and do not illicit the same responses. >>Now, alluding to my first arguments, after playing the violent video games, the subjects had less of a response to the violent episodes. Therefore, they were desensitized. They were desensitized to violent videos and violent video games, not to \"real violence\". The same way we contextual video game violence we contextualize video violence. Your cited paper in round one established exactly this. >>It has been proven that people adapt after increased exposure to stimuli and become desensitized to it, so no matter what you can't argue that violent video games do no desensitize individuals to violence at all. Violent video games aren't violence. People understand this. It isn't real. Real violence desensitizes people to real violence as there are actual correlations between those who were victims and those who victimize others. Video games desensitize people to video games. However there's no good evidence that the latter has an effect on the former as well. Pixels aren't people and people understand this. >>The evidence supporting both your and my side is lacking, so there is no ways to say with a high degree of certitude that they do or do not have long term desensitization effects, however that is not what the proposition states. You are attempting to shift the burden of proof. I am not necessarily required to prove that violent video games don't desensitize people. However, I have repeatedly offered examples of cultures with significantly more violent video games and significantly less violent crime (Japan) to establish that the correlation fails at the most basic level and thus the topic is not only unproved but wrong. If you suggest that playing violent video games caused cancer it would suffice to show that there's no evidence for that to oppose your suggestion that it does. Voters should be swayed via arguments and to suggest that neither side proved it and therefore they should pick a winner at random is amusingly amusing. ----- >>I hope I didn't waste your time. I'm probably going to lose, but we'll see what the voters decide. X) You certainly didn't waste my time. I'm more than happy to debate you. You're probably going to win. In fact, voters would be crazy to vote for me. I've just finished playing a few hours of Counter Strike: Source so now I'm going to go murdering some people... starting with anybody who votes for me!

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate.As to the Columbine massacre (the news article that you are talking about), it has never been proven that Eric Harris' and Dylan Klebold's playing of violent video games had influenced their actions. The most likely cause of the massacre was bullying and mental illness (as the FBI had found). Many implications have been made pointing to video games being the cause but the majority of these are either proven untrue or not confirmed. [1]To the 8 year old killing his grandmother, the link between playing violent video games and the murder is unproven. This was just the police racing to find a cause of the attack and finding out that the kid played a violent video game. This unfortunately happens a lot with violent crimes, people will race to find a cause and end up finding the wrong one. [2]A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found absolutely no evidence between video games and violence in vulnerable teens. In fact, in some cases the violent video games had a calming effect on the player. [3]My arguments:Many studies have shown that violent video games do not desensitize kids and those most liable to have their minds altered. The studies would show kids who play non-violent and violent games different pictures, some showing graphic scenes (like a man holding a gun to a woman's head). The subjects would have their reactions to the photos monitored and recorded. They found that there was no difference between the violent game players' and non-violent game players' reactions. Many kids recognize and respect the boundaries between the virtual and real world, and would not cross them when it comes to violence.

Violent video games also caused many people who played it to go on shooting or stabbing rampage. but that's another argument. Studies say that most people that play violent video games have grown more trigger happy with their fists, because they have been doing that in violent video games, so your argument is going against the flow of the river because 90 percent of people say the same thing as me,\"They do cause violence.\"",

But the most this can do is desensitize you to the prevalence of these things in the real world. If someone knows something is wrong, a video game won't change that. That is, of course, unless that certain someone has a severe mental disorder.I find it interesting that you mentioned the Columbine High School shooting. I looked deeper into the incident's Wikipedia page to find a section called \"psychopathy and depression\". I think it's very important to mention that Harris was a clinical psychopath and Klebold was depressive and often wrote about suicide in his diary, which supports my claim that violent video games only truly affect those with severe mental illnesses.I found an article that shows a long term study that examined violent media, and whether or not video games and movies are to blame for violence in society. This excerpt here shows the bit about when they studied video games: \"A second study into video game violence used data from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to estimate the violent content of popular games from 1996 to 2011. This was then compared with data on youth violence during the same years, with the study finding a correlation between falling youth violence and the popularity of violent games.\" But you also mentioned raging, and I'll be honest, I get angry at video games. But I've never broken a controller or harmed myself beyond hitting my desk with my fist. It's never been anything serious. It's not a thing that only applies to violent video games either, I could be playing a Mario game and I'll get mad.Sources:http://www.independent.co.uk...https://en.wikipedia.org...I'm also a beginning debater, welcome to the site. Good luck, and thanks for setting this up!",

            "premise": "Hello again. Your argument thus far is simple: Violent crimes have gone down while video game sales have gone up, showing an apparent inverse correlation of these two statistics. My counterargument, too, is simple: The apparent inverse correlation of these two statistics mask the causation that is actually there is some cases. Your statistics, at best, show that the spread of video games has not increased the number of violent crimes. This is a fair point (though I would point out that there were MANY other factors at play in contributing to the violent crime rate's decline) but my case does not contend that the spread of video games increase the number of violent crimes, but that they do indeed influence the lives of players and that they can and do at least partially cause violence. I will focus on HOW video games cause violence as well as reference incidents of publicized, mass shootings in which video games clearly played a role. First of all, video games are addictive. A study and discussion by the American Medical Association discussed the fact that video game addiction (VGA) was a real and prominent issue in the health of many Americans. Psychotherapist Shavaun Scott said that those who suffered from VGA created a separate world from reality, extremely similar to that of drug users. He elaborated that if there were conflicts in this world or if the addict became without his game, they could suffer from withdrawal or depression. These users become distant from their families and from the real world, which can lead to other mental health issues.As stated by the U.S.'s Department of Human Services, \"Psychopathology, substance abuse, poverty, cultural factors, anger, stress, and depression often are thought to cause domestic violence. While there is little empirical evidence that these factors are direct causes of domestic violence, research suggests that they can affect its severity, frequency, and the nature of the perpetrator's abusive behavior.\" So, to summarize my first case, my argument is that \"Video games > Video game addiction > stress, depression, and mental health issues > domestic violence.\". Still, this is just one way that video games are detrimental to relationships and cause violence. This increase in severity and frequency of domestic violence is not show in your original argument's statistics, as the number of violent crimes would not increase just because their severity and frequency increased within isolated incidents. http://serendip.brynmawr.edu...https://www.childwelfare.gov...On the subject of violent video games, I will argue that violence in games normalizes violence in real life and teaches children, teenagers, and adults the basics of shooting. For example, the U.S. Military has used and even helped develop games that simulate warfare in order to acclimate soldiers to violence and help them become more ready to pull the trigger. Soldiers interviewed by the Washington Post say that the games help them feel more normal while fighting, and that to them, shooting and killing even felt like a game after all of their years of playing. My argument here is that teaching people to be killers, as the games have obviously done, as attested to by U.S. Army soldiers, will make violent crimes with weapons more severe. The people that do play these games and then become violent will have virtual practice with weapons, and thus they will be more effective and in turn do more damage. This may not be the direct cause of violence, but it could indeed be a secondary cause. What if someone was contemplating violence, but they were unsure that they would be able to effectively harm anyone, thus making their attempt at violence useless? With video games, they are allowed to practice violence BEFORE they attack anyone, thus building their confidence that violence will be successful and convincing them to try it. http://www.washingtonpost.com...Lastly, I will provide specific examples of cases in which video games were at least a contributing cause of violence: Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, was an addict of both violent and nonviolent games. Data taken by a GPS device his mother had given him showed him playing Dance Dance Revolution for long periods of time on weekends. He played between 4 and 10 hours a day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Other video games, including the notorious Call of Duty games, Grand Theft Auto, Halo, and Splinter Cell games have all been found at his home. Many news outlets have speculated that video games could have created a rift between himself and the real world, and maybe even outright trained him to believe that killing was normal. In Vietnam, a 13 year old boy murdered and robbed an 81 year old woman. He said that he needed the money to fuel his addiction to online games. Back in the States, A Jacksonvillian woman pleaded guilty to shaking her baby to death, a second degree murder charge. She told investigators that it was because the baby would not stop crying, interrupting her addiction to Farmville, the game she was playing at the time. An Ohio teen, Daniel Petric, shot and killed his mother and shot and wounded his father because they took away his copy of Halo 3, thus interrupting his video game addiction. The judge said that he \"firmly [believed] that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever.\" It is a common element in violent video games for characters to \"respawn\" after dying. Another Vietnamese teenager murdered a 7 year old girl by bashing her head in with a rock. Police say he planned to kill the girl while they were picking fruit, stealing her gold ear rings to pay for computer games. There are at least 10 deaths that have occured because infants and small children have been left unattended for extended periods of time in heat or without food/water while the parent played addictive video games like World of Warcraft. It is not my argument that these deaths have been violent deaths, and thusly they are not direct examples of video games causing violence. Rather, they are examples of how extreme video game addiction can become, which could easily lead to violence. http://kotaku.com...http://www.news.com.au...http://jacksonville.com...http://news.softpedia.com...http://www.cbsnews.com...In summary, it is my argument that video games are addictive and destructive. I have presented examples of how this addiction can become destructive, of how it can lead to stress, anger, and domestic violence, of how it leads to irrational violence by those who are desperate to continue their addiction. I have presented an example of how it allows soldiers to normalize and prepare for violent war, and provided a hypothetical of how this could affect civilian people. Video games are AT LEAST a secondary cause of violence. Video games make violence that does occur more severe and makes those who commit it more effective. They are detrimental to society and they CAN cause violence. That will conclude my opening argument. Thank you again, and I wish you luck. Vote Pro!",

            "premise": "Violent video games require active participation, repetition, and identification with the violent character. With new game controllers allowing more physical interaction, the immersive and interactive characteristics of video games can increase the likelihood of youth violence. Playing violent video games causes the development of aggressive behavioral scripts . A behavioral script is developed from the repetition of actions and affects the subconscious mind. An example of a common behavioral script is a driving script that tells drivers to get in a vehicle, put on a seat belt, and turn on the ignition. Similarly, violent video games can lead to scripts that tell youth to respond aggressively in certain situations. Violence in video games may lead to real world violence when scripts are automatically triggered in daily life, such as being nudged in a school hallway.",

            "conclusion": "Violent video games desensitize individuals to real violence",
            "premise": "When people are given repeated and long term exposure to media and video game violence they become aroused by the violence via a number of physiological and hormonal cues. Aggression is one of them. It's accurate to suggest that after exposure to violent video games adolescents and young adults do become aggressive. The effect wears off after about half an hour. The same effect is witnessed when people are exposed to pornography. Rape proclivity (similar questionnaire style psychology test of appropriate vs. inappropriate responses) and hormone levels spike and return to normal after about half an hour. The study you cite supposes that it can draw this short term spike of adrenaline into a long term correlation via \"delinquency\". You want to know why long term exposure to video games results in declines of academic performance? --- BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES ALL THE TIME!!!! Exposures to sex-materials and exposure towards violent materials do have a notably short term effect of sex and violent related activity. If you get somebody riled up, it takes a little bit of time for them to settle down. This isn't some kind of long term psychological scarring, it's hormones. If you expose people to sex they're okay with sex. If you expose people to violence they're okay with violence. These hold true for half an hour with a notably steady drop off throughout. ---- You need to establish that violent video games desensitize individuals to real violence. So far you've established: * People process video game violence in the same way as video violence. * You can rile a person up with video games. * If students play video games all the time they do worse in school. Are you going to cite a study with some direct relevance to the topic next? ---- These studies and this topic has been explored for decades and to date there's no good evidence to support the hypothesis and not for a lack of trying. It's become a joke of made for TV movies and school kids the world over. The idea that some kid is going to play GTA and car jack somebody and drive over a large number of people (fewer than ten if you want to avoid getting three stars) is simply wrong. The way kids figure this out without any fancy psychology PhDs? They play violent video games and would never do such a thing. No amount of psychology papers could possibly put that asunder. No amount of desperate attempts by psychologists trying to prove a link that they absolutely want to find is going to make a link suddenly appear. In the harder sciences when have a hypothesis and it fails, you look somewhere else, you don't keep searching for the next 20 years. The studies are going backwards. They assume that there must be a link and go about searching everywhere for it, they aren't trying to understand some underlying mechanism or odd effect they witnessed. They are making a conclusion and desperately seeking science to back it up. However, when we look at the bigger picture and compare populations to see if there is some effect there, we don't find it. There is more violent video games in Japan, and if you've ever seen Anime you'd know that there's plenty of video violence as well, however Japan still has nearly no violent crime. There's very little point in doing research to find the mechanisms behind something that can't even make a statistical dent. I'm sorry but you're wrong. I get the feeling that you're passionate about this and I don't mean to offend, but violent video games aren't making kids violent. It doesn't matter how many video games kids play, you threaten them with real death and expose them to real violence and they act the same way: scared.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting the debate as well as the rules associated with the debate. Violence is a re-occurring theme in our news. In response to these news, we often judge these teens without trying to find the origin of many attacks. Today, lets look at a major cause of teen violence as well as an irresponsible act performed by game stores or sellers of these games. I offer the following definition: Violent video games-\"game that includes video game\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgraphic violence, sex and sexism, violent and gory scenes, partial or full nudity, portrayal of\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcriminal behavior, racism, and other provocative and objectionable material.\"-->http://en.wikipedia.org... --> Often these games are rated M for mature and A for adults only. Contention one: Teens Emulate violence in games. Like their parents and there peers, teens as well as children of all ages often emulate video game activities. Within this game that they play, there avatar ids often seen doing stunts that would be considered impossible in real life. These kids in an effort to reenact these stunts as well as to prove to there peers that it can be done, often go ahead and replicate the stunts they see in the games. In the case of teenagers, these whom there minds are almost too easily controlled or manipulated often do things that passes jumping out of a building top, or even wrestling one another, what they are interested in is how to kill and dispose of a human body without detection. Some teenage then become an unstable hazard as they could easily demonstrate what they learned in there games when angered. Paul boxer wrote in a July-1st 2011 article that \"A few years ago, on Long Island, six teenagers were arrested after a crime spree involving break-ins, a violent mugging and a carjacking attempt. According to what the teens told authorities, they had been trying to live out the life of Niko Belic. Ever heard of him? He is the protagonist in the wildly popular video game 'Grand Theft Auto IV.\" http://blog.nj.com... Contention Two: Youth who play these games exhibits an increase aggression It is one thing for violent video game players to replicate the stunts seen on screen, but we find that these kids also exhibit aggressive behavior especially towards there family members. They are not only short tempered , but find it reasonable that if the characters of a video game is able to solve his or her problem with violence, then they can also resolve all there problems with violence. Violence often displayed at schools, at home as well as towards there peers. These random act of violence can also lead to long-term problems. Lets look at a linked graph: Play video game----->Aggression---->Violence---->lost of friends---->depression----> anger---->suicide! \"In experimental studies, children who view violent television shows or films \u2014 or who play violent video games \u2014 are significantly more likely to behave aggressively in comparison to children who view nonviolent television shows or films, or who play nonviolent video games. In long-term studies, individuals who consume violent media during childhood end up more aggressive as adults, in comparison with peers who consume nonviolent media during childhood. The studies that have produced such findings now number in the hundreds. The effects have been seen in children from urban areas, as well as suburban and rural areas; in the United States, as well as many other Western and non-Western nations.\" http://futureofchildren.org... conclusion: Sadly, I have not much time to conclude the debate however, giving the substantial reasoning, it is quite clear that a ban should be placed on the sale of violent games to minors. Thank you and I await your response.",

            "premise": "I would like to once again thank my opponent, for accepting this debate. Society should restrict the sale and play of violent video games because children become desensitized to violence and its impact. If children are exposed to violence through media, such as violent video games. When children see violent acts in society they equate it with the non-personal response of a video game. Then those children become a danger to themselves. As children have no real picture of the devastating effects of violence in reality. The violence of video games often down plays violence. So to the child it is not very huge. Which is a major concern. It is a major concern because some children may try to emulate the violence seen in video games, thus causing harm to either themselves or others. Final thought violent video games cause violent behavior and violent acts. Below I have posted a link to better support my argument. http://www.sciencedirect.com...",

            "premise": "Hello there, today, I'm going to be rebutting several of your arguments that you've made in the last round. Here we go; - Unfortunately, for your first argument, I'm going to be automatically debunking that one because once I clicked the link to that site, I got a security error on that site. Most likely because I have Norton installed. So if it's okay with you, I'm going to be automatically debunking that one. Next time, try to use a different web site. I would also like to say that even if video games DO cause aggression, it would be very little and would most likely just affect a particular group of people. Pretty much kids. - \"Another argument to the negative affects of video games is that they cause desensitization to individuals\". Now I suppose that video games do cause desensitization to individuals, I don't necessarily see how this is a bad thing at all actually. Just because these people aren't affected by violence, doesn't mean their most likely to cause violence or do anything bad. It also doesn't mean that they aren't affected by REAL LIFE violence since real life violence and video game violence are two whole entire different things. They aren't going to become non emotional sadistic people. There is no actual proof of this. If there is actual proof, then show me. - The con still hasn't answered a MAJOR question that I've asked him, has he/she ever played violent video games? If so, then did you feel any aggression? -If you see all of the articles about video game violence, you'll see one thing in common, the age group. The people that are making these articles about video games are only talking about KIDS and video game violence. They didn't mention anything about adults at all, because they know that their mature enough to be able to handle these violent games. But did you know, the average gamer is ACTUALLY 30 years old. The point that I'm trying to make of this is that when you say video games cause violence, maybe you should actually say video games cause violence for children, because the people who make those articles know that video games won't make adults behave more aggressively. But, the average gamer is 30 years old....... http://www.g4tv.com... \"It has actually been shown by the FBI that many perpetrators of mass shootings played violent video games often. Is it a mere coincidence, or could violent video games have induced those horrible acts of violence? Would all of those offender's behaviors been affected by symptoms shown in some of the arguments above.\" Do you have any proof? Actually, I think your LYING because I just found an article claiming that the FBI doesn't think that video games cause violence. http://www.gameskinny.com... And another article; http://kotaku.com... So what do you think? -\"Another point is that violent video games are more harmful than television shows, comics and other things of the like as they depict you; or a virtual version of you, performing those violent acts. It makes it all too easy to picture oneself doing violent things is if one has already done them in an alternate reality, with no punishment (referring to earlier argument mentioned).\" First of all, I never said that video games are more harmful than tv shows and comics, I specifically said that wouldn't violent tv shows and comics have the same effect as violent video games? Yet you still haven't clearly answered that question, the con seems to be trying to avoid the question. -\"Yet one more argument to point out is that video games often promote violence as a suitable resolution to various conflicts. Rather than simulating talking problems out in a civilized manner, the cause and effect flow on from an altercation is usually violence or warfare of some sort. What is this teaching the players, if not violence?\" I would just like to make clear that I never said that video games are resolutions to various conflicts. I just said that they relieved stress. Of course video games wouldn't solve real world problems, because it's a virtual world. Also I would like to ask you something, in one point or another in life, haven't you ever had a huge anger burst and the way you tried to calm yourself was by maybe shouting or punching the wall (at one moment of your life). Video games have the same effect as this except you wouldn't be smashing anything in real life, but you would just be killing things in the virtual world. All of my fellow gamers out there would understand. -Like I've said before, I WANT you to play a violent video game like mortal kombat or call of duty before you post your next argument. I also want you to tell me how you felt when you played those games. I think it would only be fair for this type of debate. Anyways, this is my share of my argument. And as tradition, I wish my opponent good luck.",

            "premise": "I first have to state that I will probably bee counted off for the copy and paste thing. If you feel I should be counted off please do so voters, although this is your own action. Also for the last round (The fifth) you do not have to have an official closing, you may continue making new arguments in your respective round. although I am giving con the upper hand. On with the debate. Yes I have agreed with you on many things. In fact most of your argument is completely true and I know this from experience. I have said BoP is shared, and it is. If you feel I have not brought up enough logic on my positive claim than I will start using statistics. Monday 10 November 2014 A recent long-term study by the USA shows the violent games are not the cause for violence in society If you read this study its states that in the first of the two historical evaluations researchers studied the links between violent films and societal violence by looking at the top grossing titles between 1920 and 2005. What they deduced was that film violence went in a rough U pattern during this time period whereas societal violence decreased in the later half of the 20th century. The second study used data from ESRB to estimate the violent content of video games from the time of 1996-2011. It showed that as the popularity of violent video games went up, youth violence went down. you can read more of thisin the sited resources below. To continue on into a more depressing topic, children who commit homicide have different brain structures. This article talks all about it. Apparently researchers found that children who commit murder have lower levels of grey matter in their medial and lateral temporal lobes and the hippocampus and posterior insula, according to news release. If you are wondering what grey matter is its the stuff that helps you process information in the brain. This means the less grey matter you have the more likely you will become confused between violent video games and reality. In another article posted Wed/July23/2014 showed that harsh corporal punishment can knock grey matter levels down in children. If a person receives this, they are more likely to commit violent acts in the future. This has nothing to do with the debate at hand, but what we can deduce is that when children between ages 10-17 play a violent video game they aren't losing anything beneficial to them and therefor are not violent in the future. Again I will restate a few more points There has never been a link between violent video games and violent acts in kids and teens. The sales rate for video games has quadrupled from 1995-2008 along with a 71.9% drop in juvenile arrest rates and a 49-50% drop in juvenile crimes. Any small correlation between violent youth and violent video games may be explained: Violent games do not cause youth to be violent, instead already violent youth are attracted to violent video games. cites http://www.independent.co.uk... http://www.natureworldnews.com... http://www.news-medical.net... http://www.cnn.com... http://videogames.procon.org...",

People's reactions to video games can cause violence, this is a definite fact. This does not mean that video games cause violence. Say, for example, I am using a spoon to scoop ice cream and then the spoon bends slightly, and then I punch my brother in the face. Should I have reacted so badly? No, I shouldn't have reacted like that. People aren't going to blame the weakness of spoons for me punching someone in the face, they are going to blame me and the incredibly bad temper that I have. When people in completely sound mind get mad at a video game, they don't become violent. If video games did cause violence, then wouldn't everyone who got mad at a video game become violent? It is more correct to have the cause of the violence on the person committing it then the video game they were playing.",

            "premise": "Whilst it might be agreed that violent video games in the hands of a person who is old enough to see them and be able to understand the context in which the violence is being wrought is acceptable, this may not be true of younger people who acquire games. Games with violent content are often easily acquired by players too young to purchase them. They may also gain access to them at home from older siblings. Because children do not have fully developed mental faculties yet, and may not clearly separate fantasy from reality, exposure to violent games can have a large impact upon children. This has a greater impact than children seeing films that feature realistic violence because whilst a child might get bored with films owing to the lack of interaction with the medium, this is much less likely to be the case with, for example, a military shooting game, which a child might play over and over As such, all violent video games should be banned to prevent their acquisition by young children either by accident, or owing to parental ignorance.[1] [1]\u00a0Anderson, Craig et al.

            "premise": "This debate will have 3 rounds 1. Representing a case that fully proves why or why not video games are creating violence 2. Attacks/Rebuttals 3. Why one side has clearly one the round and should be voted for. I will now affirm the Resolution: Video Games are Causing Violence \"Video games are bad for you? That's what they said about rock-n-roll.\" Shigeru Miyamoto Contention 1: Parents are Disregarding the Game - Now, must of us grew up playing video games and wanted a game that had a lot of violence in them. And since we were not old enough to buy it, our favorite grandparents or parent(s) got the game for us. In this generation, it is without a doubt that video games are getting much more violent. However, the exposure of this violence has to do with parents, and how they decide to raise their kids. It is clearly put on the back of a violent video game \"M\" for mature rating: strong langue, intense violence, sexual themes, and drug abuse, etc. Therefor, if a child does cause harm, the parents are the ones to be to blame as they bought the game for their child and are responsible for the outcomes of what happens to their child. Don't blame games for violence in kids or young adults, blame the irresponsible parents for that act of violence. According to a KOTAKU article, 2/3 of parents don't even bother looking at the game's rating. And believed that the games' age rating even mattered when purchasing a game. As you can see, it should be ultimately the parents fault if their loving angel had did something bad. http://kotaku.com... Contention 2: Correlation Does Not Prove Causation - This is the most logical and most proven philosophy ever, and has yet to be refuted. This philosophy basically states that just because you have a bigger shoe size doesn't mean you are a better runner. Things like this are completely logical and don't prove anything special, such as I have a size 10, but my dad can run way better than me and has a size 9. When it comes to video games, violence cannot simply be directly related to playing too many violent video games. I myself play a lot of violent video games, assassins creed, black ops, GTA, and others yet feel no compulsion to go and shoot out a super market or stab random people on the street. If a child plays a lot of call of duty, it does not mean that he is going to try and kill someone at school. It just doesn't relate. Many people after the Sandy Hook Shooting blamed violent video games on the shooters behavior because he tended to play them a lot. However that just wasn't the case, he was mentally unstable in the first place. Therefor, if my opponent wants to address this issue, he/she must EXPLICITLY show how video games do in fact, create violence in children. http://www.princeton.edu... http://www.pbs.org... (When reading this article, please read the FULL and Complete thing) Contention 3: No sufficient Studies -This argument will embody the fact that, regardless of how many studies that show video games (especially violent ones) are causing violence, they are completely false as they lack the correct variables and correlation to even prove that there is a direct link. Again from the pbs.org link above, regardless of the famous Ohio State University study on violence in video games (130,000 people surveyed, the variables weren't controlled and the subject results were skewed) the study was a complete fallacy and failed to make a direct link to why video games are causing violence. Now, lets start off with the fact that we are not addressing \"aggression\" we are explicitly addressing violence and should be the base of all studies shown in this debate. Studies on video games causing violence follow the same path, AS CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE OR IMPLY CAUSATION. I must affirm because of my three points.",

            "premise": "I'll start out by saying I agree with my opponent's definition. I'll use this round to address each of the studies my opponent has cited in their case.Survey StudyThere are a couple reasons that this study does nothing to prove my opponent's point. Firstly, this is not a study over whether or not video games cause violence. It is a study over whether or not people believe video games cause violence. In the chart my opponent has provided, we can see that more people think video games cause violence than not. This argument can't be taken into account because it is a logical fallacy known as bandwagon. (assuming something is true because many people believe it is) The article linked by my opponent seemed to show that those who play video games are less worried about negative affects. So, it is quite obvious that this article is not actually claiming that violence in video games is harmful. The article ends with this... \"It is possible that concerns about games could fade away in much the same way that fears about rock music, comic books, and radio dramas dissolved when these forms of entertainment gained wider acceptance.\"Time StudyThis study notes that video games (even if played for a short period of time) can cause permanent changes in the brain and aggression. (Note: My opponent says violence, but the article says aggression) I showed in R2 that violence and aggression are not actually the same thing. Aggression is an intention, violence is an action. Moreover, nothing about this study suggests it was the violence in the video games that resulted in the aggression. There is a good chance that the competitive factor so often found in violent video games was what caused such feelings of aggression among the children. American Psychological Association notes (after observing several studies), \"More competitive games produced greater levels of aggressive behavior than less competitive games, no matter how much violence was in the games. (1)\" Remember, my opponent must prove that violence factor in video games results in real-world violence. Fox News StudyThis study is very similar to the time study, so I'll go ahead and cross-apply what I said earlier. I would like to note that my opponent's source concedes that this study is flawed. The source says, \"However, experts not involved with the study say that the research has flaws, and does not add anything meaningful to the debate over whether violent video games increase aggression, which has been a contentious issue.\"Grand Theft ChildhoodMy opponent cites a study that explains how 60% of middle schoolers that beat up someone played at least one M rated video game. I'd like to reference something I said in R2, \"It turns out that delinquent peers, depression, and an abusive family environment account for actual violence incidents\u2026\" If a middle schooler is beating up their classmates, it is more likely to be because of the reasons I have listed. In order for this study to count, my opponent will need to explain exactly how, in this study, the violence factor of video games is contributing to this violence among kids.School Shooting StudyPage four of my opponent's source explains that many factors contribute towards school shootings and that not one factor is decisive. Here we can see that violence in video games alone does not cause such shootings to come about. Most likely, other factors are coming into play as I have shown in previous evidence. Just because a shooter plays violent video games doesn't mean that is what caused them to commit such a violent crime. Moreover, this resolution does say \"in general.\" School shootings are very rare. Even if literally every school shooting was a result of violence in video games, this would not be enough to cause me to not fulfill my BoP.Video Game and Homicide CorrelationThis chart compares video game sales in Europe and America, as well as homicide in Europe and America. It important to realize that we don't know exactly what caused this correlation. My opponent has not proved that violence in video games directly have caused this link. This is a logical fallacy known as false cause. Essentially, this correlation could be caused by anything. For example, Europe and the US have different gun control policies, different laws, and different atmospheres. Anything could cause this correlation. In the chart I provided, I was not aiming to show a direct correlation, rather, I was aiming to show that video game sales certainly are not causing violence to go up.(1) https://www.apa.org...",

            "premise": "Thanks Pro for the response. In this round we are just going to tie this all up and show why we have won this debate. Now I will begin to say why I have won. 1. Okay, so my opponent brought up Adam Lanza, or the horrible human being who killed 20 children and 6 adults. However, regardless of the evidence that my opponent has brought up, it does not even say that the video game that Adam Lanza was playing even was the MAIN CAUSE of the shooting. The resolution is proposing that video games are CAUSING violence. His evidence bites him back again as the evidence directly states, \"The fact remains that while the report's conclusion does not mention video games as any cause for Lanza's murderous rampage (nor does it speculate on any motive), one video game was, at least, part of the buffet of mass shooting news reports, books, and other media Lanza was consuming, according to evidence recovered from the home.\" Again, voters, my opponent has brought up evidence that directly refutes his statements and his argument falls as mine stands regardless of the rebuttal. There is no, way, shape, or form that my opponent has brought up that a video game caused that mass shooting. Therefore you are just going to have to carry that to my side as a winning argument. 2. My opponent brought up grand theft childhood, and this again contradicts his statements. If you look at the myth category of the website, it says, \"The growth in violent video game sales is linked to the growth in youth violence \" especially school violence \" throughout the country.\" And the fact is, \"Video game popularity and real-world youth violence have been moving in opposite directions. Violent juvenile crime in the United States reached a peak in 1993 and has been declining since. Between 1994 and 2004, arrests for murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assaults fell 49 percent, resulting in the lowest juvenile arrest rate for violent crimes since at least 1980. Murder arrests, which reached a high of 3,790 in 1993, plummeted 71% to 1,110 by 2004. School violence has also gone down.\" My opponent clearly has lost this point as he is completely contradictory of himself and you are going to keep this flowing to my side as VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT CAUSING VIOLENCE IN CHILDREN. 3. My opponent brought up my argument that parents are influencing the child when they buy the child that game. He brought up a cooking game and how that makes people want to be chefs, however, he would have never wanted to be a chef had it not been for his parents buying the game and letting him play it. In violent video games, it is the same case , therefore voters, you are just going to flow that to my side. 4. Now voters, please keep in mind that my opponent has failed to attack my correlation does not prove causation contention therefore dropping his case even further, and not attacking my third contention leads to an even further drop in his case as the studies are false and are contradictory of his statements. http://www.grandtheftchildhood.com... http://kotaku.com... Please vote con as his case is contradictory and holds no ground in this debate, he is completely contradictory of himself, and has failed to attack my second and third contention. I have deconstructed his case and have proven, WITH HIS OWN EVIDENCE that video games are not causing violence in children. Therefor, I must undoubtedly negate.",

            "premise": "As of now, every lawsuit that has been filed against the game industry for cases such as this have been thrown out. Why, you ask? Because the science doesn't back up such claims. As we all should very well know, correlation doesn't imply causation; this is basic psychology. The burden of proof is on my opponent to show the causal link between video game violence and an increase in aggression. As is with most studies, the one my you have posted simply concludes that individuals who play violent video games experience an increase in physiological signs of aggression. However, this still does not address the issue at hand, of whether or not violent video games lead to real life violence. Such experiments are methodologically unsound' the environment is drastically different, and participants are in situations they normally wouldn't be. Even so, such experiments don't establish this \"link\" between violent video games and aggression. [1] People know what they are playing, and what context it is. It's for fun, and they are conscious of what goals they are playing it for: entertainment. Studies in apes show a distinction between play fighting and ripping each others gut out in real combat. It shows that apes do make distinctions between the two, so why can't humans? [1] Yeah, individuals get a physiological response to violent video games, as do people who watch porn. In the same way, the movie industry has been here long before video games came along, and the violence in many movies such as Saw (yummy) is no secret. Roughly 79 percent of America's youth play video games, many of them for at least eight hours a week. [2] Holy camels there must be shootings and beatings and rapes all over the street! But wait a minute, then explain to me why the crime rate in America is going down. [3] Surely, it should be spiking up with the video game industry exploding in its few decades of existence, but the evidence speaks otherwise. ---References--- 1. http://www.pbs.org... 2. http://culturalpolicy.uchicago.edu... 3. http://www.livescience.com...",

            "premise": "Violent video games desensitizes individuals, causing them to take real violence lightly. People habituate the video game violence and become physiologically numb to it. Nicholas Carnagey, an Iowa State psychology instructor and research assistant, and ISU Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Anderson collaborated on the study of \"The Effects of Video Game Violence on Physiological Desensitization to Real-Life Violence\" with Brad Bushman, a former Iowa State psychology professor now at the University of Michigan, and Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. 257 college students, 124 men and 133 women, were tested individually. After measuring their heart rate and galvanic skin response and asking questions about their video game preferences and general aggression levels, each participant was exposed to one of eight randomly designated violent or nonviolent games for 20 minutes. The four possible violent games were Carmageddon, Duke Nukem, Mortal Kombat or Future Cop; the non-violent games were Glider Pro, 3D Pinball, 3D Munch Man and Tetra Madness. After the 20 minute duration, the test subjects were subjected to the same tests and then asked to watch actual violent episodes constructed from TV episodes and commercially-released films in the contexts of courtroom outbursts, police confrontations, shootings and prisons fights. Physiological differences were observed throughout the entire viewing. When viewing the actual images of violence, participants that played the violent video games had a significantly less skin response than those that had played nonviolent video games. In addition, the participants that had played the violent video games had a lower heart rate than those that played nonviolent video games. The people that participated in the experiment had no discrepancy in heart rate or skin response before the beginning of the study or immediately after playing the assigned games The results demonstrate that only 20 minutes of exposure can cause people to be less aroused by violence. When desensitized to violence and accepting it as the norm, one is more apt to commit violence. Video game players can become more aggressive in outlook, perceptual biases, attitudes, beliefs, and behavior than they were before the repeated exposure or would have become without such exposure. In a study entitled \"Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life', it was found that violent video game play and aggressive personality separately and jointly accounted for major portions of both aggressive behavior and nonaggressive delinquency. \"Violent video game play was also shown to be a superior predictor of both types of delinquency compared with time spent playing all types of video games. This is also consistent with our GAAM formulation and suggests that future research (unlike most past work) needs to distinguish between these types of video games. The positive association between violent video games and aggressive personality is consistent with a developmental model in which extensive exposure to violent video games (and other violent media) contributes to the creation of an aggressive personality. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow a strong test of this causal hypothesis, but a zero or negative correlation would have disconfirmed the hypothesis, so the test is a legitimate one.\" I conclude, from the evidence stated, that video games lead to aggression.

            "premise": "I feel that just because a video game have the ability to glamorize illegal things (such as using and selling drugs, speeding cars, and murder) does not mean that people who play these games will actually do illegal things. If people are influenced by taking drugs, running red lights, or being violent in anyway because they did it on a video game then there is something else driving that person to do it. No moral and mentally healthy person would go kill people for fun due to a video game. No one wants to sell drugs due to it \"looking fun\". No one wants to get into a fist fight because \"why not\". No one wants to get police to chase them in a speeding car for the hell of it. There are definable other aspects in said persons life that would lead them to that. I think it is quite clear that people get desensitized to violence in general due to video games and movies, however that does not mean people are going to be violent. Desensitization of violence doesn't necessary mean you will be a violent person, but will not be mentally affected by it if you see it. On a personal note, I have been playing video games ever since I could remember with games like Pokemon, and Runescape. To this day, I am still a big gamer and have played most mainstream games. When I saw the Deadpool movie this weekend (extremely graphic), I did not freak out at the crazy amount of violence. I would say I'm desensitized to most violence, but I'm also basically a pacifist and never really hit anyone or got into a fight. I acknowledge this is my situation, but I wasn't raised around violence. I never really saw a real fist fight. Real violence wasn't around me, so that's probably why I'm a pacifist. But that is kind of my point, it's individual experiences that might make people violent, not from a role-playing game on a television. From my perspective anyone who plays violent games with a relatively healthy mind knows that these games are fake. Someone who is violent probably did not get it from watching fake scenarios of violence, like in movies or video games because it is clear it is fake. There is no urge (from a mentally healthy person at least) to go and try this in real life. I just don't feel that anyone who is a normal human being would take something from \"Grand Theft Auto\" and go steal cars, kill police, and punch hookers. I just don't see it happening. Again I do see the desensitization of violence, but I don't see it causing extra violence in stable teenagers (or anyone for that matter). I keep saying \"stable\" and \"mentally healthy\" because if someone has a mental problem they might do something crazy from an idea a video game gave them, but that's not exclusive to video games. (I hope this all makes sense)",

            "premise": "I have given you many examples on what the police are calling copycat crime and that the police are taking very seriously!. because this is an issue on the rise The government is supposed to do what is best for his/her country,weigh up the consequences and benefits and make a decision on what is best and if it saves lives to ban violent video games then so be it that is what we should do! So you think that people being able to waste there lives sitting in front of a screen for hours on end killing people is more important than even just one of the lives out of the many lives lost due to copycat crime from violent video games???? You put the word children in capital letters when you were talking about what I thought well why? what does it matter if the people killing are 17yrs old or 28yrs old the bottom line is that people are getting murdered not the age of the people killing them!!!. And you said would I put a ban on cars because they can be used in violence well no I would not because cars have a useful purpose but what useful purpose do violent video games have?! answer me that. And you said we should ban all movies with violence well no because there is a difference between when you watch someone shoot someone else in a movie that is not you pulling the trigger but in a game you are the one killing. Violence maybe human nature but it is certainly not something that should be glorified and encouraged on violent video games!. When children are growing up we teach them right from wrong by rewarding them for good behavior and punishing them for bad but in a violent video game the players are rewarded for killing someone by being moved up on a level or awarded a new gun or armor. Why this goes against basic moral standards. A survey of 1,102 adolescents found that 97 percent had played video games in the past day. Although most parents checked the censor\"s rating before allowing their child to purchase it, 50 percent of boys and 14 percent of girls favored games with an \"M\" (mature) or \"AO\" (adult-only) rating, which implies a high degree of violence This is cause for concern. Research has long shown a cause-effect relationship between video game violence and aggression among children and youth who play it. And morally should people really take pleasure in killing and assaulting and torturing people???.",

However, many meta-analysis studies which show that there is a link between video gaming and violence are plagued with publication bias and methodological problems, such as citing studies which were not published or selecting certain studies and ignoring others. (http://www2.psych.ubc.ca...) 2. Non-Laboratory resultsA survey is not a study: it can be affected by the personal biases of teachers and students. As the teachers knew which students whose violent behaviors they were rating, the survey that pro cited was not sufficiently blinded. (http://drdouglas.org...) Also, many experts, parents, and paediatricians agree that violent video games do not cause violence. (http://www.theguardian.com...) If the survey that pro cited were to be counted as valid evidence, then this should be too.One of the methodological flaws of using labratory results is that the violent clips and video game content are often served to the groups of youth outside of their contexts; the entire narrative of the violent work of fiction was not provided. This is different than in real life situations. (http://www.independent.co.uk...)3. Crime RatesPro claims that crime rates decreased in spite of violent media becoming more popular. I propose an alternative idea: violent media has nothing to do with crime rates. Studies have shown that the one thing that correlates with crime is gasoling lead levels.

Your third claim supports mine as well. You claim that people blame their violent actions on video games. Because you used the term \"blame\" it is safe to assume that you meant that the actions were not actually caused by the video game itself.ConclusionRemind me, are you for or against the idea that violence is caused by video games?

In fact, what your article proves is that people will do anything to get what they want. The video game did not make that person violent. His desire to get something he did not have made him violent. It is the same as a person who steals. What fear mongers and paranoid people do is pick something violent people have in common and say that is the cause of violence. Well, all people have toothbrushes, clothes, TVs, etc. We could just as easily say those things cause violence. Yet, we all know the don't. The odds of a violent person having a video game is very high since many households have them. That doesn't mean the video games cause violence. It just means people like the product so they purchased it. Like I said, I have been around real violence. When a person does something violent, it is for very specific reasons within that person. It has nothing to do with a game. If anything, the game lets the person relieve the stress in a non-harmful way. Want to see a really violent person? See a person who holds everything in and then one day just snaps. Look at all the violence cases. Go past the news or the twitter feeds that tell you nothing. Look at the case itself. What cause violence is more than likely two people going at it and in most cases, both parties are at fault in some way.",

            "premise": "As Pro, I am advocating that video games do not increase or perpetuate violence. First Round: Case Presentation Second:Rebuttals Third:Voters 1. Statistics point to the Pro argument According to the FBI in 2009,The arrest rate for juvenile murders has fallen 71.9% between 1995 and 2008. The arrest rate for all juvenile violent crimes has declined 49.3%. In this same period, video game sales have more than quadrupled. The FBI statistics show that video game sales have been on the rise, while all juvenile violent crimes have fallen in the same amount of time. Looking at today's debate, you have to see that Pro shows with this evidence that the claim that video games cause violence is not backed up by reasonable statistics. Therefore, the claim is false. 2.There is no correlation between violence and video games. A 2004 US Secret Service review of previous school-based attacks found that one-eighth of attackers exhibited an interest in violent video games, less than the rate of interest attackers showed in violent books, movies, and writings. The report did not show any link between video games and school based violence. 3. Violent video games can indeed be a healthy outlet. A 2007 study by the Journal of Adolescent Health reported that 45% of boys played video games because \"it helps me get my anger out\" and 62% played because it \"helps me relax.\" Those statustics show that children go to video games to give them an escape from the pressures of life around them. Also, video games can provide helpful lessons for the future. They allow people to explore situations like war, violence, and death without real consequences. Overall, statistics show that there is no correlation between video games and juvenile violence. In fact, video games help more than they hurt.",

First of all, you said that parenting is a primary source to violence, while this may be a legitimate statement, it does not pertain to the argument at hand. Second, you mentioned that some people may not be able to differentiate reality from fantasy, and that may cause them to be more prone to violence without gaming. This is only true in some cases. For example, a child. If a child plays this game, he will be prone to violence he is most likely has not been exposed to otherwise. You mentioned that parents should be deciding at an early age whether they should play violent video games or not. Well if video games that were violent were not sold, this would not be a problem at all. You mentioned call of duty, or medal of honor. You said that while realistic, it is educational. I have to disagree, as the last four Call of Duty games have taken place in modern ages. With most taking place in the near future. Did you know the Military uses first person shooters to make them less sensitive to killing. Why would you expose that to children? As for Crysis, it still involves shooting humans. The fact stands that you shouldn't put children in the hands of someone who is killing another person.",

            "discussionTitle": "Violent Video Games Cause Violent Behavior",
            "conclusion": "Violent Video Games Cause Violent Behavior",
            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for accepting! Good luck to him/her! :)Before I begin, I want to point out that the onus is on my opponent to prove that the resolution is true. This is because:a) The burden is on him to prove a positive statement (i.e. the resolution), as it's impossible to prove a negative claim.b) The resolution demands that he prove that violent video games cause violent behavior, and that I prove they do not. This means that so long as I'm refuting my opponent's arguments, then it's sufficient for me to win the debate, as I'm disproving my opponent's position, i.e. showing how violent video games do not cause violent behavior.OVERVIEW TO MY OPPONENT'S CASE:My opponent seems to be using the tactic of just citing sources without actually writing out an arugment. There's a few problems with doing this.First, this is just the appeal to authority fallacy. He's just showing the articles to me and saying that I'm wrong because it's all right there. By that line all I have to do is show my own sources and nothing in his last round stands anymore because the sources would cancel each other out. Without writing any actual arguments, he doesn't have anything to advance in the round, and thus no way to win.Second, this is a debate between me and the user blackbird. If I wanted to debate the authors of those articles, I'd contact them and do so. It's unfair to me to be expected to read through every article and respond to everything in them while all my opponent did was just list off a few results from Google. Judges, I ask that you don't let him get away with this kind of behavior. If he doesn't actually give you any arguments of his own, then vote him down.But, even though it's unfair for me to have to, I read through his sources. Let's examine each one in depth:THE CNN SOURCE:His first source is a source from CNN talking about the link between violent video games and aggression. This source is a wash for a few reasons:First, he's mistakingly saying that aggression and violent behavior are the same thing. That's not the case though. I can be an aggressive person without doing a single violent thing. Aggression doesn't necessitate violent acts and the onus is on him to prove that it does.Second, his own source admits that there could be an outside reason other than the violence that's causing the aggression. To quote his own article, \"\"It's not the violence per se that's the problem, it's the context and goals of the violence,\" said Olson, citing past research on TV violence and behavior.\". Since my opponent has to be proving that it's the violence that's causing the violent acts, as per the resolution, if I show that there's an outside reason other than violence that's causing these violent acts then you vote con. Third, his own source admits that his own source has too vague of definitions, and that there needs to be better definitions of what a violent video game constitutes and what aggressive behavior constitutes. To quote his own source, \". But she argues that the label \"violent video games\" is too vague. Researchers need to do a better job at defining what is considered a violent video game and what constitutes aggressive behavior, she added.\" This means that a) his source doesn't fully defend the position he's taking and b) it further confirms my earlier point that aggression isn't the same thing as violent acts. THE TIME SOURCE: My opponent's next source is a source from the New York Times, talking about, again, how exposure to violent video games leads to aggression. This source is even worse.First, refer back to my above argument about how aggression and violent acts are not the same thing.Second, his own source contradicts his claim. To quote his source, \"Anderson and his team, however, did not see any significant difference in empathy among the players who played more or fewer hours. That confirmed earlier lab-based studies that showed both undergraduates who played violent games and those that played non-violent ones were equally likely to help scientists pick up dropped pens.\" And this is important because if there's no difference in empathy between those who play violent video games and those who do not, the claim that violent vidoe games lead to aggression looks even worse than it did before. Also, if violent video game players are showing the same levels of empathy as non-violent video game players are, then they're just as likely to also commit acts of violence as those who do not, since empathy is the opposite of aggression (helping someone as opposed to hurting them), which suggests an alternative cause to the violent acts than the violence in video games. Third, his own source blatantly argues against his position. To quote, \"The evolving literature is why some researchers, including Christopher Ferguson, chair of the psychology department at Stetson University, insist there isn\u2019t strong evidence that exposure to violent video games leads to more aggressive behavior. He notes, for example, that the rise in popularity of video gaming has not been matched by a similar rise in violent crime among adolescents who are most likely to play them. Studies that link violent video games to violent behavior, he says, often fail to account for other factors that can contribute to aggression, such as violence in the home, abuse, and mental illness.\" This is catastrophic for my opponent because it shows that a) violent video games don't lead to more aggression, b) if it did then there would be a corrolation between video game and violent crime among adolescents, which his own source says doesn't exist, and c) that there are alternative explanations to the violent behavior (i.e. domestic violence, abuse, and mental disease) that causes the violent behavior. THE PAMF SOURCE:My opponent's third source is from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, and makes the claim that violent video games leads to aggression. This source is trash as well.First, refer to the above as to how aggression and violent acts are not the same thing.Secondly, the source doesn't actually present any kind of evidence. It says a bunch of stuides have said things (\" A 2004 study by Gentile, Lynch, Linder & Walsh found that teens who play violent video games for extended periods of time: ... ), without giving us anything about the study (i.e. methodology, sample size, etc.). This means it's impossible to verify the integrity of the study conducted, which means there's no reason we should trust the accuracy of the study for the purpose to this debate.Third, even his own source won't defend the accuracy of outside sources/websites. To quote, \"[B]elow are links PAMF accessed when researching this topic. PAMF does not sponsor or endorse any of these sites, nor does PAMF guarantee the accuracy of the information contained on them.\" If the source he's citing to make x claim won't even defend the information they used to make that claim, there's absolutely no reason we should trust his source. THE PSYCHOLOGY TODAY SOURCE:His fourth and final source is from Psychology today and is saying that---wait, where have I seen this before? Is it making the claim that violent video games lead to aggression? Oh no, it is...Well, might as well dive right in.First, refer above to why violent acts and aggression are not the same thing.Secondly, the empirical evidence cited by this article is not even linked, just the results were stated, meaning we have no way to confirm that the study was a valid study.Third, the evidence it uses isn't even significant. The results from the study said, and I quote, \"These studies find that playing violent video games does, indeed, cause aggression. The effect is a correlation of about r = .20\", which is statistically insignificant. It's more likely that an alternative cause, like one's previously mentioned, are causing the violent behavior other than the violence in video games themselves. HIS OTHER TWO SOURCES:My opponent cites two more sources, which, as he claims, show how children \"will emulate Power Rangers and all sorts of things they see on television as well \". This is irrelevant to the debate. Our discussion is about violent video games. Anything outside of this should have no relevance to the debate at hand.IN CONCLUSION:I have gone through all of my opponent's claims and thuroughly refuted each and every source he cited. Moreover, he has not actually presented a single argument this debate, only letting google do his arguing for him. This means that a) you're defaulting to voting con because he doesn't have a single argument to advance through the round, which means he isn't proving that violent video games cause violent behavior, and b) even if you're counting his source-spam as an argument, I've gone through and shown how his sources are both flawed and contradictory to his position, providing me with evidence for my position, meaning I'm doing the better job upholding my resolutional burden.I pass the floor back over to my opponent, and wish him luck with the rest of the debate! :)",

            "premise": "Sorry about the late response.The topic of video games' effect on violence levels has been debated for quite some time. I believe that video games do not have an effect on violence levels.Arguments:1. Video games have been shown to have a calming effect.Recent studies have shown that video games have no effect or even the opposite effect on gamers. These studies show that gamers who were shown violent photos or photos with a negative connotation reacted the same as non-gamers. This study was published in an issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology. [1] [2]2. Video gamers know about the difference between reality and fantasy. Another popular argument against video games is that gamers can't tell the difference between the video game world and the real world. This is not the case however, as many cases of gamers confusing them are not actually confusions of the virtual/real world, but just remembering repetitions.

            "premise": "Well, you are right, but listen to this: 97% of 12-17 year olds in the US played video games in 2008, thus fueling an $11.7 billion domestic video game industry. In 2008, 10 of the top 20 best-selling video games in the US contained violence. Violent video games have been blamed for school shootings, increases in bullying, and violence towards women. Critics argue that these games desensitize players to violence, reward players for simulating violence, and teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. Video game advocates contend that a majority of the research on the topic is deeply flawed and that no causal relationship has been found between video games and social violence. They argue that violent video games may reduce violence by serving as a substitute for rough and tumble play and by providing a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings. California passed a law in 2005 that would have required violent video games to include an \"18\" label and criminalized the sale of these games to minors. On June 27, 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in Brown vs. Entertainment Merchants Association that the law violated free speech rights. On April 20, 1999, two seniors kids walked into their high school carrying rifles, and they opened fire. They shot tons of people, killing 12 students and one teacher and the people were appalled. School shootings had happened before, but this was a violence shooting and in the ensuing search for answers it came out the shooters had spent a lot of time playing violent video games. (Source- how stuff works) Since then, the entertainment proclivities of the shooters are one of the first things reported by the press. There was a 20-year-old who killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012 played violent video games. So did the 24-year-old high- schooler who shot dozens of people in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in the same year. An estimated 97% of America's young people are playing video games, with many of the popular ones that feature violent content.What seems to some to be a connection between violent game play and actual violence has many wondering about the effects of immerse violence on young children's minds. Video games have really only existed since the mid-1970s, so there's not much evidence for or against their violent effects than there is your surroundings like TV violence of movie violence, but the rise in dramatically violent shootings by teenaged gamers is bolstering the side of the argument that says video game violence translates in some way to the real world.",

            "premise": "Observation:The resolution is about the impact of violence in video games, not about the impact of video games themselves.What began the controversy:It is obvious that violence has been a major issue in society today. Events such as the school shooting in Newtown and the bombing of the Boston Marathon have made people begin to wonder what exactly pushed the guilty individuals to commit such atrocities. Many people have concluded that one of the major factors that promotes violence today are video games. Jay Rockfeller is one of the activists against video game violence. Minnesota Post explains that Rockfeller introduced a legislation instructing the National Association of Sciences to investigate the effects of violent video games on children, saying, \u201cPeople believe that violent video games are no more dangerous to young minds than classic literature or Saturday morning cartoons. Parents, pediatricians, and psychologists know better.\u201d (1) The effects of video games on the minds of young children has been studied for years, and the data quite contradicts Rockfeller\u2019s conclusion.What really causes violence in teens:Serious CrimesAdam Lanza, the gunman from the Sandy Hook shooting, played violent video games regularly. This caused many to believe that this is why he committed his violent crime. However, this was not the case. Eric Huey explains, \u201cIt turns out that delinquent peers, depression, and an abusive family environment account for actual violence incidents\u2026\u201d (2) Obviously, mental disorders would be another thing that promotes such violence. Here we can see that video games did not compel him (or most other school shooters) to commit the crime. AgressionA common argument against violence in video games is that violence in video games cause agression. This is actually not the case. Carol Pichefsky notes that agression is not caused by violent video games; rather, it is caused by a competitive environment (3). So, a game of MarioKart would be just as likely to result in aggression as a game of Call of Duty. This is not exclusive to video games either, competitive sports and competitive debate (especially on this website) are just as likely to result in aggression. So, it is certianly not the violence in video games that causes such feelings. The last thing I would like to note is that aggression and violence are two different things. Agression is an intention. Violence in an action (4). My opponent showing that video games cause aggression is simply not enough. The evidence:If violence in video games have caused violence in the past, it would make sense for the violence rates to go up as video game sales went up. However, just the opposite happened: We can see that as video game sales go up, violent crime went down. Now, I certianly won't argue that video games caused the violent crime to go down, but this evidence certianly makes mockery of the idea that violence in video games has caused real world violence.ConclusionHuey notes (1), \"...these games may seem repugnant but they do not harm the human brain or increase the likelihood of violent acts.\" Through the evidence I have presented, we can see that the violence in video games does not cause real world violence. Thus, I take the pro stance on this resolution.(1) http://www.minnpost.com...(2) http://www.sfgate.com...(3) http://www.sfgate.com...(4) http://www.goodtherapy.org...#(5) Chasing the Dream, \u201cThe Economist\u201d On to con...",

            "premise": "My last argument was an emotional argument, anything you could not understand then will probably be explained here. Sorry for that Ok I will be counter arguing this round and possibly making a few new arguments. Yes the goal in most video games is kill the enemy, destroy this, eradicate that. achieve this by ridding of this. But this debate revolves around why video games influence kids or don't influence kids to do physical harm in real life. I would never ask \"why parents do not take these away from their children?\" because it has nothing to do with the argument. although I agree its a problem that parents forget about the rating system. Ya sure kids stay indoors. That is great. So what does that prove? You know books are inside the house. Yes TV isnt really a big thing but this caters mostly to all ages between 8 and 16 but I never stated that so that is irrelevant excuse me. Continuing on most of my argument: Kids are influenced by the outside. I think most american kids go to school. And i stated there that kids influence other kids to do bad things. Also I stated that kids walk into history class and are greeted by a bloody display of human history. I am not saying we should not teach it or censor it that would be dumb, but its another form of instigating grueling violent thoughts in kids. So my argument still stands. Now on with more stuff: yes you are right video games are a popular media in this day and age. BUT does that make them the cause of most of the horrible acts relating to violence in kids? No not all. I find it funny that you say because video games are the most popular they are therefore one of the main and only reasons for violent acts and thoughts in kids. have you ever seen or heard of a miss raised child in a bad home? I have many times. Most of the violent acts and thought come from the lifestyle they were born into. Not what their hobbies are. Just some statistics found at this site(The following was copy and pasted): http://videogames.procon.org... Sales of video games have more than quadrupled from 1995-2008, while the arrest rate for juvenile murders fell 71.9% and the arrest rate for all juvenile violent crimes declined 49.3% in this same period. A causal link between violent video games and violent behavior has not been proven. Many studies suffer from design flaws and use unreliable measures of violence and aggression such as noise blast tests. Thoughts about aggression have been confused with aggressive behavior, and there is a lack of studies that follow children over long periods of time. A 2004 US Secret Service review of previous school-based attacks found that one-eighth of attackers exhibited an interest in violent video games, less than the rate of interest attackers showed in violent movies, books, and violence in their own writings. The report did not find a relationship between playing violent video games and school shootings. The small correlations that have been found between video games and violence may be explained by violent youth being drawn to violent video games. Violent games do not cause youth to be violent. Instead, youth that are predisposed to be violent seek out violent entertainment such as video games. Playing violent video games reduces violence in adolescent boys by serving as a substitute for rough and tumble play. Playing violent video games allows adolescent boys to express aggression and establish status in the peer group without causing physical harm. I copy and pasted all of those paragraphs. That should not count me off because I linked the site up top. You can also check it out here:http://videogames.procon.org... Thank you for reading my argument and happy fourth of july!!!",

This debate is based solely on the proposition that violent video games desensitize individuals to real violence. First, for my counterargument, I would like to define what it means to desensitize. dictionary.com 1.to lessen the sensitiveness of, or to reduce responses to external conditions or stimulation. Now, alluding to my first arguments, after playing the violent video games, the subjects had less of a response to the violent episodes. Therefore, they were desensitized. It has been proven that people adapt after increased exposure to stimuli and become desensitized to it, so no matter what you can't argue that violent video games do no desensitize individuals to violence at all. The evidence supporting both your and my side is lacking, so there is no ways to say with a high degree of certitude that they do or do not have long term desensitization effects, however that is not what the proposition states. One reason I go on debate.org is to see the opposite sides of issues. Thank you for providing such great information! Now I have a different perspective. I hope I didn't waste your time.

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for instigating this debate and wish him good luck!Since Pro has not forbade me from presenting arguments in the first round, I will do exactly that.The resolution: \"Video games do not cause violence to a scale which is large enough to be worried about\"In this debate, I will not argue that video games cause kids to get up and shoot/attack someone. Rather, I will argue that there is a correlation between violent behavior of any sort to violent video games.-------------------------A. Definitions and Clarifications1A - InformationThough my opponent would probably like me to argue that there is a definitive link between video games and murderous or extreme, I will instead focus on proving that there is a correlation between video games and worrisome violence as per my opponent's resolution.\"Video Games DO NOT cause violence (Or at least not at a scale which is large enough to worry about.)\"Thus, using these definitions, I will prove that Video Games have the potential and definitively have caused worrisome violence.1B - Assumption about the resolution\"Video games\" - I will assume that this is not in reference to all video games as my opponent failed to include \"all\" in his resolution of this indeed the case. Instead, I will assume that the resolution suggests that \"Video games with violent themes or otherwise aggressive content in them do not cause violence\", as it would be pointless to debate over whether games like Mario Kart or Angry Birds cause violence. That would be extremely redundant.1C - The Definition of ViolenceViolence is not limited to actions which result in the imminent harm of another person. vi\u00b7o\u00b7lence [vahy-uh-luhns] noun 1. swift and intense force: the violence of a storm. 2. rough or injurious physical force, action, or treatment: to die by violence. 3. an unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights or laws: to take over agovernment by violence 4. a violent act or proceeding. 5. rough or immoderate vehemence, as of feeling or language: the violence of his hatred. B. ArgumentsB1 - Violent Video Games cause worrisome violence, and all violence is worrisomeMost especially in youth, the exertion of noticeable or otherwise untriggered violence is abnormal and signatory of deviation in the proper growth and functioning of their brain. If someone exhibits violent behaviour, then that should be inherently major enough for those who care about them to consider as \"big enough to worry about\". For that reason, I dismiss the \"big enough to worry about\" part of pro's resolution.In the linked video, you will see adolescents, children, and even adults exhibiting behavior that can be considered to be \"violent\" as a result of video gaming.B2 - Those who benefit from video games and never exhibit violence even though they play them are irrelevant to the resolutionMy opponent has presented me with the resolution that:\"Video Games DO NOT cause violence (Or at least not at a scale which is large enough to worry about.)Scientests have found however there are many benifits to video games such as socialisation increased reflexes etc.\"Whilst it is true that in certain cases video games can bring benefits like increased reflexes, the resolution is over whether violent video games are one of the many possible causes of violence, not whether video games cause violence in every instance.Comparison:\"Being abused as a child most definitely is a contributing cause to future violence, but not in every instance. The fact that abuse as a child does not result in violence in every instance makes it no less of a cause for those who are violent as a result of it\"This concept can be applied to video games.B3 - The APA attributes that video games have the potential to cause violence in some youthsYouth who are troubled or have anger issues have been widely attributed to being triggered into versions of violence by video games [3]Some people obviously experience benefits from playing video games (including myself) and have a sense of control, but for those who do not, video games pose as an extreme risk and inevitable cause/trigger of violence. The article in which I use as a source is actually in favour of the usage of video games amongst children, as am I. However, it also attributes that video games cause violence in some adolescents. Even if the benefits of video games outweigh the negatives, video games still can be attributed as a cause of violent behavior for a significant portion of people.The article contains a wide variety of content that is rightfully \"in favour of video games\", however, since violence is the only result of video games being discussed, their statements regarding it as an effect for some people prove it to be a cause.--References--[1] - (http://dictionary.reference.com...)[2] - (http://www.apa.org...) moreso about TV violence but also applicable to video games[3] - (http://www.apa.org...)",

            "premise": "Well as my opponent has, I would like to say outstanding points have been made, I feel I may find it difficult to rebut his rebuttal. Yes as you said it is possible the understanding, or misunderstanding, of a violent video game played by a child is probable cause to violence. Again, and I apologize for constantly coming back to this, the parent is responsible not only for the games their child plays, but to help them understand through human values that violence is not only wrong, but the violence in video games is only fictional and some of the time not even possible to perform in reality. As for the 19 year old, first he is 19, an adult and almost a full-fledged one, and knows the reality of violence, not only through games, or past situations, but through his own hands. I felt obliged to look this individual up, and as said in the article, there was history of family violence between his parents, which he was quoted upon by the police. \"Police quoted Polwat as saying in a statement: \"I needed money to play the game every day. My parents give me only 100 baht a day, which is not enough. I am also fed up with them fighting. They are civil servants and do not make good money,\" he said.\" - ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk... ) So this 19 year old has had hardships in his life, family fighting, always low on money, and the assumption would be because of the lack of money, this individual would not have had decent living conditions. His reasoning was because he wanted money to buy the game. Sure he said he wanted to see if it was as easy to kill someone in real life as in the game. But the origin of the problem was money issues. He wanted money to buy the game, and as a secondary thought he figured he would try out the game in real life. I will agree with your last statement. Children should not be embellished in the acts of violence in games. You say they teach the wrong values, but aren't violent video games based off of survival of the fittest? The human mindset to be the one on top, and to not be run down? If I may not be mistaken, that is the value of almost every human being, conquer any challenge in any way possible, with or without help, through or completely void of violence. And yes, it's true that most situations do not have to be resolved through violence. More recently women have taken on many different, even important, and \"manly\" roles in video games. Sure women are depicted as sexy or provocative, but to be honest here, what female figure ANYWHERE within the media, is not shown as provocative? Movies, music artists, fashion designers, magazines, even social networking, women are depicted or even depict themselves as attractive more or less. http://www.economist.com... The above source is a reference to my below statement. It depicts the growth in the video game industry. I would like to bring up a new and final point, but it is a small one. The video game industry is huge, and growing bigger as more games are developed and new consoles and pc's are being made. As my source says, the market was worth $65 million, and has grown over 60% since 2006. If one were to remove violence completely, in other words if violence did not exist in video games what so ever, then where would the Video Game Industry be? Less jobs would be available, less money being brought to the governments, and also, the majority of video games have some form of violence in them. Be it mass killing or boxing. A recent game I have seen and played personally, called Rock of Ages, is a simple game in which you control a rock rolling down a hill. But the main objective of the game is to knock down the enemy gates and roll over the enemy \"king\". Like I said, many video games depict violence in some form, and to take that away would be like taking the meaning out of life away. Because the meaning of life is can be quite violent, and is shown not only through real life situations, but obviously in video games as well. I rest my case. I would kindly ask for my opponent to only create a rebuttal for my rebuttal, and bring up no new points unless it pertains strictly to the points i have made anywhere above, since this is the last round. Oh how I wish I made it five rounds now. Good Luck opponent, it has been pretty fun having a \"non violent\" debate! (pun intended) :)",

            "premise": "Hello and thank you for taking time to read this debate.For the purpose of clarification I will not state my intent to argue for the remainder of this debate. The Con will argue that the sale of violent video games to minors in the U.S. does not have a substantial effect on their actions and that there are other causes or reasons why young people commit violent acts.Here is my evidence.#1 - No connection between violence and games. Other causes like home life and and mental stability are the core.A PBS Report citing the findings of MIT Professor Henry Jenkins [1] \"The overwhelming majority of kids who play do NOT commit antisocial acts. According to a 2001 U.S. Surgeon General's report, the strongest risk factors for school shootings centered on mental stability and the quality of home life, not media exposure. The moral panic over violent video games is doubly harmful. It has led adult authorities to be more suspicious and hostile to many kids who already feel cut off from the system. It also misdirects energy away from eliminating the actual causes of youth violence and allows problems to continue to fester.\" As we can see per the evidence there have been numerous studies AND in fact the surgeon general telling us that the exposure to violence based on video games is a factor that leads to violence. Compare this to my opponents evidence which is unobtainable so we cannot even test the validity of the entire study. As this is my opponents argument it is the only argument I need to win to win this debate but I will go ahead and provide more evidence bellow.#2 - Violent video games are in fact core to the development of children and their decision making skills.A PBS Report citing the findings of MIT Professor Henry Jenkins [1] \"On April 19, 2002, U.S. District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr. ruled that video games do not convey ideas and thus enjoy no constitutional protection. As evidence, Saint Louis County presented the judge with videotaped excerpts from four games, all within a narrow range of genres, and all the subject of previous controversy. Overturning a similar decision in Indianapolis, Federal Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner noted: \"Violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive theme of culture both high and low. It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm, Andersen, and Perrault are aware.\" Posner adds, \"To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic, but deforming; it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.\" Many early games were little more than shooting galleries where players were encouraged to blast everything that moved. Many current games are designed to be ethical testing grounds. They allow players to navigate an expansive and open-ended world, make their own choices and witness their consequences. \"This quote is long but meaningful as it holds multiple reasons as to why children have to be exposed to violent video games. As explained, the article cites a district judge who explains why we have to protect the rights of children in exposing them to violence and thus the consequences of actions. They become as Posner writes \"The ethical testing grounds.\" and so should be accessible to children. To back up this claim the article cites Posner who justifies this exposure with reference to the violent nursery rythmes and fairytales we already tell our children. Thus if you find even the slightest moral, ethical or logical justification for exposing children to violence you vote con.#3 - Video games aren't desensitizing.A PBS Report citing the findings of MIT Professor Henry Jenkins [1] \"Classic studies of play behavior among primates suggest that apes make basic distinctions between play fighting and actual combat. In some circumstances, they seem to take pleasure wrestling and tousling with each other. In others, they might rip each other apart in mortal combat. Game designer and play theorist Eric Zimmerman describes the ways we understand play as distinctive from reality as entering the \"magic circle.\" The same action \u2014 say, sweeping a floor \u2014 may take on different meanings in play (as in playing house) than in reality (housework). Play allows kids to express feelings and impulses that have to be carefully held in check in their real-world interactions. Media reformers argue that playing violent video games can cause a lack of empathy for real-world victims. Yet, a child who responds to a video game the same way he or she responds to a real-world tragedy could be showing symptoms of being severely emotionally disturbed. \"Despite what the pro tells you, video games aren't desensitizing. As the evidence above explains, video games aren't meant to stimulate real emotional responses and thus aren't meant to show that a kid is disturbed simply because he laughs at death in a simulation. In fact they act as a release to feelings that are normally oppressed in 'reality' culture today. This answers the pro's only claim to violence and is thus a reason to vote con.#4 - Studies that conclude that violence in video games lead to more violence in kids are biased.Staff of Science 2.0 Report on the findings of Professor Patrick Kierkegaard of the University of Essex. [2]\"However, Kierkegaard explains, there is no obvious link between real-world violence statistics and the advent of video games. Despite several high profile incidents in US academic institutions, \"Violent crime, particularly among the young, has decreased dramatically since the early 1990s,\" says Kierkegaard, \"while video games have steadily increased in popularity and use. For example, in 2005, there were 1,360,088 violent crimes reported in the USA compared with 1,423,677 the year before. \"With millions of sales of violent games, the world should be seeing an epidemic of violence,\" he says, \"Instead, violence has declined.\" Research is inconclusive, emphasises Kierkegaard.\"The evidence goes a long way to win the con's because it states that really any study provided by the pro has no real world statistics to backup the nature of the findings and thus can only be limited to the theory which is invalid until there is evidence to support it.#5 - If your claim is true then why has the rise of video game sales been accompanied by a drop in violent crimes by children?Quote from Lawrence Kutner, PhD, and Cheryl K. Olson, ScD, co-founders of the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health [3]\"It\u2019s clear that the \u2018big fears\u2019 bandied about in the press - that violent video games make children significantly more violent in the real world; that children engage in the illegal, immoral, sexist and violent acts they see in some of these games - are not supported by the current research, at least in such a simplistic form. That should make sense to anyone who thinks about it. After all, millions of children and adults play these games, yet the world has not been reduced to chaos and anarchy.\"This statement and evidence is pretty damning to the case of my opponent because it poses a logical question that simply can't be answered by studies that are supposedly in support of the pro. This is because, as stated by the very qualified authors of my evidence, there has been no increase in violence even though violent video games are hot sellers. Thus there can be no conclusion for the pro because there is simply no real world proof.Thank you for your time and I look forward to my opponent's response!My Evidence (No abstract mining here)[1] - http://www.pbs.org...[2] - http://www.science20.com...[3] \"Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth about Violent Video Games\" by Lawrence Kutner, PhD, and Cheryl K.

            "premise": "In recent years the video game industry has surpassed both the music and video industries in sales. Currently violent video games are among the most popular video games played by consumers, most specifically First-Person Shooters (FPS). Technological advancements in game play experience including the ability to play online has accounted for this increase in popularity. Previous research, utilizing the General Aggression Model (GAM), has identified that violent video games increase levels of aggression. The following abstract taken from the US national library of medicine shows a direct connection between video games and aggression. Longitudinal effects of violent video games on aggression in Japan and the United States. Anderson CA, Sakamoto A, Gentile DA, Ihori N, Shibuya A, Yukawa S, Naito M, Kobayashi K. Abstract CONTEXT: Youth worldwide play violent video games many hours per week. Previous research suggests that such exposure can increase physical aggression. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether high exposure to violent video games increases physical aggression over time in both high- (United States) and low- (Japan) violence cultures. We hypothesized that the amount of exposure to violent video games early in a school year would predict changes in physical aggressiveness assessed later in the school year, even after statistically controlling for gender and previous physical aggressiveness. DESIGN: In 3 independent samples, participants' video game habits and physically aggressive behavior tendencies were assessed at 2 points in time, separated by 3 to 6 months. PARTICIPANTS: One sample consisted of 181 Japanese junior high students ranging in age from 12 to 15 years. A second Japanese sample consisted of 1050 students ranging in age from 13 to 18 years. The third sample consisted of 364 United States 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-graders ranging in age from 9 to 12 years. RESULTS. Habitual violent video game play early in the school year predicted later aggression, even after controlling for gender and previous aggressiveness in each sample. Those who played a lot of violent video games became relatively more physically aggressive. Multisample structure equation modeling revealed that this longitudinal effect was of a similar magnitude in the United States and Japan for similar-aged youth and was smaller (but still significant) in the sample that included older youth. CONCLUSIONS: These longitudinal results confirm earlier experimental and cross-sectional studies that had suggested that playing violent video games is a significant risk factor for later physically aggressive behavior and that this violent video game effect on youth generalizes across very different cultures. As a whole, the research strongly suggests reducing the exposure of youth to this risk factor. After this study established to create a direct connection between the increase of aggression and video games, we can just imagine how this dark aggression that aims at destruction and not on construction- with the easy acquisition of guns- will make school children behave at their schools. Knowing that a child spends most of his time at the school with periods of recess, this will be more than enough time for a child to participate in school shootings.",

            "premise": "This is my first debate, just a side note. I have played video games since I was very little. Gaming has become a passion of mine and I want to follow that career path. Violent games I believe are not a direct source to violence in society. First from a personal note, I have had many hardships growing up and being raised and have played violent video games throughout my lifetime. In no way has video games swayed me towards violence against anyone or anything in real life. I understand not everything has my mindset. So a couple of my points are 1- Parenting. I believe parenting is a primary source to violence. In younger years of a child's life it is up to parents to decide whether or not a child or adolescent should be playing violent video games, but whether or not that actually happens, well no one actually has control over an individual\"s parenting. Also family violence such as drug abuse, mental, and physical abuse, are the main factors to violence. 2- Reality vs. Fantasy. Some may not be able to differentiate reality from fantasy. To me, those people are more prone to violence without the aid of gaming. Many say violence in games cause people to act more violently, which in reality, if you think about it, how much of the violence in games is actually capable of being performed in real life? Infamous, for example, is about a man who can control electricity. How many people do you know can control electricity and shoot electric bolts from their hands? FPS (First Person Shooters) such as the Call of Duty or Medal of Honor series, have gun violence. Sure that is pretty realistic, but in some FPS you can't even cook a grenade, which is, in my opinion, very unrealistic. Also those particular series have a more historic and educational story line to them. The Crysis series, a FPS, involves aliens and abilities such as invisibility and suit upgrades. Sure you aim down a sight to shoot either human or alien, but still quite unrealistic. MOST people, I'm not saying all, can tell the difference from reality and fiction. I hope i have made my points clear, if not, please say so so I may go into more detail.",

            "premise": "Do video games cause violence? In a simple answer, yes. In the past 15 years, the number of gamers has gone up drastically due to both increased gaming quality and the new notions of multiplayer games, such as MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) games and simple 'LAN' games which allow you to play with a friend. Allow me to quote a news article. \"On April 20, 1999, two seniors walked into their Colorado high school carrying assault rifles, and they opened fire. They shot dozens of people, killing 12 students and one teacher, and the nation was floored. School shootings had happened before, but this was a new scope of carnage, and in the ensuing search for answers it came out the shooters had spent a lot of time playing violent video games.\" I'm sure everyone is aware that the PG rating on First Person Shooter games, or pretty much any game that contains violence or sex is literally just ink. Do people really think that kids underage pay attention to those ratings? Get with the modern world. Though it may be unfortunate, it's common knowledge that children participate in over 18 activities including not limited to these video games. It was only last year that an 8 year old shot and killed his caretaker (87 years old) after playing a particularly violent video game. It's people like that little boy who are most vulnerable to influence from video games and from adults who encourage that sort of behavior that are often encountered online. The real reason these games cause violence is because they are given to people who are sometimes mentally unhinged, and also to small children who can easily pirate them from the web. The facts state that these games are mentally damaging to many people. But the biggest problem of all lies in the age rating, because it means nothing. In fact, I'd be willing to bet children want to play those games more, to feel like a proper adult. Winning in a game is a childish notion of victory and defeat is the same. Those notions, however, have killed people in the past. That is proof enough that the games cause violence.",

Defining \"cause\"The definition of cause is so: cause |k\u00f4z| noun 1 a person or thing that gives rise to an action, phenomenon, or condition: the cause of the accident is not clear. Though I understand what my opponent is getting at, by the literal definition of \"cause\", since the video game gave rise to the actions of rage and ensuing violence; it is thus considered a 'cause' by the literal definition. Had the video game not existed, at that particular moment in time, there would have been no violence occurring, thus making video games a cause for that instance of violence. Analogy: If you whip and beat an already violent person, and that person in turn becomes even more violent, the whipping and beating still can be rightfully attributed as an associated cause of said person's violence. This concept applies here, except in a less depressing sense.Even if anger issues, bad living conditions, or etc are other causes, video games can still be attributed as one. 2. The benefits discussed here and by the APA are irrelevant to this resolutionEven if video games had extreme benefits that far outweighed it's negatives, those would be irrelevant as the topic of the debate is \"Video games cause violence\"If video games caused increased social skills in some, better reflexes in most, increased brainpower in a few, and violent or disturbed/aggressive behavior in a significant portion of the video gaming population, I still have filled my Burden of Proof that video games can be attributed as a \"cause to violence\" one way or another. 3. Legitimacy of Penn and Teller BSPenn and Teller BS is far from a reliable source and have seen large amounts of criticism for their supposed debunkings, which included concepts like Global Warming, the harmfulness of cigarettes on the body, and etc. [1]New PointA. Exposure to witnessing violence at a young age has been scientifically attributed as causing violent behavior in children later on. Why is this concept not applicable to witnessing on-screen violence?Children witnessing or having been exposed to violence has been psychologically attributed [2] to causing violence later on in their lives. Why would exposure to media violence be any different? Seeing a woman be killed and raped in front of your eyes has a detrimental effect on a child's brain development and a proven potential to prompt a violent future for that child. Why would seeing a woman be raped and killed through a television screen in games like Grand Theft Auto work any different? In fact, the AACAP recently released a study declaring that exposure to aggressive media violence has the same eventual effect that exposure to any aggressive violence may cause!

            "premise": "Science has come to a general consensus that violent TV does have an effect on kids' behavior. video games have additional reasons for concern, leading psychologists to believe that it is worse than TV. 1) video games are even more likely to affect people's behavior than TV because they're immersive. People don't just watch video games; they interact with them. 2) The games are also repetitive 3) based on a rewards system. Repetition and rewards are primary components of classical conditioning, a proved psychological concept in which behavioral learning takes place as a result of rewarding (or punishing) particular behaviors. The brains of children and teens are still developing, & are thus even more susceptible to this type of \"training.\" THE EVIDENCE: A 2001 study reported in the journal \"Psychological Science\" ( the highest ranked empirical journal in psychology) found that: \"Children who play violent video games experience an increase in physiological signs of aggression.\"[1] In 2006 at the Indiana University School of Medicine researchers found that kids who played violent game showed increased activity in the amygdala, which stimulates emotions, and decreased activity in the prefrontal lobe, which regulates inhibition, self-control and concentration. [2] The 2008 study Grand Theft Childhood reported that 60% of middle school boys that played at least one Mature-rated game hit or beat up someone, compared to 39% of boys that did not play Mature-rated games.[3] In March 2011 A study published in the afore mentioned \"Psychological Science\" found that: \"playing violent video games is associated with denying humanness to other people and Violent Video Games Increase Aggressive Behavior.\"[4] The APA: The (APA), is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States and is the world's largest association of psychologists. The following are from the APA: Article: \"Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life,\" Craig A. Anderson, Ph.D., Iowa State University of Science and Technology and Karen E. Dill, Ph.D., Lenoir-Rhyne College: Violent Video Games can Increase Aggression: \"...Video games may be more harmful than violent television and movies because of the interactive nature of the games. Playing violent video games increase a person's aggressive thoughts, feelings and behavior both in laboratory settings and in actual life. violent video games may be more harmful than violent television and movies because they are interactive, very engrossing and require the player to identify with the aggressor... ...Violent video games provide a forum for learning and practicing aggressive solutions to conflict situations,\" said Dr. Anderson. \"In the short run, playing a violent video game appears to affect aggression by priming aggressive thoughts. Longer-term effects are likely to be longer lasting as well, as the player learns and practices new aggression-related scripts that can become more and more accessible for use when real-life conflict situations arise... ...One major concern is the active nature of the learning environment of the video game,\" say the authors. \"This medium is potentially more dangerous than exposure to violent television and movies, which are known to have substantial effects on aggression and violence...\"[5] \"Two studies examined violent video game effects on aggression-related variables. Study 1 found that real-life violent video game play was positively related to aggressive behavior and delinquency... Academic achievement was negatively related to overall amount of time spent playing video games. In Study 2, laboratory exposure to a graphically violent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. The results from both studies are consistent with the General Affective Aggression Model, which predicts that exposure to violent video games will increase aggressive behavior in both the short term (e.g., laboratory aggression) and the long term (e.g., delinquency)... ...Violent video games provide a forum for learning and practicing aggressive solutions to conflict situations. The effect of violent video games appears to be cognitive in nature. In the short term, playing a violent video game appears to affect aggression by priming aggressive thoughts. Longer-term effects are likely to be longer lasting as well, as the player learns and practices new aggression-related scripts that become more and more accessible for use when real-life conflict situations arise. If repeated exposure to violent video games does indeed lead to the creation and heightened accessibility of a variety of aggressive knowledge structures, thus effectively altering the person's basic personality structure, the consequent changes in everyday social interactions may also lead to consistent increases in aggressive affect. The active nature of the learning environment of the video game.\" [6] \"Research shows playing violent video games increases aggressive behavior and decreases helpful behavior...\" [7] From APA's Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media: \"...Exposure to violent media increases feelings of hostility, thoughts about aggression... Comprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure a.) increases aggressive behavior, b.) increases aggressive thoughts, c.) increases angry feelings, d.) decreases helpful behavior, and, e.) increases physiological arousal (Anderson, C.A., 2002b; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N. L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A. J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J. C., 2004; Anderson, C.A., & Dill, K. E., 2000; Bushman, B.J., & Anderson, C.A., 2002; Gentile, D. A., Lynch, P. J., Linder, J. R., & Walsh, D. A., 2004). Studies further suggest that sexualized violence in the media has been linked to increases in violence towards women, rape myth acceptance and anti-women attitudes. The characteristics of violence in interactive video games appear to have similar detrimental effects as viewing television violence; however based upon learning theory (Bandura, 1977; Berkowitz, 1993), the practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films (Carll, E. K., 1999a). With With the development of more sophisticated interactive media, such as virtual reality, the implications for violent content are of further concern, due to the intensification of more realistic experiences, and may also be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior than passively watching violence on TV and in films (Calvert, S. L., Jordan, A. B., Cocking, R. R. (Ed.) 2002; Carll, E. K., 2003; Turkle, S., 2002); and studies further suggest that videogames influence the learning processes in many ways more than in passively observing TV: a.) requiring identification of the participant with a violent character while playing video games, b.) actively participating increases learning, c.) rehearsing entire behavioral sequences rather than only a part of the sequence, facilitates learning, and d.) repetition increases learning (Anderson, C.A., 2002b; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N. L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A. J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J. C., 2004; Anderson, C.A. & Dill, K. E., 2000)...\" [8] [1] http://www.apa.org... [2] http://www.soc.iastate.edu...

            "premise": "Hello, 16kadams! I will argue for the case that violent video games do not cause increased aggressive behavior. The burden of proof is on pro; pro is arguing for the contention. == 1. The supposed link is unclear == P1. If there is a clear link between violent video games and violence, pro meets his burden of proof. P2. There is no clear link between violent video games and violence. C. Pro does not meet his burden of proof. Justification for Premise 2: While there are some studies which supposedly demonstrate a link between violence and violent video games, some recent studies suggest that this is not the case: real life environments are different than experimental environments in terms of how they influence people. Research has shown that sometimes violent media correlates with more violence; however, during other time periods, the influence inverts. This shows that the relation between the two is most likely correlation, and not causation. (http://www.sciencedaily.com...) == 2. Violence has been going down, despite the rising popularity of video games == P1. If video games cause violence, then increased popularity of violent video games would increase violence. P2. Violence is decreasing, yet the popularity of violent video games is increasing. C. Video games do not cause violence. Justification for premise 2: despite the fact that the popularity of video games increased between 1990 and 2010, the crime rates actually dropped. (https://commons.wikimedia.org...)(http://www.bjs.gov...) This shows that there is a lack of correlation between the popularity of violent video games and crime rates. By the way, for my case to work, the popularity of video games should have increased over the past years; this is indeed demonstrated by the fact that the video game industry grows by around 16.7% annually.

            "premise": "Glad to hear that you're new here too. Considering how new I am, sorry for any errors in my argument. When looking at whether video games make children violent, first we must establish what people mean when they say 'violent'. The Merriam Webster Dictionary gives it as: 1: marked by extreme force or sudden intense activity 2 a : notably furious or vehement b : extreme, intense, 3: prone to commit acts of violence Here I am editing out some definitions that do not relate to the topic at hand. I am particularly looking at the third definition, as many have attributed video games to school shooting, saying that violent video games actually influence them enough to do something of the sort. That, in my perception, would be making someone prone to committing acts of violence. Is this possible? While studies show that people may feel more aggression while playing a violent game and shortly after, there has never been proof that there are long term psychological effects. In fact, studies show that video games can actually make you smarter. That action gamers, which I take to be games in the first-person-shoot genre(Not limited to such, just an example.) which would be a violent game.From 1995 to 2008, violent video game popularity has skyrocketed, while the number of violent crimes have lowered by almost 50%. If video games are truly a source of violence for children, then why aren't there MORE shootings? Why don't we have more armed robberies? Considering how many people play games like Call of Duty daily, you would think the number would be much higher. As The Washington Post's Max Fisher wrote: \"In fact, countries where video game consumption is highest tend to be some of the safest countries in the world, likely a product of the fact that developed or rich countries, where consumers can afford expensive games, have on average much less violent crime\". That concludes my argument, I can't wait to see yours. http://www.merriam-webster.com... http://www.thewire.com... http://videogames.procon.org...",

Don\u2019t just come here and bring out this conviction that everything in all caps means yelling. Submitting into that conclusion is vacuous.) Violence and Aggression are closely akin Just because you acknowledged something to be true doesn\u2019t really make it so. So, that comes to show that your affirmation is biased. You\u2019re saying that just because you\u2019re showing some sort of aggression that just means that you\u2019re bound to go out and commit violence. I\u2019m pretty sure you have heard of the term \u201chot head.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure that the vast majority of these hot heads out here have not committed a single crime in their lives. My dad can sometimes be a hot head, and he has never done anything wrong. Since you claim that my source that I used is \u201cbiased\u201d, let\u2019s use another one. According to the Scholastic website, it says, \u201cViolence is heterogeneous. Physical violence can be impulsive, reactive or defensive; or it can be predatory, remorseless aggression\u2026 \u201cAggression is NOT VIOLENCE. An aggressive person may not be violent. Aggression is a behavior characterized by verbal or physical attack, yet it may be appropriate and self-protective or destructive and violent.\u201d (http://teacher.scholastic.com......) Also, just because I didn\u2019t refute against a certain part of your rebuttals doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not challenging you on it. It\u2019s apparent that you didn\u2019t take into consideration that I often run out of characters to type. I would also like to point out that the Bandura Ross & Ross case uses children of the age of 3 TO 6 YEARS OLD. THAT IS NOT A PROPER AGE GROUP TO USE AGAINST A COMMUNITY THAT MOSTLY CONSISTS OF AGES OF 12+. Therefore, your case is completely invalid. (http://www.simplypsychology.org...) Effects of video games on violence are psychologically proven From where? Of course, I use movies and other forms of entertainment to support my reasoning. You know why? It\u2019s because they have the exact same entertainment value and influence aggression just like you claim video games do. Gaming is so popular; it\u2019s basically renowned as a sport now. (http://en.wikipedia.org......). It\u2019s also apparent that you did not read all of my arguments because I\u2019m obviously refuting against you when I\u2019m saying that your objection is erroneous. Anyway: According to Former FBI Profiler, Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole, she states that \u201cvideo games DO NOT cause violence.\u201d She also says that \u201cindividuals who were already contemplating in acting out in a violent way, if they are also emerged 24/7 in violent videos to the exclusion of other activities; and they\u2019re isolated and they\u2019re actually using these videos as planning or collateral evidence in terms of how to do it better, what equipment to buy, how to select the victims, how to approach the crime scene\u201d, etc. \u201cIf their use is educational material for the offender to do the crime better, that\u2019s what we take into CONSIDERATION.\u201d What she\u2019s saying is these \u201cresearchers\u201d and \u201cprofessionals\u201d don\u2019t take in other factors into account. They just blatantly look at video games and don\u2019t search for other factors like mental health, the significance or insignificance of parental guidance, his/her social environment, school/work, etc. Still quoting, \u201cAs a threat assessment and as a Former FBI Profiler, WE DO NOT SEE THESE AS THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE. WE SEE THEM AS SOURCES OF FUELING IDEATION THAT\u2019S ALREADY THERE.\u201d That means that the individual who is convinced by violence didn\u2019t submit to it because he played X, Y, and Z. He capitulated to the desire of violence on his/her accordance. I mean, what else is there for me to provide as evidence. The FBI contradicts this claim; millions of gamers all over the world discredit this claim, the SUPREME COURT points out that the research that supports the claim is \u201cINCONSISTENT\u201d and \u201cFLAWED\u201d says Chris Ferguson. Thank you Mr. Ferguson. Seriously, this fallacious claim doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. (https://www.youtube.com......) According to TomoNews US, a recent study conducted more than a month ago has displayed another factor that ignites aggression (NOT VIOLENCE). This factor has shown to be the controls of games, not the game itself. This study was conducted in the University of Oxford and the University of Rochester. They took the game Half-Life 2 and modified the entire game with the help of some programmers. They discarded the blood and gore and scrabbled the controls. Their results had shown that the players who were playing with the shooting and violence showed no aggression at all. Meanwhile, the players became easily aggressive because of the absurd controls even though there wasn\u2019t any gore or shooting taking place at all. This relates to aggression being caused by competition. It occurs very frequently, and like I said, it\u2019s human nature. When something doesn\u2019t work, we get frustrated. When we\u2019re trying to win at something, and something occurs that deters us from winning, of course, we will flip out. (https://www.youtube.com......) (http://venturebeat.com......) (https://www.youtube.com......) (Warning about the video: I\u2019m not saying that gun laws should be blamed totally. It can be, but I really don\u2019t care about it for right now. What everyone needs to realize is that parenting and/or mental instability is the #1 issue here.) (http://www.theesa.com......) You have also failed to glance at the similarities between these two forms of entertainment. THEY BOTH CONTAIN MATURE CONTENT SUCH AS GORE, SEX, AND PROFANTIY. THEY BOTH HAVE CONTENT RATINGS. Just because these two things have that one little difference, don\u2019t just come out here and say, since they have a small difference, you can\u2019t use it as a source. That ideology is absurd. The General Aggression Model has expounded the case of violence Okay, first of all, Aristotle\u2019s theory of gravity has been proven wrong by Galileo. Second of all, just because I said it\u2019s outdated that doesn\u2019t mean that old principles should not be used. That just comes to show that you don\u2019t even know what the word \u201coutdated\u201d means. Outdated, according to Webster, means \u201cno longer of use or unacceptable.\u201d (http://www.merriam-webster.com......). That means that when something is proven wrong, it is no longer of use and it\u2019s obsolete. I will correct myself upon saying that the GAM is outdated even though I didn\u2019t directly say it is. However, the G.A.M still doesn\u2019t provide evidence that video games cause violent crimes. You see, according to Oxford, (Man, I love Oxford for bringing me so much evidence.) \u201cbriefly, the model shows how factors in the IMMEDIATE SITUATION (such as being insulted while in front of friends, and having just played a violent video game) combine with factors that people bring with them to the situation (such as positive attitudes towards using aggression, impulsive personality, and a habit of taking slights too personally) to produce an internal set of aggression-related thoughts and feelings that are likely to yield aggressive behavior.\u201d That comes into showing that the aggression shown in video games is SHORT TERM like I said. (http://www.oxfordscholarship.com......) Children inevitably imitates aggression, resorting to violence without supervision Basically, what you\u2019re saying is \u201cMonkey see, monkey do.\u201d Yes, children imitate things, but you still haven\u2019t taken into account that the parent is the one responsible for teaching their child right from wrong. What do you think parents are there for? Just to sit there and watch the kids? Even though that\u2019s what some parents do, that\u2019s not what the duties of what the parents are held accountable for. This \u201cstudy\u201d that you used has nothing to do with video games at all. It sounds like this study was conducted by children by a very young age. You did not refute that parents are responsible for telling their children that it\u2019s wrong to do this. It\u2019s wrong to do that. So, what\u2019s your point? I mean, I can\u2019t refute everything while bring out a hundred sources at once. There\u2019s a character limit on here you know. Crime rate interpretations by opponents of the resolution are fantasy What? I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re refuting against here. So, the information that I\u2019ve clearly given that\u2019s from the FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION and the BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS is \u201cfantasy\u201d? That\u2019s just an excuse because the facts are there and it shows that the correlation between video games and violence is non-existent. If it was, then don\u2019t you think crime rates would actually increase? But, it doesn\u2019t. I mean, the graph you just showed me proves it. Look, the trends of video game sales and federal offenses are NEARLY PERPENDICULAR. It doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. Con's parental argument provides no guarantee This rebut is totally wrong because, according to an article at Vision.org, they say that Parental Guidance is a crucial factor in child development. Also, I have cited other sources earlier that say so. (http://www.vision.org......) Let's be mathematical here 70% of the world population are gamers. There are 7.2 billion people on Earth. So, that's 5.04 billion people. That's a lot isn't it? So, lets say there were 15 gamers were found committing violence. Okay, that just makes 0.000000003% of gamers affected by violence. Okay, let's make 100 gamers committing violence. Okay, good for you, you've discovered that 0.00000002% are affected. Don't you see that it is insufficient? How can you come in here and try to prove to me that WAY LESS THAN 1% of something is valid? How can you come in here and say that video games cause violence when it actually has declined? Trying to prove that less than 1% of something to me is like trying to prove that ants can beat humans. Don't forget that I'm not saying that video games don't cause violence at all Video games are just a small factor out of MANY others that contribute to violence. Mental state and the environment they're in contribute to violence the most.",

            "premise": "Arguments4. If video games do cause violence and if it said that the government wants to ban violent games, then they might as well ban professional sports as well. You know? Sports that are extremely popular worldwide?Banning video games because they cause violence,but not ban soccer, hockey, basketball, and football? All the time, there\u2019s an altercation between players in hockey, and the referees stand there, letting them fight each other until it gets out of control. It\u2019s the same thing with basketball and football except it doesn\u2019t happen very frequently and the referees don\u2019t watch them fight. According to an article at Mandatory.com, \u201cThe most popular spectator sport in the world (where most countries call it \u201cfootball\u201d), soccer has incited riots and insane acts of brutality that beat anything football or basketball has to offer.\u201d Referee Decapitated, Brazil (2013) \u2013 An article at Deadspin.com has shown that Brazilian soccer fans beheaded a soccer referee after he stabs and kills a player. Quoting: \u201cLast Sunday, an amateur soccer match in Brazil came to an unbelievably gruesome end when a referee was murdered by outraged fans. His head was then cut off and placed on a spike. The beheading was retaliation; the ref initially stabbed a player to death. It happened in the Maranh\u00e3o region of northeastern Brazil. Thirty-year-old Josenir dos Santos Abreu approached the referee, 20-year-old Ot\u00e1vio Jord\u00e3o da Silva (pictured above) during a match to argue a call. Abreu reportedly threw a punch at da Silva, who then took out a knife he was carrying with him during the match, and stabbed the player. Abreu died of his wounds en route to the hospital. Meanwhile, the player's friends and family invaded the pitch and attacked da Silva. They reportedly tied up the referee, beat him, stoned him, lynched him, and then quartered him. When they finished, they cut off his head and placed it on a stake in the center of the field. So far, just one man, 27-year-old Luis Moraes Souza, has been arrested for the crime, and authorities are searching for two more. Valter Costa, the chief of police in Maranh\u00e3o's town of Santa Ines, spoke in a statement. \u201cReports of witnesses have indicated some people that were in place at the time of the fact,\" he said. \"We will identify and hold accountable all those involved. A crime will never justify another. Actions like this do not collaborate with the legality of a state law.\u201dKayseri Stadium Riot, Turkey (1967) \u2013 Using source #1, the article says, \u201cSoccer violence isn\u2019t a modern invention \u2013 fans and players have been doling out the brutality for at least half a century. One of the most insane post-game riots of all time happened in Turkey, at Kayseri Ataturk Stadium. The first league match between Kayseri and Sivas brought 21,000 fans to the stadium, and as the game went on they grew increasingly upset, bombarding Sivas fans with rocks and bricks. The visiting team fans surged to flee the stadium, only to be repulsed by police. Forty people were crushed to death in the melee, with at least 300 more wounded. The game was cancelled, and Sivas supporters hit the streets of Kayseri and destroyed the city\u2019s gym along with over 60 automobiles, burning every car that had a Sivas license plate.\u201dThe list goes on and on and on. There\u2019s a list of altercations in sporting events on Wikipedia. Of course, you wouldn\u2019t say that sports are a primary source of violence would you? You wouldn\u2019t come out here and say just because fights occur in sports, that means that sports cause violent acts right? Yeah, didn\u2019t think so. So, why would the media just come out and blatantly state that \u201cvideo games cause violence.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. So, it is unfair to blame video games for the violence matter while sports, films, and music lyrics (specifically rap) have the exact same basis if not a greater basis of violence. Evidence supporting the \u201cvideo game causes violence\u201d has been debunked as well. RebuttalsCountering: \"Violence and Aggression are Closely Akin\"Well, yes, agression does sometimes cause violence, but you didn't put in its correct form. You see, what you're saying is that just because a person shows an act of agression, that just comes down to him inevitably committing violence; however, that is incorrect. There is a difference between physically performing a violent act such as hitting, destorying one's property, kicking, killing, etc and thinking agressively. Thinking aggressive thoughts is not the same as violence. Of course, I'm pretty sure you've felt this way before. You've felt the need to physically beat up someone before or break something for whatever reaons. Everyone has. It's human nature. It's one of our natural emotions, anger. Anger is the\"strong feeling of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility\". Anger is not the same as violence. I've found a websites that states that there is a difference between anger, violence, and agression.- http://www.humankinetics.com...(\"Not all violence comes from anger and reactive aggression. Violence has, at its root, harm to another as its planned result.\")Countering: \"Effects of video games on violence are psychologically proven\" and \"The General Aggression Model have expounded the case for violence\"This argument is so errenous for multiple reasons:1. Just becuse more people prefer violent video games doesn't really mean that video games cause violence. I can say the exact same thing for movies. I can probably say that the majority of movie watchers out here prefer to watch violent entertainment, yet you don't see people killing people primarilybecause they watched X, Y, and Z. According to an article atibnlive.in.com, researchers all over the world have stated that a wide statistic of movie watchers watch gory movies and why they do it. If you read the article, it says, \"Some types of violent portrayals seem to attract audiences because they promise to satisfy truth-seeking motivations by offering meaningful insights into some aspect of the human condition.\"2. The \"research\" and \"studies\" that you used are outdated and they have been DEBUNKED long ago.\"According to an article at PBS.org, they list 10 video game facts that have been debunked long ago. If you actually look at it, the verysecond debunked fact is, \"Scientific evidence links violent game play with youth aggression.\" (http://www.pbs.org...)The most recent and most in depth study on this matter ever conducted was from Chris Ferguson which has stated that the past studies \"relies on measures to assess aggression that don't correlate with real-world violence. Some studies are observational and don't prove cause and effect.\"General Aggression Model: I can see what this model is saying. You see, what this model is correlating to is short term violence. Yes, sometimes long term violence can possibly be present, but 99.999999999% of the time will probably be short term. You see gamers getting angry and they blow off that anger for 10-15 minutes. I don't think this model correctly follows the scenario when gamers play games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, Mortal Kombat, etc. You see, this diagram is saying that people become aggressive and violent because of it's surroundings. However, most of the time, that's not the case. People get angry and frustrated because of the challenge and the competitiveness of games. Most likely, I never hear or see a player get angry because he's looking at blood. How does that make sense? I can say the exact same thing for sports again. I'm pretty sure you've seen coaches yelling at his players have you? Do you know why he's yelling? He's yelling and showing aggression because it's that competiveness that drives him into yelling. He wants to win. He wants to bring the best out ofhis team. Is that the same asviolence? There's nothing wrong with getting stressed because of comepetition and challenge.It's nature.But, again, don't get it twisted. Having an aggressive cognition is not the same as committing to the violent act itself. That's just plain common sense.According to another article from Kataku, \"It's Video Game Competition, Not Violence, That Sparks Aggression\" Countering \"Children inevitably imitates aggression, resorting to violence without supervision\"You've indirectly just proven my point because video games shouldn't take the blame. It's the parent's fault. They lack the supervision and guidance from parents and they are being notresponsible for taking care of their child. What people have failed to realize in this debate is that parental guidance is the #1 factor that determines the child's development throughout his/her life. If that factor is non-existent or lacking, then the child will feel that there are no consequences. This is where this \"I can do whatever I want\" mentality comes from. Yes, children imitates aggression, but it's the parent's responsiblity to teach their child the difference between right from wrong.

            "premise": "Thank you for your quick response. My opponent's attack on evidence is contradictory to his position in this debate as each attack supports my position of the topic. \"does not take into account the fact that participants who are predisposed to be violent or have violent tendencies will have an increased reaction violent video games because of the familiarity of the situations and the association between real world past and the games.\" This is supportive to my case as it shows that violent video games have the tendency of rapidly amplifying an individuals violent acts. Finally, the study does not have to incorporated these aspects of the link between violence and video game, rather it does have to accurately describe \"A\" link between violence and video game-which it does.- \"The first was observed aggression such as participants pushing shoving ect ect. These measures are extremely subjective due to the fact that aggression is not always such an outward display and most people who resort to these kind of emotional outbursts exhibit anti social behavior which is the root cause of their problems.\" Could it be possible that Anti-social behavior could be another effect of video games? The answer being an absolute yes. Immense amounts of studies have shown that kids often get use to the violence in games even enjoy these violence. Now at first, this kid might play these games for fun, but over a period of time, they start to crave these games thus leading to unusual amounts of time spent playing these games. This can be seen as a form or rather a remedial stage pf anti-social behavior which as time goes on progresses. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry wrote in an Aug. 2006 article \"Children and Video Games: Playing with Violence\" published in their Facts for Families information sheet series: \"These data suggest very strongly that participating in the playing of violent video games by children and youth increase aggressive thought and behavior; increase antisocial behavior and delinquency; engender poor school performance; desensitize the game player to violence.\" http://videogames.procon.org... \"These traits are swell much closely correlated with children who exhibit anti social behavior as well as children who have a lack of attention in their lives. With both these problems excessive video game playing could be seen as an escape or a way for kids to distract themselves from their own life.\" These traits are not an excuse to sell violent video games to minors. The fact is that if these kids were as unstable as you describe them to be, then supplying them with violent video games is much like the government giving crack to a homicidal crack head. There are many games within there age level that can and possible will keep them preoccupied. \"The final measurement of aggressive behavior is reported aggression. This is extremely unethical and due to the fact that each participant will have different peers and teachers(study used reports from teachers on aggression) also the logical connection can be made that teachers will find students more aggressive if they are socially awkward and exhibit anti social behaviors. In many cases this will also cause teachers to think less of students do to the frustration and unwillingness to cooperate with authority which anti social people tend to exhibit\" Ones again, this should not be an excuse to sell games to minors. Rather than encouraging them to do something that can be hazardous to there mental as well as physical being, we should encourage them to seek valuable resources. VOTERS:You should vote for me, because unlike my opponent, i have argued based on the topic itself and not based on the evidence provided. 2. I presented more evidence to support my case 3. My opponent not only failed to make a case, but also failed to refute any of my argument 4. I have offered good reasons as to why a ban on selling video games to minors is a bad idea. Thank you.",

            "premise": "My position is rather easy to prove \u2013 I need only make the case that video games teach children how to be violent, not that they actually induce violent behavior. Luckily the psychiatric community has done several experiments that speak for themselves. Lab experiments confirm what any gamer knows in his gut: playing games like \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d \u201cKillzone 3\u201d or \u201cBattlefield 3\u201d stirs the blood. In one recent study, Christopher Barlett, a psychologist at Iowa State University, led a research team that had 47 undergraduates play \u201cMortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance\u201d for 15 minutes. Afterward, the team took various measures of arousal, both physical and psychological. It also tested whether the students would behave more aggressively, by having them dole out hot sauce to a fellow student who, they were told, did not like spicy food but had to swallow the sauce. Sure enough, compared with a group who had played a nonviolent video game, those who had been engaged in \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d were more aggressive across the board. They gave their fellow students significantly bigger portions of the hot sauce.

There appears to be evidence that exposure to violent media increases feelings of hostility, thoughts about aggression, suspicions about the motives of others, and demonstrates violence as a method to deal with potential conflict situations; and perpetrators go unpunished in 73% of all violent scenes, and therefore teach that violence is an effective means of resolving conflict. Comprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure a.) increases aggressive behavior, b.) increases aggressive thoughts, c.) increases angry feelings, d.) decreases helpful behavior, and, e.) increases physiological arousal. Studies further suggest that videogames influence the learning processes in many ways more than in passively observing TV: a.) requiring identification of the participant with a violent character while playing video games, b.) actively participating increases learning, c.) rehearsing entire behavioral sequences rather than only a part of the sequence, facilitates learning, and d.) repetition increases learning.

            "premise": "To start off, I would like to resolve an issue that I knew would be a problem even before this debate started. Noting the comments, you can see that people are already siding with CON on this topic mainly because they play violent video games also. Yes they're fun, I personally enjoy such video games. I am only discouraging violent video games for the practice in future debates and for this school project I'm doing right now. I know a fair amount of people in my school who play them also. I would like to ask those of you judging and voting, to vote based on how we debate rather than your own biased opinion. This for a school project and I really appreciate it. Thanks! With that cleared up, I would like to address his argument he made then move on from there. My opponent stated: \u201cstores take precautions for selling games to young minds.\" In response to this, I would like to state that my opponent\u2019s arguments have no ground to stand on. there are tons of arguments out on the Internet to attack our case so far, we haven't seen any attacks on our arguments yet. His arguments are based entirely on personal views of what he thinks. im basically saying that i would like you to challenge me a bit more. To debate, you need evidence which have provided. So yes, there are warning on the back of the case and the choice is yours. But often times those warnings are ignored. How old is the average high schooler? 13-16 right? Rarely are they ever 17 until they are seniors. Most violent video games are rated M for Mature 17+. So the warnings are being ignored. People are purchasing violent video games at younger and younger ages. I was at the redbox just last week when I saw probably a 11 year old renting Black Ops 2, a rated M game. Thirteen years ago (2000) was the low point: 85% of minors were able to purchase an M-rated game. So warnings being ignored results in children being exposed to violence at a much younger age. With buying and renting violent video games being easier and easier to get, we need to see that not only are the children of our generation suffering from it, but violence is rising because of it and I will go into that in my next argument. About 90 percent of U.S. kids ages 8 to 16 play video games, and they spend about 13 hours a week doing so (more if you're a boy). Now a new study suggests virtual violence in these games may make kids more aggressive in real life. Kids in both the U.S. and Japan who reported playing lots of violent video games had more aggressive behavior months later than their peers who did not, according to the study, which appears in the November issue of the journal Pediatric. \"It's not the violence per se that's the problem, it's the context and goals of the violence,\" said Olson, citing past research on TV violence and behavior. Olson is right. Imagine the goals of he violence. Rewards for killing people, shooting people, and doing drugs? In most games you are rewarded with money or points the more you kill. So in a game, the more you kill, the better you do. Do we really want youngsters being exposed to this? No, We don\u2019t. For my opponents first attack, he said that playing violent video games sharpens your skills in the military. First off, no it doesn\u2019t. Video games support you to rush into a situation and be a \u201cHero\u201d. Imagine doing such in a real life scenario. In all actuality, if you catch a bullet in real life, your down and its basically a real life \u2018Game Over.\u2019 No respawn or second chance. So sharpening your skills for real life situations? Not one bit. His second argument he made was that young minds cannot purchase violent games. Ive already proved otherwise and all my arguments still stand seeing how no attacks have been made.

            "premise": "Do Violent Video Games Increase Aggression? Studies have shown that playing violent video games can increase aggressive thoughts, Behaviors, And feelings in both the short-term and long-term. Violent video games can also desensitize people to seeing aggressive behavior and decrease prosocial behaviors such as helping another person and feeling empathy (the ability to understand others). The longer that individuals are exposed to violent video games, The more likely they are to have aggressive behaviors, Thoughts, And feelings. These effects have been seen in studies in both Eastern and Western countries. Although males spend more time than females playing violent video games, Violent video game exposure can increase aggressive thoughts, Behaviors, And feelings in both sexes. The analysis of 24 studies from countries including the U. S. , Canada, Germany and Japan found those who played violent games such as \"Grand Theft Auto, \" \"Call of Duty\" and \"Manhunt\" were more likely to exhibit behavior such as being sent to the principal's office for fighting or hitting a non-family member. \"Although no single research project is definitive, Our research aims to provide the most current and compelling responses to key criticisms on this topic, \" said Jay Hull, Lead author of the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"Based on our findings, We feel it is clear that violent video game play is associated with subsequent increases in physical aggression, \" said Hull, Associate dean of faculty for the social sciences at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, And the Dartmouth Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Video game violence has been a hot-button issue for more than a decade. Interest in research on video games' potential for violence increased after it was learned Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, The two teenagers who committed the Columbine High School shooting, Played the first-person shooting computer game \"Doom. \" But in a 2011 Supreme Court decision overturning California's ban on the sale of violent video games to minors, The late Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed a link between the games and aggression. \"These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, And with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively, \" he wrote in the majority opinion. Since then, An American Psychological Association task force report in 2015 found a link between violent video games and increased aggression in players but insufficient evidence that violent games lead to criminal violence. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump convened a video game summit a month after the February shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Prior to that meeting, Trump said, \"I\"m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people\"s thoughts. \" The Dartmouth researchers sought to reduce confusion about research findings \" including disputes about the association between violent games and aggression \" with a finely structured meta-analysis. Those in the study who played violent games, Whether frequently or infrequently, Had an increase risk of aggressive behavior. The new research echoes Hull's previous finding that playing violent games equates to about twice the risk of being sent to the principal\"s office for fighting during an eight-month period, He said. A separate 2014 study he oversaw of violent video games in 2, 000 families is one of the 24 included in the meta-analysis. The effect is \"relatively small, But statistically reliable. The effect does exist, \" Hull said. While there's not research suggesting violent video games lead to criminal behavior, Hull's previous research suggests players may practice riskier behaviors such as reckless driving, Binge drinking, Smoking and unsafe sex. \"A lot of people ask, Do these games really cause these kids to behave aggressively? I would say that is one possibility, \" he said. \"The other possibility is that it's a really bad sign. If your kids are playing these games, Either these games are having a warping effect on right and wrong or they have a warped sense of right or wrong and that\"s why they are attracted to these games. Either way you should be concerned about it. \" Aggressive behavior is measured by scientists in a number of ways. Some studies looked at self-reports of hitting or pushing, And some looked at peer or teacher ratings on aggressive behaviors. Other studies looked at how likely an individual was to subject others to an unpleasant exposure to hot sauce or a loud noise after playing violent video games. Unfortunately, Few studies have been completed on violent video game exposure and aggression in children under age 10. There is also little information about the impact of violent video game exposure on minority children. There have not been many studies on the effects of different characteristics of video games, Such as perspective or plot. However, Some studies have found that competition among players in video games is a better predictor of aggressive behavior than is the level of violence Do Violent Video Games Increase Violence? Violence is a form of aggression, But not all aggressive behaviors are violent. Very few studies have looked at whether playing violent video games increases the chances of later delinquency, Criminal behavior, Or lethal violence. Such studies are difficult to conduct, And require very large numbers of children. It makes sense that since playing violent video games tends to increase the level of aggressive behavior it would also results in more lethal violence or other criminal behaviors, But there is no clear evidence to support that assumption. Policy In the aftermath of the Parkland shooting in Florida in 2018, Policymakers are again questioning the influence of violent video games. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) affirms that their rating system is effective, But the APA Task Force on Violent Media recommends that the ESRB revise their rating system to make the level of violence clearer. The Task Force also recommends that further research must be done using delinquency, Violence, And criminal behavior as outcomes to determine whether or not violent video games are linked to violence. Bottom Line Studies show that they make children more violent.",

A study and discussion by the American Medical Association discussed the fact that video game addiction (VGA) was a real and prominent issue in the health of many Americans.\"Soon after the meeting that the AMA had in 2007, they retracted their statement on the matter, and many addiction experts were strongly against the notion that video game addiction should be considered a real addiction. (Sources: http://uk.reuters.com..., http://www.theguardian.com...)\"Video games > Video game addiction > stress, depression, and mental health issues > domestic violence.\"I must point out an issue in this reasoning. This statement you have made make the impression that you think that video game addiction leads to stress, depression, and mental health issues. In fact, many experts believe that stress is a major factor leading to video game addiction (and a big one too). (Source: http://www.healthxchange.com.sg...)\"I will argue that violence in games normalizes violence in real life and teaches children, teenagers, and adults the basics of shooting\"Many studies have also shown that violent video games do not desensitize kids and those most liable to have their minds altered. The studies would show kids who play non-violent and violent games different pictures, some showing graphic scenes (like a man holding a gun to a woman's head). The subjects would have their reactions to the photos monitored and recorded. They found that there was no difference between the violent game players' and non-violent game players' reactions. Many kids recognize and respect the boundaries between the virtual and real world, and would not cross them when it comes to violence. (Sources: http://health.usnews.com..., http://gamepolitics.com...)As to the specific cases, there is no proof that Adam Lanza, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, and other mass murderers like them were influenced by video games.Studies have shown that many video games can be calming, and that huge amounts of people use video games to calm down and relax. They see it as a way to escape the harsh realizations of reality and to enjoy themselves. The cases of violence related to video games are minuscule in number, and usually are more because the perpetrator has a mental illness than because of the video games themselves.May I wish you good luck, and Merry Christmas!",

My response to that is \"exactly\". Due to the fact that the child does not understand the violence, he or she is more likely to think that his kind of behavior is okay. Mostly because, as you have stated, they do not understand he violence, or how it is wrong. I can also give many examples in which children have commited acts of violence due to a video game. One for example,On August 2, 2008, Polwat Chinno, a 19-year-old Thai teenager, stabbed a Bangkok taxi driver to death during an attempt to steal the driver's cab in order to obtain money to buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV. A police official said that the teen was trying to copy a similar act in the game. Another thing I forgot to point out. is that some video games teach kids the wrong values. Violent behavior, vengeance and aggression are rewarded. Negotiating and other nonviolent solutions are OFTEN not options. Women are often portrayed as weaker characters that are helpless or sexually provocative, is this the kind of stuff you want a small child playing?",

            "premise": "Hello once more, Before getting on to rebutting the points stated previously, I would like to add my arguments to the mix. In this instance, I am often addressing more violent video games, as they are included in the topic and pose the greatest threat and significance to my debate. First, let's look at some actual, hard evidence. There has been a task force report released by the American Psychological Association on August the 13th, 2015, stating that there is a \"definite link to increases aggression in children who play violent video games.\" This statement clearly speaks volumes for itself. Not much else has been concluded, but there is a lot more research to be done and knowledge to be gained. Source: http://www.apa.org... Another argument to the negative affects of video games is that they cause desensitization to individuals. Multiple studies have proved that those who regularly play violent video games experience a reduction in emotion-related physiological reactivity to real violence. They come to accept violence rather than be overly repulsed or reactive to it. Surely, this highlights the negative and violent affects of certain video games. Even if you choose not to accept violent video games are the sole cause of violent behavior, it is clear that it is a large factor. Along with the increased aggression produced in people who play video games, players often watch their character perform violent acts with little or no punishment for them. If anything, violent video games could easily be considered something that nurtures violent and possibly harmful impulses. It has actually been shown by the FBI that many perpetrators of mass shootings played violent video games often. Is it a mere coincidence, or could violent video games have induced those horrible acts of violence? Would all of those offender's behaviors been affected by symptoms shown in some of the arguments above? Another point is that violent video games are more harmful than television shows, comics and other things of the like as they depict you; or a virtual version of you, performing those violent acts. It makes it all too easy to picture oneself doing violent things is if one has already done them in an alternate reality, with no punishment (referring to earlier argument mentioned). Yet one more argument to point out is that video games often promote violence as a suitable resolution to various conflicts. Rather than simulating talking problems out in a civilized manner, the cause and effect flow on from an altercation is usually violence or warfare of some sort. What is this teaching the players, if not violence? I will further these points in the later rounds, as well as rebut the opposing arguments. To my opponent, good luck in your rebuttals and the rest of the debate. Thank you.",

One gamer was asked if they liked violent video games, his response was \" Yes because I have started to feel the urge to practice my sniper skills for real.\" A child who plays violent video games starts looking at the world as a dangerous place where violence and aggression are an appropriate response, more than a child would who hasn't had that exposure. Young children also try to copy the actions they have observed while playing video games. These actions or gestures are stored in their memories and children do feel the urge to try them out in their real lives on their siblings and in school, thus increasing the bullying tendencies. Non-violent games can prove to be a great teaching tool and they can be used for educational purposes. They also improve the hand-eye co-ordination. So, parents should try to convince their children to play such games and divert their attention from violence.",

It is a known fact that we learn by repetition. By allowing children to play violent video games it starts to desensitize them at an early age to the effects of violence. These games were originally designed for military training to help soldiers overcome their hesitancy in shooting the enemy.\"This is simply untrue. Altered versions of doom and America's Army were used to train soldiers in team work not killing.\"Video Game Violence and Why It Should End Video games these days are now just shooting and killing. Children play these games for entertainment and I know that they are fun, because I play them too. But this is a serious thing. Children do not need to play violent games because games can influence children to do so. People say,\"Oh, my son promised to never act like that,\" or,\"Tyler loves these games and he keeps asking for a BB gun\". The BB gun may be just for fun, but soon he'll get a real gun.\"Yes this is sort of correct a person who likes first person shooters may want to get a gun. Please show me how guns increase violence.\"Violent video games like MWF3 or Call of Duty or Assassins Creed are insults to military men. They're at war, fighting for our country, and you've got your butt on a couch, laughing at people who are getting shot on a video game. This is a serious offense to soldiers. And what if you played these games and someone you love is in the military.\"Which is why so many \"military men\" play video games [1] and furthermore why video games are used as PTSD therapy.\"Those Who voted 'No' are delusional fools. It's plainly obvious, video games make people of all ages agitated and aggressive.\"As a gamer I have been described as aggressive but I have never been described as agitated.\"I've seen it in my nephews and niece and there are countless studies available at your finger tips.\"Where are these studies?\"Yes violent video games should be banned!! Police have linked several violent cases to violent video games. For example a 8 year old boy oblivious to the real life fact that if you shot someone in real life they would die and not come back, took out a gun and shot is grandmother. His grandmother did die and did not come back. He is now facing life in prison after juvenile hall of course for something he didn't realize was bad in the first place. Video games pump things into children's heads so bad these days they have no way of knowing the difference between real life and video game life.\"There is no link for this but it sounds like a case of serious and abnormal delusion not caused by video games.Most of the rest of your argument actually supports me either that or it's simply news reports with no evaluation of the facts.My argumentThe case for the ban of violent video games seems to be based on the assumption that violent video games cause violence whereas in fact the increased use of violent video games has shown to have no noticeable effect on the murder rate [3].Furthermore what is a violent video game? There is no often adhered to definition and I think this causes a problem as it allows for censorship of controversial content.[1] http://uk.ign.com...[2] http://kotaku.com...

Why do they say violent video games make people violent? The reason for this is because of the fact that people that play violent video games get so addicted to these violent video games that they lose themselves in these video games and lose between what's real and what's fake Not everyone can handle violent video games. That is why violent video games are suppose to be for a mature audience. (17+) http://www.nytimes.com... If the person is correct on this article that and I quote - \"The young men who opened fire at Columbine High School, at the movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and in other massacres had this in common: they were video gamers who seemed to be acting out some dark digital fantasy. It was as if all that exposure to computerized violence gave them the idea to go on a rampage \" or at least fueled their urges.\" Then that could prove something there although he goes more into detail that studies have shown it is unsure about the fact that video games were the result of this. However people can get lost in what is real and what is fake.

This suggests there really is a conclusion to this yet and more research has to be done. US president Obama Proposes funding for game violence studies. This article summaries the top 25 studies for violent video games that dates back to the 80s http://kotaku.com... Look at these studies and the conclusions. Some showed after playing violent games there are no difference from playing regular games without violence. Other tests showed teenagers acted out more aggressively after playing violent video games.",

            "premise": "OK, \"first round is acceptance\" probably means something different than I thought it did. If I am actually right about what it means though, i may have to make it clear that this is not sarcasm nor a cruel jab, i honestly don't know if i know what that phrase means by now. I've only seen it used a few times, and half of the times i used it, it was ignored, so what do I know?Anyways, since i already made an argument in my last debate, i find no purpose in reinventing the wheel. I shall copy and paste my previous arguments below: 1:Gaming as a medium of artModern gaming has a tendancy of pandering towards a teenage audience: using violence and sex to win over the audience they want (see section 3). The problem with this is that it prevents people from taking gaming seriously. No one wants to accept gaming as an art form, no one believes that games can convey emotion or messages, and no one believes that \"mature\", in reference to video games, can mean anything other than a rating. I am saying this as a teenage male gamer: games should stop trying to put people like me into a box2:Coming under fireYou've heard the argument before: \"violent videogames ruin the children\", \"videogames turn people into mass murderers\", \"videogames killed my children\", etc. It will never go away unless we bite the bullet and stop pushing violence. I personally want people to start taking games seriously, as priorly mentioned, but I don't want them percieved as a threat. I can only assume you feel the same wayAnd, to explain what I meant in section 1, I will copy another excerpt from my previous debate, specifically the counterarguments, here:3: Reiteration of why games tend towards violenceWhy do people tend to like violent games as opposed to nonviolent ones? One of the issues is the AAA games (like Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty) vs. indie games (like minecraft and Don't Starve). AAA is sponsored by heavy budget studios with heavy wallets and large numbers. Indie games are created by \"independent developers\", which can be stretched, but for all practical purposes just means a small team of friends who just thought it would be fun to create a video game. Because AAA games have larger budgets, they can push their games with advertising campaigns. However, they also don't have much area for originality; because they spend so much money on each project, they can't afford to get a failed project, so they just rehash an old formula: buff guys shooting guns at other buff guys. Indie games usually go with violence as well, to mirror their AAA counterparts.The issue isn't that nonviolent games aren't as good, but that they aren't as well known. What about when they are well done? Undertale, an indie game written by Toby Fox, was prided for its emphasis on nonviolence and the ability to talk with the opponents without taking their lives. Mirror's edge, while still more or less AAA (even with less marketing), and still including heavy amounts of violence, did not focus on violence, but on parkour and freerunning4: Counterarguments:--\" the more life like a game is the better understanding people get from playing video of real life scenario.\"Fair, but what does this have to do with violence? I am fine with games using realism, and even the violence it entails, to get across a message or to undestand others' lifestyles. However, currently, it is overused as a means to attract the average teenage male. --\" Any way there is violence in the news about a murder or a extremist group and movies so that doesn't mean games have to suffer\"First off, I don't care about movies. I'll let the cinephiles debate over that. I, as a gamer, am concerned for video games. Second, I do not believe that movies have this problem as much as video games. I have no sources, so maybe this argument is invalid. But I still believe that, if movies are using it as much as video games (which I doubt), they should tone it down a bit too.-- \"people find these games fun so why ruin it for them.\" Well, do you think they find specifically running around taking lives fun, or do you believe that the game, in and of itself, is fun? I don't think that violent games should outright go extinct, but we could do without another COD clone. I believe that video games can be fun without violence, or at least without a constant dependance on violence to remain entertaining. --\"All games have violence any way. Mario you kill a goomba but because there is no blood it does not count as violence put a little bit of blood in and it is bad. But it doesn't matter what game you play they all have violence in them\"I disagree with almost everything here. Yes, blood does have an impact on how violent a game seems, and how much it is deemed violent by the ESRB, but this does not mean that every game that doesn't have blood is violent. DDR isn't violent. Guitar Hero isn't violent. Games are not violent by nature, and I believe that games can evolve past gripping furiously onto violence with both hands. Further, I don't care if video games have violence in them, I just have a problem with the pointless overuse of violence. --\"If you think they are too violent do not play them you do not need to complain. Also games are meant to be fun and enjoyable so if people like me enjoy fps games then i enjoy them if you do not like them then play another game. people have opinons and you should allow them to make there own decisions not try and stop them playing there favorite game. \"Well, this is a harder point to argue with, I will admit. However, saying that you like FPS games is not the same as saying you couldn't play nonviolent games. Nonviolent games haven't been explored too much, and I would argue that that is one of the only reasons people don't like them. AAA developers are unwilling to cut much from the original formula they have gone through for a long enough amount of time. I don't want to see COD disappear forever. I don't want Undertale to ditch its Neutral Mode or Genecide Mode. I just want there to be less games like COD and, more importantly, more games like Undertale--where nonviolence is given a chance. Right now, there isn't much in the gaming industry (at least on the AAA side) other than FPS games and similarly made violent games. I just want games to branch out a little, not shrink. --\"Also games like the new battle field are educational they have a story mode about WW1 as the game is set in early 20th century.\"But do they require violence to have education in them?--\"All forms of media whether it is a game, movie news all relate to violence in one way. The reason there is violence is because before there was violence and weren't games in the past and there were more wars.\" Your first point here was already addressed earlier. Your second point has no bearing in this conversation because it applies to violent video games' affect on real life, which is a point that has been argued to a stalemate, and one which I would rather not address.",

We should stop looking for a scapegoat and give children support from the family in terms of love and proper role models and the government in terms of education. If children are affected by everything then how are children afected by music such as venetian snares whose music is breakcore. If children are affected by everything then can you imagine in 1992 when mortal kombat arrived. I dont remember trying to fireball my teacher or send electric through my mates head to make him explode. Another example is the ads, video games from japan such as samurai etc which are very famous for their violence However, the crime rate at that time was not increasing. In fact, it decreased Furthermore, violent video games aren't molding violent people, it is the violent and troubled people that are drawn to the games. If someone plays grand theft auto for hours then shoots a cop, that person would probably have hurt someone anyway. Is it worse because that person is a cop? No! A cop's life is worth no more then any other person out there, no matter what the circumstances. A small minority may be influenced by violence in video games but this does not warrant banning violent video games outright. It warrants better parenting and education and healthcare systems. Regarding the ( Grand Theft Auto ) argument and it relating to Columbine, the two teenagers were indeed fans of violent video-games, but GTA was not mentioned by the media, the game that was mentioned was DOOM 3, where the media claimed that it was there that the two teens created a level to imitate Columbine so they could plan their shooting, but this claim was later debunked when it was learned that they ( the two teens ) did not initially plan to go inside of the school.",

GTA V and violent crimes argumentI will admit that this was an argument I was expecting. To rebut my opponent's point about the lack of a major increase in crime among juveniles, I will argue that violence does not always occur in the form of a crime. Violence, as stated above, can be summarized as any use of unjust aggression or force. Modern society has educated and raised young people by the thinking that committing violent crimes is a stupid thing to do, and young people are smart enough to realize that. However, that doesn't mean no violence has occurred as a result of video gaming.2. Unrealistic video gamesThe resolution of this debate is \"Video games cause violence\", not \"All video games cause violence\". Whilst some video games, explicitly things like video games for toddlers, obviously have almost zero chance of prompting violent behavior, I have still filled my BOP that Video Game(s) have prompted violence.3. The brainIn a growing brain and in a society where media and real life are almost extremely mixed together, and where some people meet their closest friends, wed, and earn fortunes through the pixels of a computer screen, I would say that violence demonstrated on this platform most definitely has the potential to cause an imitating effect, especially if the juvenile in question has never known anything other than what society is now.-- no sources necessary this round --",

To back this up from within the source: [[ Japanese children rated their own behavior in terms of physical aggression, such as hitting, kicking or getting into fights with other kids; the U.S. children rated themselves too, but the researchers took into account reports from their peers and teachers as well. ]] There is no reason it doesn't refer to violence. --- S2: Second is a misquote: [[ But Dr. Cheryl K. Olson, co-director of the Center for Mental Health and the Media at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, isn't convinced. \"It's not the violence per se that's the problem, it's the context and goals of the violence,\" said Olson, citing past research on TV violence and behavior. There are definitely games kids shouldn't be playing, she said, for example those where hunting down and killing people is the goal. But she argues that the label \"violent video games\" is too vague. Researchers need to do a better job at defining what is considered a violent video game and what constitutes aggressive behavior, she added. Further, she adds, playing games rated \"M\" for mature has become \"normative behavior\" for adolescents, especially boys. \"It's just a routine part of what they do,\" she says. ]] First, it exceeds the claim that it effects children by entering into a different age bracket (adolescents) and second it's a generic counter-balance claim for any given newsource to prevent bias however she too states that certain games should not be used and then proposes that the proposition is loose, which is fine however it does not dismiss: [[ In every group, children who were exposed to more video game violence did become more aggressive over time than their peers who had less exposure. This was true even after the researchers took into account how aggressive the children were at the beginning of the study -- a strong predictor of future bad behavior. The findings are \"pretty good evidence\" that violent video games do indeed cause aggressive behavior, says Dr. L. Rowell Huesmann, director of the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor. There are two ways violent media can spur people to violent actions, said Huesmann, who has been studying violence in media and behavior for more than 30 years. First is imitation; children who watch violence in the media can internalize the message that the world is a hostile place, he explains, and that acting aggressively is an OK way to deal with it. Also, he says, kids can become desensitized to violence. \"When you're exposed to violence day in and day out, it loses its emotional impact on you,\" Huesmann said. \"Once you're emotionally numb to violence, it's much easier to engage in violence.\" ]] It doesn't even counter it. They are talking about two different age groups and I focusing on children. My opponents criticism holds no water. --- Q1: The second source is pretty much the same. [[ When asked if it was okay for a boy to strike a peer if that peer said something negative about him, for example, these kids were more likely to say yes. They also scored higher on measures of hostility, answering that they would to respond with aggressive action when provoked, even accidentally. The more long-term gamers were also more likely to fantasize about hitting someone they didn\"t like. ]] Solves the \"language\" issue. --- Q2: [[ Working with 3,034 boys and girls in the third, fourth, seventh, and eighth grades in Singapore, Anderson and his colleagues asked the children three times over a period of two years detailed questions about their video game habits. ... \"What this study does is show that it\"s media violence exposure that is teaching children and adolescents to see the world in a more aggressive kind of way,\" says Anderson. \"It shows very strongly that repeated exposure to violent video games can increase aggression by increasing aggressive thinking.\" Brain imaging studies also hint that exposure to violent gaming may actually temporarily change the brain. In a 2011 study, for example, after a week of daily video gaming, brain scans of a small group of volunteers showed less activity in the regions connected to emotions, attention, and inhibition of impulses compared to participants who played non-violent video games. The effect appeared to be reversible, but the results suggested that extended periods of play could lead to more stable changes in the brain. ]] --- Q3: Completely shows my opponent misquoted the segment chosen: [[ Previous studies have suggested that the short-term effects of spiking stress hormones\"typical of the fight-or-flight response\"can rev up players\" sensitivity to slights or provocations, and that playing violent games can lead to longer-term suppression of empathy. Another recent study purported to find a link between violent video games and racism. Anderson and his team, however, did not see any significant difference in empathy among the players who played more or fewer hours. That confirmed earlier lab-based studies that showed both undergraduates who played violent games and those that played non-violent ones were equally likely to help scientists pick up dropped pens. ]] This has nothing to do with with children, for one, and it has nothing to do with this study the article is on, for two, it looks at other studies which suggested something entirely different that wasn't even measured in the study cited. The \"third\" point has the same problem as the third point last time as it's an anti-bias point however if one reads it: [[ More recent research has not found that children who play VVG are more violent than other kids, nor harmed in any other identifiable fashion. A recent longitudinal study of my own, following 165 10- to 14-year-old boys and girls over a three-year period, now in press with Journal of Psychiatric Research, finds no long-term link between VVG and youth aggression or dating violence. ]] The age itself exceeds that of the scope of the study itself. The actual study, if read, shows as the article states: \"That\"s because children tend to act less aggressively as they get older, and learn more mature ways of dealing with conflicts than lashing out.\" However it is backed up with the above in segment Q2 which goes back and addresses the issue throughout the study and the rerouting of native behavior and behavioral choices. --- O1: I am no longer going to constantly \"assert\" the equivocation problem since it's been shown false twice now and it is clearly false in the third if one should read it. It does not even hide the term violence and it is extremely clear that it refers to at least violent behavior and fighting. As for the \"source doesn't present evidence\" the studies are cited and there is a link to one at the bottom. It isn't impossible to verify. That doesn't even make sense. I would understand if there were no citations, it wasn't reviewed, it didn't have scholarly status, and it was not from a reputable source but there's no value to your \"questioning\" as it is as sound as any source would get. You have to objectively prove why it's not a sound source not just inject why you don't like it. The standard for endorsement has nothing to do with the validity of the information. That is an outright Strawman (http://www.nizkor.org...) and means nothing. --- F1: \"Third, the evidence it uses isn't even significant. The results from the study said, and I quote, \"These studies find that playing violent video games does, indeed, cause aggression. The effect is a correlation of about r = .20\", which is statistically insignificant. It's more likely that an alternative cause, like one's previously mentioned, are causing the violent behavior other than the violence in video games themselves. \" I have to prove that VVGs cause aggression. This proves that VVGs cause aggression. You rejection based on the \"amount\" of aggression is ( http://rationalwiki.org... ) shifting goalposts. Instead of my source proving the point and being sufficient my opponent has decided that it's \"not enough\" and \"doesn't work\" based on absolutely no criteria. Furthermore the opponent doesn't explain why it's statistically insignificant or what \"r=.20\" actually means which misleads those who do not know to simply be swayed without an explanation which further makes for an actual Appeal to Authority: Self (http://www.nizkor.org...) as my opponent feels they are of sufficient standing to declare this as fact without backing. --- Overview: Pivot 1: My opponent commits Equivocation as a means of defense. Pivot 2: My opponent misquotes the sources, does not posit his own, and inters his own reasoning as a means of dissuading others regardless of his not being an Authority and his not having grounds or ignoring the content and context. Pivot 3: My opponent admits that at least one source did provide sufficient evidence that it does occur but then shifts the goalpost stating that it's occurrence was not sufficient to meet their criteria which was not revealed prior making it shifting of goal posts, a logical fallacy, and completely unfair. Conclusion: I was hoping I'd be reading things that backed VVGs rather than having to discuss basic language deciphering skills and listening to made up on the spot criteria. Note: I dropped the last two sources in agreement with my opponent because though they are actually signs of of the behavior in children and why they are so impressionable (and it does talk about video games in the last two sources) it's easier to continue without them.",

            "conclusion": "Video Games do not increase or perpetuate juvenile violence",
            "premise": "First of all, as an observation, Juvenile can be defined as the following, from Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: \" physiologically immature or undeveloped\", :reflecting psychological or intellectual immaturity\", and \"of, relating to, characteristic of, or suitable for children or young people.\" Therefore, since no exact age-bar ws given by the Pro, we can assume anyone is a juvenile if they match the description. This means adults who have mental disabilities, and people of all ages who bear these characteristics meeet the criteria of \"Juvenile.\" First - Kids/Juveniles who play violent video games are prone to Violent Videogames, as told by a journal Pediatrics in it's study in 2008. Anne Harding of CNN, who covered the study, reported on three groups in the study: \"In every group, children who were exposed to more video game violence did become more aggressive over time than their peers who had less exposure.\" CBSNews' 60 Minutes even went on about how a violent video game, Grand Theft Auto, led to a rampage by one of the kids who played it: \"And now, the game is at the center of a civil lawsuit involving the murders of three men in the small town of Fayette, Ala. They were gunned down by 18-year-old Devin Moore, who had played Grand Theft Auto day and night for months.\" American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry elaborate on these effects: \"Studies of children exposed to violence have shown that they can become: \u201cimmune\u201d or numb to the horror of violence, imitate the violence they see, and show more aggressive behavior with greater exposure to violence. Some children accept violence as a way to handle problems. Studies have also shown that the more realistic and repeated the exposure to violence, the greater the impact on children. In addition, children with emotional, behavioral and learning problems may be more influenced by violent images.\" Therefore, the effects of violent video games are true, and do exist. Therefore, I contend that video Games do increase juvenile violence, as anyone, including children, who are deemed able to be a \"juvenile\" by definition, can be pushed into doing violence.",

            "premise": "The facts are strongly against the Proposition\u2019s analysis The proposition\u2019s arguments fail to stand up in the real world. Several major studies published in\u00a0The Journal of Adolescent Health,\u00a0The British Medical Journal\u00a0and\u00a0The Lancet\u00a0(among others) have shown no conclusive link between video game usage and real-life violent behaviour. The Federal Bureau of Investigation found no evidence linking video game use to the massacre at Columbine (or other highly publicized school shootings).[1]\u00a0There is no evidence to support the idea that people exposed to violent video game (or other violent media content) will then go on to commit crimes.[2] Further, if violent video games were causing violent behaviour, we would expect to see rates of violent crime increase as games with realistic portrayals of violence became more widely available on popular game consoles. Instead, violent crime has decreased in recent years. Some economists have argued (based on time series modelling) that increased sales of violent video games are associated with decreases in violent crime.[3] In\u00a0Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do, researchers/authors Lawrence Kutner, PhD, and Cheryl K. Olson, ScD of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Center for Mental Health and Media refute claims of violent behaviour increase caused by violent video games. The researchers' quantitative and qualitative studies (surveys and focus groups) found that young adolescents view game behaviour as unrelated to real-life actions, and this is why they can enjoy criminal or violent acts in a game that would horrify them in reality. They also found evidence that those relatively few adolescents who did not play video games at all were more at-risk for violent behaviours such as bullying or fighting (although the sample size was too small for statistical significance). The authors speculated that because video game play has gained a central and normative role in the social lives of adolescent boys, a boy who does not play any video games might be socially isolated or rejected. Finally, although more study is needed, there is some evidence to suggest that violent video games might allow players to get aggressive feelings out of their system (i.e., video game play might have a cathartic effect), in a scenario that does not harm anyone else.[4],[5],[6] [1]\u00a0O\u2019Toole, Mary Ellen, \u2018The School Shooter: A Threat\u00a0Assessment perspective\u2019,\u00a0Critical Incident Response Group,\u00a0www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/school-shooter [2]\u00a0Editorial.

            "premise": "There was a study done with 200 kids, with kids the age of 10 or 11, showing that the longer they played video games, the more aggression was stored up in the kids. Children who played for longer than three hours each day had higher levels of aggression and lower levels of academic engagement. Considering the vast number of children and youth who use video games and that more than 85% of video games on the market contain some form of violence, the public has understandably been concerned about the effects that using violent video games may have on individuals, especially children and adolescents. Now admittedly that video games are not the main reason for mass homicide and school shootings because it all comes from the person's family, environment, and chemical imbalances that they might hold but like you said, \"Video games can assist with the growth and development of our brain.\" While video games can be healthy for brain development they can do just the complete opposite in people, especially in children and adolescents, because their brains are still developing. Scientific research has demonstrated an association between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive affect, aggressive cognitions and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement. Playing violent video games causes more aggression, bullying, and fighting. 60% of middle school boys and 40% of middle school girls who played at least one Mature-rated (M-rated) game hit or beat up someone, compared with 39% of boys and 14% of girls who did not play M-rated games. A 2014 peer-reviewed study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that habitual violent video game playing had a causal link with increased, long-term, aggressive behavior. Several peer-reviewed studies have shown that children who play M-rated games are more likely to bully and cyberbully their peers, get into physical fights, be hostile, argue with teachers, and show aggression towards their peers throughout the school year.",

Well I still stand by my reasoning about responsibility of parents, but also a child's mindset is different then when in adolescence or older, therefore they most likely do not understand the concept of the violence that are in those video games. And how many kids have you heard violently hurting someone just because they wanted to? Even if their past growing up was not rough or devastating? Sure there are some smart kids out there, but if they were smart enough about it, they would know about violence and take in account human integrity and have some idea that it is wrong to cause violence. I admit I may have outspoken for the more recent Call of Duty's, but the older ones did have a educational value. If violent video games could hold some sort of educational value I believe the violence would matter less The education, if prevalent enough, takes your mind off the more violent parts of the game. The emotional status of the characters, how the game makes you feel, whether it be sadness, or even hate towards another character, that emotion leads to a deeper understanding of the violence in the game, if that makes sense. And the thing about the military? They live that on a weekly bases, even before video games became electronic. Sure it may be how they become less aware of killing another human being, but again, that is their lifestyle, and sure there are more even better ways, to deal with that, but obviously video games were the option chosen, and I would like to believe more for the fun that could be taken out of it by sitting next to your comrade in arms having a friendly competition.",

Children play these games for entertainment and I know that they are fun, because I play them too. But this is a serious thing. Children do not need to play violent games because games can influence children to do so. People say,\"Oh, my son promised to never act like that,\" or,\"Tyler loves these games and he keeps asking for a BB gun\". The BB gun may be just for fun, but soon he'll get a real gun.\" My opponent actually agreed with this.Q:A: 1: The largest study of gun violence in the United States, released Thursday afternoon, confirms a point that should be obvious: widespread American gun ownership is fueling America\"s gun violence epidemic. The study, by Professor Michael Siegel at Boston University and two coauthors, has been peer-reviewed and is forthcoming in the American Journal of Public Health. Siegel and his colleagues compiled data on firearm homicides from all 50 states from 1981-2010, the longest stretch of time ever studied in this fashion, and set about seeing whether they could find any relationship between changes in gun ownership and murder using guns over time. Since we know that violent crime rates overall declined during that period of time, the authors used something called \"fixed effect regression\" to account for any national trend other than changes in gun ownership. They also employed the largest-ever number of statistical controls for other variables in this kind of gun study: \"age, gender, race/ethnicity, urbanization, poverty, unemployment, income, education, income inequality, divorce rate, alcohol use, violent crime rate, nonviolent crime rate, hate crime rate, number of hunting licenses, age-adjusted nonfirearm homicide rate, incarceration rate,and suicide rate\" were all accounted for. No good data on national rates of gun ownership exist (partly because of the NRA\"s stranglehold on Congress), so the authors used the percentage of suicides that involve a firearm (FS/S) as a proxy. The theory, backed up by a wealth of data, is that the more guns there are any in any one place, the higher the percentage of people who commit suicide with guns as opposed to other mechanisms will be. With all this preliminary work in hand, the authors ran a series of regressions to see what effect the overall national decline in firearm ownership from 1981 to 2010 had on gun homicides. The result was staggering: \"for each 1 percentage point increase in proportion of household gun ownership,\" Siegel et al. found, \"firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9R43; percent. A one standard deviation change in firearm ownership shifted gun murders by a staggering 12.9 percent. To put this in perspective, take the state of Mississippi. \"All other factors being equal,\" the authors write, \"our model would predict that if the FS/S in Mississippi were 57.7% (the average for all states) instead of 76.8% (the highest of all states), its firearm homicide rate would be 17% lower.\" Since 475 people were murdered with a gun in Mississippi in 2010, that drop in gun ownership would translate to 80 lives saved in that year alone. Of course, the authors don\"t find that rates of gun ownership explain all of America\"s gun violence epidemic: race, economic inequality and generally violent areas all contribute to an area\"s propensity for gun deaths, suggesting that broader social inequality, not gun ownership alone, contributes to the gun violence epidemic. Nevertheless, the fact that gun ownership mattered even when race and poverty were accounted for suggests that we can\"t avoid talking about America\"s fascination with guns when debating what to do about the roughly 11,000 Americans who are yearly murdered by gunfire.\" http://thinkprogress.org... 2: \"Video Game Violence and Why It Should End Video games these days are now just shooting and killing.

            "premise": "The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Psychological Association, American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Psychiatric Association, wrote in a July 26, 2000 \"Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children\" available at www.aap.org: \"Children who see a lot of violence are more likely to view violence as an effective way of settling conflicts. Children exposed to violence are more likely to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior Viewing violence can lead to emotional desensitization towards violence in real life. It can decrease the likelihood that one will take action on behalf of a victim when violence occurs. Entertainment violence feeds a perception that the world is a violent and mean place. Viewing violence increases fear of becoming a victim of violence, with a resultant increase in self-protective behaviors and a mistrust of others. Viewing violence may lead to real life violence. Children exposed to violent programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent and aggressive behavior later in life than children who are not so exposed. Although less research has been done on the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people, preliminary studies indicate that the negative impact may be significantly more severe than that wrought by television, movies, or music.\" July 26, 2000- American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry American Academy of Family Physicians American Academy of Pediatrics American Medical Association American Psychiatric Association (APA) American Psychological Association Craig Anderson, PhD, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, wrote in a 2009 article \"FAQs on Violent Video Games and Other Media Violence,\" available on psychology.iastate.edu: \"The results, overall, have been fairly consistent across types of studies (experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal) and across visual media type (television, films, video games). There is a significant relation between exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior. Exposing children and adolescents (or 'youth') to violent visual media increases the likelihood that they will engage in physical aggression against another person. By 'physical aggression' we mean behavior that is intended to harm another person physically, such as hitting with a fist or some object. A single brief exposure to violent media can increase aggression in the immediate situation. Repeated exposure leads to general increases in aggressiveness over time. This relation between media violence and aggressive behavior is causal.\" 2009- Craig Anderson, PhD David Greenfield, PhD, founder of The Center for Internet and Technology Addiction and Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, said in a Sep. 20, 2013 panel discussion titled \"Growing Up GTA\" available at huffingtonpost.com: \"My opinion on video game violence, which has a very powerful reward system wired into it, is that continued exposure desensitizes people to the experience of violence. But the other big issue, along with the reward structure, is that it teaches them a skill set that they might not otherwise develop, especially the first person shooter games. I have a real problem with giving people, in the name of entertainment, a technology that desensitizes violence, and then teaches you how to commit violence more accurately \" and then elevating people's levels of dopamine\" [T]hose studies have been absolutely supported. When you put people on a PET scanner or an functional MRI, their brain lights up like a Christmas tree when they're doing these games, especially when they hit the reward points that are designed by the gamers to\" keep people gaming because that's how these games make their money. Nothing is engaged in at the levels that I see gaming at, as a form of entertainment or dopamine elevation, unless it's a narcotic like cocaine for instance. How could you be exposed to something this toxic and have it not affect you?\" Sep. 20, 2013- David N. Greenfield, PhD Leland Yee, PhD, State Senator (D-CA) wrote in a June 22, 2009 amicus brief filed with the US Supreme Court for Video Software Dealers Association v. Schwarzenegger: \"The interactive nature of video games is vastly different than passively listening to music, watching a movie, or reading a book. With interactive video games, the child becomes a part of the action which serves as a potent agent to facilitate violence and over time learns the destructive behavior. This immersion results in a more powerful experience and potentially dangerous learned behavior in children and youth... Just as the technology of video games improves at astonishing rates, so to does the body of research consistently demonstrate the harmful effects these violent interactive games have on minors. Over three thousand peer-reviewed studies, produced over a period of 30 years documenting the effects of screen violence (including violent video games), have now been published... These data suggest very strongly that participating in the playing of violent video games by children and youth increase aggressive thought and behavior; increase antisocial behavior and delinquency; engender poor school performance; desensitize the game player to violence.\" June 22, 2009- Leland Yee, PhD Brad Bushman, PhD, Professor of Communication and Psychology at The Ohio State University, stated the following in a Feb. 18, 2013 article titled \"Why Do People Deny Violent Media Effects?\" available at psychologytoday.com \"People want to believe that if millions of people play violent video games and they don\"t all become killers, then those games must be harmless. Unfortunately, that\"s not true. We haven\"t 'proven' video games directly cause violence because it can\"t be proven. There is no way to ethically run experiments that see if some threshold of playing a violent game like Call of Duty may push a person into violence. But that doesn\"t mean we are left without evidence. We know that video game violence is certainly correlated with violence \" just like smoking is correlated with lung cancer. However, this does not mean that the research does not show causal effects; in fact it does, over and over again. We recently conducted a comprehensive review of 136 articles reporting 381 effects involving over 130,000 participants from around the world. These studies show that violent video games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), and aggressive behavior. Violent games also decrease helping behavior and feelings of empathy for others. The effects occurred for males and females of all ages, regardless of what country they lived in. So the question then becomes why people and journalists repeatedly shrug off this compelling body of work.\" Feb. 18, 2013- Brad J. Bushman, PhD Pamela Eakes, Founder of Mothers Against Violence in America (MAVIA), wrote in an article titled \"Do You Know What Video Games Your Children Are Playing?\" on www.pbs.org (accessed Oct. 6, 2014): \"Parents do know that children learn by observing, imitating what they observe, and acting on the world around them. According to child psychologist Michael Rich, children develop what psychologists call 'behavioral scripts.' They interpret their experiences and respond to others using those scripts. One can easily see how repeated exposure to violent behavioral scripts can lead to increased feelings of hostility, expectation that others will behave aggressively, desensitization to the pain of others, and an increased likelihood of interacting and responding to others with violence. Violent video games are an ideal environment in which to learn violence. Violent video games: Place the player in the role of th",

You have no support to back up your opinion so give me the numbers my first debate had the numbers and proof I have now made my debate improved so argue with this: I love video games, but does the high violence sometimes make you violent ? No that\"s a load of nonsense of course it doesn\"t. But that\"s what some people actually believe, and today I\"ll tell you why some people believe it and why some don\"t. By the age of seven, Yes SEVEN! You can tell the difference from fantasy violence and real world violence and when you play and watch more violent content that skill grows greater and seriously who on earth will just start thinking they\"re hitman and start running around doing flips off cars and shooting people. And I\"m not just talking nonsense here is proof from an American newspaper article: Playing violent video games does not cause kids to commit mass shootings. Over 150 million Americans (and 71% of teens) play video games. There have been 71 mass shootings between 1982 and Aug. 2015, seven of which (9.8%) involved shooters age 18 or younger. Some people think that violent games lead to violent actions because their exposure to violent video games is linked to lower empathy and decreased kindness. Empathy, the ability to understand and enter into another's feelings is believed to inhibit aggressive behavior. In a study of 150 fourth and fifth graders by Jeanne Funk, PhD, Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at the University of Toledo, violent video games were the only type of media associated with lower empathy. And violence is lower in countries that play more video games. 2005 in Japan had 73 murders compared to the US's poor run of 2,279 just by teens. Basically what I\"m saying is that we could do a lot better Japan is one of the most populous countries in the world and they have the least murders. Video games actually stop people being violent . Per capita video game sales were $5.20 in the United States compared to $47 in Japan. You might think videogames are for kids but as an adult pro gamer you get millions even billions. I think as NZ we should start a gaming festival or competition at ASB Showgrounds Auckland every year. I believe that videogames have nothing to do with other people being violent.",

The only thing youre actually doing is try to twist the resolution of the debate to an absurd degree just to get yourself more leeway....\"That was also the topic of the debate in the first place, actual violence occuring from video games. Deaths, wounds, murder, mass shootings. You've changed the topic to over all stress from video games, and feeling bad because you've lost.\"Tell me then pencil-d*ck, where in the first or second round did you say that the resolution applied only to deaths, wounds, murders, and mass shootings? The answer is that you didnt. Youre cutting off 90% of the meaning of violence to include only really, really violent stuff while completely ignoring the fact that uncontrollable cursing, chucking the controller, etc also qualifies as 'violence' \"Seeing violence in video games is just like seeing violence in movie. But movie violence is much worse. \"Im sorry, how many movies have you seen that have caused you to start cursing uncontrollably or to throw objects violently across the room? Movies cause far less violence then video games, thats just simple observation. \"It turns out that it didn't happen! Why you ask? Because those 7.5 million people are mentally stable. \"First off, nobody who plays Black Ops II is mentally stable. All of them are 12 year old boys hitting puberty like a wall, they are most certainly not stable. Secondly, you just admitted that people overreact to all kinds of stuff such as sports yet you continue to deny that video games can be a trigger for causing people to act violent. Hypocrite much?\"I believe we cuss under our breath and get frustrated at numerous things throughout life. Stepping in gum, losing a job, not assembling a product correctly, etc...\"I dont know about your mental stability, but ive never stepped in bubble gum and then as a response yelled out \"F*CKING SH*T THESE F*CKING HACKERS CAN SUCK MY HAIRY D*CK. SUCH BULLSH*T\" like thousands of teenagers are yelling right now after they just died in Black Ops II.....Stepping in gum is not the equivalent of dying in a video game since the reaction to both varies immensly. ===========================================================================Point is, video games do cause violence in the from of rants of cursing, chucking the game controller or remote against the TV or wall, etc etc.",

A study that Villanova and Rutgers University had published \"found that when shooting game sales are at their highest, crime numbers tend to drop\" (1). There was also a study done in 2010 that found that used 103 young adults to solve a frustration task in groups, with some playing video games and some not. They found \"that the games had no impact on aggressive behavior whatsoever, and that the group which played no game at all was the most aggressive after the task, whereas the group that played the violent games were the least hostile and depressed\" (2).

In the game grand theft auto the player can decapitate police officers, kill them with a sniper rifle, massacre them with a chainsaw, and set them on fire should people of any age be taking pleasure in doing this in a game I think not. I have just given you examples of video games pushing people into committing violent crimes. None of these people were in the correct mental state but it was the video games that showed them how to do what they did. It is very hard for many parents to stop there children to playing violent video games with friends and older sibling who will play these video games with and there is a lot of pressure in schools to play these games therefore people feel like they have to play it to feel accepted in schools it is very easy to play these games at a friends house or borrow the game or I have encountered people selling these games to there friends in school. But if the government puts a ban on these games then they will slowly start to not play it. Violence as entertainment is simply immoral, if society wants to stop violence then why use entertainment to glorify it this is just a mixed message. How many more people have to die before we just our common sense and stop people playing violent video games, tell me this, what good does it do?!?! And no I do not want to ban water because water does good the human race would struggle to live with out water but the human race could quite happily live with out violent video games corrupting the minds of people.",
