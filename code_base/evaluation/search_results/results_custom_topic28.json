            "discussionTitle": "Prostitution do more harm than good",
            "conclusion": "Prostitution do more harm than good",
            "premise": "Thank you for still postings your arguments. There are some points of your rebuttal which I understand (please clarify this if it's mistaken) : 1. I am being tyrannical Having a national value does not necessary have to be tyrannical as long as you're not imposing it in tyrannical way. This debate is one of example where we can discuss what are things which should be considered as good for most people and bad for the others. So in making choices in life, people do well aware that they're action will result more negatively or possitively although at the end they still do it anyway. Please do note that this is not a debate to ban prostitiution market. But this debates is want to discuss whether prostitution is good or bad regardless it is legal or not. There are a lot of thing which people are considering do more harm than good but they still do it anyway. For examples are smoking, drinking too much alcohol, narcotics, too much gambling, etc.. People have to well aware that those actions bring more harm than good, when doing their actions. I don't mind people are smoking, As long as they know the consequences and we could make some policy especially if the non smokers is also on the risk of the smokers' actions. And these policies can be taken in a democratic way. Applied the same to prostitiutions. 2. Subjective value argument. The motion which I create is I think fair enough. \"Prostitution do more harm than good\". This debate is not simply only discuss whether the prostitution is good or bad. I do believe that prostitution have both sides (good and bad), But what we should be discussing is, is itrue that the good overcome all the negatives sides of prostitutions (or not)? up untill the third round the contender fail to show the goodness of prostitutions other than arguing it subject to personal values. for that matters, of course I do know it is a personal value. But is it good? is it harmful? to society and also to the prostitutes and the consumer themselves? because personal value does not always manifest into goodness, I think this logic is flaw to negate the motion. It is according to me is a red herring argument. Please do clarify this on the last round if I am mistaken. 3. STD Surely I know that using a condom is another way to reduce the risk. But that doesnt mean the risk is gone and is still multiplying on how often you have sex with a different people. Moreover, There are a lot of kind of STDs other than HIV which can not be prevent just by using condom. Prostitution make it worse because the frequency of having sex is so up higher than most people. Even compare to the one who has a promiscuous life but not having sex to earn money for life. without medical check up being shown at the first place (which I think is impossible in doing so) I believe prostitution makes the risk higher. 4. Narcotics and prostitution. For this I admit that we should see the prostitution case by case. And I also admit there is no causation in general can be applied to guarantee all prostitutions using drugs. But the correlation is so high. And in some cases, the pimp will use drugs to make sure the prostitutes keep doing the business. But nevertheless I think you are right. This is a very weak arguments which I don't wish to defend. 5. Violance and prostitiution. Even if the prostitutes not being beaten by the customer, the act of prostitution is I think a same kind act of rape. It doesn't matter whether you use it by force or with money, the point is the prostitutes are not willing to do it. But, the risk of violence is still there. The ideal life would be the prostitute have the right choose whether they want to perform the job or not as long as they know they won't get any money if they don't do it. But in practical life, such that options is not there. Especially when the prostitiution itself is not legal, how can the prostititute report this to the police without having to have punishment o they prostititution act? In a place where it is legal, the prostititutes is still having the risk of being violated physically because they sell themself as a commodities. Yes I know they can report this to the police afterwards, but still they have been violated. It is not the fault of the prostitutes and I'm not blaming the victim. But the risk of it to happen is there. so in conclusion, after do calculation I still believe prostititution brings more harm than good. Unless you can show goodness of prostitutions which can be overcome the harm. My arguments lie on the risk. Not necessary it has to happen but rather please explain, what are the goodness that can compesate all the risk other than it is just a personal values that one should defend.",

            "premise": "I accept. First of all the majority of 12 year old ar any age child prostitute is there involuntarily. Non voluntary prostitution would still be illegal. Also legal prostitution would only be legal for 18 and older. No minors. if it were legal it could be better regulated so as not to spread as much disease and make it safer so the women involved arent managed by dangerous pimps. We could add a law that persay says that it is illegal to be involved in prostitution if you have an STD. then we could just go after those people. Prostitution could be one off the check boxes when you go for a physical snd if the doctor sees it they can make you get regular tests. Also nobody said that you should sell your body for sex. Its a terrible idea actually. but it shouldnt be illegal or criminalized. Many women in prostitution actually have people to support and prostitution is a last option. I would want to help them find a better option but if thats what they go with im notnfoing to fine them or arrest them and put their family in an even worse position. Probably the most imprtant reason it should be legalized is that it lets customers get rid of sexual urges. These actually has been shown to correlate with lower rates of sexual assault and rape. I would rather have legal prositution in my town then women getting raped. http://www.washingtonpost.com... Also, it is your body and you do what you want with it. Nobody can tell you any different.",

            "conclusion": "Should prostitution be legal",
            "premise": "Prostitution should be legal for a lot of reasons. A good example of prostitution working in a civil society is the Netherlands. Prostitution has been legal for years in this country and the people has benefitted from the tax revenue generated from prostitution. Many people say prostitution should be illegal for religious or moral reasons. This is a false premise to ban prostitution. The urge for sexual reproduction is inherent in all men. Those men who lack the skills or time to court women and engage in sex should not be denied their sexual instincts because the government deciding prostitution is illegal. Some argue that prostitution is derisive to the women who work in the industry. Allegedly many legal prostitutes are forced into their work and have no choice in the matter. The Dutch engineered a solution to this by providing social services and protection to the prostitutes working in the country's many red-light districts. If a Dutch night walker feels under pressure from a pimp and not acting under her own choice she would have many resources available to her. In a country with illegal prostitution these options do not exist. In Sweden the government has tried to fight illegal prostitution by prosecuting the men caught in the act rather than the hussy. Then they offer the call girls alternative education opportunities to reeducate them and reintegrate them into moral society. The man on the other hand must endure the difficult legal process and face the possibility of paying fines and doing community service/Jail time. While it is not surprising the Swedish socialist government would opt for such an extreme measure it nevertheless highlights why neither side of the exchange should be punished for paid sexual favors. While many men enjoy a good go-around with a slankpop once in a while we should still raise our children to avoid such behavior.",

            "premise": "Rebuttals1.\u201cThe tests don't show positive until many weeks after an STD has occured. Also, even though contraception is used, it is not uncommon for it to fail.\u201dTesting for STI/STD is quick and easy. Depending on what the person is being tested for, your provider may take a blood sample, a swab, or ask the person to pee in a cup [1]. Each STI has a different test. Generally, it takes only a few days for results to come in. HIV for example, an HIV test is super quick. With just a finger prick of blood a rapid HIV test can show results within 10 minutes [2].If condoms are stored and used properly, they rarely break (there\u2019s a 2% - 5% chance). Contraception will hardly fail if used right [3].2. \u201cMaking prostitution legal won't make it safer in all cases. Yes there are safer places to PURCHASE A WOMEN(or man), but that is only a small fraction of prostitution businesses.\u201dProstitution is dangerous because prostitution is illegal. Con just made my point a lot clearer. The \u2018safer small fraction of prostitution businesses\u2019 is in countries or states, where prostitution is legalized. 3.\u201cThat may be how some prositution businesses are run, however, most are run by sketchy people in run-down motels. In these businesses women do not have security guards nor do they use intercoms. There is an overwhelming amount of criminal cases where prostitutes have been raped by customers and in many, murdered. It is a dangerous business whether it's legal or not.\u201dMost prostitution businesses are run by \u2018sketchy people\u2019 because prostitution is illegal. If prostitution is legal, prostitution businesses will be run by reliable managers of brothels. Since prostitution in Nevada is legal, sex workers work in a safer and secure environment than countries or states that illegalizes prostitution. Crimes against sex workers will lessen because of security guards or bouncers protecting them. Again, legalizing will reduce the amount of criminal cases against prostitutes. 4.\u201cProstitution will be dangerous legal or illegal. Anything involving sex, money, and human trafficking with put the participants at risk. Also, do we really want our roads and public schools funded by tax money from prostitution?\u201dCon did not present any evidence on how prostitution will still be dangerous if it is legalized. Con also committed an appeal to emotion fallacy [4]. 5.\u201cI agree that men and women have the right to their bodies but not in this way. They should not be allowed to sell their bodies for money. There have been several studies showing the link between prostitution and drugs and they use their 'paychecks' to buy drugs.Yes, we have a right to our bodies. However, selling your body as a service is not at all the same. Prostitutes are prime targets of human trafficking, rape, STDs, as well as unwanted pregnancies. Prostitution is a disgustingly harmful act that needs to be stopped, not legalized.\u201dMen and woman have the right to their bodies so they can do whatever they want with it. If prostitutes want to use their bodies to have sex with a customer, who has full consent and pays the prostitute for his/her time, then there is nothing wrong about that. Con failed to show any evidence of these studies that link prostitution and drugs. I don\u2019t see how prostitution and drugs are related. Some normal everyday people buy drugs too. Again, prostitutes are prime targets of human trafficking, rape, STDs, and unwanted pregnancies because prostitution is illegal. Legalizing prostitution will reduce these crimes against prostitutes. ConclusionThere is a reason why is it also called one of the oldest professions in the world. Prostitution can never be stopped. Legal or illegal there will always be prostitution. It happens every day throughout the world, so why not make money off it and reduce the risk in it? It is simply two consenting adults exchanging a service for money. A prostitute and her customer agreeing on an exchange of money for sex, violates no one's rights, and does not directly necessarily harm anyone else. Thus, it should be legal. However, some people do not seem to have clarity on the issue, and want to bring in lots of personal opinions and hogwash about how prostitution promote drug-use, violence, STDs, etc. In fact, it is anti-prostitution laws which promote all of these things.I would like to thank Con for this debate.VOTE PRO!!!Sources[1] http://www.iwannaknow.org...[2] http://www.teenclinic.org...[3] http://contraception.about.com...[4] https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com...",

            "premise": "My adversary has requested (by private message) that I begin addressing his points from round 1. I wish to emphasise that he has the full burden of proof in this debate and I thank him for bringing this topic to the debating floor. I note the strangeness of this debate topic, given that prostitution is legal in India. The Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act (SITA) of 1986 does not criminalise prostitution per se, but does criminalise brothel keeping (Section 3), living off earnings of sex work (Section 4), procuring, inducing or detaining for prostitution (Section 5 and 6). I shall assume that my adversary wants to legalise activities that promotes carrying prostitution out on an organized or commercial scale. I will begin by countering my opponent's arguments.CA: 1st and 2nd paragraphsThe first and second paragraphs are just rhetoric and I will not be addressing them.\"In my opinion government and before that the society should build a public opinion to make prostitution legal in the eyes of law.The reason my thought process keeps revolving around this solution to the problem is because this is something that is prevalent already since ages.It is silently accepted by us all. My question to everyone and myself is why cannot we give it a legal recognition.\"My adversary argues that since prostitution is widespread, and enforcement is lax, it should be legalised. \"A corollary of the above proposition is that it will help in great deal to give better lives to sex workers and prevent them from exploitation at hands of their customers and law.This in turn might help reduce the spread of AIDS as it will definitely lead to better and safer practices among them.\"While my adversary's intentions are admirable, his claims are untrue. Two studies (with a sample size of almost 200 women in 5 different countries) conducted by The Coalition Against Trafficking of Women International (CATW) have shown that \"prostitution establishments did little to protect them, regardless of whether they were in legal or illegal establishments. 'The only time they protect anyone is to protect the customers.'\" (Source 2) The source shows us that legalizing prostitution does little to better the working conditions of sex workers. My adversary also claims that legalizing prostitution will lead to much better and safer practices among sex workers. This is also untrue, because the sources of disease are the prostitute's clients. Up to 47% of these women (same source) stated that men expected sex without a condom, and 45% stated that they were abused if they insisted on a condom. Whether or not prostitution is legalized, these pressures will exist. As such, legalizing prostitution is not a viable solution.I am not required to provide arguments against decriminalisation of organized prostitution, but I will make a couple of arguments, one specific to India. Argument 1: Legalization does not improve India's social attitude towards women, it worsens itMy adversary claimed, at the beginning of round 1, that India is facing a social crisis. He feels that the social climate towards women would improve if prostitution is legalized. This is not, in fact, likely. By legalizing prostitution, the country would in fact be feeding the male chauvinism that perceives women to be an object to satisfy male desire. By making it available, India would in fact be giving in to the unhealthy pressures of the country. It would not shrink the sex industry, it would expand it. \"Legalization of prostitution in the State of Victoria, Australia, has led to massive expansion of the sex industry. Whereas there were 40 legal brothels in Victoria in 1989, in 1999 there were 94, along with 84 escort services. Other forms of sexual exploitation, such as tabletop dancing, bondage and discipline centers, peep shows, phone sex, and pornography have all developed in much more profitable ways than before.\"- (Source 3) Argument 2: Legalization increases clandestine and underground prostitution, women trafficking, and child prostitutionMy adversary assumes that it is in the best interests of prostitutes to work under a commercial establishment, such as a brothel. He ignores the pressures, including physical, and the fears that come with working under a controlling pimp's grip. For this reason, many prostitutes remain as streetwalkers. (sources below) Child prostitution also increases. \"The Amsterdam-based ChildRight organization estimates that the number [of child prostitutes in Netherlands] has gone from 4,000 children in 1996 to 15,000 in 2001.\" For the same reasons, women trafficking also increases. This can be seen in studies of legal prostitution in Germany.I have rebutted all my adversary's arguments and provided some of my own, thereby negating the resolution. I remind my adversary that he has the full burden of proof in this debate, and it will not suffice to rebut my arguments; he must defend his own as well. I look forward to receiving his arguments.References:1. http://www.lawyerscollective.org...(ITPA).pdf2. http://www.isha.org.il...;3. http://www.catwinternational.org...;",

            "premise": "View on prostitutes Opponents of legalization often depict prostitutes as helpless victims forced into prostitution at a young age. This view is exemplified by the column [5] that my opponent cites. I cite from that same article: \u201cProstitution turns women into lumps of meat that are bought and sold for the sexual gratification of men.\u201d The author is disgusted by prostitution, and sees prostitutes as helpless, pathetic \u201clumps of meat\u201d. Needless to say, that this is not how prostitutes would like to be seen. Most prostitutes chose their profession. The job usually earns them more money than any other job they can do. They often need money to pay for household expenses, or to pay for education etc. Making prostitution takes away their livelihood. To get an idea who these prostitutes are it is insightful to read the following survey of prostitutes in New Zealand. http://www.otago.ac.nz... 772 sex workers were interviewed. Some highlights: 73% of the prostitutes entered the profession for financial reasons. 82% of them were at least 18 when they entered the profession (contradicting the claim of my opponent that most of them entered the profession between 14 and 16), 3% has been raped by a client. 77.8% reported always using a condom. Prostitution is legal in New Zealand after the Prostitution Reform Act. Prostitutes have legal rights in NZ and they are well aware of it. The German experiment My opponent used his citation [8] for his argument that legalization in Germany did not work. This citation starts with: \u201cDas Prostitutionsgesetz l\u00e4uft weitgehend ins Leere, besagt die erste offizielle Studie \u00fcber seine Wirkung. Schuld sei vor allem die Halbherzigkeit des Gesetzes.\u201d My translation (the link for the Google translation did not work for me): \u201cThe prostitution law does not work, says the first official study about its effect. The primary reason is that the law is half-hearted.\u201d So although the article says (in 2007, 5 years after the introduction of the law) that the law had not yet worked, it says that the main reason is that the law does not go far enough! The goal of the law was to recognize prostitution. 85.5% of the prostitutes welcomed the law as a first step towards recognition. Although prostitutes would like to work legally, they often decide not to do so, because local law officials stop them from doing so using local zoning laws. \u201cDie Autorinnen empfehlen deshalb, die Entkriminalisierung der Prostitution weiter voranzutreiben. Sie raten vor allem, das Gewerbe mit einer Art Lizenz auszustatten. Diese sollten Betriebe und Huren erhalten, die gute Arbeitsbedingungen bieten und legal arbeiten.\u201d My translation: The authors [of the study] recommend a continuation of the decriminalization of prostitution. In particular, they recommend the creation of some kind of license for the profession. These licenses will be given to brothels and hookers who work legally and have good working conditions. Risks of prostitution Prostitution, like some other professions such as law enforcement, fire fighter, is not without risks. But these risks easily can be exaggerated. My opponent goes on at length on the \u201crisks of promiscuity\u201d. The risk of STD\u2019s can be reduced to a minimum by using condoms. Most prostitutes (77.8%) always use condoms, and the remaining prostitutes probably use them most of the time. Prostitutes (like fire fighters) should wear their protective gear to be safe at their jobs. The idea of legalization is to give licenses only to prostitutes who do their work safely. Prostitution and sex trafficking There is no convincing evidence that legalization of prostitution leads to an increase of sex trafficking. Illegal immigrants cannot practice prostitution legally, even after legalization of prostitution. The study [10] that my opponent cites is not very convincing. It is based on many assumptions and poor empirical data. They write: \u201cAs pointed out already, this means we cannot control for unobserved country heterogeneity. Also, while we have established that the legalized status of prostitution is associated with a higher incidence of trafficking inflows, a cross-sectional analysis cannot provide a conclusion as to whether legalizing prostitution would result in increased trafficking after legalization.\u201d A lot of studies on the effect of legalization on sex trafficking has been done in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark. These countries have legalized prostitution (although in these countries, prostitution was already decriminalized to an extend before complete legalization). These studies are in the early 2000s. However, it seems to me that these studies ignore major changes with regards to borders. Since the fall of the USSR, human trafficking has increased. Many countries in the European Union joined the Schengen agreement in the 2000s. This means, that many borders between European countries have been eliminated. It is not hard to imagine, that this is having a huge impact on trafficking. It is therefore not surprising to see, that there has been an influx of sex workers from Eastern European countries into the Netherlands and Germany. I think that the war in former Yugoslavia may also be a factor. There is no convincing evidence that the legalization of prostitution leads to more rapes, human trafficking, or child prostitution. Prostitution and crime If prostitution is illegal, then prostitution is crime. To decouple prostitution form criminal elements, we must legalize it. Also, both in countries with legalized and not legalized prostitution, prostitutes are often forced to do their work in bad neighborhoods with high crime rates. Prostitutes should be allowed to do their profession everywhere they want (indoors). Prostitution and drugs Although there may be a correlation between drug use and prostitution, there is no convincing evidence that prostitution causes drug use. Sometimes, people enter prostitution because of drug or alcohol use. According to the NZ survey, this was 21.4%. This is not a problem of prostitution, but of drug use. With regard to drug users going into prostitution there are two options: 1)Either, we believe they are unable to make good choices for themselves. In that case they should be locked up in a rehab institution until they are no longer a danger to themselves. 2)Or, we believe that they are able to make choices for themselves. In that case, we should not take away their livelihood.",

First I want to look at the example of Germany\u2019s recent change to legalize prostitution.The German Experiment. Historically prostitution was never outlawed in Germany. The took the position of Saint Augustine that prostitution should be tolerated. [1][2] by Governments. In the 1500s there was a change in attitude because of the Protestant reformation and the rise of syphilis. In the 1800s sex trade workers had to register with local police and health authorities. In the early 1900s the focus was on regulation (not abolition) and then government run brothels were common under Nazi rule. Later, in East Germany prostitution was illegal, but in West Germany it was regulated. In unified Germany prostitution was never fully illegal, but the rules varied by municipality. In 2002, Germany changed the law in an effort to improve the legal situation of prostitutes. [3] Let\u2019s look at the results of the 2002 change in law. It is estimated that 400,000 work as prostitutes in Germany (Pop 89 million).[4] \u201cIt is a magnet for migrant sex workers, who are lured from their wretched villages in Bulgaria and Romania and turned into virtual sex slaves in Germany\u2019s 3,000 brothels. Police are nearly powerless to help them.\u201d - [5] Germany is finding that the current laws are not working, and have added more laws to refine what is legal and what is not. [6] [7] The German government (2007 report) concluding that few prostitutes had taken advantage of regular work contracts and that work conditions had improved only slightly, if at all The law has failed. Prostitutes themselves don't want to change their working conditions and contracts to the new (2002) legal status. [8] Prostitution should NOT be legal. It increases rape (non consensual sex). It increases human trafficking(sex slavery). It increases statutory rape (consensual sex with underage partners) The usual age of entry to the \u201cprofession\u201d is between 14 and 16. It is linked with organized crime and drug trafficking even in places where prostitution is legalized and regulated. None of these are activities that governments should encourage.Lets look at some further reasons why governments should work to minimize prostitution. Legislation Helps Protect Society There are many health issues relating to promiscuity. Prostitution maximizes these issues. First lets look at Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Most STDs have an incubation time before they can be diagnosed. This means that a prostitute (lets say 2 partners daily) who will test positive for HIV after 3 weeks, may infect 42 customers before it is possible to detect that she is infected. There is no way to 100% prevent the spread of STDs. Here are some other medical risks of promiscuity: Prostate cancer, Cervical cancer, Oral cancer, Heart disease, Domestic violence, Unwanted pregnancy, Birth defects[9] There are consistent links to organized crime and use of illegal drugs. I assume we are agreed that organized crime and illegal drug use should be reduced if possible. The link between organized crime, human trafficking, illegal drug use and prostitution is made clear in a position paper from the London School of Economics. [10] Here are some points to ponder from that paper. * \u201clegalized sex industries actually result in increased trafficking to meet the demand for women to be used in the legal sex industries\u201d * \u201cwherever prostitution is legalized, trafficking to sex industry marketplaces in that region increases\u201d * \u201cprostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing and fuels trafficking in persons\u201d * democratic political regime experience a larger reported incidence of trafficking. It is inaccurate to think of prostitution as a single experience. In countries where it is legal there are freelance workers, brothel workers, workers with a \u201cmanager\u201d. Many of the low end / low price workers are getting money for drugs. In Germany there is a huge problem with \u201cnarco prostitution\u201d as the workers are in poor health, and many are victims of rape, murder and violence. In round 2 I plan to cover the issues listed below. Although I am against unnecessary government intervention, I believe the best way to reduce the harm done by prostitution is to criminalize the purchase of prostitution (Target the Johns as opposed to the sellers). Trades training could be offered to the sellers of sex services as a way to get them out of the sex business.

Condom usage is also mandatory and this is advertised by the brothels so that customers know beforehand. Finally, sex workers are able to examine the customers before any services are given to make sure there are no signs of visible STIs. \" The tests don't show positive until many weeks after an STD has occured. Also, even though contraception is used, it is not uncommon for it to fail. 2. \"Legalizing prostitution will offer opportunities for sex workers to work in a safer environment like brothels that give both the customer and the prostitute protection, security and a pleasurable time.\" Making prostitution legal won't make it safer in all cases. Yes there are safer places to PURCHASE A WOMEN(or man), but that is only a small fraction of prostitution businesses. 3. \"They started by saying that the negotiation process for sex workers in Nevada requires the use of an intercom during the process so that workers will not betray the business owners and so that owners can know if the customers are putting the workers at risk.\" That may be how some prositution businesses are run, however, most are run by sketchy people in run-down motels. In these businesses women do not have security guards nor do they use intercoms. There is an overwhelming amount of criminal cases where prostitutes have been raped by customers and in many, murdered. It is a dangerous business whether it's legal or not. 4. \"Prostitution is a dangerous job if it is not legalized. They will be more prone to rape, murder, STDs and human trafficking if they don\"t work in a brothel. Legalizing prostitution will offer sex workers rights, a safer and secure environment like brothels, fair wages, and the government will also earn more tax money.\" Prostitution will be dangerous legal or illegal. Anything involving sex, money, and human trafficking with put the participants at risk. Also, do we really want our roads and public schools funded by tax money from prostitution? 5. \"I would also argue that men and women have the right to their body, so sex workers are not giving up there rights and you also don\"t have any evidence of prostitutes using their salary to buy drugs.\" I agree that men and women have the right to their bodies but not in this way. They should not be allowed to sell their bodies for money. There have been several studies showing the link between prostitution and drugs and they use their 'paychecks' to buy drugs. Yes, we have a right to our bodies. However, selling your body as a service is not at all the same. Prostitutes are prime targets of human trafficking, rape, STDs, as well as unwanted pregnancies. Prostitution is a disgustingly harmful act that needs to be stopped, not legalized.",

            "conclusion": "Prostitution should be legalized in the United States",
            "premise": "I will affirm that \"prostitution should be legalized in the United States.\" The basis of my affirmation will be negative rights and objecting moral law; I argue that in a democratic society, there is no reason other than a subjective moral one for prostitution to be illegal. As such, making prostitution illegal on the basis of these subjective moral beliefs creates a moral law which violates the liberty of individuals who may not, or outright do not adhere to the same moral principles. To begin, I offer the following definitions for the clarity of my opponent and potential voters; 1. Prostitution: The act of exchanging sexual services for monetary gain. 2. Should: A pragmatic obligation. 3. Legalized: An acceptable practice under the law free from prosecution by a governing body. I will present two arguments to warrant a vote for the pro here, and two more in the next round. I encourage readers to consider them and weight them under a paradigm of comparative advantage against any arguments my opponent may present. If at the end of the round my arguments seem to advocate a more advantageous world, I encourage you then to vote for the Pro. 1. Moral Liberty is the issue of discussion- My opponent may argue otherwise, however so far as the current writer can see the only purpose behind prostitution's illegality is one of moral scrutiny. Generally our society sees the act of prostitution as a dirty, immoral action and have accordingly made the act illegal in most places throughout the U.S. This is the case with most, if not all sexual taboos; a few find a specific act detestable and make laws to prohibit others from doing such. With prostitution specifically, the moral division is not one which is shared in all parts of the world. It is instead an influence of America's Judeo-Christian culture, which discourages non vanilla sex. The Devadasi of south India actually sell their daughters to Hindu temples to serve as prostitutes[1]; They are looked up to as members of the high class, and seen as sex symbols. Even with the practice of prostitution was outlawed in 1947, these laws were not enforced due to the beliefs of Hindu society. [1] goo.gl/OasIO 2. Legality in the status quo- Currently, open prostitution is illegal in all but 1 state in the U.S.; that being Nevada. However even there prostitution is only legal within a limited sphere; there exist 28 registered brothels where prostitution is legal[2], outside these establishments one may be penalized for the aforementioned act. In North America, the United States is the only country (exempting Nevada) where prostitution is illegal. Both Canada[3] and Mexico have legalized prostitution; this has resulted in greater safety for Canadian prostitutes, who now have the ability to hire personnel to protect them, and protect themselves from sex-trafficking; this has unfortunately not been the case in Mexico were despite having legalized prostitution, or better stated made no legislation to address the issue. It is still considered largely an underground business due to the laws quite simply not being clearly defined. Unlike Canada who has openly addressed the issue of prostitution's legality in regards to liberty and safety, Mexico has largely ignored the issue. [2] goo.gl/roUlq [3] goo.gl/U6bPZ [4] goo.gl/jeSJm Conclusion- Religious and social dogma is the only cause of prostitution being illegal in the United States; accordingly the argument moral liberty must be considered. We musn't make law based solely on personal belief. Furthermore, by finally taking the jump to fully legalize prostitution in the United States, it would stand to reason that prostitution in Mexico would be influence to change for the better. Lawmakers of Mexico would be spurred to address the issue of prostitution and set clearer guidelines. Finally, any opposing arguments which deal with potential negative impacts of prostitution should be disregarded as an appeal to fear. Vote logically, not fearfully.",

I am for making prostitution legal \"almost\" everywhere by states being able to legalize brothels, which could control who is allowed to sell their body and who is NOT allowed to sell their body such as children. It is better to have a license so it would be easier to tell if a brothel is running illegal prostitution with abducted woman and perhaps children. And if the legal brothels are forced to have regular health checkups, unlike the Netherlands, AIDs will be maintain and controlled from prostitution. \"Actually, if prostitution was legal without having to have a license for it then they would not have to have a pimp or manager.\" I am guessing you did not comprehend what I wrote before, or I did not make it clearer. Prostitution in the Netherlands is legal \"everywhere\", but there still happens to be human trafficking going on and woman are still being abused and abducted to be forced in prostitution. It would be much better if they work in legal brothels that do not force them in prostitution and do not abuse them, because legal brothels are state owned. There can only be brothels in a county with a population of 400,000 or less. I would say they should increase this so it can apply to more areas and states should decide to allow brothels to be ran in their counties, as this will \"generate revenue\" for the state To make my view clear in where I stand in prostitution I will say this.... I do think prostitution should be made legal in more states other than Nevada. Prostitution should be made legal but only in specific areas such as legal brothels. I would like to thank my opponent for this wonderful debate that I had pleasure taking part in.",

            "premise": "First of all, did you even look at the structure I proposed? With this, we'll be unable to provide rebuttals, as your next round is going to be your opening statements and I'll have to waive the last round. Why do I have to post my argument before yours? You instigated the debate! You should've known that you'd have to go first. Anyway, here are my arguments for prostitution. A. Reduction of Crime I. Rhode Island's Prostitution and Its Effects on Rape and STDsIn Rhode Island, for nearly three decades, prostitution was practically legal through a loophole in the law. \"...examined rates of rape and STDs in Rhode Island from about 2003, the year a court case exposed the inadvertent legalization, to 2009, when the loophole was closed.\"Their paper, Decriminalizing Indoor Prostitution: Implications for Sexual Violence and Public Health, published recently by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that the world's oldest profession prospered after 2003, when folks realized it was essentially legit.\" [1] What did the authors find through this study? \"The pair found that rape decreased by almost one-third, down 31 percent. Gonorrhea decreased by 39 percent.\" [1] This was in Rhode Island alone! Can this not be an example for the rest of America to follow?II. Sex Trafficking Reduction\"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimated that there are around 30 million victims of human trafficking around the world. More than half of the victims (55 percent) are women or girls.\"According to the International Labor Organization, human trafficking generates around $150 billion per year. Two-thirds of this money ($99 billion) comes from commercial sexual exploitation.\"The United States is not immune to the perils of this disgusting industry. Somewhere between 14,500 and 17,500 people are trafficked into the United States every year. The vast majority of these individuals are trafficked for sex work.\" [2]But does prostitution reduce this? In fact, yes! In one example, after Germany made prostitution legal, sex trafficking went down by about 10%. [3] B. MoneyI. Saving MoneyIn the United States, Nevada is the only state to currently allow prostitution. The rest of the U.S has made prostitution illegal. Despite this, money can certainly be saved if only it was legal. \"In the U.S., law enforcement agencies spend at least $2,000 for each arrest of a sex worker \u00e2\u20ac\" that includes the arrest, court, and imprisonment costs. And with the vast number of sex workers in the country, it costs the government more than $120 million a year on prostitution control.\" [4]That makes for a hefty price tag, especially when you consider that there are one million prostitutes in America alone. [5] If it was illegal in the United States, all this money could be saved. II. Making MoneyThis is a simple argument. In America, illegal prostitution businesses don't pay any taxes. However, if brothels were made legal, then they can be made to pay taxes like any other business. \"Since counties began legalizing prostitution in the early 1970s, they have been reaping an economic benefit from a variety of brothel-related revenue sources, including licensing fees, property tax, work card fees and liquor licenses. In total the sources pump more than $10 million into county coffers annually, according to one state study.\" [6]C. Prostitution Is A Victimless CrimeIn prostitution, no one is necessarily harmed as long as it's two consenting adults. So, in a way, it's similar to porn but without the camera. Both are seen as a career where you engage in sexual acts for money. How are they different? (Besides the obvious lack of media.) \"'Prostitution should not be a crime. Prostitutes are not committing an inherently harmful act. While the spread of disease and other detriments are possible in the practice of prostitution, criminalization is a sure way of exacerbating rather than addressing such effects. We saw this quite clearly in the time of alcohol prohibition in this country.\"'...What makes prostitution a \"victimless crime\" in the sense that no one is necessarily harmed by it is that there are consenting adults involved.;'\" [7]D. Free ChoiceAgain, like I said before, prostitution isn't inherently or intentionally trying to hurt anyone. Why can't it be legal, as long as it doesn't restrict the freedoms of others. It's their body, so they should be allowed to go along with their lives however they see fit. ConclusionThank you. I look forward to your opening statements. Good bye.

            "premise": "Thanks for the debate. Introduction: Prostitution should not be legal for various reasons. My opponent and I still have to go through 4 rounds of debate. I will not lay out my entire argument in the first round of debate, as I am sure most of it will get lost along the way. \"The average age of entry into prostitution is 13 years (M.H. Silbert and A.M. Pines, 1982, \"Victimization of street prostitutes, Victimology: An International Journal, 7: 122-133) or 14 years (D.Kelly Weisberg, 1985, Children of the Night: A Study of Adolescent Prostitution, Lexington, Mass, Toronto). Most of these 13 or 14 year old girls were recruited or coerced into prostitution. Others were \"traditional wives\" without job skills who escaped from or were abandoned by abusive husbands and went into prostitution to support themselves and their children. (Denise Gamache and Evelina Giobbe, Prostitution: Oppression Disguised as Liberation, National Coalition against Domestic Violence, 1990)\" [1] 1. Take this source as my first reason prostitution should not be legalized. I am fully aware that you believe sexual intercourse with an underage person should not be allowed. If we use some deductive reasoning, how many teenagers smoke before they are the age of 18 (the legal age to smoke). What about alcohol? If prostitution is legalized, it is highly likely that underage females from very low income areas will try to capitalize on an opportunity to make some money. It is very possible that they would lie about their age and begin a career in prostitution. I feel that this source is a good place to start the debate. Rebuttal to my opponents argument points: \"Personally, it should be a fundamental right to have sex with whoever you want, whenever you want, and whichever way you want as long as both parties agree to the proceedings.\" -People already have the right to do this. No issue needs to be addressed there. \"Some arguments against the legalization of prostitution are semi-valid, usually to the theme of health risks and such\" -Health risks are a small part of the issues associated with prostitution. I prefer to look into the dramatic increase in physical abuse and sexual assaults that would create a much larger burden on law enforcement agencies across the United States. I will jump into those statistics in later arguments. Further, we will also talk about the high rate of victims of child molestation jumping into prostitution. We will also talk about how many drug addicts (meth, crack, heroin), quickly lose money and revert to prostitution as a means to finance another criminal offense. \"Other arguments attempt to define prostitution as a moral issue by saying it's demeaning and should therefore be illegal\" -Prostitution is very demeaning to women and is also immoral. However, I will address other issues associated with Prostitution. \"That argument is like saying that if someone doesn't like a movie because he/she thinks it demeaning, then he/she can make it illegal to see that movie based on subjective value judgement\" -First, this is not the greatest comparison in the world. Watching movies is absolutely nothing like prostitution. I will give my examples in upcoming arguments. \"You should not enforce subjective morality onto others\" -Are you suggesting we legalize all criminal behavior? My arguments will focus on the prostitutes as victims. When you encourage prostitution, a large percentage of females that will start prostitution will start at a very young age as my source identified earlier. How many people start smoking in their thirties? \"Very little data about smoking is regularly collected for kids under 12, but the peak years for first trying to smoke appear to be in the sixth and seventh grades, or between the ages of 11 and 13, with a considerable number starting even earlier. In 2011, 6.1 percent of eighth grade students reported having had their first cigarette by fifth grade (ages 10\"11), and 15.5 percent had tried smoking by eighth grade. More than half of twelfth graders who were current smokers had tried smoking by the end of ninth grade.\" [2] -As you can see in the source I provided, a large number of kids start smoking between the ages of 11 and 13. However the legal age to smoke tobacco is the age of 18. Prostitution carries a very similar path, and if we allow mere children to partake in prostitution so they can make money, we will fail young girls all across the United States. I await your response. [1] http://www.rapeis.org... [2] http://www.tobaccofreekids.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Prostitution Should Be Legal",
            "conclusion": "Prostitution Should Be Legal",
            "premise": "1. The Nordic Approach The Swedish Law punishes those who buy the sex, and not those who were bought. I thought that was pretty straightforward. The Nordic approach has been found to be highly successful, reducing prostitution usage, violence, and trafficking. Other pro-prostitution laws have had the opposite effect, increasing violence (or having no effect) but often increasing trafficking [1]. 2. Consensual sex Often, something being consensual is an illusion. Research studying 9 countries (some of which where prostitution was legal) 89% of prostitutes say they have been forced to be a prostitute, whether it be through coercion or trickery. Further, the amount of trafficking for prostitutes in New Zealand have increased since prostitution decriminalization, presumably increasing the amount of forced prostitutes [1]. The amount of \u201cconsensual\u201d sex in the prostitution business is fairly low. However, what about that 11%? Merely because something is consensual does not make it correct. A gladiator fight, for example, is consensual, but that does not mean the state should let people do what they want with their bodies. 3. Black Markets Everyone agrees you can\u2019t end prostitution; however my opponent assumes legalization will reduce the amount of black markets (and violence) if prostitution was legalized. However, this is simply not the case. The Swedish experience clearly shows reduced violence, coercion, and increases safety by increasing the controls on prostitution [2]. Further, we need to decipher what is intrinsic to all prostitution, and what is not. For example, Farley and Kelly write that violence is, \u201cintrinsic to prostitution.\u201d[3] As violence is intrinsic to prostitution, even when legal, the question is how to best curb some of this violence. Legalization in New Zealand has increased abuse in brothels. What is also interesting is that in Auckland there was a 200-400% increase in street prostitutes (in other words, illegal prostitutes [1]). Although it seems intuitive that legalization would decrease violence and illegal trafficking and black markets, it is shown that the opposite occurs every time. Even in counties in Nevada where prostitution is legal, traffickers often ask to buy the brothels (and it is often answered with a \u201csure\u201d[1]). My opponent and I agree that helping these women is paramount, but the literature indicates legalization is the worst thing to do when attempting to curb black markets, or increase safety. 4. The victimless crime The largest victim in this case is the prostitute, as noted often coerced into the business. Legalization increases the amount of street prostitutes. Now, illegal prostitutes are raped about 55 times a year and legal prostitutes 33 times a year. I would say that\u2019s about the same, as one rape is unacceptable. Now to further explain the data: it seems, number wise, legalization would then reduce the rapes! No, as legalization increases the 55 times a year side, and not to mention the trafficking increases. The fact legalization leads to prostitutes being victims, and increased violence, the biggest victims are those coerced into the business [4]. I can name a few victims, actually. (1) the prostitute, (2) those affected by increased trafficking, and (3) those affected by the increase in street prostitutes after legalization. 5. Safer and efficient It is fairly obvious the harms of prostitution are intrinsic, and are often worsened by legalization. I have demonstrated a strong anti-prostitution law (Sweden, 1997) is the most effective in increasing public awareness and safety about prostitution. Efficient is irrelevant, as any sane person does not want a harmful practice to be efficient. Increasing the money in the business merely increases the harms to society. 1.

            "premise": "Brilliant. Thank you, and I apologize for my tardiness.Nordic ApproachI am still slightly unclear on this proposal (I will allow my opponent to elaborate and make his case), but the basis of this law to me does not make a whole lot of sense. If two adults consent to a sexual activity, what difference does it make that a transaction of money has taken place? In essence, we would be allowing people to be whores and such all they want by offering and giving out their sexual services for free, but we would be denying them a source of income if that is what they choose to do as a living. I disagree. Why make it illegal to pay for something that is perfectly legal to give out for free?People should be legally able to do what they want with their own bodiesMy argument here is simple: I believe that the government should have no interference in the personal lives of a citizen. Such matters are, by definition, personal. If a person chooses to prostitute their body, the government has no right to get into that business. That person made a lifestyle choice and a career move, and they made that decision consciously and independently. To block this choice is nonsensical. Making prostitution illegal creates a dangerous black marketObviously, making prostitution illegal hasn't made prostitution go away. Even in places where prostitution is a crime punishable by death, it still exists. It will never stop existing. It's the same way with a lot of things that are illegal. The real effect that not legalizing prostitution has is that it hurts the prostitutes. These people are subject to abuse, rape, or even murder, all because they can't go to the police due to fear of arrest. Prostitutes are in danger, and legalizing and regulating their work would go a long way to protecting them. Prostitution is victimless and is therefore not a crimeThere are few valid reasons for why prostitution should be illegal beyond a basal religious worldview. Of course, religion shouldn't be taken into account because of the First Amendment to the constitution, which, for all intents and purposes, prohibits us from legislating based on religion. So, beyond that, who is being hurt by prostitution? If a person makes the private choice to pay for a sexual service, there is no harm being done and the government should get out of the way. As I've stated earlier, the only one who could potentially be harmed is the prostitute.Legalized prostitution will be safer and a more efficient private sectorFor all of the reasons I have mentioned above, it is my belief that a legal, regulated prostitution system would not only be safer, but it would also add another sector to our economy. Capitalists who oppose legalized prostitution (and other things for that matter) sounds like an oxymoron to me. Rejecting people from doing what they want without hurting anyone and making money off of it sounds like a capitalist nightmare to me.ConclusionTo sum it all up, the government can protect prostitutes, add a whole new sector to the economy, and stop taking liberty away by making prostitution illegal. Prostitutes and customers have the individual right to make personal and economic decisions of their own without interference from the government, and the only person prostitution could ever potentially harm is the prostitute herself, and that is only when it is illegal and unregulated as it is now in the US.Of course, I would like to allow Con to make his case for the Nordic approach and, if he feels it necessary, to form rebuttals on my arguments.",

            "premise": "Prostitution's History Prostitution has been found in nearly every civilization on Earth stretching back throughout all recorded human history. wherever there have been money, goods, or services to be bartered, somebody has bartered them for sex. Prostitution underscores the concept of supply and demand, which may explain the longevity of this practice. as long as there are people in need of and willing to pay/ barter for the services provided by prostitutes, they will always exist to supply that demand. In essence the profession is here to stay. why it should be legalized Legalizing prostitution will allow it to be taxed and regulated, not only making the government money but also making it safer for thousands of women who are drawn to this profession. Taxation It is a fact that thousands of women, for whatever reasons have turn to prostitution at some point in their lives. This has allowed the practice to flourish and is a thriving estimated billion dollar a year business. A large percent of that money goes to the underground economy and is never taxed. if legalized government would be able to tax those incomes and profits and use those monies to not only develop communities but establish programmes to assists the prostitutes themselves. Regulations. Through legalization the government will be able to regulate the system. Regulations will allow the act to be managed instead of ignored and allow the government to work to prevent underground prostitution that occurs daily. Regulations would be able to curtail the number of teens that are swept up into prostitution every year by enforcing the age of consent and other rules. The regulations will also be able to affect all areas of prostitution such as health and safety and would establish guidelines and implement improvements. ultimately legalized, and regulated prostitution would transfer the power from pimps or organized crime rings to the government. Legalized Prostitution at work As seen in the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands where it is legal , the prostitutes are tax paying citizens and the government ensures that all prostitutes are able to access medical care and work in better conditions by regulating and monitoring working practices and standards. In turn the government enjoys the benefits of steady taxable revenues. (1) http://www.liberator.net... (2) http://www.amsterdam.info...",

            "premise": "Legalization of prostitution would open the doors for much more negativity than you may expect. When looking at the legality of prostitution in the United States, you cannot completely disregard the morality that comes with it. This idea makes STD/HPV viruses much more prone to happen. In fact, evidence from \"laws.com\" located underneath sex crimes, states that well over 50% of prostitutes have contracted a sexually transmitted disease, while simultaneously having unprotected sex over 300 times every single year. Not only will this be harmful to the prostitutes and the clients, but also anyone who also comes in contact with the said people. The idea of \"it is prohibited by law and will always exist in society\" is the same excuse as making methamphetamines legal because it always exists. When the law is broken and disrespected, there will be consequential time spent. We, as a human race all have the same opportunity to do whatever we want; be it legal or not. But when one decides to go against the law of the land, there will be negative repercussions. Making it legal because it already exists is ignorant and is almost a form of our government giving up. Furthermore, if the government were to endorse the sale of mostly women, and sometimes even men, they would be going on a downhill slope of regression. Decriminalizing prostitution and calling it safe is a mere illusion for women who endure physical and psychological trauma. In fact, all brothels do is move this abuse inside to mask the horror involved in being a prostitute. The public would be blinded by the systemic issues involved in this act. How could you endorse the spread of HPV, violence, abuse, and exploitation of these victims? How could you say that regulating prostitution would solve \"forced prostitution and child trafficking\"? Regardless, violence will take place in or out of a brothel and STD's will still swarm the area. If the prostitution industry is grossing over 52 billion dollars a year illegally (bbc.uk.com), just imagine what would happen if it were to be legalized? Generally, the idea of a hypothetical argument must go dismissed, but the numbers have spoken, and they have continued to repeat themselves. And finally, to assume that making prostitution legal would make it easier for women to report rape and sexual injustices, is absolute ignorance and disrespect to those who have fallen victim of sexual violence. The idea of reporting these cases is not easy, and regardless of the legality factor, most acts go unreported because they fear not of going to jail, but of their overall safety. Endorsing prostitution either means you support sexual violence and the spread of STD's or you are just unaware of the horrid activities contained within a brothel. You are blinded that making it legal, automatically makes it safe, but you ignore and disregard the fact that prostitution will never be safe. Thus, it should be illegal.",

            "premise": "The US federal government does not have jurisdiction over prostitution.[1] In most states it is a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime.[1] [2] I assume he is simply stating that the exchange of sex for money should not be prohibited, making US law like Canadian law.[3] Countries like Canada with this policy have added laws to reduce prostitution because of the problems it brings. In Round 1 Pro made the following 4 points: (Grammar mistakes not corrected) 1. \u201cIf both parties adults, government should not take away their freedom to engage in the exchange.\u201d 2. \u201cOf course, child prostitution and forced prostitution should remain illegal.\u201d 3. \"legalization makes prostitution safer\" 4. \u201cMy main argument for legalization is that government should not interfere and should not unnecessarily restrict civil liberties.\u201d Government uses legislation to reduce harm. Legislation on guns, explosives, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and also prostitution fit here. To say \u201cI should be allowed to purchase a nuclear warhead as a free exchange between two consenting adults\u201d is ridiculous. Prostitution causes harm. Legislation is in place to reduce its frequency and the harm done. Pros point 2 shows that he agrees that some aspects of prostitution need to be illegal. Pro claims that legalization makes prostitution safer. He gives no evidence for this claim. The German experience is that legalization of prostitution INCREASED the death toll and violent crime, in part because of the increased numbers of prostitute. Pro says \u201cgovernment should not interfere and should not unnecessarily restrict civil liberties.\u201d Government should carefully consider which issues are so critical that they require legislation. There are such dangers involved in prostitution that it needs to be prohibited by law. Like impaired driving and public intoxication there is both public nuisance and potential for harm that seem to always accompany prostitution. Public nuisance and widespread harm are just two of the reasons that prostitution should NOT be legal. PRO contends that \u201cMost prostitutes chose their profession.\u201d Let me point out major faults with Pros interpretation of a study.[4] 1. There was a move from managed (brothel and escort) to private sector following decriminalization. Danger to sex workers from both violence and disease increase when the go from a \u201cmanaged environment\u201d to \u201cprivate sector.\u201d \u2013 \u201cStreet-based workers were more likely . . . to report refusal of a client to pay, having had money stolen by a client, having been physically assaulted by a client, having been threatened by a client with physical violence, having been held against their will and having been raped in the last 12 months.\u201d 2. The sample was not a random. The majority of participants were white, \u201cbetween the ages of 22 to 45 years, had entered the industry after age 18, and had education levels of at least three to five years at the secondary school level with many having tertiary levels of education\u201d \u2013 the New Zealand study is irrelevant to our situation where our demographic is much different. 3. Even with these survey participants, the picture is horrifying. For example - \u201c87% of all survey participants have a regular doctor but only half of these participants disclose their occupation to their doctor.\u201d This means 13% have no doctor at all, and 51% have not told a doctor that they are in the sex trade. THIS IS AFTER LEGALIZATION! - \u201cparticipants discussed not telling their doctor of their occupation because they thought that there was a stigma attached to sex work and also there was a fear that the knowledge of their occupation would affect their treatment for other health issues.\u201d \u2013 Legalization will not change this, but will increase the number of sex trade workers. - \u201cThere was little difference in disclosure of occupation to health professionals in Christchurch participants pre- and post-decriminalisation.\u201d - \u201cover one tenth of participants reported not using protection at some time in the last 12 months\u201d - \u201cClients frequently request sex without a condom.\u201d . . . some \u201creport doing the job without a condom but charging more.\u201d - \u201cFew participants reported adverse incidents that had happened in the last 12 months to the police.\u201d \u2013 This dispels the myth (PROs claim) \u201cIf sex workers are not treated as criminals, they can seek the protection of law enforcement without fear of being arrested.\u201d This study make me question the wisdom of those who say legalized prostitution will make it less of an issue for worker safety, client health, social health and the ability of workers to seek legal protection. Pro quoted the study about Germany\u2019s failure: \u201cAlthough prostitutes would like to work legally, they often decide not to do so, because local law officials stop them from doing so using local zoning laws.\u201d This is a \u201cred herring\u201d argument. All legal businesses are required to obey local zoning laws. Street prostitutes don\u2019t like being told by club owners that they can\u2019t sell their products there. Brothel owners who want to put their businesses on Main Street. This is little different than someone setting up a hotdog stand (pun not intended) by city hall. Pro failed to counter the health risks of promiscuity. He claims \u201c77.8% always use condoms.\u201d This claim is likely high (error in self reporting is common). It assumes too high an effectiveness of condoms. It ignores the incubation period where diseased people show no symptoms. Look at the following statement by the Center for disease control (CDC).[5] - \u201ccondom use cannot provide absolute protection against any STD. The most reliable ways to avoid transmission of STDs are to abstain from sexual activity, or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner.\u201d [6] Pro failed to counter the link between prostitution and human trafficking. His claim that \u201cIllegal immigrants cannot practice prostitution legally\u201d is absurd. The US has 11.5 million unauthorized immigrants,[7] many working. The political situation around Germany effected the problem of sex trafficking. Sex trafficking happens now. If prostitution is legalized it will increase. Pro claims no \u201cevidence that the legalization of prostitution leads to more rapes, human trafficking, or child prostitution.\u201d This is false. Prostitution is a most dangerous business. More workers in the sex trade places more people at risk. An American study[8] found that prostitutes are 200 times more likely to die (when adjusted for age and race). In Germany the numbers of prostitutes grew ten times since legalization, much of that growth linked to human trafficking and coercion. [1] In USA \u2013 http://en.wikipedia.org...

There will always be a Demand for sex, and likewise there will always be a Supply of it. Many of the woes that people claim come with legalized prostitution (pimping, child trafficking, forced prostitution) would actually be solved by legalizing prostitution as that the legal stigma would vanish. Both prostitutes and \"johns\" would have nothing to fear in approaching the police regarding potential crimes. However, those same crimes listed above are made worse when prostitution is illegal, both because of underworld economics and because prostitutes are less likely to go to police when they fear being arrested (as do their customers).",

Barrows Health Consultant on Human Trafficking for the Christian Medical Association \"HIV and Prostitution: What's the Answer?\" The Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity website Sep. 9, 2005 2.Not a Legitimate Business \"One needs to completely rid oneself of the voracity for cash to see that prostitution, although legalized, can never be a legitimate business because it will always be associated with crime, corruption, class, mass sexual exploitation and human trafficking.\" Virada Somswasdi, JD President of the Foundation for Women, Law and Rural Development (FORWARD) Speech at Cornell Law School Mar. 9, 2004 3.Violence \"Regardless of prostitution's status (legal, illegal or decriminalized) or its physical location (strip club, massage parlor, street, escort/home/hotel), prostitution is extremely dangerous for women. Homicide is a frequent cause of death.... It is a cruel lie to suggest that decriminalization or legalization will protect anyone in prostitution. It is not possible to protect someone whose source of income exposes them to the likelihood of being raped on average once a week.\" Melissa Farley, PhD Founding Director of the Prostitution Research and Education \"Prostitution Is Sexual Violence\" in the Psychiatric Times Oct. 2004 \"Legalizing prostitution will make prostitutes more professional and safe. They will practice only the safest forms of sex.\" How does legalizing something make it safer? Just because it's legal, prostitutes won't completely change to a safer and more professional way. Prostitution is a dangerous job(if it can even be called a job) and that will never change. Anything that has to do with sex and money will result in disgusting circumstances. \"Legalizing prostitution will give the women rights and work in a safe environment.\" All prostitution is harmful. Making something legal doesn't magically make it safe. Legalizing it will not by any means give women rights because that is exactly the opposite of what prostitution is. Prostitution is women selling themselves to men for sex. That is a women giving up their rights so they can get money ( usually used to buy drugs ).",

            "premise": "The Federal IssueI would like to start by saying that if prostitution ever did become legal it should be something chosen on a state by state basis and not by the federal government. For the resolution to reach across all states it would have to be something legalized at the federal level presumably.A Source of Income First of all I don't think prostitution would be as popular as you make it out to be. I don't think people would be willing to have sex for a quick buck. Even if it did become popular it would desensitize sex to a simple hedonistic activity that you can sell at market. i. StrippingWhy can't the stripping industry remain the sole provider for this kind of market. It already helps people make quick money in college and such like you said with out actually having sex. The stripping business being the staple as it is now makes it so prostitution isn't needed. Stripping serves the same purpose as prostitution does. ii. Health IssuesIf prostitution was legalized there would be a whole host of health concerns ranging from hidden medical issues, STDs and liablility problems. What if people hide their medical histories? STDs could run rampart through legal brothels due to indiscretion, carelessness and unsafe sex. If someone lied about having an STD who is liable? The brothel or the person who had the disease or both? What if a prostitute gets pregnant? What happens then? Contraception isn't 100% effective. These are all huge concerns that would have to be managed in court and by the business which frankly can be avoided by keeping stripping joints the way they are and continuing to ban prostitution. Moral Issues The biggest moral issue that would be derived from prostituion is the desensitizing of sex which could lead to a whole host of problems. * It could lead to a rise in teen sex --> teen pregnancy* The family unit would be threatened because if sex is for sale on the streets adultery would be promoted leading to a potential rise in divorce rates * Looks would become something of sexual importance and potential employment purposes in the sex business. * Some people might feel ashamed or soiled after experiencing prostitutionConclusion - Stripping and porn are a suitable way to fill this industry while providing people the finances they need without turning to prostitution- The potential problems with prostitution do not outweigh the potential benefits especially when the market already has strippers and porn.Thank you.",

The burden of proof will be shared equally.Definition to avoid semantics: The practice of engaging in sexual activity with a customer for payment. Note that prostitutes may be male, female, or both; and their customers may be heterosexual, homosexual, or other.An introduction to my arguments: After round 1, I will elaborate on my following arguments:1) People should be able to do what they want with their own bodies.2) By making prostitution illegal, a dangerous black market is created (which is what is happening now).3) Prostitution is victimless and is therefore not a crime.4) Personal and economic decisions of the people are none of the government's business, therefore making prostitution illegal is an intrusion.5) By legalizing prostitution, prostitutes will become safer and the business will be more efficient, adding another sector to the market.Rules: Pretty generic. Maintain a respectful attitude. Round 1 is for acceptance and any clarifications, perhaps a few opening arguments. It doesn't matter.Rounds 2 and 3 will be for statement of positions and rebuttal.Round 4 will be for closing arguments only.Thanks and good luck!",

            "premise": "I remind voters that the resolution is whether or not prostitution should be legalized in the United States. How this is argued is irrelevant, as long as it is effectively argued. PRO has spent a lot of time attempting to unreasonably restrict the scope of my arguments citing some unknown set of rules. He is using fear to detract from his position.1) Sources. There are no problems with sources at this point. Redundant accusation by PRO.2) PRO states: \"it is my opponent's responsibility to show how the economic issues he argues for are applicable to the U.S.\" Gender inequality and prostitution feed a vicious negative feedback loop, where the existence of one will fuel the other. This is evident in my prior posts. Once prostitution becomes legalized or unenforced in America, the potential for this feedback loop manifests in America. There is no reason to take such a risk.3) PRO continually ignores the damage to inroads made in gender equality that legalizing prostitution would do to America. India and South Korea are societies where both exist in copious amounts. We need not follow their path.4) PRO states: \"ultimately prostitution is a different business with different rules in the United States than it is in India.\" No. Prostitution is NOT a business in America, it is illegal and heavily enforced. This is why America ranks high in gender equality. The US is #4 in income equality between the sexes, Japan #80, Korea #109, and India #124. [1]5) PRO states: in India, it's the \"caste system, not prostitution which harms these women and children.\" I disagree. Poor economic conditions in India force girls into slavery, i.e. prostitution. The combination of poverty, lack of women's rights, and prostitution equate to a miserable existence for women caught in this negative feedback loop. A woman should not have to be sold into prostitution because their family is too poor to feed her.6) PRO states: \"Canadian [legislation] protects prostitutes.\" That's great. In the US we simply don't have this problem. Instead we try to find more productive avenues for a woman's time.7) PRO states: \"Canada is far more closely related to the United States in terms of culture and law, and so we can easily foresee this being the outcome of prostitution's legalization in the US.\" PRO and CON are in agreement here. However, Canada has a long tradition of ambiguous laws that made the act of consensual sex for pay legal, but nearly every other aspect of prostitution illegal, to include \"communicating in a public place for the purpose of selling or buying sex, keeping or using a [brothel], and procurement[/pimping].\" [2] This is de facto criminalization of prostitution, valid as of 2008. If you cannot legally negotiate terms of a deal, how can you effectively conduct any significant business?Canada is experimenting with the gradual process of legalizing prostitution, but before it does, for all intents and purposes prostitution is illegal. Canada currently enjoys high gender equality rates, on par with the US - it ranks #14 in income equality. [1] Canada is taking the risk that it may enter the negative feedback loop of prostitution <=> gender inequality. All it would take is one significant economic downturn while prostitution is legal. Women, who due to their less privileged status in the work force, would probably be affected more by a downturn and would see prostitution as a way out. The objectifying of women would begin here, gender inequality would materialize, and the negative feedback loop would solidify. THIS IS THE RISK, AND THERE IS NO REASON FOR AMERICA TO TAKE IT.The choice is clear. There is precedence where societies with entrenched views on prostitution have an almost grotesque views on women's rights. Vote CON.

I predict my opponent will say something along the lines of \"My body, my rights\", and that's what I'll get to later. Second off, what kind of society would we be creating for ourselves if we allow prostitution. A society that basically believes that women are good only for sex work? That's not the kind of society I want to live in, or the kind of society I want the next generation to grow up in. And than there are the two downfalls of prostitution; the spread of STDS, and the unwanted children. I have no doubt that no matter how much government regulation there is, the spread of STDS would lead to a public health crisis. And imagine how many children the prostitutes would have. And don't say \"Just get abortoins\" because abortion is even more unethical than prostitution itself.",

            "premise": "Pro begins round 3 with the illogical statement: (grammar mistakes quoted exactly) \u201cbeing a prostitute is about as dangers as being a fisherman.\u201d This is either an intentional attempt to mislead, or a poor understanding of math and statistics. He states that the homicide rate for prostitutes is 200 and then tries to compare that to the death rate for fisherman. A true comparison would be the homicide rate of prostitutes to the homicide rate for fisherman or the death rate for prostitutes to the death rate for fishermen. I would have more sympathy for this error if PRO had not misquoted the facts so obviously. Death rate by homicide in active prostitutes was 229[1], but the overall death rate (CMR) was 459. Compare this to the CMR for USA (9) or Canadian (8) general population.[2] This makes a prostitute 50 times more likely to die than an average citizen. I was surprised to learn that \u201cHomicide is the second leading cause of death on the job for workers in the United States.\u201d[3] The major factors were listed in the study as \u201c contact with the public; exchange of money; and working alone, at night, or in high-crime areas are risk factors for workplace homicide Several studies also report high rates of homicide associated with taxicab services, grocery stores, convenience stores, bars, nightclubs, and gasoline stations.\u201d There is also a strong link to ethnicity of both the individual AND their fellow workers. These factors would not change by simply legalizing prostitution. PRO continues argue for the safety of legalized prostitution based on anecdotal (the worst kind) evidence[4] Prostitutes, clients and managers were interviewed\u2013 This is the kind of background work you do before designing a scientific study. Included in this study were quotes like \u201cPanic buttons are a joke . . . usually they\u2019re across the room, but if you can get across the room you can get out the door.\u201d This was from a \u201cstudy\u201d claiming the safety merits of legalized brothel prostitution. Let me recap why Prostitution should NOT be legal Simply allowing the sale of sex for money will not remove the problems of prostitution. Because this is a state (not federal) issue in the US, the laws that grow up around prostitution will be a patchwork of local and state regulations that encourage sex trafficking and other criminal activity. We use legislation to protect society, and the dangers of prostitution merit tighter laws and more enforcement to keep people from getting into sex trades too easily. There are many health issues of promiscuity. These are not only issues for sex workers, but for their customers, and for the intimate partners of those customers. The best way to limit harm is to keep prostitution illegal, and to find more effective methods of enforcement. Prostitution has many links to organized crime and illegal drug use. These ties will not simply disappear if prostitution were legalized. This would give more money laundering opportunities to criminal enterprise. In The US the average age of entry into street prostitution is 12-14 years.[5] Sex slavery and sex trafficking are a core part of prostitution, even in countries like Germany where it is legal. Legalization only makes the numbers larger. We have legislation to protect the vulnerable. There are age restrictions for alcohol and tobacco. Many drugs are prohibited completely. Speed limits are enforced. In Prostitution, the dangers to the workers and their clients are so high (and there are no benefits) that it needs to be completely prohibited. The prohibition against men taking advantage of women by making them prostitutes is ancient,[6] and there is no reason to think society will get better by legalizing prostitution. As the USA moves towards universal health care and socialized medicine there is an even bigger need to reduce, not increase, prostitution. As the taxpayer ends up paying the cost for medical care of prostitutes and their clients you will pay a huge cost for legalized prostitution. \u201cProstitutes health care needs exceed those of most other women.\u201d[7] Not only is there a high price to pay for medical treatment of prostitutes, but most sexually transmitted diseases have an incubation period where the disease is infectious, but not yet diagnosed. This makes the transfer to client and coworkers a danger as well. New strains of multi drug resistant STDs are appearing among prostitutes who use antibiotics \u201cjust in case\u201d. [8] [9] \u201cThe rapid spread was associated with transmission in high risk individuals (that is, prostitutes and their clients).\u201d This was in the Netherlands where prostitution is legal and carefully controlled. In Germany the legalization of prostitution did exactly what would be expected. The number of prostitutes went up, and the price of a prostitute\u2019s service went down. Homicide rates went up. Incidents of violence increased. Human Trafficking increased. These are not good for society or individuals. Pro states that prostitution should be legalized. He wants us to work hard to change our laws so that more harm can come to more people. His position would increase costs to the taxpayer. (for the possible benefit of lowering the cost of a prostitute) There is no good reason to legalize prostitution. There are many good reasons to increase enforcement.

            "premise": "Alright! Good arguments! Here are my refutations. Your first argument is this: \"The average age of entry into prostitution is 13 years (M.H. Silbert and A.M. Pines, 1982, \"Victimization of street prostitutes, Victimology: An International Journal, 7: 122-133) or 14 years (D.Kelly Weisberg, 1985, Children of the Night: A Study of Adolescent Prostitution, Lexington, Mass, Toronto). Most of these 13 or 14 year old girls were recruited or coerced into prostitution. Others were \"traditional wives\" without job skills who escaped from or were abandoned by abusive husbands and went into prostitution to support themselves and their children. (Denise Gamache and Evelina Giobbe, Prostitution: Oppression Disguised as Liberation, National Coalition against Domestic Violence, 1990)\" [1] 1. Take this source as my first reason prostitution should not be legalized. I am fully aware that you believe sexual intercourse with an underage person should not be allowed. If we use some deductive reasoning, how many teenagers smoke before they are the age of 18 (the legal age to smoke). What about alcohol? If prostitution is legalized, it is highly likely that underage females from very low income areas will try to capitalize on an opportunity to make some money. It is very possible that they would lie about their age and begin a career in prostitution. My refutation to that is even if prostitution remains illegal, this same kind of underage of prostitution would occur. Your points heavily imply that underage girls would lie about there age to begin a career in prostitution, however, therefore slightly increasing the number of people being introduced to the trade of prostitution. Whether or not your point is valid or not, that still should NOT affect just some random, normal people who want to conduct a safe business transaction. I.e. The x and y example I gave in round 1. Your reason is basically painting everyone with the same brush. Isn't it better to legalize it and regulate it to eliminate the problem of underage prostitution? Oh, one more thing: \"Others were \"traditional wives\" without job skills who escaped from or were abandoned by abusive husbands and went into prostitution to support themselves and their children.\" Well, if they didn't have any other skills, and they needed to support their family, isn't it a good thing that they went into prostitution? \"Personally, it should be a fundamental right to have sex with whoever you want, whenever you want, and whichever way you want as long as both parties agree to the proceedings.\" -People already have the right to do this. No issue needs to be addressed there. Well, actually, no. X couldn't go up to y, offer him money for sex, and then have consensual sex, because of this draconian, invasive law. In this example of prostitution I give, all the criteria I listed above is met, and they are still not allowed to do it. Therefore, it is an issue that needs to be addressed. SIDE NOTE: They are not hurting anyone. X wants sex, y wants money, they make a deal that helps both of them! Maybe y likes having sex? Who knows! \"Some arguments against the legalization of prostitution are semi-valid, usually to the theme of health risks and such\" -Health risks are a small part of the issues associated with prostitution. I prefer to look into the dramatic increase in physical abuse and sexual assaults that would create a much larger burden on law enforcement agencies across the United States. I will jump into those statistics in later arguments. Further, we will also talk about the high rate of victims of child molestation jumping into prostitution. We will also talk about how many drug addicts (meth, crack, heroin), quickly lose money and revert to prostitution as a means to finance another criminal offense. Ready to address this when it comes up. \"Other arguments attempt to define prostitution as a moral issue by saying it's demeaning and should therefore be illegal\" -Prostitution is very demeaning to women and is also immoral. However, I will address other issues associated with Prostitution. Some prostitutes might actually enjoy sex and do not necessarily view it as immoral. What is so wrong about mutually beneficial transaction that does not hurt anyone else? What's so demeaning about that? And besides, when prostitutes entered the biz, they accepted the premise that it would be \"demeaning\" (Which it isn't.) \"You should not enforce subjective morality onto others\" -Are you suggesting we legalize all criminal behavior? My arguments will focus on the prostitutes as victims. When you encourage prostitution, a large percentage of females that will start prostitution will start at a very young age as my source identified earlier. How many people start smoking in their thirties? No, I'm not suggesting we should legalize all criminal behavior. When someone, without the other persons consent, harms them in a significant way, that's illegal. However, prostitution has consent on both sides and no significant harm, therefore relying on a subjective moral value judgement in order to make it illegal. For example, if I started a religion that said drinking tea should be punished by getting stoned to death, that obviously would not become law since that's a subjective moral value judgement, and not one that everyone needs to take. 1. Legalizing something is not encouraging it. 2. Prostitution and smoking are two very different things. I doubt prostitution would be \"the next big thing\" for kids if it got legalized. All it would show is that two people can engage in consensual sex for money without fear of going to jail. All right, once more, good arguments from you. Good luck with your response.",

For the purposes of this debate, anything that deals with legal matters will pertain within U.S. jurisdiction.

To start off, let's get a few definitions on the table: [Word - Prostitution] [Source - http://www.merriam-webster.com...] The act or practice of engaging in promiscuous sexual relations especially for money [Word - Should] [Source - http://www.merriam-webster.com...] Used in auxiliary function to express obligation, propriety, or expediency [Word - Legalized] [Source - http://www.merriam-webster.com...] To make legal ; especially : to give legal validity or sanction to ==================== Prostitution is not \"wrong\" or \"immoral\" ==================== I argue that there is nothing morally wrong with prostitution. If consenting sex is obviously legal, then why not consenting sex with money? There is nothing in making a job out of consensual sex - it does nothing to harm either party. ==================== Conclusion ==================== I realize that my argument is small, short, and not much. However, I expect that if my opponent doesn't try to argue against the morality of prostitution, he will instead argue against the practicality of it. I am entirely aware of these arguments, but I have no clue what various one my opponent will use - refuting several POSSIBLE arguments is a waste of time. Anyway, I await my opponent's response. Good debating for the both of us!",

            "premise": "Sorry for the late reply. Got caught up IRL.With regards to the spreading of disease by prostitutes, the solution is simple. The Beatles song, Ticket to Ride, is about a document required of all prostitutes working legally in Hamburg according to John Lennon[1]. A similar regulation would prevent the spread of disease by prostitutes. In addition, a prostitute would be wholly within his/her rights to demand a clean bill of health from a potential customer. By Con's logic regarding the spread of disease, we should also illegalize dating apps[2], promiscuity, or just plain Millenials having sex[3]. Equating prostitution to using methamphetamines is quite a stretch, although I can see the logic. However, those hiring a prostitute do so for the purposes of sexual intercourse, which is natural and normal. The effects caused by meth use (particularly crystal meth) tend to put the user in a state of hyperwakefulness. Some using meth may to react violently and there are those who use it solely to prep before committing a violent crime.[4] It is not the drug itself that makes it illegal, but the criminal activity that tends to accompany its use. Beyond the current prohibition on prostitution, there is no criminal activity that goes beyond sex. And if one were to argue that somehow sex is criminal, one would have to admit that one's own existence is the result of criminal behavior. You also say something of a slippery slope, and that is the same kind of argument that was offered by the Religious Right about homosexuality.To argue against my point on the legalization of prostitution as a way to prevent violence against prostitutes, you say \"all brothels do is move this abuse inside to mask the horror involved in being a prostitute\". However, the victim would merely have to go to a police station (or reach out to some emotionally attached \"john\") in order to file a legitimate complaint. If my manager strikes me at work, he has not only committed a crime, but handed me the ability to sue the company. The same would go for the prostitute. In addition, due to legalization, there would no law against prostitutes merely employing themselves, thus doing away with pimps altogether.You make the unsupported assertion (granted, in response to my unsupported assertion) that legalizing prostitution would greatly reduce child trafficking. Of course it would! Under the current prohibition, pimps are safer exploiting children because this implicates any customers in the act as well. However, with legalized prostitution, \"johns\" would have no need to visit shady underworld pimps or brothels, as that there would be ones with women of legal age (which I think should be at least 21) to be a prostitute. Any suspicion of child trafficking could be immediately reported by a john or a fellow prostitute without any fear of incarceration for themselves.I do like the non-sequitur of associating prostitution with rape. Prostitution is the act of selling sex to a client. Rape is forcing some to have sexual relations. The two are not related. And again, prostitutes who are raped would be entitled to equal protection under the law by police. You say \"Endorsing prostitution either means you support sexual violence and the spread of STD's or you are just unaware of the horrid activities contained within a brothel.\" Well, if we are to prevent these things from ever happening, we should prohibit relations between men and women altogher. Maybe just have matchmakers pick out husbands and wives who can only meet under strict circumstances. I've only offered a way to reduce the threat to prostitutes and clients, who already exist and will continue to exist. As for your the final line, \"ignore and disregard the fact that prostitution will never be safe. Thus, it should be illegal.\", we should merely examine its logic. If we illegalize all professions which are not safe, than we should illegalize the military, the police, the firefighters, the sewage workers, the electricians, and on and on the list goes. I am merely pointing at a way for men and women who already work as prostitutes to either seek help from police to escape pimps or take control of their own professions. And to others who are either completely without talents or just enjoy sex alot and wish to capitalize on it, I say \"why not?\"1)https://www.beatlesbible.com...2)https://www.thesun.co.uk...3)http://www.msn.com...4)https://www.drugabuse.gov...",

            "premise": "The main reason why prostitution should be legalised is health related. Right now prostitution is the leading cause of STDs, but only because it is illegal and practised on street corners. If prostitution was legal, prostitutes would be checked constantly and clients could be required to prove they are healthy. In Australian brothels all men must be checked before going there. As long as prostitution is illegal, it is impossible to control their health. Legalizing it, however, allows you to check both the prostitutes and their clients constantly in order to significantly reduce infections. Also, legalising prostitution would eliminate most pimps, because prostitutes would be able to work on their own. Sure, some would still work for pimps, but they would clearly act very differently. The reason pimps can abuse prostitutes is because they cannot call the police or complain in any way. Legalizing prostitution would give prostitutes a chance to report the abusive pimps to the police without risking their own freedom. Human trafficking would be just the same if prostitution was legal. Legalizing prostitution doesn't mean legalizing human trafficking. Also, legalizing prostitution wouldn't have any effect of human trafficking, it wouldn't make it easy or encourage more people to do it. Legal prostitution would also mean a very different work space for prostitutes. As long as prostitution is illegal, they must work on the streets. Legalizing it would allow them to work in more decent and safe conditions. This would also solve the problem of safety. Prostitutes are very vulnerable. This is why most serial killer kill prostitutes. When you allow prostitutes to work in decent, clean, safe, legal brothels, you also protect them from murderers or abusive clients. These are the main benefits of legalizing prostitution. I don't have much time so I will post my rebuttals in the next round.",

            "conclusion": "Prostitution should be legal in each state.",
            "premise": "1. Prostitutes are not hurting society. They are simply working hard. Naturally, there is no ban on prostitution. It is simply another profession and the capitalist, free government should not hinder this form of work. It is a victimless crime and nobody is hurt. There is no purpose in banning prostitution. 2. One great reason to legalize prostitution: Right now, prostitutes are forced to hire pimps. Pimps are unfortunate. They beat prostitutes and can force them to do whatever they want them to do. But prostitutes are forced to go to pimps for protection. However, prostitutes would be able to go to police if their occupation was legal. This would put abusive, violent pimps out of business. And would get the police to protect their actual citizens. Right now, a prostitute cannot report to the police even if she is raped, because she risks getting arrested. Under legal prostitution, she could be protected by the police instead of abusive pimps. 3. Prostitutes currently make up a sizable amount of the population. If prostitutes were legal, they would provide tax revenue. This is much needed tax revenue, when many governments are low in money and forced to go in debt. 4. Las Vegas legalized prostitution. It works well. There are frequent STD tests. And regulation. Unlike in a state with illegal prostitution. There are illegal prostitutes who have all sorts of STDS, but in Las Vegas, there is regulation. And prostitutes with STDs are forced to go out of business or get cured. This is obviously a better model. 5. The constitution lists a few natural rights including liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These should not be infringed. 6. The constitution restricts government power using the word \"not\" 24 times. It is obvious that our government is founded upon the princiole of liberty and lack of government infringement in our personal lives and personal tastes. 7. Prohibition has historically been ineffective. Alcohol prohibition did not work. And we should learn from our history. (http://www.cato.org...) The prohibition on drugs is not effective. (http://www.lasvegasmercury.com...) The prohibition on prostitution is not effective anyway. (http://www.echeat.com...) Why would we do something that harms us so much and does not even work? 8. Prohibtion causes underground black markets. Drug dealers and gangs deal their drugs. We saw notorious gangsters and Al Capone with alcohol prohibition. Now, we see gangs and pimps doing prostitution illegally. This is a problem, because allows gangs to fight for territory and other things and unnecessary lives are lost. 9. Prohibtion causes underground black markets. Drug dealers and gangs deal their drugs. We saw notorious gangsters and Al Capone with alcohol prohibition. Now, we see gangs and pimps doing prostitution illegally. Also, prostitution is illegal, so gangs use it as a source of funding. By making prostitution illegal, we are indirectly funding gangs. If prostitution was legalised, no gang would make money from it, because they would be discouraged from it. 10. Prohibition uses much police resources. When we use police to enforce prostitution laws, we use taxpayer dollars to enforce an ineffective, useless, and harmless law. Police could use the resources they use to criminalize prostitutes to protect its citizens from actual harmful things, deeds and people. 11. When the Netherlands ended drug prohibition, drug use was reduced. (http://www.drugwarfacts.org...) The same thing has happened with alcohol prohibtion here in the states. When we legalize prostitution, it is very likely that prostitution will be reduced or even halfed like in the Netherlands with prohibition on drugs. 12. We must fight hard for every single liberty we have. Cambodia, Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany all prove this. It is rare when enormous rights are taken away instantly. For example, in Nazi Germany, Jews were forced to wear a gold star and they were cool with that. Then, Jews had to register as such. Hitler, eventually, suspeneded the constitution. And finally, there were concentration camps. When the Jews saw the trucks taking them away, they did not fight, because they were used to the destruction and ignoring of rights and the German citizens accepted it only because it was gradual. This will happen in America if we allow it. It is not unreasonable to believe that if we allow them to take away rights like prostitution rights, they will take away the next right, and the next right, and the next right, until we are finally stripped of all human rights. Protect our human rights! History tells us to fight against every violation of rights! Vote PRO!!!",

            "conclusion": "In the United States, prostitution should be legal.",
            "premise": "First, (1)As I know, approximately 2-third of Nevada only allow prostitution in USA. So, of course you and I cannot easily found the evidence presented there that legal prostitution in the united states is harmful to the overall, mostly secular, society in the United States. This thing are not effective objection against opposition of allowing prostitution because USA still prohibit prostitution in the most area. So, we do not know the effect of allowing prostitution, and we cannot deal with this problem related to this topic yet. Your pointing is missed. (2)Public benefit means the profit of the more individuals. Of course, public benefit is often the second hand profit and individual right is often the first hand profit, but if the public benefit still bigger than private benefit, we should seriously consider these things. If the rights conflict each other, we cautiously think what rights are greater than others and we should choose the greater one if we cannot guarantee both of them. Do your bill of rights order you should not deal with this problem to this way? In addition, although the example of 'http://seattlepi.nwsource.com......' shows 'the courts have shown an outright disrespect for the dignity of women in other much more recent laws.', it cannot justify 'to refute the idea that criminalization of prostitution is somehow done to prevent indignity.' First, it is a only one example. Although you can show me more examples, I cannot still have conviction it is the major trend in the USA judges because I don't know the percentage of this case than the whole case related with the dignity of women. Second, in this case, the attitude of supreme court should be changed first, not allowing prostitution that can do more violate the dignity of women. Your country should not mess more the dignity of women because of the attitude of judges. 'Who does society tend to view with a greater amount of dignity, she who obeys the law, or she who breaks the law? Some of the stigma and loss of dignity for prostitutes stems, not from the act, but from the law.' No, as I have mentioned before, 'The use of a woman's body solely for the purpose of sexual gratification does not treat them as a person. This lack of respect dehumanizes both prostitute and client, and this situation can violate the dignity of both sex.'. Not only law but also the act can violate dignity of women. In addition, I cite more arguments from the site. (http://www.idebate.org...) 'The legalisation of the \u2018Bunny Ranch' in Nevada did not prevent the majority of prostitutes from continuing to work outside of the licensed brothel, and remain dependent on pimps. This is because brothels are more expensive environments for prostitutes to work and clients to visit. Rent, health checks, and security, are some of the costs which make it uneconomic for some prostitutes to be employed in brothels. In Britain, where prostitution is virtually prohibited, some prostitutes use private apartments, whilst others work on the street. Legalisation of prostitution does not remove the street market, or the dangers associated with it. The dangerous street environment is generated by simple economics, not legal controls.' Because of this, if your country allow prostitution in the whole country, the violating dignity of women can be more serious and can do more happen. http://menstuff.org... With nearly 1/4 the married people in the US participating in intercourse outside of marriage I hardly think we can consider faithfulness a fundamental aspect of American society. I would also challenge my opponent to describe how it might be possible for a prostitute, short of rape, which is not generally paid for, to actually cause a violation of the rule of marry? Isn't a larger part of the responsibility to maintaining that law of marry on those who are actually involved in the marriage?> I agree your opinion in this part. 'I could also read this argument to say that it is or should be unlawful or at least wrong, to participate in intercourse outside the bounds of marriage. It is difficult to be sure because within the bounds of marriage could apply to either no intercourse before marriage or no outside intercourse after marriage. Either way, in the United States women are not expected to wait for marriage to engage in intercourse. Nearly half of girls age 17 have had sex, but don't marry until the mid 20s. This was taken from: http://marriage.rutgers.edu...... Therefore this standard of virginity at marriage is not fundamental to American Society.' But, prostitution is not only a virginity problem. It is also the problem of the dignity of women. Do you really think virginity and dignity are the same mean? 'Pornography is legal. This means that it is legal for a woman to have sex in front of a camera for pay, but take the camera away and it is illegal.' But, I want to know more USA have NOT ANY restrictions of allowing pornography. I want you elaborate this. In addition, even if pornography is legal in the current situation, I don't think it is the reason of agreeing allowing prostitution because the pornography can also be illegal because of the same reason. If not, there are more reasons can be existed. First, What make you think morals are the extension of religious belief? Even though, if prohibiting prostitution is only based on moral and religious reason, if you still argue prohibiting prostitution is wrong because of these reasons, you have a serious mistake. Because, you didn't say why the religious belief and moral reasons that support prohibiting prostitution are wrong. Of course I think you can say 'As I have mentioned before, religion and government should never mix.' But, this reason must need more detail explain. In addition, don't you think 'individual right(freedom)' are also based on these mentions in the 'Declaration of Independence' - That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness - Don't the 'creator' mean 'God or holly existence'? How can you explain this without the effect from religious belief to the government? So, What is the exact mean of 'religion and government should never mix'? Finally, as I have mentioned before, I already showed you an example of Nevada in this writing against your argument to the way of dealing with the prostitution. And, I agree to 'Certainly there will always be those that operate a business in an illegal manner. There are illegal day cares even! All business are vulnerable to this.'. But, most of other jobs cannot be compared as prostitution in the aspects of human dignity because most of other jobs do not basically violate worker's dignity unlike prostitution. I can show you the reasons to the final round in my turn. I'll wait your final reply in this debate.",

            "premise": "Alright, sorry for taking so long! Good arguments once more! \"My refutation to that is even if prostitution remains illegal, this same kind of underage prostitution would occur\". -That is absolutely true, but when you legalize something, people will find ways to take advantages of those opportunities. The fact that something is illegal and can be punished acts as a deterrent. It will not deter all crime, but it will deter some crime. I will briefly explain why some punishments are implemented. The prison system acts as a deterrent to criminal activity and it also protects society by incarcerating those who may do additional harm to others. As I mentioned, the criminality of something will not deter all crime, but it does deter some. True, but I think it's a pretty low number as to be completely significant, but I get your point. I'll give that one to you, it's valid. However, underage prostitutes should not affect everyone else who is completely of age and can make there own choices. You can have sex for every other reason you want, except money. The crime is completely determined by motivation! It's basically convicting someone and throwing them in jail for having the wrong motivation to have sex. I'll replace having sex in this situation I'll replace the words \"having sex\" with say, eating a burrito. If I eat a burrito because I like the burrito, it's fine, but when I do it because I want money, it's suddenly illegal? What? You should not send someone to JAIL just because they engaged in the benign act of paying someone for sex. Nothing inherently bad about that. What people who don't support the legalization of prostitution need to understand that money for sex, when cut down to the basics, there is nothing inherently bad about that. It's paying someone to perform an act which does not harm anyone else. The problem isn't the act itself, the problem is the industry which surrounds it, so wouldn't it be better to legalize it so we could take steps to eliminate this abusive industry and keep the prostitutes safe? \"I would like you to define what safe is.\" Maybe I used the wrong word there, but my point is still valid and it still stands. -Take this statistic for example! In 1991, 85% of prostitutes/clients reported history of sexual abuse in childhood; 70% reported incest! Would you consider that to be a tragedy? For arguments sake, lets say over 75% of prostitutes were sexually abused as children. Is it fair to conclude that many if not most prostitutes were sexually abused as children? That being said, do you feel that prostitution is justified knowing that a majority of them were abused as young children? Is there a link between sexual abuse as a child and prostitution? I believe there is, and to truly fight prostitution, we must fight the sexual abuse of children. Further, we must find a better way to identify these children (schools would be the greatest place). Okay, it's fair to say many prostitutes were abused as children. But how about the prostitutes that weren't and chose the profession from their own free will? And even if there was a link between all of them, isn't the damage already done? Why should something that could be, but not always, a result of something that's illegal be declared illegal simply because it's the result of illegal activity? That doesn't make any sense. Say, hypothetically, getting hit by a car can lead to becoming a burger flipper, a less than desirable job. Does that mean that burger flipping should be declared illegal? No. Your point, no offense, is really muddled. \"Personally, it should be a fundamental right to have sex with whoever you want, whenever you want, and whichever way you want as long as both parties agree to the proceedings.\" -People already have the right to do this. No issue needs to be addressed there. \"Well, actually, no. X couldn't go up to y, offer him money for sex, and then have consensual sex, because of this draconian, invasive law. In this example of prostitution I give, all the criteria I listed above is met, and they are still not allowed to do it. Therefore, it is an issue that needs to be addressed.\" -I agree, that would be entirely illegal, you must have not provided that information in your initial argument. Please refer to the sentence I used as reference for your argument. Alright. In the example I gave of X paying y for sex, and then having it consensually, that met the criteria that I presented. Then you said that we already have the right to do this. And then I said no, we don't have the right to do this because the example I gave met all the criteria for the rights we should have and it's still illegal. Then you agreed with me and said that yes, it would be entirely illegal. However, your statement is illogical, since before you said that we do have the right to do the things that meet the criteria, and my example certainly met the criteria. Your contradicting yourself. Look, I think you're a skilled debater, yet you're not being reasonable. \"SIDE NOTE: They are not hurting anyone. X wants sex, y wants money, they make a deal that helps both of them! Maybe y likes having sex? Who knows!\" -You mention that nobody is getting hurt? 80% of women in prostitution have been the victim of a Rape. Additionally, 68% - 70% are being Raped! Based on that statistic, can you still conclude that \"They are not hurting anyone\"? You need to understand the vulnerabilities of Prostitutes. First, a majority of them were sexually abused as children and started prostitution by the age of 12-14 years. Then not only were they sexually abused as children, exploited as minors, 70% of them are RAPED while on the job? How is nobody getting hurt? Where do you not see exploitation? I was reffering to the example I gave where x and y have consensual sex, not rape. I do understand that rape is a huge problem in the prostitution industry. It is sick and it is wrong. However, in the example I gave where x and y have consensual sex and hurt nobody, my point was that that harmless act of consensual sex is considered illegal by these draconian prostitution laws. And since there's this trend of abuse and rape in the prostitution industry, wouldn't it be better to legalize it so we can regulate it and make sure this stuff doesn't happen? \"Up to 95% of women in prostitution are problematic drug users, including around 78% heroin users and rising numbers of crack cocaine addicts (Home Office 2004a).\" [2] Conclusion of Round 3. -Let me break this down. We have \"75% of women involved in prostitution started as children\" [2]. A large percentage of prostitutes reported sexual abuse as children. While conducting the act of prostitution 70% of prostitutes reported they have been Raped. Lastly, \"95% of women in prostitution are problematic drug users including 78% of them identified as HEROIN users. Yes, so why don't we legalize the industry so we can regulate it. The problem here isn't the prostitution itself, it's the heroin and rape which can occur as a result of that. Whether or not heroin should be considered legal is honestly a matter of opinion, so I'm not gonna debate that, however, allow me this allegory. At bars and such and such, people can get really rowdy and beat each other up. Does that mean bars should be illegal? No. That is all. Good arguments all around, from both sides if I might say myself.",

Sex workers should be registered. This way, it will be easier to for law enforcement and potential clients when sex workers are minors, when they are forced or when they are illegal immigrants.(Another debate of mine on this topic never really took place, so I copied and pasted the opening arguments.)I am surprised that you are against legalization of prostitution, because on your profile you claim to be libertarian. My main argument for legalization is that government should not interfere and should not unnecessarily restrict civil liberties.I am looking forward to an interesting debate.",

In fact if legal brothels are state owned and so technically there is still a manager or pimp, which of course would be the state. And by what I have read there still happens to be forced human trafficking in the Netherlands, so there of course would still be pimps abducting and using violence for human trafficking and would easily be concealed in the opened as other legal prostitutions go on.

            "premise": "Danger of Prostitution Prostitution is not without risk. The death rate of fisherman is 200. The homicide rate for prostitutes was 229. Murders of African American: 18-24: 102. (rates are per 100,000, per year) Sources: http://jobs.aol.com... http://www.feministcritics.org... http://aje.oxfordjournals.org... In other words, being a prostitute is about as dangers as being a fisherman, and twice as dangerous as just being and African American male between the ages of 18 to 24. The homicide rate of prostitutes is likely to be exaggerated.The homicide rate of prostitutes was measured during the period 1967-1999 (32 years) during which overall homicide rates were higher. Also the sample sizeis small (117) and uses only samples from one town (Colorado Springs) that cannot represent all of the United States. The risks of illegal prostitution in Colorado is still relatively high. Prostitution can be safer. The only state in the USA where prostitution is legal is Nevada. A study about prostitution in Nevada brothels says: \u201cOf more than 40 prostitutes we interviewed, from large and small, sub- urban and rural brothels across Nevada, only one reported any personal experience with violence in the brothels.\u201d \u201cThere is strong indication from the interview, document analysis, and ethnographic data presented here that legal brothels generally offer a safer working environment than their illegal counterparts. Regulated brothels offer particular ways of dealing with pragmatic safety issues and minimizing actual violence, including violence passed from johns to prostitutes and back to johns through diseases, viruses, and infections. Nevada brothels offer specific mechanisms to protect workers via the ways transactions are organized, the ways technology is ordered, the visibility of customers, the bureaucratic relationships among customers, managers, and workers, and the cooperation with police based on the mere fact of their legality. All of these mechanisms work to eliminate systematic violence and to discourage an atmosphere of danger and risk that, as a mirror image of fact, is significant.\u201d http://esplerp.org... The publication below shows, that few clients asks for sex without condoms in Nevada Brothels, and no clients had penetrative sex without condoms: http://ajph.aphapublications.org...; \u201cSince those rules for Nevada brothels went into effect in 1988, the report said, there have been no cases of HIV infection and a negligible rate of STDs, the Los Angeles Times reports.\u201d Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com... The issue with \u201crisks of promiscuity\u201d seems misplaced. If condoms are always used, the probability of the ripping of a condom, one of the partners being infected by an STD, and one of the partners being infected by the others, are relatively small. It is not an unreasonable risk. So: Prostitution CAN be relatively safe, especially if it is legal. My opponent claims that the number of prostitutes grew tenfold in Germany after legalization. This number is probably fiction, at least I did not find this number in any of the references he gives (but perhaps he can point it out to me where he got this number from). Clearly, after legalization, prostitutes do not have to hide their profession. So this may cause an increase in the number of known prostitutes. But in any case, there is nothing wrong with prostitution, as long is it is practiced safely between two consenting adults. So an increase in prostitution should not be necessarily be considered as a bad thing, especially if legalization also makes it possible to make prostitution safer. New Zealand study The New Zealand study shows that legalization in New Zealand was a success. Let me rebut the criticisms of my opponent: CON wrote:1. There was a move from managed (brothel and escort) to private sector following decriminalization. Danger to sex workers from both violence and disease increase when the go from a \u201cmanaged environment\u201d to \u201cprivate sector.\u201d \u2013 \u201cStreet-based workers were more likely . . . to report refusal of a client to pay, having had money stolen by a client, having been physically assaulted by a client, having been threatened by a client with physical violence, having been held against their will and having been raped in the last 12 months.\u201d Rebuttal: I think CON confuses the 3 categories. There is \u201cmanaged environment\u201d (like brothels etc.), \u201cprivate sector\u201d (prostitutes working for themselves indoors) and \u201cstreet prostitutes\u201d. Street prostitutes is definitely more dangerous than \u201cmanaged environment\u201d and \u201cprivate sector\u201d, but there is not a big difference between \u201cmanaged environment\u201d and \u201cprivate sector\u201d. \u201cPrivate workers reported moving into private work because it provided a safer working environment, where they could earn more and attract better clients. \u201c In other words, the move to private sector was a GOOD thing! It made them safer!!! CON wrote: 2. The sample was not a random. The majority of participants were white, \u201cbetween the ages of 22 to 45 years, had entered the industry after age 18, and had education levels of at least three to five years at the secondary school level with many having tertiary levels of education\u201d \u2013 the New Zealand study is irrelevant to our situation where our demographic is much different. Demographics: Maori (non-white) 31.7%, NZ European (white) 50.7%, Pacific Island (non-white) 5.1%, Other: 12.5%. So barely a majority is white. This is probably not much different in the USA. What do you mean not random? The age group, demographics, education simply reflects the demographics of the prostitutes of New Zealand. Studies like the one in New Zealand haven\u2019t been done in the USA as far as I know. Because of the illegality it is difficult to get reliable surveys on prostitutes in the USA. I have no reason to assume that the age demographic is very different from that of New Zealand. CON wrote: Even with these survey participants, the picture is horrifying. For example- \u201c87% of all survey participants have a regular doctor but only half of these participants disclose their occupation to their doctor.\u201d This means 13% have no doctor at all, and 51% have not told a doctor that they are in the sex trade. THIS IS AFTER LEGALIZATION! 87% is not bad (probably higher that the percentage of people in the USA with health care). Half of the prostitutes disclose their work with their primary care physician. But many of them get check-ups from other institutions as well. They get regularly checked for STD\u2019s even if they don\u2019t tell their primary care physician. Conclusion: Prostitution can be legalized in a way that makes work safer for prostitutions as the Nevada and New Zealand examples show. Opponents of legalized prostitution like to depict prostitutes as helpless victims. This is not the reality of prostitution. Most prostitutes choose their profession freely, and we should be allowed to do so. But in the end, the most important argument, in my opinion, is freedom. Two consenting adults should have the freedom to have sex in exchange for money. Government does not have the right to take away the livelihood of a sex worker.Vote Pro!",

            "premise": "I would hope that all viewers of this debate would judge on argumentation rather than personal opinion. Even though this usually doesn't come through to all, I feel better stating it... Now onto the debate: A) Prostitution is always going to exist. -No matter what we do, no matter how many laws we make or consequences we set forth, you will see that prostitution will always be around. B) By making prositituion legal, more people will be protected. -Look to the government here. Everytime they legalize something that could be considered bad (like alcohol), you will see that the use of it actually is much more prudent. Just like the abolition of alchohol, the abolition of prostitution has simply made people upset. Therefore, there is one more reason to do prostitution, to get 'back' at the government. Finally, you will see that if we can make regulations on prostitution rather than outlawing it, that when someone doesn't pay a prostitution, that they can go to the police rather than not eating for a week. Or when a jerk beats the living snot out of a prostitute, that they can go to the police rather than do nothing at all. But most importantly, there can FINALLY be a system of medically checking people for STD's and deadly diseases to prevent the negligent spread of these unnecessary diseases. C) Prostitution is the choice of the woman and man. -Why are we trying to prevent two people, from something they both obviously want to do (EG: make money and have sex)... Trying to outlaw this, simply ticks people off to an extensive degree, which actually furthers this act. But moreover, how does it affect you if a prostitute does anything? If you don't want to be a part of it, then don't. I certainly consider it something that I don't want to be a part of but in America, I feel it my obligation to allow other people to make the choice for themself rather than me make the choice for them. ================================================= Off my opponents only argument thus far: Economy--> An economy with prostitutes is actually BETTER than an economy without them. The money people spend, the more the money flows around the system. Essentially, the more people that spend money, the better the economy is. But also, you must recognize that people who are prostitutes are likely on welfare (since they don't have an official job). So do you really want your tax dollars to go to someone who is making more money than you anyway? In the end, prostitution is a choice. Prostitution will always exist, therefore, if we were to continue this abolition of it, more people will actually get harmed. But finally, the economy is increased by making prostitution legal. Therefore, I urge you to vote PRO! Thanks for this debate and good luck!",

            "conclusion": "No to legalizing prostitution",
            "premise": "Although legalising prostitution itself is perceived as a negative thing, it is very easy to see the positive side of this decision. First and fore-mostly, prostitution is going to exist no matter if it is legal or not. Making prostitution illegal does not stop people from taking this path, or going to a prostitute, similar to making drugs such as heroine illegal will not stop people from buying them, dealing them, or using them. Thus, all of your points will still stand no matter if prostitution is legal or not. Given this case, acknowledging and making prostitution legal at least give prostitutes basic rights to protect themselves from abuse, being under-paid, or being raped. If prostitution would forever remain illegal, it will not die down, and the prostitutes, often young and vulnerable, will have no rights protecting them from various harms on the streets. Although making prostitution legal will not terminate anything, it will still decrease the chances of ' finding themselves at a place, where they do not want to be. ' as they will be under the protection of the law. Making prostitution into a lawful job also means that laws could be implanted so that STDs and such diseases could be checked frequently, and an age limit put on. Thus making prostitution legal will be beneficial to the health and safety of both prostitutes and their customers. Of course, most of the people entering prostitution are young and should be getting an education instead of selling their own bodies. This is largely due to poverty, domestic abuse and human trafficking. This phenomena is not going to improve whether prostitution is legal or not. It is structured deep within society and unless there are ways for domestic abuse and human trafficking to stop, there will be forever children and teens entering the industry. This also brings me back to my previous point. If prostitution is to remain illegal, 'in the dark', and as a social taboo, the children and teenagers will find themselves in a situation in which they would never make enough money to get out of, and being constantly abused at the same time. If prostitution was legal however, their situation will improve drastically, as they will be under the protection of the law, perhaps even providing them with a minimum wage and various welfares. Lastly, forced prostitution and human trafficking aside, if someone is willing to exchange sex with money and enjoy the process of it, why should it be illegal? The pornography industry is perfectly legal, so why isn't the prostitution industry legal? In conclusion, it is undeniable that forced prostitution should not be supported, but it is also clear that if prostitution remain illegal, prostitution will not stop and the conditions will be relatively worse. On the other hand, if it was legalised, laws could be implanted to protect the prostitutes from harm and abuse and help them get on the right track, and it will also give people who enjoy this profession a lawful job. However please keep in mind that most problems with prostitution is not caused by 'prostitution' but factors like poverty and domestic abused, as well as human trafficking.

            "conclusion": "Prostitution should be legalized",
            "premise": "Thanks for your response.Lets take the issues one at a time1. Prostitution is a victimless crime \"Prostitution is often described as a \"victimless crime\", or a \"consensual crime\", because in theory, no one present at the crime is unwilling. In reality, this is a myth. In reality, prostitution of women is a particularly lethal form of violence against women, and a violation of a woman's most basic human rights...Sadly, the majority of girls enter prostitution before they have reached the age of consent. In other words, their first commercial sexual interactions are rape. Research indicates that most women in prostitution were sexually and physically abused as children.\" [1] \"There's some sentiment out there that prostitution -- except for the potential of sexually transmitted disease and the marital implosion it may cause -- is really one of those victimless pursuits that really doesn't fit the description of a crime. Aside from the societal concerns that sex for money constantly erodes whatever moral values the majority of us still hold dear, the more immediate harm is dealt to these vulnerable young women who are usually duped into a life of dependency and abuse.\" [2] It would also lead to more anti-social behavior of men who now can just walk into a brothel and pay for sex.So the list of victims are the institution of Marriage, Morality, any who gets an STD, youth, women.2. Undermining the black market and increasing workplace safety for prostitutesThe goal with black markets is to eliminate them not turn them into legitimate buisnesses. \"No other workplace has to cover the range of health and safety issues that ensue from this sexual and economic exchange. Together with STIs, verbal abuse, battering, sexual harassment and violence, rape and unwanted pregnancies are recognised occupational health and safety risks within the prostitution industry. This does not change because prostitution is legalised.\" [3] \"Ingrid Barclay\u2019s study, which looks at the experience of four women in one of Melbourne\u2019s legal brothels, shows how even when overt coercion is not present, women remain disempowered. The women in her study found that they had to agree to any sexual acts a buyer demanded to obtain a booking. They are then later forced to attempt to renegotiate the way the sexual act will be performed when the booking has commenced and they are alone with the buyer.\" [3]Legalization does not make it safer.3. Decreasing the taxpayers' loadIf you intend to regulate the industry the money goes from police to more government beaurcrats, and with increases in disease, and violence it will cost tax payers more. \"when police pay attention to minor offenses \u2014 such as prostitution, graffiti, aggressive panhandling \u2014 they can reduce fear, strengthen communities, and prevent serious crime.\" [4]It will not decrease tax payer load.Now to my arguements1. Demeaning to WomenYou making womens' bodies just sex objects to buy and sell. Not to mention how positution would enforce female steryotypes and unrealistic standard of beauty.\"It bothers me that we're making money off the backs of women. Condoning prostitution is the most demeaning and degrading thing that the state can do to women. What we do as a state is essentially put a U.S.-grade stamp on the butt of every prostitute. Instead, we should be turning them around by helping them get back into society.\" [5]2. DiseaseLegalizing Prositution will only lead to an increase of STDs. \"In 1986, the Victorian Labour government [Victoria, Australia] legalized brothels, claiming crime would be eliminated, prostitutes' lives wouldbe made safer, and there would be fewer health risks. None of this happened...Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and AIDS increased.\" [6] \"It has been argued that legalized brothels or other \u201ccontrolled\u201d prostitution establishments protect women through enforceable condom policies. In one study, 47% of women in U.S. prostitution stated that men expected sex without a condom\" [7] \"The harm reduction approach is shortsighted, doomed to failure, and ethically lacking. It fails to recognize that many prostitutes are unable to negotiate condom use with their clients but often are forced to provide whatever services the client may want. In addition, it is common knowledge that prostitutes are often paid more if they agree to have sex without a condom. In fact, a study in Calcutta India found that prostitutes who regularly use condoms suffer a 79% reduction in their earnings over prostitutes who do not use condoms.1 A 79% loss of income is a huge motivator to forego the use of condoms!\" [8] \"Even if a prostitute is being tested every week for HIV, she will test negative for at least the first 4-6 weeks and possibly the first 12 weeks after being infected. If we assume that he or she takes only 4 weeks to become positive, because there is an additional lag time of 1-2 weeks to get the results back, there will be at best a window period of 6 weeks for a prostitute. The average prostitute services between 10-15 clients per day. This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely. This is not the best approach for actually reducing harm. Instead, in order to slow the global spread of HIV/AIDS we should focus our efforts on abolishing prostitution.\" [8]Sources: [1] http://www.aljazeera.com...[2] http://www.lowellsun.com...[3] http://action.web.ca...[4] http://old.nationalreview.com...[5] http://tinyurl.com...[6] http://www.academia.edu...[7] http://www.embracedignity.org...

There is a reason why human trafficking is illegal and its ironic on how you are in support of this. It seems like you don't know the victims of human trafficking who will be later used as sex slaves. They are minor girl, who need education. They are trafficked, by making this legal, you are spoiling the lives of thousands of children and helpless women. That statement is disgracing. 2) There is a reason why porn stars choose porn and not prostitution. Its because porn is easier to perform and its just acting, both the male and female know their duty and its in a safe environment. For prostitution, the women has to go where the customer demands which is a threat to her. DO YOU WANT SOMEONE'S LIFE THREATENED just because you think prostitution is better? I hence stand justified. Prostitution should remain illegal. There's a good reason why its illegal in over a bunch of places. Making porn illegal will cause an outrage in the society, by the general public and the porn stars. We don't need that. Everything is fine and it should stay that way. Thank you opponent, this has been a good debate.",

            "premise": "I'm not a person of your country, but anyway, I start my reply. I referred to this cite. (http://www.idebate.org...) First, basically, government have no right to engage private life like intercourse. But if the benefit of public is bigger than the private right, the regulation was based on the legal step of the law, the regulation is based on serious and careful consideration, and they are not violating the essential parts of the freedom and right, government can also regulate right of people. Basically, the justice of prostitution is based on the right to decide of their own body. But, this right is also can be restricted because of violating the dignity of human. I have the intention to argue that prostitution can violate the dignity of human so regulation of prostitution should be needed even if the rule was made by the government in this debate. Second, prostitution basically violate the rule of marry. The essence of the rule of marry is the exclusive right of the intercourse with a spouse. As long as the rule of marry remain the fundamental of the society, we should keep it. In addition, the use of a woman's body solely for the purpose of sexual gratification does not treat them as a person. This lack of respect dehumanizes both prostitute and client, and this situation can violate the dignity of both sex. So, the overwhelming of freedom also can harm to the society and individual. It should be well adjusted by individuals or even by the government in the some situation. And I can tell you more side effects of prostitution. Finally, Laws regarding prostitution are also based on the serious consideration not only religion but also other aspects. I can show you this evidence by showing this site. - http://www.idebate.org... - The regulation of prostitution are not only based on the faith of religion. Violation of the right of prostitutes, the economic aspects, the side effects from the country which allow prostitute, and so many other aspects are also considered by the officials in the USA government.

            "premise": "1.The fact that at least 18 countries (out of 150 ) does not mean anything for your case. Several countries do uniformly stupid things all the time. I'll use the example of the Netherlands to prove that society can be benefited from legal prostitution instead of harmed. In the Netherlands, a very Libertarian nation, prostitution is legal. Here, prostitutes work in sex houses or brothels instead of displaying their lewdness on the streets (which proves legal prostitution leads to regulation instead of wild frenzy of paid sex), pimps are unnecessary and put out of work, and prostitutes pay their income taxes. (http://en.wikipedia.org...) Canada is another example with legal prostitution. They look down on us, because they believe (and so many Americans) that prostitution is criminalized based on a non-existent Biblical precedent. Their prostitution is safe and contributes to society in a positive way instead of a negative way. Canada, most all of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, most of Asia, Latin America are all other examples with legal, safe prostitution that contributes to society and the tax treasury. (http://www.sexwork.com...) 2. CON says that \"not all pimps do the things\" that I've described. It is evident that pimps are abusive and violent. (http://www.libertarian.to...) I challenge my opponent to find a source that says that pimps are friendly... It is common knowledge that pimps are violent. It is in their job description. If a pimp was not violent, the prostitute would not pay him. Let's remember that there are no police involved in this. So a pimp cannot go to the police and tell that the prostitute has stolen her money. Instead, the pimp has to evil and abusive to scare the girl into giving him her money. It is a fact that in the Netherlands, Canada, almost all of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, most of Asia, and Latin America all have legal prostitution and it is safe from violent pimps. (http://www.sexwork.com...) 3. CON has given a false example. He says that Germany legalised prostitution and had a budget deficit later as a result. This is not a result of prostitution. Firstly, the government did not pay prostitute anything. So they could not have lossed any money (not even one penny). Secondly, prostitutes usually have their brothels pay the tax. Thirdly, in Germany many cities and states force their prostitutes to pay their taxes in advance. How could they be evaded in this instance? Fourthly, EVERYBODY EVADES TAXES!!! The IRS has a huge problem of forcing people to pay their right amount of taxes. The fact is that no government can be hurt (financially) by taxing, because they are not paying money, so they are no losing money. And German (and prostitutes of other nations) pay their taxes. (http://en.wikipedia.org...) 4. A great example is in Kenya and Senegal. In these countries, prostitution is regulated and condom use has gone up tremendously. Now, STDs have reduced drastically. (http://www.liberator.net...) This website has a chart showing that countries where prostitution is legalized have lower rates of HIV/AIDS. Canada has half our rate, Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands have a third. (http://www.liberator.net...) A third example is Nevada. Under legalised prostitution, NO CASE OF HIV HAS EVER BEEN FOUND. This fact is backed up by Nevada Department of Public Health and Harvard University. (http://www.aegis.com...) The fact is that regulation works. 5. My opponent says that his pursuit of happiness may be different from mine. I agree! That's the beauty of American liberty! Everybody is into something different and if you want to do something that does not harm anybody else you should be able to. Thomas Jefferson says in his Declaration of Independence that we hold these truths to be self-evident that the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and endowed by our Creator. He also says that if the government takes away these rights we are to change that government! (http://www.archives.gov...) If a person is into hockey, debating, or prostitution, it is that persons personal liberty to engage in these activities, because he is hurting noone else. 6. My partner did not even bother to refute the actual fact that our Libertarian founding fathers would have frowned up illegal prostitution. Because they supported liberty and they opposed big, despotic government. 7. In this point, CON admits to the fact and conceeds that \"the prohibition on Prostitution hasn't exactly worked.\" Of course, my sources tell us all this as well. And he also says that Alcohol and Drug prohibtion did not have the same problems (like HIV). However, alcohol and drugs are abusable. But even though this is true, we ended the prohibition on alcohol because we saw the negative effects of it. We saw notorious gangsters like Al Capone (paralled to pimps and gangs today). We saw bad health issues because of lack of regulation (paralled to higher STD levels). We saw a lot of tax revenue lost (compared to revenue lost today). We saw an ineffective enforcement (which we see in prostitution today). We even saw government corruption (which we see in this today). We saw a costly (but still ineffective) enforcement. Please, let's learn from our history! 8. My opponent says that prostitution is not the first thing that gangs fight about, which I agree. But it is still something they fight about and it could be stopped. Also, violent pimps are a seious problem, which could be bearly eliminated if prostitution was legalised like Netherlands, Canada, and other examples illustrate. 9. My opponent here admits that prostitutes would pay taxes. Also, many people own casinos in Las Vegas. There is nothing stopping the mafia from owning a Subway. Legalizing prostitution does not help the mafia in any way. It hurts pimps though by displacing them. CON says legalisation will make it so that gangs \"will no longer have to avoid the law.\" Yes! This is the essenes of legalization! This way, now, the law is involved and prostitutes are safe and taxation is had. 10. My opponent points to one instance where prostitutes were arrested and told on a mobster named Lucky. But this is unnecessary. The girls did not even have to be arrested in the first place. And police money could be used elsewhere. It's the only logical thing to do. CON's example is irrelevant! Resources could go elsewhere! 11. CON calls the sentiment that legalisation lowers use a \"myth.\" However, \"Contrary to the prohibitionist's philosophy, this data may give reason to implement and regulate prostitution to reduce crime because crime in countries where prostitution is legal is lower than the U.S.'s rates.\" (http://www.liberator.net...) This is a scientific researcher. 12. I am not comparing legalisation to the Holocaust. I'm comparing the rights taken away. Slowly but surely, rights were taken away and because it was gradual and commonplace it was allowed by citizens. We must use history to learn from our mistakes! I'll use another historical truth. In Cambodia's genocide, Pol Pot tried to make the ultimate utopia. But when people tried to stray from it, they were eventually fined, then jailed, then killed. Rights are taken away gradually, not all at once. We must ensure that we fight for every right we have, because we all know that we are losing them slowly. Pot was trying to do a good thing and protect his people, and look what happened. My opponent failed to bring up one beneficial point of criminalization of prostitution. Vote economics! Vote more tax revenue! Vote STDs and health! Vote good police resource allocation! Vote history! Vote PRO!",

Whether or not that argument is valid should not effect one guy, who wants to have sex, and one girl, who is willing to perform sexual acts upon said person for money, to make a transaction of mutual gain. Other arguments attempt to define Prostitution as a moral issue by saying it's demeaning and should therefore be illegal, but what they don't see is that something being demeaning is only a subjective judgement, and besides, both parties would be accepting the alleged demeaningness. That argument is like saying that if someone doesn't like a movie because he/she thinks it demeaning, then he/she can make it illegal to see that movie based on subjective value judgements. You should not enforce subjective morality onto others. I'll restate my point one more time, for good measure: If it's consensual and doesn't directly affect anyone else, then it should be legal.",

Making this a white market activity would make it much safer in all these aspects. Again there would need to be regulations. Only people 18 and over should be able to engage in prostitution. But if it's between consenting adults I don't see the problem. Plus with regulations there would be no more pimps and if they decide to quit they isn't any life endangering consequences.

            "premise": "Thank you for your quick response. Rebuttal for Round 3 Arguments: \"My refutation to that is even if prostitution remains illegal, this same kind of underage prostitution would occur\". -That is absolutely true, but when you legalize something, people will find ways to take advantages of those opportunities. The fact that something is illegal and can be punished acts as a deterrent. It will not deter all crime, but it will deter some crime. I will briefly explain why some punishments are implemented. The prison system acts as a deterrent to criminal activity and it also protects society by incarcerating those who may do additional harm to others. As I mentioned, the criminality of something will not deter all crime, but it does deter some. \"Whether or not your point is valid or not, that still should NOT affect just some random, normal people who want to conduct a safe business transaction\" -I would like you to define what safe is? \"Estimates of the prevalence of incest among prostitutes range from 65% to 90%. The Council for Prostitution Alternatives, Portland, Oregon Annual Report in 1991 stated that: 85% of prostitute/clients reported history of sexual abuse in childhood; 70% reported incest.\" [1] -Take this statistic for example! In 1991, 85% of prostitutes/clients reported history of sexual abuse in childhood; 70% reported incest! Would you consider that to be a tragedy? For arguments sake, lets say over 75% of prostitutes were sexually abused as children. Is it fair to conclude that many if not most prostitutes were sexually abused as children? That being said, do you feel that prostitution is justified knowing that a majority of them were abused as young children? Is there a link between sexual abuse as a child and prostitution? I believe there is, and to truly fight prostitution, we must fight the sexual abuse of children. Further, we must find a better way to identify these children (schools would be the greatest place). \"Well, if they didn't have any other skills, and they needed to support their family, isn't it a good thing that they went into prostitution?\" -I believe you did not address the \"Abusive Husbands\" part. If husbands did their job, and were not abusive, we may of had a different result. This still does not justify prostitution and the fact that at least 75% of these individuals were sexually abused as children. \"Well, actually, no. X couldn't go up to y, offer him money for sex, and then have consensual sex.\" -I agree, that would be entirely illegal, you must have not provided that information in your initial argument. Please refer to the sentence I used as reference for your argument. \"SIDE NOTE: They are not hurting anyone. X wants sex, y wants money, they make a deal that helps both of them! Maybe y likes having sex? Who knows!\" \"About 80% of women in prostitution have been the victim of a rape. It's hard to talk about this because..the experience of prostitution is just like rape. Prostitutes are raped, on the average, eight to ten times per year. They are the most raped class of women in the history of our planet. \" (Susan Kay Hunter and K.C. Reed, July, 1990 \"Taking the side of bought and sold rape,\" speech at National Coalition against Sexual Assault, Washington, D.C. ) Other studies report 68% to 70% of women in prostitution being raped (M Silbert, \"Compounding factors in the rape of street prostitutes,\" in A.W. Burgess, ed., Rape and Sexual Assault II, Garland Publishing, 1988; Melissa Farley and Howard Barkan, \"Prostitution, Violence, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,\" 1998, Women & Health.)\" [1] -You mention that nobody is getting hurt? 80% of women in prostitution have been the victim of a Rape. Additionally, 68% - 70% are being Raped! Based on that statistic, can you still conclude that \"They are not hurting anyone\"? You need to understand the vulnerabilities of Prostitutes. First, a majority of them were sexually abused as children and started prostitution by the age of 12-14 years. Then not only were they sexually abused as children, exploited as minors, 70% of them are RAPED while on the job? How is nobody getting hurt? Where do you not see exploitation? \"Ready to address this when it comes up\" -This was in reference to the prostitutes caught up in drug addictions. \"Up to 95% of women in prostitution are problematic drug users, including around 78% heroin users and rising numbers of crack cocaine addicts (Home Office 2004a).\" [2] Conclusion of Round 3. -Let me break this down. We have \"75% of women involved in prostitution started as children\" [2]. A large percentage of prostitutes reported sexual abuse as children. While conducting the act of prostitution 70% of prostitutes reported they have been Raped. Lastly, \"95% of women in prostitution are problematic drug users including 78% of them identified as HEROIN users. I await your response. [1] http://www.rapeis.org...

            "premise": "Rebuttals 1. STD \"Even if a prostitute is being tested every week for HIV, she will test negative for at least the first 4-6 weeks and possibly the first 12 weeks after being infected.... This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely.\" There are 19 legal brothels in the United States, all of which are in rural counties in Nevada [1]. They have restrictions and are government regulated. In brothels in Nevada, it is a requirement for sex workers to be tested and verified as healthy. Afterwards, they are required to be checked on a weekly and/or monthly basis for certain STDs. Condom usage is also mandatory and this is advertised by the brothels so that customers know beforehand. Finally, sex workers are able to examine the customers before any services are given to make sure there are no signs of visible STIs. If there are any suspicions, the worker is allowed to refund the customer and refuse service. Barbara Brents and Kathryn Hausbeck state in their study that the legalization of prostitution in Nevada's brothels allows for improved regulation and protection for both businesses and workers [2]. 2. Not a Legitimate Business \"One needs to completely rid oneself of the voracity for cash to see that prostitution, although legalized, can never be a legitimate business because it will always be associated with crime, corruption, class, mass sexual exploitation and human trafficking.\" Criminalizing prostitution, however, makes it worse. Sex workers will have to rely on their pimps to keep them safe and secure but they cannot be fully trusted. \u201cSex work is legitimate work and problems within the industry are not inherent in the work itself. It is vulnerability, not sex work, which creates victims. Sex workers should enjoy the same labor rights as other workers and the same human rights as other people.\u201d [3].The problem is the environment the sex worker works in. Legalizing prostitution will offer opportunities for sex workers to work in a safer environment like brothels that give both the customer and the prostitute protection, security and a pleasurable time. 3. Violence \"Regardless of prostitution's status (legal, illegal or decriminalized) or its physical location (strip club, massage parlor, street, escort/home/hotel), prostitution is extremely dangerous for women. Homicide is a frequent cause of death.... It is a cruel lie to suggest that decriminalization or legalization will protect anyone in prostitution. It is not possible to protect someone whose source of income exposes them to the likelihood of being raped on average once a week.\" Brents and Hausbeck's case study of Nevada's brothels entailed examples of how they believe protection mechanisms were designed to account for the entire process of each individual. They started by saying that the negotiation process for sex workers in Nevada requires the use of an intercom during the process so that workers will not betray the business owners and so that owners can know if the customers are putting the workers at risk. After the price is negotiated, the money is paid and taken out of the room by the sex worker. At that point, the sex workers have the opportunity to let security guards know if there is anything unsafe or uncomfortable about the situation so that security can be alerted. Another protection mechanism requires security to interrupt the workers after the allotted period of time to demand that the customers either leave or renegotiate the price, so that sex workers are not coerced or forced into providing additional services without a fee. Finally, the study concludes that sex workers are offered protection from one another in brothels because of strictly enforced rules and the relationships that brothels have been able to build with local law enforcement officials [2]. According to some legalization supporters, this protection creates an environment that can be empowering for women to work in. 4. \u201cHow does legalizing something make it safer? Just because it's legal, prostitutes won't completely change to a safer and more professional way. Prostitution is a dangerous job(if it can even be called a job) and that will never change. Anything that has to do with sex and money will result in disgusting circumstances.\u201d If prostitution is legalized, sex workers can work in brothels rather than relying on their pimps for security and protection. Prostitution is a dangerous job if it is not legalized. They will be more prone to rape, murder, STDs and human trafficking if they don\u2019t work in a brothel. Legalizing prostitution will offer sex workers rights, a safer and secure environment like brothels, fair wages, and the government will also earn more tax money. 5. \u201cAll prostitution is harmful. Making something legal doesn't magically make it safe. Legalizing it will not by any means give women rights because that is exactly the opposite of what prostitution is. Prostitution is women selling themselves to men for sex. That is a women giving up their rights so they can get money ( usually used to buy drugs ).\u201d Again, prostitution is less harmful if it is legalized. I would also argue that men and women have the right to their body, so sex workers are not giving up there rights and you also don\u2019t have any evidence of prostitutes using their salary to buy drugs. Since Con did not rebut most of my arguments I shall extend them. Sources [1] http://www.thelasvegascourtesan.com...

            "premise": "\u201cThe State of Nature, the natural condition of mankind, is a state of perfect and complete liberty to conduct one\u2019s life as one best sees fit, free from the interference of others.\u201d [1] From that starting point, the only reason people give up some of their freedom is to be protected from being harmed by others. This idea is captured by John Stuart Mill\u2019s famous \u201charm principle,\u201d which holds that each person must be afforded the right to exercise self-control over their own body and mind, and that \u201cthe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\u201d [2]Thus, Mill drew an important distinction between \u201cself-regarding acts\u201d and \u201cother-regarding acts.\u201d The former involve doing things to yourself that don\u2019t harm other people, though they may be self-destructive. The latter involve doing things that harm other people. Mill argued that government should never prohibit or interfere with the former, even if these choices are self-destructive. As such, the harm principle allows individuals all the freedom they want to pursue their own views of the good life\u2014up to the point where an unwilling person could be harmed. Freedom ends only where the next person\u2019s nose begins.Prostitution is a classic self-regarding act. If it harms anyone, it only harms those consenting to the act (i.e. sex workers or johns). In effect, it\u2019s no different than most legal and consensual acts. Just as consensual possession of other people\u2019s belongings is not theft, and consensual presence on other people\u2019s premises is not trespass, and consensual sex isn\u2019t rape, consensual exchange of sex for money shouldn\u2019t be illegal. Under Mill\u2019s harm principle, any argument for prohibiting or interfering with consensual acts that don\u2019t harm anyone else is a non-starter.What are the arguments against legalizing prostitution? Opponents usually argue that (1) it's harmful to prostitutes, and (2) it increases sex trafficking. I'll respond to each of these in turn. First, under the harm principle, it doesn't matter if prostitution is harmful to prostitutes because there's no justification for interfering with self-regarding acts, even if those acts are self-destructive. Second, there's no evidence that sex work is inherently harmful. The only evidence showing harms is related to the institutions surrounding illegal prostitution. Decriminalization solves those problems because it creates an explicit distinction between legal sex work and illegal sex trafficking and rape. This helps police enforce sex trafficking and rape laws, while granting legal sex workers the freedom to use their body and mind as they see fit, without harming anyone else.In terms of sex trafficking, it's a huge topic with a lot to talk about, but at least this much isn't up for debate: trafficking is a profound crime that should be eradicated. But it's also an issue that requires much greater nuance than it's currently given. In the US, there's a distinction between really bad trafficking -- defined as \"a commercial sex act induced by ford, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age\" -- and just regular sex trafficking, defined as \"the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.\" In other words, \"sex trafficking\" is defined as consensual sex work by migrants. That's it. This distinction is critical. While the former is a profound crime, the latter is just another definition for sex work performed by migrants. This important point is often lost in debates about prostituion, as anti-trafficking and anti-prostitution discourse has blurred the line between these two categories. To be clear, \"sex trafficking\" as defined by the law is not synonymous with sexual servitude.That poses a serious problem for actual anti-trafficking efforts, because it misdirects funds away from genuine victims, and onto sex workers who simply visit friends in a different city. In actuality, decriminalizing prostitution helps combat sexual servitude, by keeping our focus on the stuff that's actually bad. In short, definitions are important. The sloppy and overly-broad definition of trafficking is the problem, not sex work itself. Moreover, there's no evidence whatsoever that decriminalizing prostitution increases sexual servitude. There's no evidence that decriminalizing prostitution increases the type of sex trafficking you see in movies like Taken. And that's all I'll say on the trafficking issue unless my opponent brings it up.Finally, there's an idea among opponents of prostitution that sex workers cannot consent to exchange sex for money. Why not? It's like any other job where you provide a service with the use of your body in exchange for money. There's nothing inherent about exchanging sex for money that makes consent impossible. To be sure, many prostitutes don't consent, but that's something that typically happens when prostitution is illegal. And, non-consensual sex is already covered under existing laws for rape, and sexual servitude is covered under the \"severe sex trafficking\" laws. Criminalizing prostitution is completely unnecessary. The US should decriminalize *consensual* prostitution.[1] http://www.iep.utm.edu...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org...[3] https://oag.ca.gov...",

            "conclusion": "Prostitution should be legal in the US",
            "premise": "Regulation Prostitution is illegal at this point, and there is basically a black market that is occurring. When anything is banned, it sets up a market for the thing in question. Drugs is another great example of this. The question is whether or not prostitution will occur anyway, and the obvious answer to that is yes. As it is now,, prostitution is banned and still occurring on a day to day basis so that answers the question about it still occurring. So the next question is what to do about it. Since we know that it is still going to occur on a day to day basis regardless of whether it is banned or not, why not regulate it? With regulation there are positive impacts that come along with it. a) Revenue Prostitution by itself, draws in a large amount of money. Opening it up to proper regulation allows for an entire new type of industry. With Americas failing economy, any jobs are welcome at this point. The porn industry by itself is estimated to make between 15-50 billion dollars yearly ( http://www.forbes.com... ) . This is just watching and not participating. Opening up brothels allows for people to actually interact with the women in question and will stem a great deal of profit and open up jobs that have never been utilized before b) Womens Health Concerns Women that often participate in prostitution under the radar feel they trapped there. They often are scared of getting killed or beaten if they leave their specific pimp. This type of business without proper regulation causes a great deal of damage, and the women in question often get trapped. They also contract HIV and other diseases because they don't have the ability to utilize proper health facilities. Regulating this industry allows for it to be ran properly, and can help free the women in question. Along with allowing any new women that want to enter into the business the chance to get check ups, condoms, and other things that are essential for their health. It has also been proven that regulating prostitution will reduce acts of violence and murders by up to 25 percent. This includes rapes and other such acts ( http://prostitution.procon.org... ). It's a question of values, by regulating this we can not only make money but help women that are stuck in this industry get unstuck. This allows decreases the number of rapes, deaths, and crimes, that occur on a yearly basis by nearly 25 percent. c) opportunity savings. There are nearly 50 through 100 thousand people yearly that arrested for prostitution. The amount of time and money it takes to actually arrest them and put them into the system costs the US billions yearly. Being able to regulate and legalize it not only flips that costs to profit because we can regulate it and make money off it, it also reduces the total costs from the people that are caught doing this why it is non legal d) Their choice If you have sex with someone because you go on a date, that is your choice. In a way that is payment in itself. That is perfectly legal and acceptable in today's society. There is a short line to walk between drawing a written contract and having sex by sort of a verbal understanding. In the end if someone wants to have sex with someone, and they both agree that is their choice. What they gain from that should be worked out by the individuals. If it is money, we should do what we do with every other thing in the world. Tax it. resolution affirmed",

            "premise": "Prostitution is a victimless crime. When all goes well (i.e. there is no violence) neither the john nor the prostitute is victimized. I think we can agree on this. If we cannot, please correct me in your response, and we will discuss accordingly. However, there are lots of horrendous cases of violence between the client and service provider (but I will get to that later). If all goes well, no one gets hurt. Thus, it is not an immoral practice because questions about ethics and morality relate to the happiness and unhappiness of beings that have the potential to feel such happiness and unhappiness. I have no ethical need to interfere when I see a plant destroyed. However, if I saw that a human was about to be crushed, I would have an ethical need to interfere. Therein, seeing that prostitution causes no harm to sentient creatures in its most innocent form, the laws and the enforcement of such laws in our country represent a massive waste of human energy. Campaigning against something that causes no harm to sentient creatures is quite foolish and is a massive waste of time and energy. We would not reasonably campaign against the eating of salad. Now, of course, the above shows only why prostitution in its most innocent form (no violence) is not immoral. Clearly, those who commit violent crimes against prostitutes are not moral people and the situations that arise because of them are quite tragic. Also, these situations are quite common. According to law.com, 204 prostitutes are murdered out of every 100,000. This is 20 times the national average. The average prostitute is beat no less than once a month. So, what are we to do to prevent these innocent but desperate people? What I propose to counter this is something like Amsterdam's red light zone. Prostitutes provide their services in a neighborhood specifically designed for such. They work in a building that is not their home, so potentially violent customers do not know where they live. Perhaps most importantly, there is an alarm button which immediately calls the police over if there is any sign of trouble. This would almost effectively eliminate all of the violence committed against prostitutes. In the system we currently have, prostitution is done in back alleys and places with no police thus the opportunity for violence is high. This, of course, leads to high levels of violence against them, but we can stop it via legalization. Another argument for legalization of prostitution is it would decrease the amount of STDs passed via prostitutes. The same study on laws.com that was mentioned earlier states that 50% of the world's prostitutes have HIV. Of course, since their profession is illegal, no prostitute is going to get a doctor to get tested for an STD. We should have, nationally, a system like we have in Nevada. A prostitute is required by law to wear a condom, and they must be tested weekly for STDs. Thus, legalizing prostitution will help hinder the currently massive growth of sexually transmitted diseases. The proof of this is the effectiveness of the Nevada system at stopping STDs. The porn stars of Los Angeles have higher rates of STDs than Nevadan prostitutes. A Nevadan prostitute has not been diagnosed with HIV since 1986. Compare that with the shocking figure of fifty percent, and it is easy to see why prostitution should be legalized. Just to be clear, what I suggest is a combination of the rigorous testing of Nevada and the red-light district of Amsterdam. Prostitutes would work in specific zones, have a button that would summons police immediately if the client is in any way doing something harmful. There would be no abusive pimp or middleman between client and servicer. This system would effectively end almost all of the violence against prostitutes, inhibit STDs, and free up manpower wasted on Vice departments in police to be used for the pursuit of actual criminals.

            "premise": "\"In the year since lifting the ban on brothels in the Netherlands, eight Dutch victim support organizations reported an increase in the number of victims of trafficking, and twelve victim support organization reported that the number of victims from other countries has not diminished (Bureau NRM, 2002, p. 75). Forty-three of the 348 municipalities (12%) in the Netherlands choose to follow a no-brothel policy, but the Minister of Justice has indicated that the complete banning of prostitution within any municipality could conflict with the federally guaranteed \"right to free choice of work\" (Bureau NRM, 2002, p.19). ... Contrary to claims that legalization and decriminalization would control the expansion of the sex industry, prostitution now accounts for 5% of the Netherlands economy (Daley, 2001, p. 4). Over the last decade, as pimping was legalized, and brothels decriminalized in the year 2000, the sex industry increased by 25% in the Netherlands (Daley, 2001, p.4). At any hour of the day, women of all ages and races, dressed in hardly anything, are put on display in the notorious windows of Dutch brothels and sex clubs and offered for sale. Most of them are women from other countries who were probably trafficked into the Netherlands (Daley, 2001, p. 4). ... Results of the Swedish legislation thus far have been promising. The prohibition against men buying prostituted women has received strong social support. Several polls, conducted in 2000 and 2001, show that approximately 80% of the Swedish population support the law. Of those who want to repeal the law, the majority are men, with only 7% of women in support of repeal (Jacobson, 2002, p.24). Most importantly, women who are attempting to leave prostitution support the law (Ekberg, 2001). Swedish NGOs that work with women in prostitution also support the law and maintain that since passage of the law, increased numbers of women contact them for assistance. The very existence of the law, and the fact that people know it will be enforced, they say, serve as an aid to young women who are vulnerable to pimps and procurers (Ekberg, 2001).\" http://www.honourconsulting.com... \"Legal sex businesses provide locations where sexual harass- ment, sexual exploitation, and violence against women are perpe- trated with impunity. State-sponsored prostitution endangers all women and children in that acts of sexual predation are normal- ized\"acts ranging from the seemingly banal (breast massage) to the lethal (snuff prostitution that includes filming of actual mur- ders of real women and children). A report on the sexual exploita- tion of children noted that the presence of a thriving adult sex industry in a community had the effect of increasing child prosti- tution in that same community (Estes & Weiner, 2001). Nevada, the one U.S. state where prostitution is legal in 13 counties, had significantly higher rates of sex crimes than the rest of the United States in the 1990s (Albert, 2001).\" http://www.prostitutionresearch.com...

If it is a person's right to decide what they want to do with their body, it follows that they choose to suffer a high probability of getting sexually harassed, raped and possibly be continually followed by the attacker if the person does not act. Suppose prostitution is legal, then the availability of prostitutes will rise, allowing for more people to purchase this service. Their motives are usually: sexual urges, satisfy sexual fetishes and dissatisfied with partner. This produces problems with men/women that cannot contain their sexual urges: sexual harassment rates increase. Additionally, if the person is religious, their acts of sins may make them go alcoholic or take illegal drugs to control their emotions. My last point is that people with sexually transmitted diseases will increase because cheap brothels will accept nearly everyone as they require currency to survive. As a consequence, the clients may have STIs and sexually transmit it to the prostitutes unknowingly and then we see a rapid spread.",

            "premise": "Thank you for this topic, and I look forward to this debate. As this is my first debate, I'm still trying to get into the style and organization needed for debating better, so bear with me, please :]. There are several reasons why prostitution cannot or should not be legalized in all of the U.S, which I will list (not on this post) in no particular order. I'd like to note that I am not arguing for making prostitution illegal where it is legal now, but rather that the U.S. on a widespread scale should not legalize prostitution. The first is economic harm for places where prostitution is legal (the state of Rhode Island allows sex for money, but not organized prostitution rings, while Nevada has legal prostitution organizations in 8 of 16 counties). This argument would be quite straightforward. The legalization of prostitution in such places would indicate that prostitution might help save a failing economy or give jobs to many unemployed. Indeed, Nevada brothels pay licensing fees, like quite a few other businesses. Legalizing prostitution on a large scale would probably make it harder for these states to sustain their economy. I mean, where would all the tourist revenue go? People don't go to Nevada to enjoy the cool 100 degree summer weather, or the incredibly arid and desert-like air. They go for the gambling and the prostitution. If you make prostitution widely available elsewhere, then both gambling and prostitution would no longer be the exclusive trademark of Nevada, as gambling has already begun to creep away from Vegas. A direct rebuttal to this might be that prostitution on a larger scale might give the U.S. and states more tax revenue, and that Nevada and Rhode Island will be able to compensate for the loss of revenue and jobs. Common sense would seem to dictate that prostitution was PROBABLY not the first thing Nevada's legislators and citizens thought of when they moved to the state in an attempt to build a new life. Desperation, along with the failure of other options, probably led to it. In fact, legislation has been pushed for years now to ban prostitution altogether, but is never passed. Another thing that might surprise voters in this debate is that prostitution is not a legitimate business in the U.S. The state of Nevada does not recognize brothels as businesses, and do not tax their revenue, but only charge for the permitting of such a brothel. (all above from [http://en.wikipedia.org...]) That's all for now. In the manner of many of the debates I've read, I'm pretty sure that my opponent has the burden of proof - he's the one trying to change things.",

If this is true, I am not sure why there is sill a debate, but I will still go over your arguments. I am not clear what your point is with the education of prostitutes or the relative intelligence thereof, but if it is in fact what it appears to be, then I really have no response to that. It appears to be \"Prostitutes are dumb, therefore prostitution should be illegal.\" You might as well say, \"prostitutes are dumb, therefore we do not need to protect them from potential abusers as we do our smarter citizens.\" Is this not an accurate summary of your point? Enlighten me if it is not. Most prostitutes have boob enlargements? Evidence, please. Also, though I don't know if they have studies for questions so logically obvious (i.e. do poor people have expensive surgeries?) but I'd willing to bet the answer is a well and resounding no. Even so, the logic behind the idea that prostitutes have breast enlargement surgeries, therefore prostitution should be illegal is murky at best. \"By legalizing Prostitution, eventually kids would be seeing phonographic images in advertisements and our population would grow to large as people would be reproducing without knowing what they are doing and committing to, the government will then have to pay those people under the assisted living and child raising program creating even more debt.\" This is a very long cause and effect sentence. Unfortunately, most of the \"causes \" have no correlation with the \"effects.\" Legalizing prostitution has no correlation with seeing pornographic images in advertising (seeing as the prostitutes would be in a special district, and there would be no pimp). Next, our population would not grow large as, by law, condoms would be worn. So therefore, the whole assisted living idea and the increasing debt idea are both eradicated.",

            "premise": "Thank you for responding so quickly. I, unfortunately, cannot respond at such a pace. I remain convinced of my position and unconvinced of yours despite the arguments you have made. I feel they do not provide sufficient evidence to support the continued illegalization of prostitution. So, without further ado, here are my counter arguments. First, however I'd just like to point out that the area in which I live in, like most of the areas within the world, does not have \"massive safety measures\" for prostitutes. It should but it does not. The act is illegal. All of those measures is how we should go about providing safety to prostitutes. Moving along to your second point, you believe that since prostitution is \"artificially modifying ones body\" it is therefore immoral. We may be using different definitions of the word prostitution, but I use the widely accepted one that I listed in my round 1. I do not know how you got the modification of one's body idea, but that is not what I am talking about. For the record, seeing as artificially modifying one's body provides no harm to a sentient creature, then it would not be immoral. Your next idea is that prostitution creates \"lazy. And weak-minded people who cannot work for a living.\" Now, I am not sure if you are talking about the johns or the prostitutes themselves in this situation, so I will address both. Unless you provide proof, we can safely assume employing prostitutes has no correlation with not working (those who didn't work would have no means of employing prostitutes, so the reasoning is a tad contradictory). If you mean the prostitute themselves, you are still wrong. No wants to be a prostitute, or at least not a majority of them (a recent survey dissevered that 92% of American prostitutes want to leave the profession but cannot due to lack of money for food). Why would they? Prostitutes, generally, are financially desperate people in bad neighborhoods doing the only thing they know how to (and probably the only thing they can) make money. The fact that it is illegal and it is still so prevalent shows how desperate these people are. If they had anything else they could do, they would have done it. The idea that they are simply lazy, is frankly ludicrous. \"As sex used to be a private personal thing companies and lazy people are taking advantage of this to earn money.\" First, what is the oldest profession? Prostitution is certainly up there. There are references to prostitutes in many ancient cultures, including some of our Holy Books (Koran, Torah, Bible). So the idea that sex used to be private personal thing is absurd. Of course, some people view it this way. I view it this way, and I would not employ prostitutes if they were legalized, but there have always and will always be other views on sex (else prostitution would have died out long ago). Also, I have already dealt with the lazy people idea, but am confused on what you mean by companies, as in my model there would be no companies running the show. Elaborate in your next response, please. Let's say that we accept that all you say is true, that it is immoral, that it creates lazy and weak-minded people. Even if we accept all that (which I don't) then it is still not enough to justify the monthly beatings of 1 million people. That number is just for the United States. I await your response with anticipation.",

            "premise": "Hundreds of thousands of children are captured, and put to work as sex slaves each year in the United States alone. Could actually legalizing prostitution be the best way to solve this continuing issue and many other ongoing problems relating this? It may seem contradictory, but could this be the winning solution? Legalization of prostitution would protect against child sex slaves and trafficking. Although most people most likely think it increases child and human, but when prostitution becomes legalized people can get sex work as needed, without having to illegally use children. People will be more apt to become a sex worker, because the fear of being caught would be gone. It would provide laws and restrictions against child trafficking, and limit the age of the workers. Listland.com said, \"A lot of pro-decriminalization of prostitution believe that if people can legally buy sex from women 18 years or older, it will significantly reduce child exploitation.By legalizing prostitution and implementing more strict laws regarding it, we can abolish child sex slavery.\" When more women join prostitution, that are 18 and older, men can easily get what they want in a safe, consensual manner, rather than not being able to find anyone of the proper age, resorting to minors. Human rights and lesser child trafficking are great reasons for why prostitution should be legalized, but also that prostitution is a victimless crime, because it is consensual. Since it t is a victimless crime, \"There is no difference between picking up a girl at a bar verses picking up a hooker or escort. [...] If it was 100% legal there would be less pimps and more jobs, it's your body\"s your choice\" (Debate.org). Both parties are acting in a voluntary manner. Many women choose to be a prostitute for many reasons. Therefore when a woman goes to a house for the business she does, and it is consensual. People cannot stop others for the act of consensual sex. Prostitution is a victimless crime, and therefore should be made legal in the United States. Prostitution legalization not only drastically lowers the child trafficking rate, but people have the right to their bodies and prostitution will never be fully contained. It is a victimless crime and consensual. Although many people already have very biased ideas about what prostitution is, and who participates, there are very many outstanding ways America could improve but simply legalizing prostitution",

Since my opponent has forfeited this round, I shall take this round to summarize the debate thus far, and/or add anything that I think I missed out in previous rounds. My opponent has repeated or clarified all his arguments in Round 2, and I will be quoting from there.@karamvirz A1:\u201cThe reason being that the SITA act is in no way powerful enough to allow the sex workers exercise the right to equality, prohibition of discrimination, right against exploitation etc.\u201dCounter:Just because the act does not guarantee sex workers certain rights, does not necessarily mean that legalizing prostitution will guarantee them rights. In fact, a study by CATW (an international NGO) has shown that it does not happen. I should remind my adversary that discrimination and exploitation against or of prostitutes is illegal, and legalizing prostitution would have no effect on it. Perhaps my adversary wishes for greater enforcement of the law in favour of prostitutes.@karamvirz A2:\u201cI am not in favor of activities that \"PROMOTE\" prostitution in any form but , to amend our laws so that the ones involved in this (both sex workers and their clients )can freely exercise the rights and the practices without being criminalised which ultimately will ease out the sexual frustration in the society leading to reduction in rapes and other incidents that I have talked about.\u201dCounter:As mentioned before, legalizing prostitution doesn\u2019t guarantee rights for anyone. My adversary has given no reason to believe that legalizing prostitution will ease out the \u201csexual frustration\u201d that he perceives exists in society. @karamvirz A3:\u201cThe reason I talk about widespread nature of prostitution and lax enforcement of existing laws is to enlighten everyone of the fact that this is something that has been ongoing since ages and never stopped, considering which makes me think that the only reason that it has survived so long is that it is somehow silently accepted by all societies and is a necessity , then why not make it acceptable by law as well.This will help reduce the fear both participants\" mind.\u201dCounter:My adversary is aware of how weak this argument is. His use of the word \u201csomehow\u201d implies that even he doesn\u2019t know how or whether prostitution can be accepted by society. I have to contradict him here. A 2011 study on India by the International Center for Research on Women has shown that \u201cupwards of 84 percent of respondents said they thought sex work was morally wrong\u201d. Clearly, Indian society is not as accepting of prostitution as my adversary thinks it is. The study is part of an international, three-year long survey, with a sample size of up to 8000 men spread across various countries. (ICRW isn't very clear on its methodology, but they're an international NGO so I think they are trustworthy).Source: http://www.icrw.org...@karamvirz A4:\u201cI believe that the legalisation will give rights to a prostitute to legal help in such cases and situations and prevent herself from harassment.As a result they can force their clients to use protection else no SEX. An example improvement could be - Sex workers and clients can be made to present mandatory health cards before getting involved in any practice which have the date and status of their last health check and either party can have the right to demand for a health card before the act. So I definitely believe this will improve things and prevent many sexually transmitted deceases.\u201dCounter: Prostitutes already have the right to legal help. If they don\u2019t want to have sex without a condom, all they have to do is say so. In fact, either party is allowed to pose any restrictions they like. If these restrictions are not agreeable and either party forces themself on the other, then the sex becomes non-consensual = rape. (which is a criminal offence) My adversary\u2019s point makes no sense.@karamvirz A5:\u201cIt is the thinking of our indian society that we need to change.When laws will be made to recognise prostitution definitely people will start thinking positively towards it.\u201dCounter: Pure conjecture; this point should be ignored. I cannot understand why my adversary is so confident as to say that it will \u201cdefinitely\u201d happen. @karamvirz A6:\u201cI am not a speaker or supporter of brothels , Pimps and other such organisations neither Do I say these should be made legal.But do you think that any person would feel safe and fearless in a room when even with a prostitute who is not part of a group or network?I would disagree and most of us would.The whole point is to remove the fear from the participants\" minds of being caught and charged for God knows what all things.\u201d Counter:I will remind my adversary that prostitution is legal. Organized prostitution, such as under a pimp, in a brothel or prostitution otherwise affiliated with an organization is illegal in India, under the Indian Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act (SITA). If my adversary is not saying that these should be made legal, then he has just conceded the debate. \u201cI would disagree and most of us would\u201d is pure conjecture and should be ignored. I have difficulty following the second part of my adversary\u2019s argument, and I request him to phrase it clearly, with a definite conclusion, so that I can address it in the next round. Conclusion:I have rebutted all of my adversary\u2019s points. I note that he has not rebutted my point that prostitution will worsen attitudes towards women in India and made a ridiculous counter argument against my substantiated claim that legalization increases clandestine and underground prostitution, women trafficking, and child prostitution. The full burden of proof is on Pro, and he has to successfully defend his arguments against my rebuttals to win this debate. I note also that my arguments may not impress him, given that he thinks that I am obsessed with statistics, but I hope it impresses our voters.I request him to post his argument in time this time. Sources used are the same as in previous rounds, except for the link in the earlier part of this argument.",

Regulation. Require those who hire and those who engage in prostitution to carry liscenses that must be updated regularly. Part of the stipulation will be STD screenings. Problem solved.

            "premise": "Rebuttals to Round 4 Arguments: \"However underage prostitutes should not affect everyone else who is completely of age and can make their own choices.\" -I think that your arguments are slightly off point. As I mentioned before, an overwhelming percentage of prostitutes are brought into that lifestyle at a very early age. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"The crime is completely determined by motivation! It's basically convicting someone and throwing them in jail for having the wrong motivation to have sex.\" -I believe you are taking prostitution and criminality in the completely wrong perspective. First, the crime behind prostitution is exploitation. Exploitation is a crime, and it is actually very common with underage girls. Ironically, most prostitutes, as we identified earlier, were exploited at a very early age, and as a result, they have become battered by the lifestyle. Take this following source for example: \"Prostitution is consuming thousands of girls and women and reaping enormous profits for organized crime in post-communist countries. In addition, each year, several hundred thousand women are trafficked from Eastern European countries for prostitution in sex industry centers all over the world. The practices are extremely oppressive and incompatible with universal standards of human rights. The sex trade is a form of contemporary slavery and all indications predict its growth and expansion into the 21st century.\" [1] -If we digest this statement, and use some deductive reasoning we can jump to a couple solid points. First, the regulation of prostitution will just expand on human trafficking. Pimps and greedy businessmen will target young girls and groom them to partake into the sex trade. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"I will replace the words 'having sex' with say, eating a burrito. If I eat a burrito because I like the burrito, its fine, but when I do it because I want money, its suddenly illegal?\" -You have mentioned a couple times that my reasoning was illogical. Now, I would really like for you to explain how you compare the exploitation of minors into prostitution to eating a \"burrito\"? I hope you understand that this is a very real issue. You bring up points about eating burritos, and I am bringing up points about; exploitation, physical abuse, drug addiction, and rape. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"The problem isn't the act itself, the problem is the industry which surrounds it, so wouldn't it be better to legalize it so we could take steps to eliminate this abusive industry and keep the prostitutes safe?\" -Now we are getting somewhere. The real nuts and bolts into why some people feel prostitution should be regulated. I present this source as an argument: \"Considering the extreme conditions of exploitation in the sex industry, those distinctions are nothing but abstractions that make for good academic debates. They are, however, meaningless to women under the control of pimps or traffickers. Certainly, the sex industry doesn't differentiate between \"free\" and \"forced,\" and my research reveals that men who buy women and children in prostitution don't differentiate either. Legalization and regulation aim to redefine prostitution as a form of work, indicated by the use of the term \"sex work.\" The renaming may clean up the image of prostitution, but it doesn't end the violence and exploitation.\"[1] -What can we conclude from this particular statement. How do you intend to control the pimps and the businessmen that will traffic minors into the industry? How do you intend to regulate or control the drug addiction? We can't even control the heroin epidemic that is on the rise in this country. Do you really believe we can control rape of physical abuse? Can you guarantee me that all prostitution will be conducted in some facility, where security personnel manage a camera system? What do you intent to do when men decide to sneak camera's into the room and film their sexual intercourse, then sell it on the internet? To what ends do you expect to take prostitution, and please don't tell me its for the income the governments will receive through taxation? -Lets look into healthcare for these prostitutes. Do you really think insurance companies will provide very cheap insurance to women who are likely to obtain some form of STD? What about all the males that could catch some of these STD's? Is it possible that STD's will rise in this country? If that's the case, what will happen to our insurance premiums? Will the government now force those who can actually afford healthcare to also pay for the treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases? I am using a little logic here. However we still have one more argument. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Okay, it's fair to say many prostitutes were abused as children. But how about the prostitutes that weren't and chose the profession from their own free will? And even if there was a link between all of them, isn't the damage already done? \" -So from what I can conclude from your statement, the damage is already done to minors, why not let them have a career in prostitution. Is that the point you are trying to make? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \"Then you agreed with me and said that yes, it would be entirely illegal. However, your statement is illogical, since before you said that we do have the right to do the things that meet the criteria, and my example certainly met the criteria. Your contradicting yourself. Look, I think you're a skilled debater, yet you're not being reasonable.\" -I don't see where I contradicted myself. I told you people could have sex of their own free will. However, men who pay women for sex are guilty of exploitation. They are exploiting a sexual service from someone who was likely brought into prostitution through; phsyical abuse, mental abuse, molestation, drugs, or manipulation. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conclusion: -Lets break down prostitution in a different way. Why do men pay women for a sexual service? To gratify a sexual desire? To fulfil a sexual fantasy? Is it a taboo for them? Are they cheating on their wives? -Women sell their bodies for money, not because it feels good. Now there may be a very small percentage of women that cope with the lifestyle of prostitution, but that does not make it right. When taking into consideration the amount of minors that are manipulated and driven into prostitution, it is completely rational and fair to conclude exploitation is the crime. \"Women's bodies and emotions must belong to them alone. They must not be traded or sold. The sex industry targets and consumes young women, usually under age 25, often girls in their teens. If a state permits prostitution to flourish, a certain portion of each generation of young women will be lost. Prostitution causes extreme harm to the body and the mind. Women who survive the beatings, rapes, sexually transmitted diseases, drugs, alcohol, and emotional abuse, emerge from prostitution ill, traumatized, and often, as poor as when they entered.\"[1] On to you!

            "premise": "As one can clearly see in the case of the Australian law, it is the law itself which creates barriers to entry, not the fact that prostitution is legal. This is what I was talking about that it was not completely legalized. It was legalized with conditions built in that are difficult to meet. The law itself requires that prostitution be done in a building designated for that purpose which meets a variety of other requirements. Clearly the barriers to entry are not a product of legalization but the law itself.I agree with Con that companionship is an important part of human life. I also agree that sex can be an expression of intimacy among companions. Prostitution cannot replace companionship. However, even when not in a relationship, humans still feel compelled toward sex. This is often satisfied through one night stands and the like. It is this basic need for sex that prostitution can and does address. In fact, a legal and regulated sex industry would often be safer than random hook ups at a bar. It is certainly less time consuming than hanging around bars hoping to hook up, and does not involve consuming alcohol and other detrimental behaviors. For this reason prostitution is a net gain for society as a whole and should not only be legal but also encouraged.Con contends that if prostitution were completely legal, it would be so prevalent that prostitutes would compete each other out of business. Of course, even a cursory knowledge of economics should dissuade anyone from believing this. Con curiously seems to claim that the increased availability of prostitutes would cause people to prefer relationships. I have already discussed earlier that sex as an expression of intimacy and sex as the fulfillment of a basic need are vastly different situations and prostitutes would not be put out of business by relationships. I also fail to see how, as Con claims, that prostitutes would choose to \"enslave themselves to pimps\" once legalized. This is something that happens because it is illegal.Con's source about the Netherlands refers to human trafficking, indeed a problem that needs to be addressed, but that still doesn't change the fact that sexual assualt in the netherlands is significantly lower than in the US which Con offered no evidence against.In an attempt to prove that prostitution is not a job, Con links to an article that seems to have nothing to do with his point. Indeed there are serious issues prostitutes face and it's only after normalizing and accepting prostitution that these issues will be able to be addressed properly. As long as prostitution is viewed by many as shameful, bad, or wrong, prostitutes will continue to be victimized. Once we all view it as just as viable a profession as working in a retail store, the \"shadiness\" will inevitably go away. Con also seems to believe that anyone who refuses to join a union is not in a legitimate profession, an absurd contention I won't waste any space arguing against because it's obviously incorrect.Con likens prostitution to modeling (as opposed to acting). I agree with him on this point, and also believe that modeling should be completely legal and viewed as a valid career path. Luckily it already is. We should afford this same courtesy to prostitutes. Con also says that a law will only complicate things while arguing in favor of a law to ban prostitution, a strange contradiction.In summary, if prostitution were not only legal but also normalized and fully embraced as a legitimate career choice, all of society would be better off. Let me repeat that simple legalization is not enough. It needs to be normalized and accepted. All of Con's points about the downside of prostitution are either because it is illegal, because the laws are designed badly, or simply because the profession is viewed as wrong or shameful even in places where it's legal. It is because of this last point that legalization is not enough. We need to normalize and encourage it as a legitimate career choice.",

            "premise": "The issue of dehumanizing women or making them out to be an item does not lie in the idea of prostitution. The most devaluing aspect of prostitution is the fact that it is not legal. This restricts a woman's ability to choose her own career path. The idea of sexualizing woman has already taken place with exotic dancing and pornography and therefore should not be seen as the driving force for anti prostitution movements. As for rape, sexual assault is even more of a reason for prostitution to be legalized. If a prostitute is raped now, the lines are more blurred and the woman is likely to be prosecuted equally or instead of the man who did the sexual assault in the first place. If prostitution was legal, the only one to be at fault would be the rapist, not the prostitute.",

            "conclusion": "Prostitution should be legal in the United States",
            "premise": "1. The Right To Do What We Want With Our Own BodiesWe have the right (if not legal right) to do whatever we want with our own bodies, so long as it doesn't infringe upon the rights of another. Con says we don't have that right in regard to prostitution, based on these factors: A) Disease- I've already argued against this, including the fact that STD rates tend to DROP when you legalize prostitution.B) Physical Violence- I've already argued against this and explained why legalized prostitution PROTECTS prostitutes from physical violence (from pimps, clients, etc.). To repeat, it makes law enforcement protective allies rather than people who will arrest you for doing your job. C) It wouldn't financially benefit the govt.- This is completely untrue which I will explain later. More importantly, you don't lose rights just because something isn't profitable. It wasn't profitable to free the slaves, but they still had a right to freedom. D) It would encourage selling sex for money.- Once again, I've already argued against this. See point 6 from the last round as just one example. E) It subjects people to ridicule. - This is completely irrelevant. I might wear a terrible outfit and be ridiculed. That doesn't mean I don't have the right to wear it.2. Covering the Medical Cost of STDs Con says that we cannot expect clients to be tested for STDs, as that might infringe upon their privacy. With any mutual transaction, the customer and consumer agree to specific terms. This is true of any contract or exchange. Some requirements are more detailed or personal than others. In this case, a brothel might require STD testing just as leasing a vehicle or renting a home requires a background and credit check. If the customer doesn't want to abide by the terms and conditions of the exchange, then they won't be a customer there.Further, I've argued that people must be responsible for their own health and decisions. If I eat 20 cupcakes a day, I might suffer from obesity. That's my problem. Con never responded to the contention of personal responsibility. Additionally, prostitutes would require safe sex. Considering condoms are 98% effective [5], the likelihood of contracting an STD is minimal. Also, Con disregards the obvious fact that if prostitutes are being tested for STDs, then even if the clients aren't tested, the prostitutes will NOT be spreading STDs (because if they had one they couldn't practice) meaning any rise in rates could not be attributed to prostitution. 3. BureaucracyCon says he disputes the economic gains that legalizing prostitution would bring. This is a pretty absurd contention. Let's acknowledge how big the sex industry is (it generates billions in revenue per year). Now for a small case study, consider the fact that in Nevada alone, legal brothels generate about $50 million in total revenue per year and have an economic impact of about $400 million on the state [6]. Now multiply 400 million by 50 states. That's 20 billion dollars in positive economic impact. That is money that goes into the circulating economy - not the underground economy, benefiting only crooks.So now we have to see if the cost of regulation is so enormous that it somehow trumps the exorbitant amount of money the industry creates. The answer is quite clear that it most certainly would not. By \"regulating\" the only thing the government would have to do is audit brothels, which would require maybe hiring a few more IRS employees. Of course creating those jobs would be a good thing. The same applies to creating jobs to check for safety and code compliance. Assuming the government had to hire 1,000 employees to oversee this regulation of this industry (which is probably a generous over-estimation) at let's say $50 K a year, that would cost 50 million dollars at the federal level... but considering we estimated the tax revenue at 50 million at the state level, then clearly revenue exceeds bureaucratic oversight by hundreds of millions of dollars.If you don't want to accept my figures, a comprehensive analysis on the cost of regulating prostitution can be found in a study done by economists [7]. The authors support regulation as being financially beneficial on a cost/benefit analysis. Moreover, they point out the obvious fact that the cost of criminalizing prostitution is incredibly and unnecessarily expensive. They note, \"...Legal intervention in these sub-markets [prostitution] is likely to be specially costly and futile at the same time.\" My opponent mistakenly ignores the enormous cost of criminalizing this industry, which costs about 8 million dollars per state per year [8]. That's about $400 million annually. Regulation would be astronomically cheaper than criminalization. Con says, \"But if its the private sector regulating prostitution then these agencies would prioritize making money more than keeping people safe.\" There are a ton of arguments in favor of privately regulating multiple industries, not just prostitution [9]. I could spend a great amount of time detailing why this is a completely flawed assertion. However, I've already showed why this would be economically beneficial even without private regulation, so for the sake of brevity I won't waste my time. Likewise while it's true that prostitutes may get help trying to find jobs, that's not really important to my contention so I won't waste character space responding to it. The point still remains that the economic benefits for legalization are overwhelmingly in my favor. 4 & 6 - Brainwashing and Impact on Society Con basically says that prostitution is taboo which is irrelevant. Bi-racial and gay relationships are still considered taboo in some places, but that doesn't mean they are immoral. The same concept applies to smoking pot. Rather than a visceral, emotional response based on what society has told is is \"acceptable,\" we have to look at the facts. The facts are that society has a very strong demand for sex, and prostitution is a viable solution. Rather than spend $40 buying a random girl drinks at a bar hoping to take her home, a client could spend the money going to a prostitute and doing exactly what he would have done anyway: have casual sex, which happens in our society all the time. This is safer and probably more moral as the intentions of the exchange are clear and mutually agreed upon. Con also brings up teenage prostitutes. This is an appeal to emotion (But what about the children?!) but doesn't have much clout. For one thing, if a teenager wants to pursue a career in sex work, they should have that option. The only reason this seems \"icky\" is because of what society has taught us about the non-existent, inherent sacredness of sex or our bodies. And you know what - if you believe that sex is sacred, awesome - don't be a prostitute. Parents should instill values in their kids/teens. But again, you cannot impose your own morality onto others via government force. It is not the role or responsibility of citizens or government to interfere with your sexual choices, but instead to protect your rights and uphold contractual agreements in the market. 5. Rule BreakersCon basically ignored my entire argument 5 from the last round, so just extend it. [ CONCLUSION ]My entire R2 has been upheld.

            "premise": "Thank you. You have brought up good points. Arguments: Prostitution is basically personalized pornography[2]. Pornography is good for you[1], and perfectly legal, making the it seem unfair that prostitution is illegal. In fact, it would be legal if any of the parties filmed it and distributed the video. There are a few apparent contradictions with the law here. Prostitutes are also similar to promiscuous people, with the exception of the fee. It is pretty much unavoidable that there are going to be people who sleep with strangers and enjoy it, and it should be allowed if they want to make money off of it. If prostitution were government regulated, it could be the new lottery. What I mean is it would bring in thousands upon thousand of tax dollars each year[8], helping our US government pay off its huge debt[9]. The Declaration of Independence tries to give citizens the right to the pursuit of happiness[3]. This may be a stretch, but it still stands that if prostituting yourself makes you happy and is something you enjoy, you shouldn\"t be prevented from doing it. Rebuttals: \"It promotes children to be trafficked\" In fact, it would do quite the opposite. Children being trafficked, especially for sex, is terrible and unfortunately happens very often[4]. However, they're an easier target because children are not as smart or strong as adults and therefore more vulnerable. If prostitution were legal, there would be more willing adults in the business, causing the demand for child trafficking to dive[5]. It would also decrease human trafficking in general[6]. \"Most of the prostitutes are victims\" Right now that is true. But like I mentioned, if it were legal, there would be ore willing participants and thus a much lower demand for people to be forced into prostitution against their will. In a world without sex trafficking, prostitution would be a victimless crime[5]. \"Whether or not it's legal, it's still a dangerous job\" There will always be risks, as there are with any profession. Making prostitution legal will decrease these risks. Nevada was the first state in the US to legalize prostitution. They have very smart laws set to keep their workers safe that could not be enforced if prostitution were considered a crime. The employees are given monthly STD tests, have a \"safety button\" in the case of a client getting too aggressive, and brothels can\"t seek to recruit new prostitutes[7]. Quotes[10]: 1 If nobody wants to sell sex, it is a crime to force anyone to do so. But when men or women do want to sell their bodies, they should have that full right without encountering punishment or discrimination. If the client behaves decently, the relationship between the sex buyer and the sex seller must be considered a purely private transaction. \" NILS JOHAN RINGDAL, Love For Sale 2 \"The obscenities of this country are not [prostitutes]. It is the poverty which is obscene, and the criminal irresponsibility of the leaders who make this poverty a deadening reality. The obscenities in this country are the places of the rich, the new hotels made at the expense of the people, the hospitals where the poor die when they get sick because they don't have the money either for medicines or services. It is only in this light that the real definition of obscenity should be made.\" R13; F. Sionil Jos\", Ermita: A Filipino Novel 3 The only way to stop this trafficking in and profiting from the use of women's bodies is for prostitution to be legalized. Legalization will open it up to regulation; and regulation means safety. JEANNETTE ANGELL, Callgirl 4 When prostitution is a crime, the message conveyed is that women who are sexual are \"bad,\" and therefore legitimate victims of sexual assault. Sex becomes a weapon to be used by men. MARGO ST. JAMES, San Francisco Examiner, Apr. 29, 1979 5 People tend to be put off by the idea of selling sex, but if you spend a winter's night with one of them and talk with her about her family and so on, you're likely to find she's just like any other woman.

Prostitution is legal in Nevada in Brothels, and also Argentina, Austria, Armenia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, El Salvador, Finland, France, Greece, Guatemala, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovakia, Switzerland and Turkey.Since the Rules established state that Prostitution is being considered in regards to Belgium, and prostitution is legal in Belgium, there is no debate here and Pro loses. In addition I would challenge Pro to prove that Condomns exist. However, I would argue that Brothels should require Condoms. I have noted the 2,000 character limit.

            "premise": "Some of your points/reason are repeated, basically you are trying to say- Legalization of prostitution gives legal rights to pimps or sex industry to expand the prostitution , and it doesn't promotes women's health , doesn't enhance women's choice and may cause increment in child prostitution. So my point is : Legalization of prostitution doesn't means that anyone who wants to run prostitution can got permission from government, now government's have control on it. After legalization, pimps have to take license from government to run the prostitution. And practicing of unfair means by them can cancel their license, so it creates a fear for them, so they can follow the prescribe rule to run the prostitution. In case of expansion, So it is a choice, if anyone prefer it so she/he can go in it and if pimps try to make force on her/him then she/he can go for complain. Legalization of prostitution, doesn't means that governments give allowance for child prostitution, there would be minimum age which is decided by government, same as government define minimum age for marriage and minimum age for drinking, and if any case are found regarding child prostitution there should be complain of it and should be punished. Legalization of prostitution definitely protect women(prostitutes) because now what they are doing is legal so they can go to cop or state court if any unfair means happens to them and got a help from a state. State would not give licence for street prostitution to pimps, and also after legalization government have information of where prostitution is going on because every sex industry or brothel's which are running now they try to got a legal license. After legalization of prostitution state would conduct protective steps to ensure health and safe environment for prostitutes and provides labour rights and prostitutes have identity in society and if 100% is not followed but still these condition is much better than condition what prostitutes suffer in these day's.",

            "premise": "Konichiwa! Since my opponent has not given me any guidelines to follow, I will post my arguments this round. Point 1: STDs and How Long It Can Take To Show Up Sexually transmitted diseases can take a long time to show up in an infected individual. For this argument, I'll be giving three common sexually transmitted diseases along with how long it may take the person to develop symptoms or for it to be detected by tests.HPV:Testing:For HPV, there is currently no testing for men (1)\"The average incubation period, which begins immediately after the initial sexual contact with an infected person, is usually two to three months but can range from one to 20 months. However, when HPV is transmitted from one person to another, the virus infects the top layers of the skin and can remain inactive or latent for months or possibly years before warts or other signs of HPV infection appear. In couples that have not had sex partners for many years, the woman may develop an abnormal Pap smear because of previous contact.\" (2)What it causes:\" HPV can cause cervical and other cancers cancers including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (called oropharyngeal cancer). Cancer often takes years, even decades, to develop after a person gets HPV. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types of HPV that can cause cancers. There is no way to know which people who have HPV will develop cancer or other health problems. People with weak immune systems (including individuals with HIV/AIDS) may be less able to fight off HPV and more likely to develop health problems from it.\" (3) Treatment:There is a vaccine that will prevent some of the strains of HPV before the initial infection. HIV:Testing:\"Even if a prostitute is being tested every week for HIV, she will test negative for at least the first 4-6 weeks and possibly the first 12 weeks after being infected.... This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely. This is not the best approach for actually reducing harm. Instead, in order to slow the global spread of HIV/AIDS we should focus our efforts on abolishing prostitution.\" (4)What it Causes:\" HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you highly susceptible to numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-poor nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV and a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus. This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces \u2014 causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs. Candidiasis. Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on the mucous membranes of your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina. Cryptococcal meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil. Toxoplasmosis. This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, and the parasites may then spread to other animals and humans. Cryptosporidiosis. This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite that's commonly found in animals. You contract cryptosporidiosis when you ingest contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS.\" (5) Treatment and its side effects:There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but a variety of drugs can be used in combination to control the virus. Each class of anti-HIV drugs blocks the virus in different ways. It's best to combine at least three drugs from two classes to avoid creating strains of HIV that are immune to single drugs. HIV treatment regimens may involve taking multiple pills at specific times every day for the rest of your life. Side effects can include: Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Heart disease Weakened bones or bone loss Breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) Abnormal cholesterol levels Higher blood sugar levels\" (6) Due to a character limit, these are all the disease I will cover.In Conclusion Regarding Point 1:Many sexually transmitted diseases take a while to show up in testing. For instance, HIV can take up to twelve weeks to show up.It is unsafe and immoral to approve this type of behavior.This would lead to more STD infections as quoted by Jeffery J. Barrows.Case 2: Sex TrafficingThis argument will be quoted:\"Legalized or decriminalized prostitution industries are one of the root causes of sex trafficking. One argument for legalizing prostitution in the Netherlands was that legalization would help to end the exploitation of desperate immigrant women who had been trafficked there for prostitution. However, one report found that 80% of women in the brothels of the Netherlands were trafficked from other countries (Budapest Group, 1999)(1). In 1994, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) stated that in the Netherlands alone, \u201cnearly 70 % of trafficked women were from CEEC [Central and Eastern European Countries]\u201d (IOM, 1995, p. 4). The government of the Netherlands presents itself as a champion of antitrafficking policies and programs, yet it has removed every legal impediment to pimping, procuring and brothels. In the year 2000, the Dutch Ministry of Justice argued in favor of a legal quota of foreign \u201csex workers,\u201d because the Dutch prostitution market demanded a variety of \u201cbodies\u201d (Dutting, 2001, p. 16).In the year since lifting the ban on brothels in the Netherlands, eight Dutch victim support organizations reported an increase in the number of victims of trafficking, and twelve victim support organization reported that the number of victims from other countries has not diminished (Bureau NRM, 2002, p. 75). Forty-three of the 348 municipalities (12%) in the Netherlands choose to follow a no-brothel policy, but the Minister of Justice has indicated that the complete banning of prostitution within any municipality could conflict with the federally guaranteed \u201cright to free choice of work\u201d (Bureau NRM, 2002, p.19). \" (7) Due to a character limit, that is all I shall post.

            "premise": "Premise 1-Definition of Prostitution Con has yet to provide a clear definition to what prostitution is. Prostitution is the act of offering one\u2019s self for hire to engage in sexual relations. (1) This means that there is consent between all parties involved, to exchange a service (sex). 1-http://bit.ly... Premise 2-Purpose of Laws For prostitution to be illegal there needs to be laws against it. So that ultimately leads to the question, why do laws exist? Laws are in place to protect citizen\u2019s general safety and their rights from external forces. (2) This means that as long as one is not harming another person\u2019s rights or safety, they are not acting outside the law, and are free to make any decisions they wish. This overall allows people to have individual autonomy and free will, as long as they are not affecting another. 2-http://bit.ly... Premise 3-Regulations Countries which have legal prostitution tend to regulate it (such as Germany and the Netherlands). Two of the main problems which face prostitutes and/or johns (people who buy prostitutes), which threaten their safety, are rape/assault and STDs. There are already laws against rape/assault (which I\u2019ll get more into later), but STDs cannot be prevented the same way. However, many areas where prostitution is legal have put laws in place which make STDs among prostitutes a lot less likely. For example, in counties where prostitution is legal in Nevada, condom use and weekly tests for STDs are required by law. (3) There are also similar laws in Germany. (4, 5) In fact, even without laws requiring things such as condoms, most prostitutes won\u2019t work without one, which is how it is in the Netherlands. (6) As a result of these policies, areas which have legal prostitution see less STDs. This can be observed in Nevada, Germany, Australia, and Rhode Island (where prostitution was temporarily legal). (3, 4, 7, 8) Regulation has worked so well in Nevada, to the point where STDs are less likely among Nevada prostitutes than among California porn stars. (3) 3-http://huff.to...4-http://bit.ly...5-http://bit.ly...6-http://bit.ly...7-http://bit.ly...8-http://bit.ly... Premise 4-Dangers of Illegal Prostitution Con mentions a stat that says about 80% of prostitutes have been raped, which I agree with. In fact, most prostitutes are too scared to even report violence from customers to the police, because they don\u2019t want to be prosecuted. (9) So, one would expect rape of prostitutes to go down in areas where prostitution is legal, because they don\u2019t have to worry about being arrested or otherwise punished. The stats support this. For example, despite other crimes happening at about the same rate, rape decreased dramatically when rape was legal in Rhode Island. (8) The opposite ended up happening when Queensland banned brothels, with a 149% increase in women being raped, compared to a 49% increase in other offenses against women. (10) Overall, studies have shown that if rape was legalized throughout the US the rape rate would decrease by about 25%. (10) Another major problem, that doesn\u2019t exist nearly as much when rape is legal are abusive pimps. Studies have shown that 89% of women in prostitution want to escape. (11) In fact, pimps often manipulate, threaten, and abuse women in order to make sure they remain prostitutes. (12) However, if women were protected under the law they would no longer have to serve pimps and could work for a brothel, which could not abuse their employees or force them to leave. 9- http://bit.ly...10-http://bit.ly...11-http://1.usa.gov...12- http://bit.ly... Argument 1-Regulated Prostitution Should be Legal As already shown prostitution in its pure form is done with consent, so no one\u2019s rights are harmed. Also, as shown regulations can make it safer. Plus, having it be illegal makes it more dangerous than it has to be. For that reason prostitution should be legal. Premise 5-Profit from Legal Prostitution Legalizing prostitution would also provide a huge profit. Prostitution is a huge industry, which costs a lot to enforce laws against. For example, in the US $200,000,000 is spent annually on enforcing laws regarding prostitution. (13) However, potentially billions of dollars could be made from taxing prostitution, in the US alone. (14) 13-http://bit.ly...14-http://bit.ly... Argument 2-Financial Benefits As already shown prostitution would bring a lot of money into the government. This could be great for many reasons. This money could be spent on things such as police, social services, or even awareness of why people shouldn\u2019t hire prostitutes. Argument 3-Justice Benefits If the police have to focus less time on prostitution they can focus more on more serious crimes such as murder, rape, and assault. Plus, it would lead to less people being arrested for a crime which harms no one. Rebuttal 1-Encoragement of Prostitution P1: I disagree with Con\u2019s reasoning for the necessity of laws to maximize people\u2019s welfare. As mentioned in my 2nd premise, laws are better off to protect others from external forces, but otherwise they should have completely free autonomy. This way the government treats all people equal, assuming they don't harm others. P2: Sex Tourism: A culture of promiscuity is not inherently bad. One may subjectively see it as a bad, but it\u2019s not objectively bad. Con does say it hurts the city\u2019s reputation, along with its tourism industry. However, having legal prostitution may improve the city\u2019s reputation, to some people, specifically libertarians. Plus, Amsterdam is still one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, having more tourists than cities such as Tokyo and Los Angeles. (15) Plus, even though Con\u2019s argument came from tourism workers in Amsterdam, it\u2019s still essentially a subjective opinion with no evidence. Divorce: Con suggests that divorce would increase if prostitution is legal. However, no evidence is provided to support this. In fact, divorce rates in Germany and the Netherlands have increased at roughly the same rate as other Western countries and are in many cases lower: Germany (16): Netherlands (17): France (18): Belgium (19): Italy (20): Drug Use: Con provides no insight on the cause of this correlation. It could simply be because they feel like they can\u2019t leave, which is must less of a problem in legal prostitution as mentioned above. However, the cause could easily be something else as well. For example, most prostitutes are poor, and drug abuse tends to be higher among poor people. (21, 22) Also, drug use is not notably higher in Germany or the Netherlands compared to their European neighbours. In fact, both countries have among the lowest amount of people injecting drugs per capita. (23) As for the prostitutes almost everything I addressed responds to Con\u2019s concerns. Essentially, keeping it illegal just causes things such as rape and murder to occur a lot more in prostitution. C1: I disproved both premises to build this conclusion (although I only had to disprove one). P3: I accept that prostitution would increase. C2: C1 has been disproved, so C2 therefore has been as well. 15- http://read.bi...16- http://bit.ly...17- http://bit.ly...18- http://bit.ly...19- http://bit.ly...20- http://bit.ly...21- http://bit.ly...22- http://bit.ly...23- http://bit.ly... Rebuttal 2-Human Trafficking P1: I accept this premise. P2: I accept this premise. P3: If you follow the view of personal autonomy you know the prostitutes are responsible for their own actions to enter human trafficking, an illegal activity, even with legal prostitution. However, even if you follow Con\u2019s view, legal prostitution would still provide a net benefit. Currently in the US there are estimated to be 14,500-17,500 people in human trafficking. (24) Let\u2019s say the 17,500 numbers grows 100% if prostitution is legal, meaning 17,500 more people are negatively affected. However, let\u2019s examine the decline in rape. There was a 31% decrease in rape rate after rape was legalized in Rhode Island. (8) We\u2019ll be conservative and say the decline would only be 25% nationally. Con uses the stat that 80% of prostitutes have been raped. We\u2019ll use that stat as well. It is also estimated that there are 1,000,000 prostitutes in the US (we\u2019ll just account for them in the calculations, not any new prostitutes who most likely haven\u2019t been raped). (25): Decline rate*(Number of Prostitutes*Rape Rate)=Drop in Rapes -0.25*(1,000,000*0.8)=-200,000 So it appears that at least 200,000 less women will be raped. So: 17,500-200,000=-182,500 net loss in people being harmed under legal prostitution. Not to mention, this is a very conservative estimate. I said human trafficking would increase 100%, which is likely larger than it would be. Plus, I took the largest estimate of people currently in human trafficking in the US. Also, I dropped Rhode Island\u2019s rape decline rate 6% and didn\u2019t even account for the fact that stat was for overall rapes, not just prostitutes (suggesting it\u2019d be larger drop among prostitutes). This also doesn\u2019t account for the fact less people would have STDs, less people assaulted/murdered, and less people feeling trapped as prostitutes. Finally, it doesn\u2019t account for the potential benefit from greater revenue for the government and more time for police to focus on serious crimes (such as human trafficking). C: Disproved premise 3. 24-http://bit.ly... 25-http://read.bi...Conclusion:As can be seen. There is no reason laws should exist against regulated prostitution. Plus, if legalized, many of the harms associated with prostitution would become much more minor. Finally, the benefits outweigh the costs regarding legalizing prostitution.",

            "conclusion": "In the United States, prostitution should be legal.",
            "premise": "Thank you, Acetraveler, for taking this debate. I have read other debates you have had, and I am sure that you will provide me with a good challenge, which is definitely something that I look forward to. I understand you are not from the USA, however I can only argue about situations in the US to support my resolution. First I will refute your arguments then I will expand my own arguments. \"First, basically, governments have no right to engage private life like intercourse. But if the benefit of public is bigger than the private right, the regulation was based on the legal step of the law The regulation is based on serious and careful consideration, and they are not violating the essential parts of the freedom and right, government can also regulate right of people..\" If I understand this argument, basically you're asserting that the collective wellbeing of the many trumps the individual rights in question. I will agree that the collective well being is important, but I argue that it is not MORE important than individual rights. My arguments on this ground are 1)There is no evidence presented here that legal prostitution IN THE UNITED STATES is harmful to the overall, mostly secular, society in the United States. 2)The United States was founded on the ideals that individuals have the right to protection from unjust and arbitrary laws that were enacted for the purpose of bettering the majority of society at that time (the stamp tax, sugar tax etc. Were enacted without allowing the taxed to have adequate representation in Parliament, thus violating the rights of individuals in the colonies in order to support the well being of the larger English society in Brittan.) For further examples, a quick look at our bill of rights shows that, of the 10 original amendments to the Constitution, every one of them, in one way or another, upholds the tenant that individual rights are paramount. \"Basically, the justice of prostitution is based on the right to decide of their own body. But, this right is also can be restricted because of violating the dignity of human. I have the intention to argue that prostitution can violate the dignity of human so regulation of prostitution should be needed even if the rule was made by the government in this debate.\" Almost anything can be twisted to harm the dignity of those involved in it. This does not invalidate the rights of the individual to choose to participate in those activities. Let me give an example of how the government actively has chosen NOT to uphold the dignity of women, because that is NOT THEIR BUSINESS. http://seattlepi.nwsource.com... Shows that the courts in the United States have ruled, if a woman is in public, and she wears a dress, she has no right to view her body as \u2018private' and her image can be captured, and distributed without her permission, or knowledge. We should all be able to agree that this creates a situation of indignity for women in general. I mention this not to debate whether these laws are just or not, but to refute the idea that criminalization of prostitution is somehow done to prevent indignity, when the courts have shown an outright disrespect for the dignity of women in other much more recent laws. Obviously, women that choose not to be objects of sexual gratification have no right to expect that choice to be honored, while the laws on prostitution also invalidate a woman's right to choose under what circumstances her body will be used for gratification. Further I will ask a question in regards to this argument. Who does society tend to view with a greater amount of dignity, she who obeys the law, or she who breaks the law? Some of the stigma and loss of dignity for prostitutes stems, not from the act, but from the law. \"Second, prostitution basically violate the rule of marry. The essence of the rule of marry is the exclusive right of the intercourse with a spouse. As long as the rule of marry remain the fundamental of the society, we should keep it.\" I understand this to mean that you assert that prostitution harms marriage by promoting otherwise faithful men to seek out sex with another partner. I disagree. Cheaters are cheaters and they will cheat, whether they are paying for the chance to cheat, or not. Liars are liars and they will lie. The lack of legal prostitution does not stop infidelity. Please see the following web site for some statistics of cheating on spouses in the US. http://menstuff.org... With nearly 1/4 the married people in the US participating in intercourse outside of marriage I hardly think we can consider faithfulness a fundamental aspect of American society. I would also challenge my opponent to describe how it might be possible for a prostitute, short of rape, which is not generally paid for, to actually cause a violation of the rule of marry? Isn't a larger part of the responsibility to maintaining that law of marry on those who are actually involved in the marriage? I could also read this argument to say that it is or should be unlawful or at least wrong, to participate in intercourse outside the bounds of marriage. It is difficult to be sure because within the bounds of marriage could apply to either no intercourse before marriage or no outside intercourse after marriage. Either way, in the United States women are not expected to wait for marriage to engage in intercourse. Nearly half of girls age 17 have had sex, but don't marry until the mid 20s. This was taken from: http://marriage.rutgers.edu... Therefore this standard of virginity at marriage is not fundamental to American Society. \"in addition, the use of a woman's body solely for the purpose of sexual gratification does not treat them as a person. This lack of respect dehumanizes both prostitute and client, and this situation can violate the dignity of both sexes. \" Pornography is legal. This means that it is legal for a woman to have sex in front of a camera for pay, but take the camera away and it is illegal. So, the overwhelming of freedom also can harm to the society and individual. It should be well adjusted by individuals or even by the government in the some situation. And I can tell you more side effects of prostitution. Finally, Laws regarding prostitution are also based on the serious consideration not only religion but also other aspects. I can show you this evidence by showing this site. - http://www.idebate.org...... - The regulation of prostitution are not only based on the faith of religion. Violation of the right of prostitutes, the economic aspects, the side effects from the country which allow prostitute, and so many other aspects are also considered by the officials in the USA government. Every one of the arguments at that website has a correlating response. I hold that the responses are clear and accurate and the rebuttals to your arguments at idebate.org are valid. However, the con stance presented does not show that the reason these laws were allowed to exist in the first place were for any reason other than morals (an extension of religious belief), The justifications I read here for the continuation of these laws seems to be primarily, \"even if we made it legal and regulated it, some would still work outside of the law.\" This is of course an oversimplification of the many many arguments presented, but the over feel of the arguments was such. My argument to this would be that I am not against licensure of prostitutes, regulations of the profession, or high penalties for those that operate outside the bounds of those regulations. Certainly there will always be those that operate a business in an illegal manner. There are illegal day cares even! All business are vulnerable to this. That in no way rebuts my resolution.",

            "premise": "\"That may be true where you live but I'm talking about every state in America. Where I live, there is no such thing as a license for being a prostitute. If money is involved, they can get arrested. They can't get a license in my area.\" Actually brothels are the buildings that are actually licensed and the prostitutes, the contracted workers, are legally allowed to sell sexual services, but any prostitution outside the licensed brothels would be illegal prostitution. Yes I understand that they do not have it in you area, because Nevada is the only state in the United States that brothels are legal. There are countries that have already legalized prostitution such as Netherlands, Germany, Austria and New Zealand but this has impacted the Netherlands with child prostitution dramatically in a 5 year period; 4,000 children engaged in prostitution during the year of 1996 and in the year of 2001 it has increased to 15,000 children involved in prostitution according to The Amsterdam-based ChildRight organization. So legalization of prostitution may most likely lead to the results of children prostitution. \"Actually, that may come out as a positive thing because where prostitutes won't make as much money, they might try to live an honest life or maybe they will just lower their price\" Contracted prostitutes in state licensed brothels are capable of setting their own prices for any services at any given time, so therefore they would only of course absurdly raise the pricing of their services when there is a customer that they find repulsive. They of course would not do this to everyone because they would need to pay for their staying at the brothel. I would say the contracted prostitutes are already living an honest life due to the fact that they are not in the streets and paying the costs of their living which includes eating, and sleeping, at the brothel. \"Making prostitution legal would break the link between their managers or pimps. These individuals subject prostitutes to physical abuse and threats of violence, retain a portion of their earnings, and often encourage them to become addicted to drugs. The provision of a secure environment in which to work would allow men and women to be independent of these individuals.\" Actually there is no real proof of that it would break any such link a pimp has against the illegal prostitutes. In fact if legal brothels are state owned and so technically there is still a manager or pimp, which of course would be the state. And by what I have read there still happens to be forced human trafficking in the Netherlands, so there of course would still be pimps abducting and using violence for human trafficking and would easily be concealed in the opened as other legal prostitutions go on. So, It would still be unlikely for men and woman to be independent from pimps. \"Legalisation of prostitution would bring clear economic benefit for governments. A tax on the fee charged by a prostitute, and the imposition of income tax on the earnings of prostitutes would generate revenue.\" By which you would be referring to legal brothels because that is where prostitutes would most effeciently be controlled by the government and taxing of the clients. State brothels are better alternatives to prostitution \"everywhere\". \"The problem of a high concentration of sex tourists in a short number of destinations will disappear once a larger number of countries legalise prostitution. Supporting this motion, therefore, will reduce the problem of sex tourism.\" I agree with that thought, but do not agree in trying to globaly make other countrie's cities into the Netherland's Amsterdam. I would like a better alternative than Amsterdam, because in the Netherlands prostitutes are not required to have mandatory health check ups...... so they might be dirty, not like they already are lol.",

            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for his great arguments. In this round I will rebut his arguments, then defend mine, then add my final argument.Human TraffickingI agree that anything that increases human trafficking is bad. I disagree with my opponent's assertion that legalising prostitution creates more human trafficking. My opponent has two sources, one from a blog that pretty much asserts this based on the opinions of a site called \"Bible Knowledge\" (with no research to back it up), and the other one is from the opinion pages of a minor newspaper. Both say that studies have been done but do not cite the studies, and despite a good search I cannot find any of them anywhere. His sources would do well to note that prostitution in Amsterdam is not legalised but decriminalised.Why does human trafficking happen? Prostitutes do not smuggle themselves. They get smuggled and traded by gangsters and criminal organisations. Prostitutes have no choice but to join these - they have no legal protections because they are also criminals, and they need protection from the law which the criminals can provide. This dependency is the problem. There is zero empirical evidence from peer-reviewed research that smuggling increases when prostitution is legal (http://eprints.qut.edu.au...), and it's because of the reduced dependency on criminal groups.Prostitution is only a tiny fraction of human trafficking that happens in the world (http://www.jstor.org...). It would be much better to tackle this problem rather than make the wrong assumption that all prostitutes are victims of trafficking (http://femlaw.queensu.ca...) and therefore need to be victimised by the government some more, by throwing them in jail and/or (if they are indeed trafficked) sending them back home with nothing. It's like banning retail in order to stop theft.But even if this were somehow the prostitute's fault, the solution is not to ban all prostitution just because some people do it wrong. Banning all prostitution because some people smuggle prostitutes is analogous to banning all TV because some people watch too much TV. Rather, it should be illegal to smuggle prostitutes, not to be a prostitute.As one book put it (http://goo.gl...) \"trafficking in women, coercion and exploitation can only be stopped if the existence of prostitution is recognized and the legal and social rights of prostitutes are guaranteed.\"Prostitution will still happenMy opponent's argument basically boils down to this: stealing still happens, so let's make that legal too. I'm not saying this is a reason to make it legal. That's what my safety and role of the state points are for. The reason I make this argument is because all the counter-arguments to prostitution rely on prostitution actually being reduced as a result of criminalisation, which all the evidence indicates it isn't. So while my opponent may make a good argument that legalisation does not follow from this, that isn't my point - my point is that prostitution will still happen. In my own country we have plenty of empirical evidence for this (http://www.nzherald.co.nz...).SafetyIf my opponent wants me to draw a distinction between other crimes and prostitution, I would be able to give several, such as the fact that prostitution does not have a victim and that no party is dissatisfied with the outcome. Having said that, my point is that prostitutes are better off when they are safer. Thieves are rarely raped and murdered. Every year that is the reality for thousands of prostitutes in countries where it is illegal. Our society has a problem with violent crime, and I've provided tons of analysis in the last round that legalising something that is (for no good reason) a \"soft crime\" can actually prevent a lot of this harder, more violent and more dangerous crime. That's good not only for the prostitute, but also for people like me that abhor prostitution.My opponent also argues that to be a profession it must have standards for safe sex and so on. I agree. Prostitution should have standards. The reason it doesn't is that there's no advocacy for prostitutes. As a result if prostitution is illegal, anybody with the ability to have sex can become a prostitute. When it's legal, legal requirements can be put in to ensure that prostitutes have safe sex, just like we ensure doctors are competent.Like my previous opponent, this opponent asks me to give sources citing empirical evidence of everything I say. Something that's logical, as my argument is, is true whether you have empirical proof or not, but in fact I can support everything I said there empirically. I just need my opponent to be more specific about what fact he disagrees with. If he would actually tell me what was wrong with my argument, I'd be happy to prove him wrong.He does mention that I lack a source that opening up to families leads to those families being able to make an intervention if the child is underage, which was my point about families. Actually there is a lot of evidence that legal prostitution can open up a whole range of discourse with young people and their families about it: http://goo.gl...He also does not believe prostitutes are more likely to honor other laws if prostitution is legal. This has been proven many times in academic journals, for instance: http://jiv.sagepub.com...Furthermore, he misreads my point on trafficking, and how it can be REDUCED (not increased) with legal prostitution.Role of the StateIn general, prostitution fits a class of actions that the state has already deemed to be legal. The state decided long ago that people ought to be free to use their bodies sexually to make a profit - this is why the pornography industry exists. Sex is no more illegal than posing nude, so the only principally consistent application of the law is not to ban either of them when money is added back into the equation. If we accept the view that the state is to determine moral rules about what should and should not be done, we must also expect the state to actually have a consistent and coherent moral code. The harm of this is that the general lack of principle in what determines right from wrong reduces clarity in certain borderline situations, thus reducing legal certainty. It's a lot more difficult to respect both the law in general, and any given law, when you aren't really sure what the law is or why it's there. This is definitely the case with prostitution.There are several arguments from specific perspectives on how the state should be behaving, in addition to the above argument from inconsistency in how the state is behaving. Prostitution is a privacy issue, because it concerns things done in the most private of all possible spaces. Government regulation over what we do on the internet, which is somehow also considered private, is not allowed - so then why is regulating prostitution allowed? Almost all of privacy law is about getting others out of our private lives - the only major exception is prostitution. This itself raises another question - since prostitution is so private and there are no spillover effects on others when it is managed and regulated correctly, why should the government even care? Prostitution law would therefore be a major overstepping of the state's role in our society. There are two impacts of this. First, there is a slippery slope towards more arbitrary \"moralizing\" of our lives, including our private lives. Second, it reduces general trust in the law, which impacts on crime rates.",

There are certainly times when we should have the right to do what we want with our bodies (get tattoos, piercings, spray tans, etc) and there are certainly times when we should not have the right to do what we want with our bodies (go in public naked, public urination, etc)\" Con cannot simply point out the obvious fact that we don't have the legal right to do whatever we want with our own bodies. Instead, he must explain why we should maintain the status quo\"I see what Pro has pointed out and I now realize I cannot use the argument \"because its illegal\" to argue why Prostitution shouldnt be legalized, so I will explain why we should consider not legalizing Prostitution. We should maintain the status quo of not legalizing prostitution because it can 1) lead to the spreading of many diseases between individuals (STD's and non-STD's alike), 2) it can also lead to physical harm of either the prostitute or the client, 3) it would not be a financial benefit to the government, 4) it could encourage much younger generations to start selling sex for money and put themselves in great danger, and 5) because it subjects the prostitute and even their family to ridicule and harm since a majority of Americans see prostitution as a taboo profession, and thats just off the top of my head2) Medical bills would rise as a result of STD rising. The Pro once again argues that legal prostitutes are regularly tested for STD's but my point in this argument would be that the prostitutes themselves would be in danger of catching STD's from their clients who are not tested. Requiring clients to submit to STD tests could be seen as a violation of their privacy and doctor-patient confidentiality because other requirements needed to buy alcohol or a car are associated with age and registration, things that are not private and thus dont violate the privacy of the consumers. Lastly if the government flat out refused to cover the cost of STD's then this hurts both the prostitutes and clients who may contract STD's and have to pay out of their own pockets for treatment, but it would also punish against other people who were born with STD's or contracted STD's from their partner who is not a prostitute. If the government legislates against covering STD's then way more people then prostitutes will suffer for it. 3) Legalizing prostitution = saving money (?)\" Con has conceded to how much the criminalization of prostitution has failed both as a deterrent and how much of a problem it has been in terms of financing - including lost tax revenue, and the cost of maintaining the criminal justice system\"Yes I know I conceded that, thats what the word \"conceded\" in the arguments in the second round I gave means.... I understand that tax revenue is lost by not making prostitution legal, I am simply disputing that the other costs and factors of legalizing, regulating, and accounting for legalized prostitution would eat away from how profitable legalizing prostitution could be for the US, if it would be profitable at all. \"By keeping prostitution illegal, you are forcing all of these employees into having criminal records which basically secures prostitution as the only job they can ever have thereafter\"Being in the criminal record does not chain someone to the career they had prior to that record. Police agencies and jails routinely try to get prostitutes to switch professions after they have been put on record. http://www.azcentral.com...http://www.huffingtonpost.com...http://www.bing.com...http://www.amplifyyourvoice.org...Police forces regularly try to help prostitutes with and without criminal records alike to change profession, so the idea that the system chains prostitutes to their career is unfounded. \"Third, the government doesn't have to fund the regulation. Oversight can be provided by private business, similar to how insurance companies provide a service in response to a government mandate\"But if its the private sector regulating prostitution then these agencies would prioritize making money more than keeping people safe, hell regular insurance companies use to deny people coverage all the time through excuses like pre-existing conditions and were more focused on making money then protecting people, so this could only make legalization more problematic since the systems regulating it would have other interests in mind over keeping people safe 4) Young Prostitutes (still in high school)\"Further, what authority does Con have to declare this profession as dishonorable\"Look, prostitution is kind of like being a fry cook for a fast food restaurant.... Anybody can do it, and in prostitution the only thing you need is a Vagina, there is a high demand for it yes but the labor market is already overwhelmed with people who could qualify. Also I did not mean to imply that Prostitution is dishonorable I meant to imply that it is more taboo than other professions. \"Con cannot self-righteously impose his subjective morals onto society.\"Im sorry if what I said came off that way, but I was trying to argue that legalizing Prostitution could make younger girls as young as 15 or 14 start selling their own bodies for sex and putting themselves in harms way because they do not know about the danger they are flirting with. The other point I was making is that it could sway young girls into becoming prostitutes instead of pursing other careers like doctors, nurses, teachers, and other careers that arent taboo in American culture. 5) Free lance prostitutesJust because people dont follow the rules in every profession doesnt mean we can just ignore it. The fact is when Prostitution is legal there are people who will choose to not go through the lengthy process of getting certified and tested and will go straight to prostitution just to make money or satisfy some desire they have. 6) Increase Promiscuity\" This takes sex workers away from their families, friends and children\"The penalty for being convicted of prostitution in just about any state is a fine never more than $1000 in most states or prison for up to 1.5 years, and prison time only kicks in after several offenses. The criminalization of prostitution rarely robs people and families of those convicted of prostitution, but criminalizing prostitution does severely punish pimps who could face multiple years in prison and several thousands of dollars in fines. http://prostitution.procon.org...This point was meant to argue that prostitutes face much higher acts of violence against them than in any other profession and that society can be considered a victim if prostitution is legalized are reasons to be against the legalization of prostitution. Pro responded by focusing on the burdens of keeping prostitution criminalized rather than address these points I brought up. I understand that there are reasons to decriminalize it but it cannot be denied that there are just as many reasons to not criminalize it.",

            "premise": "You say that it should be a woman's choice. And yes, it should be, but that's overwhelmingly not the case.In a study submitted at trial with 854 women in 9 countries, including Canada, 89% of women interviewed said they wanted out of prostitution.http://www.feminisms.org...And no, prostitution is not better than a McDonald's job.As adults in prostitution, 82% had been physically assaulted; 83% had been threatened with a weapon; 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes; and 84% reported current or past homelessness.Of the 130 people interviewed, 68% met DSM III-R criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. Eighty-eight percent of these respondents stated that they wanted to leave prostitution.http://www.arte-sana.com...Here's another tidbit from the first link:Women who gave affidavits of their experience in prostitution said that prostituting indoors is not safe. Some of the women said they preferred prostitution on the street because they had more control and they got to keep more of their earnings. Prostituting indoors means the brothel owner negotiates with johns. This person, whether they are called pimp, manager, or agency owner, has a vested economic interest in women pleasing johns, and is more likely to agree to johns\u2019 demands to have sex without condoms and to engage in sexual acts women themselves wouldn\u2019t agree to.One of the applicants, Amy Lebovtich, reported in her affidavit that when she was working in a brothel a john tied her up and raped her. No one intervened and she was left tied up for nearly half an hour until someone found her. Another woman who gave an affidavit had this to say: \u201cI have been raped and sodomized by johns while working in massage parlours, and was too scared and embarrassed to make any noise, and wouldn\u2019t have even known who to call. Sometimes I would hear other girls screaming or crying and I didn\u2019t know if it was part of an act or real. I never intervened\u2026Screams in the house were frequent and no one ever got involved.\u201d It isn\u2019t exactly good business to report a violent \u201ccustomer\u201d to the police, even in a legalized regime.Finally, there was ample evidence on the trial record that legal brothels in decriminalized countries serve as covers for child prostitution, trafficking in women and links to organized crime. In the Netherlands and Australia, the illegal sector comprises more than half of the prostitution industry. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women reported that in 2004 alone, 405 cases of trafficking in women were discovered in the Netherlands. The Dutch expert reported that there have been at least 50 documented murders of prostituted women in the Netherlands between 1992 and 2004 \u2013 several of these women were, \u201cmurdered in a brothel or \u2018window\u2019, and a few of them were murdered at home by their pimp.\u201d She summarized her findings by saying, \u201c\u2026the new prostitution legislation of 2000 has not meant that prostitutes are now more safe. The ability to work indoors, the decriminalization of organizing prostitution and the legalization of sex work have not removed the risk of being beaten, abused or coerced\u2026In short, the new legislation\u2019s goals of reducing the violence against women and the exploitation of women have not been met.\u201dHere is an image showing describing a harrowing impact.http://40.media.tumblr.com...;More information can be found here: http://casac.ca...From these facts, I don't believe total legalization is the solution to this awful unethical industry. I support the Nordic model--where people who pay prostitutes are criminalized whereas the prostituted people themselves are not. Just because something will generate plenty of tax revenue and \"still happen\" does not mean that people who engage in it are exempt from criminalization.",

            "premise": "I thank my adversary for a spirited response. I'll jump right into it.\"I am not in favor of activities that \"PROMOTE\" prostitution in any form but , to amend our laws...which ultimately will ease out the sexual frustration in the society leading to reduction in rapes and other incidents that I have talked about.\" This seems to be pure conjecture, Pro does not have any sources to show that legalizing prostitution will reduce rape, molestation, etc. This being the case, his argument is disproved by the study conducted by the CATW, that I cited in the previous round.\"Drug trafficking , Child labor , Regionalism , Casteism and other such practices - all these are wide spread and existing laws have failed in preventing them, still I none of us is an advocate of legalising them...this is something that has been ongoing since ages and never stopped , considering which makes me think that the only reason that it has survived so long is that it is somehow silently accepted by all societies and is a necessity\" This is a very strange argument. As my adversary points out, drug trafficking, child labour etc. also have a long history. What makes prostitution different? It is as \"unaccepted\" as the others are. To bolster my point, his claim that the existence of prostitution through the ages implies its acceptance is disproved by the social stigma associated with it. For ease, my source can be found here: http://www.ruhama.ie....\"First of all 200 women across 5 countries averages to 40 women per country.Number is quiet low to come to a conclusion.\"My adversary has no statistics or sources to disprove the findings of the previous source, and this statement should be ignored. Pro cannot tell statisticians how to come to conclusions. If he can find another source, I would be open to discussion on it.\"Second , presenting the argument that most of these women were never favoured by law even if it existed , is not convincing enough to not give better legal recognition to the practice...We often see poor and helpless being exploited and crushed under feet by the powerful, but does that mean we should not have laws to protect them.\"My argument literally is that legalizing prostitution will not protect them from exploitation. I don't see why that isn't convincing, given that it appears to be one of the primary aims of decriminalising prostitution.\"We have seen cases where determined people have shown their guts and fought against exploitation and come out victorious.\"This is either rhetoric or a personal example, neither of which are productive in a debate.\"So merely giving the stats from a XYZ survey and saying that sex workers should be deprived of their rights since anyway they are going to be suppressed and exploited even after laws are framed , is not justified.I believe that the contender is too much obsessed with surveys and figures.\"I am affronted that my adversary would coolly refer to my source (a study conducted by an international non-governmental organization) as an \"XYZ survey.\" He makes the ignoble remark that I am \"too much obsessed with surveys and figures\". My sources are methodical studies that support my contentions. Pro seems to labour under the delusion that conjecture and rhetoric is a fitting rebuttal to these.\"I believe that the legalisation will give rights to a prostitute to legal help in such cases and situations and prevent herself from harassment\"Prostitution is not illegal; organized prostitution is. A prostitute has the right to legal help even under current circumstances.Counter Argument 1: Legalization does not improve India's social attitude towards women, it worsens itMy adversary has side-stepped my argument without really addressing it. I maintain that legalization would worsen India's social attitude towards women in general.Pro provides a very poor justification to discredit my source, which uses case studies of prostitution in Australia and the Netherlands. It compares various situations of the sex industry before and after prostitution was legalized. Pro claims that the sex culture in these countries is advanced, and the \"Indian male is yet to fulfil his basic sexual desire leave aside all those stuff that your source talks about\". Given that Pro has pooh-poohed my sources for using a sample size of 200, and thereby not giving an accurate picture of India's 1.25 billion population, it is rather funny that he now claims to represent all of over 500 million Indian men. \"I would like to say that if that really is the case then why do we let Red Light Areas prevail\"I really cannot understand this. If crime exists, it is simply because of a lack of effective enforcement. Unless Pro can show otherwise, he cannot imply that it is a conscious decision that stems from acceptance of the crime.Counter Argument 2: \"I am not a speaker or supporter of brothels , Pimps and other such organisations neither Do I say these should be made legal.But do you think that any person would feel safe and fearless in a room when even with a prostitute who is not part of a group or network?I would disagree and most of us would.The whole point is to remove the fear from the participants\" minds of being caught and charged for God knows what all things.From the wiki article:\"My adversary has moved on from caring for women's rights to caring for the rights of their clients. My takeaway from his argument is that he wants the law abolished so that men may solicit women freely without fear \"of being caught and charged for God knows what all things\". This is a very weak argument that can be simplified to this: \"I want to steal a car, but I am so afraid of being caught. Let's make it legal to steal cars so that the fear is removed.\"My opponent has not provided justifications for his original points beyond conjecture and rhetoric and his rebuttals to my arguments are weak as well. I maintain that prostitution should not be legalized in India.Sources:1. http://www.lse.ac.uk...A note to my opponent: Wikipedia is not a very credible source to cite in a debate.",

However , prostitution itself is a very decadent way of earning money to be a profession , a job , we both agree that prostitution has become a job , so let's treat it as a job , the first idea we get about a person's life job is (study) , for a person studies hard to get a decent job where he is paid what he certainly deserves ex: doctor , engineer, pilot , carpenter , musician , painter, etc\u2026 , another person may work hard in a life profession that doesn't involve study, ex: cleaner , worker , or a person who works in a shop and sales things . In all of these types of life professions the person works hard , some work harder than others , and eventually earn more . Now if we come to prostitution , it's a job when a person's only work is to enjoy himself/herself and his/her partner or without involving any hard work or any life's gift , people are gifted with their jobs , they know how to get it right even the cleaner himself , so how can someone just come and use his/her body in a profession that no sane human mind can consider even close to be equal to these life professions where workers find respect ? and do you think legalization will maintain the workers safety or even respect , no because the woman (since most of prostitutes are women ) who agrees to sell her body to a man for money will never get respect of that man ( the client himself) and will always subject to rape and assault.( https://www.google.iq...) 2-Putting in mind that this job can always be dangerous to the worker and to the client : First \u2013 physical abuse , abuse from customers or even an early domestic abuse that leads to becoming a prostitute . (http://womensissues.about.com...) Second- most prostitutes are drug addicts (https://www.ncjrs.gov...) . Third- it actually increases trafficking (http://journalistsresource.org...) Forth \u2013 STDs , incidents in West Virginia\u2026 (http://www.privatemdlabs.com...) There really are other jobs that are way much better than this . 3-And the worst thing that it could start in early age , leading girls into a life of decadence and abuse instead of creating a good future . \"80 percent of the world population of prostitutes are female and range in age between 13-25\".(https://www.google.iq...) 4- reasons for becoming : First - \"there are women who see prostitution as their way out of poverty\" if this is the case then we should work on solving poverty so that people don't need to get into such dangerous business. Second- \"many were forced into prostitution against their will\" Then the government should track pimps who force women into this business for their own profit. Third-\"large numbers of prostitutes were sexually abused during their childhood.\" The society should really aspire to become better than this . Forth- True decadence \u2026 \"many prostitutes chose be their will to become prostitutes for the simple fact that they can get millions in a very short time even if they are accepted in universities \" (http://www.philosophyinaction.com...) And this is simply against pride and against the honorable method of working hard , beside .. what are they going to do when they can't perform sexual actions anymore? And there are other reasons that are almost similar to these major three reasons.( https://www.mentalhelp.net...) Also check https://www.google.iq... Final Note ( very important ) : Now If the world aspires to be better then it really shouldn't allow prostitution to be accepted as a life profession , and the only way to do that is by removing all reasons that may anyhow force people into prostitution , we must fight poverty and spread education , we must criminalize domestic abuse , we must destroy trafficking , and this is exactly what we are not doing , even criminalizing prostitution is not applied in the correct way , because the people who criminalize it are themselves criminals , they could even get involved in the same industry that they are apparently fighting , law must be forced upon all , a real constructive law that can get the world out of the s**t it's been drowning in for ages.",
