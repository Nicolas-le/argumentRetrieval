They do apply to the resolution, \"Performance-enhancing drugs should [not] be allowed in professional sports\". They show that using these drugs is unsafe. \"Your part two arguments apply to \"Should children be encouraged to look into athletes as role models?\" No, I'm saying that performance-enhancing drugs should not be allowed because they set a bad example for children. \"Your part three argument applies to \"Should sports leagues concerned with an image of 'hard work' or 'fairness' allow steroid users to play?\" No, I'm saying that performance-enhancing drugs cheat users out of hard work and practice that other players have to go through. \"The resolution at hand, however, is whether it should be ILLEGAL for professional athletes to use these drugs.\" Uh, no, it's whether \"Performance-enhancing drugs should be ALLOWED in professional sports.\" \"Allowed\" and \"legal\" are very different. \"Allowed\" means allowed within the sport's rules; \"legal\" means allowed within the law.

            "premise": "wait, sir. you're not consistent with your position. Disadvantages : - Performance enhancing Drugs could have an impact on the body if left or the sportsman quits sport. - Any sport is expected to be fair and based on your natural talent and training. - There are athletes that can\"t consume performance enhancing drugs. This makes their chance of winning, bleak. - A sport is usually considered as a passion. The essence of the sport is lost if performance enhancing drugs are legalizes - Be legalizing such performance enhancing drugs, athletes could be motivated and get addicted to other forms of drugs. - The athletes can take it for granted that these drugs will enhance their performance and thus, the hard work that could be put otherwise can be hampered. and it can kill the sportman who consume it. For example, some German athletes who took anabolic steroids in the 1970\"s and 1980\"s are having health problems now. A famous NFL player, Lyle Alzado, died at the age of 43 after having taking steroids for more than 2 decades. And the sciensist's research : \"Performance enhancers, like steroids and other forms of doping, have a negative effect on long-term health. For then users of these enhancers are hurting themselves in the long run without on the average improving their short-term rewards from athletic competition, as long as competitors also use harmful enhancers. This is the main rationale for trying to ban steroids and other forms of doping from athletic competitions.\" Gary Becker, PhD Professor in the Departments of Economics, Sociology, and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago \"Doping in Sports,\" Becker-Posner blog Aug. 27, 2006 THINK MORE !",

            "premise": "Performance Enhancements are Putting Athletes in Danger Athletes are cheating more and more now by taking performance enhancements for their professional sport. An athletes health could be at risk while taking performance enhancement drugs, we already have the great technology to support them, plus the athletes are playing their sport for the determination it takes, and the love of the game. Therefore, Performance Enhancement Drugs (PED) in professional sports should remain illegal for the players to keep them safe. Athletes already have great technology to help them with their performance while playing their sport. Athletes will use scientific diets, and oxygen tents as a healthier way of helping them improve. Sports have the technology to push the athletes bodies to extents. \"Athletes already use technology to push their bodies to the edge of human capability. Scientific diets, oxygen tents that stimulate high altitudes and supplements that fine-tune already genetically superior bodies are all simple-- and legal\"examples.\" (Duncan). None of those examples are illegal to use for the athlete to help improve their performance. On the other hand, when using PEDs for the extra technology it will help them become better, faster, stronger, then it will make the sport more interesting for both the players and the crowd. \"Scientists and engineers have recently developed devices that bump up cognitive performance by dousing the brain in low levels of electricity and using magnetic fields to stimulate the brains nerve cells.\" (Duncan). This is saying that now because of the help of scientists and engineers athletes can use certain devices to encourage the brain to keep going. Instead of risking their health, they have other ways to improve their performance. PEDs could cause multiple health problems that could be very dangerous. The website of the World Anti-Doping Agency gives warnings on what steroids could do to the athletes ad their body. \"The website of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for example, warns that steroids increase the odds of mood shifts, reduced sperm counts, damage to the heart, and masculinization in women.\" (Duncan). There are many different problems that could occur while taking PEDs, they only list a small amount of possible health risks. If a player were to have one of these problems, then they could be taken out of the sport because of the damage to the body. Yet, athletes could want to use these in order to get stronger to help prevent any injury that could happen while playing. Some athletes are willing to take the chance to help with making the sport safer for the player. The purpose of having the sport is for competition. When an athlete uses PEDs, that purpose is no longer there and with competition the love of the game remains. \"Any thoughtful person who plays a sport understands the connection among talent, dedication, and excellence. Every sport sets limits.\" (Murray). While the athlete is playing the sport each time he/she plays the love of the game should grow. The determination and competition will still be there, but when taking PEDs the athlete forgets about why they are playing in the first place. But, when the athlete uses PEDs it does make them become stronger and better at their sport making it a little bit easier on them, the athlete will then be able to play longer and practice longer because of their strength. To have athletes remain safe, PEDs should remain illegal. Athletes have amazing technology to help them improve in their sport, and there are many different health problems that can occur. Lastly, athletes are playing for the love and competition of the game. Hard work and determination will get the athlete farther than risking the athletes career with taking PEDs.",

            "premise": "In todays world the temptation to use performance-enhancing drugs is too great for too many athletes. Performance-enhancing drugs are self explanatory, it is a drug to enhance physical performance. Usually associated with professional athletes striving for perfection. There are many risks that come with taking performance-enhancements there are many types of PEDs, all of which are illegal. The United States Anti-Doping agency should keep performance-enhancing drugs illegal to keep professional athletes safe. Breaking the law is not worth the risk. when a professional athlete uses performance-enhancing drugs, they have got a lot to lose. The wrong choice almost brought an end to many athletes careers. One tragic example is Lance Armstrong, stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. Jim Thorpe was denied two gold medals in the olympics, The list is endless. Athletes do not only lose their awards but it destroys their reputation that they have built. Life for professional sports organizations focused on managing the anti-doping policies would be easier. That might be true, but the people who manage the organization would no longer have a job there. Legalizing PEDs would not only negatively affect the athletes, but the people around them. There is an overwhelming amount of negative side effects that can occur from using performance-enhancing drugs. \"Simply put PEDs have the ability or potential to drastically alter the human body, and biological functions, including the ability to considerably improve athletic performance\" These drugs, however, can be extremely dangerous and in certain situations, deadly\" (USADA). Other negative side effects include muscle weakness, hallucinations, liver abnormalities and tumors, etc. Yet, with all those factors in play, many still choose to go down that dangerous road. Professional athletes are already risking a lot when playing the sport, so why does it matter if they use performance enhancements? If athletes are already taking so many risks, then they should absolutely try to keep themselves as safe as possible. The danger of using PEDs outweigh the gains in muscle mass or strength. When an athlete uses PEDs, it defeats the purpose of the competition altogether. \"Success in sports takes talent...using steroids is a form of cheating and interferes with fair competition\"(littleleague). There are other ways to improve performance; train safely, eat healthy, and get plenty of rest. To be a truly great athlete you have to work hard. There is no shortcut to success. \"Steroids and doping will help pitchers to throw harder, home runs go further, cyclists to charge longer and sprinters to test the very limits of human speed(Smith).In the moment that might be exhilarating, but it can cause a whole lot of problems later in life. using performance-enhancing drugs is not worth the risk at all. To keep athletes safe, performance-enhancing drugs should stay illegal.The bottom line is professional athletes have too much to lose, the risk is too great, and it is cheating the game.\"Life is full of grays, but sports are black and white. There is always a clear winner in the end and everyone expects that the winner achieved the success in a fair and ethical way\"(little league).It is important to understand the facts about Performance-enhancing drugs.

            "premise": "Hello, and thanks for opening this discussion. I will be countering these specific claims made by my opponent: 1. Use of PED's destroys the spirit of competition and love of the game. 2. Hard work and determination are all that is needed to make athletes \"elite.\" 3. PED's are too dangerous to be used. I wish to make it clear that I do not advocate the unrestricted use of all PED's. I will instead make the case that PED's are not significantly different than other performance enhancing measures, and that the controlled allowance of PED's will make sports both safer and more competitive. 1. Use of PED's destroys the spirit of competition and love of the game - Quite the contrary, PED's increase the spirit of competition. Nature has it's own performance enhancing drug called \"genetics.\" Genes are attained by pure luck, and it is undeniable that some genes bestow natural advantages for some sports. For example, superior eyesight is proven to be a natural advantage in baseball. Slender legs are proven advantages in distance running. Long torsos are a natural advantage in swimming. The list goes on and on [1]. If no performance enhancement was ever allowed, elite sports would only be accessible to a few genetically lucky people. As a result, performance enhancement allows more people to pursue their love for the game who may not have naturally bestowed advantages. For example, the pro baseball player Tommy John was bestowed by nature with an inferior tendon in his arm. In 1974, he underwent surgery to replace his tendon and went on to win, on average, 20 more games per season than he did before he surgery [2]. Since eyesight is so advantageous in baseball, many baseball players routinely get laser eye surgery to artificially enhance their sight [3]. This could definitely be considered artificial performance enhancement, which may be considered unfair. Yet without access to such measures athletes would be subject to a different kind of unfairness - the genetic lottery. In many ways, performance enhancement allows the genetic playing field to be more level. Sports would actually be LESS competitive if the genes bestowed by nature were the only PED's allowed, because less people would be able to compete. If certain PED's were available to everyone, then people with less advantageous natural traits could overcome them and there would be more competitors. 2. Hard work and determination are all that is needed to make athletes \"elite.\" - This ties into the last point. Hard work can definitely make you better, and it is important. But when genetics come into play, no amount of hard work can overcome natural gifts. Consider the example of Stefan Holm, a world-class Scandinavian high jumper. Stefan was the epitome of an all-natural athlete forged through hard work. He began practicing high-jump in his back yard at the age of 6. As he got older, he followed a very strict diet and weight lifting routine to strengthen his legs. He was obsessed as a teenager and practiced for hours each day, taking thousands and thousands of practice jumps. After years of practice, he won gold in the 2004 Olympics. Two years later, a college student named Donald Thomas was dared by a friend to take a high jump at a track practice. In the first jump of his life, with no training, he cleared 6'6\". Two days later, in flat high-top shoes and basketball shorts, he cleared 7' and broke the university record. 8 months later, with only mild amounts of practice, he went against Holm at the world championships and defeated the man who had been training obsessively all his life. Donald Thomas was born with an abnormally long Achilles Tendon which allowed him to jump extraordinarily high with little effort [4]. Clearly, hard work and determination was not enough to give Holm an edge over such a genetically lucky individual. Once again, with equal access to PEDs, all athletes would truly be able to reap the rewards of hard work while avoiding the futility of genetic disadvantage. 3. PEDs are too dangerous - no doubt some are, and they should be banned. But some are not. They are no more dangerous than other performance enhancing measures such as eye surgery, tendon replacement, or self-imposed anorexia (wrestlers). What is more dangerous is the current system, where PEDs are illegal but still widely used. In the current system, those who play by the rules are indirectly punished and outmatched by those who do not and avoid getting caught. This creates a \"cat and mouse\" game atmosphere where athletes do not stop using PEDs, they merely devise new ways to avoid detection. It also blurs the line between what is truly a PED and what is not. Athletes are people who naturally want to push limits, and it creates a more dangerous climate where they try to experiment with PEDs that are potent enough to be questionable yet barely legal enough to be legit. Banning all PEDs is hardly the best solution to the problem of sportsmanship and fairness. [1] All examples taken from David Epstein's book \"The Sports Gene.\" [2] http://gladwell.com... [3] Ibid.

However, there are some harmful side effects to using them. They include: - higher blood pressure - higher cholesterol levels - higher risk of heart disease - liver damage - premature growth - testicular cancer - abnormally large amounts of acne - breast development in men This, obviously, is not good for the steroid user. Furthermore, exercising normally can avoid these problems, and regular exercise is better for physical and mental health. 2) Negative impact on children When children start to get into sports, they normally treat their favorite player as an idol, an image of what they want to be when they grow up. How would they feel if their idol essentially cheated by using drugs so they didn't have to work as hard? Furthermore, what if they decided to use steroids too, because their hero did? 3) Unfair advantage Most professional athletes work hard every day to stay in shape and sharp at their sport. Why should some players get to skip this hard work that everyone else is doing? That's all for now.",

            "premise": "I affirm that PEDs should be permitted in sports. Legalizing PEDs would serve to level the playing field. According to the New York Times, more than a third of the top Tour de France finishers since 1998 have been confirmed to be doping while racing, despite efforts to stop them (1). So, the statistics clearly indicate that those who obey the rules and do not dope have a relatively low chance of performing well. If those who did not not use Performance Enhancing Drugs in the Tour de France were instead allowed to dope, those racers would have had the same advantages as those who currently dope illegally, and the playing field would have been more even. One of the primary reasons people enjoy watching professional sports is because they showcase the highest level of human achievement. Allowing PEDs to be used would raise the level of competition and skill in professional sports. This would thus make achievements in sports seem even more unthinkable and impressive, which would thus make more people attend these sporting events. As described in Forbes, \"A huge part of watching sports is witnessing the very peak of human athletic ability, and legalizing performance enhancing drugs would help athletes climb even higher (2).\" This shows that Performance Enhancing Drugs can raise the level of sports, which can make sports even more of a spectacle. For example, during the 1990's, when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa used steroids, their respective games were usually sold out with people who wanted to see their heightened abilities (2). I will now refute my opponent's arguments. My opponent argues that PEDs provide with a large risk for athletes. However, Athletes who are using PEDs are already in a dangerous industry, and frequently become injured regardless of whether or not they use drugs. In the year 2013 alone, the NFL reported at least 152 concussions, and was forced to spend up to 765 million dollars to settle claims of traumatic head injury brought by former players (3). So, PEDs do not provide with a large injury risk compared to the inherent risk of professional sports. My opponent also argues that allowing PEDs takes away from true human achievement. However, being an athlete requires a high amount of skill regardless of whether or not you use PEDs. Hitting a home run, for example requires excellent timing and a perfect swing. Using PEDs may increase the distance of this home run, but hitting a it is still a spectacle of your own human, not chemical precision. So, performing in sports requires intricate skill, no matter what. It is thus clear that PEDs do not take away from human achievement. As such, I affirm. 1- http://www.nytimes.com... 2- http://www.forbes.com... 3- http://www.pbs.org...",

            "premise": "I contend that professional sports leagues should legalize steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. I understand that this position may initially be considered blasphemy, but there are multiple reasons that leagues should legalize performance-enhancing drugs. First of all, throughout history, humans have been trying to stretch the limits of what is possible. This includes through the use of any available technology. The fact that humans cannot physically fly did not stop the Wright Brothers from building the first airplane. Yes, legalized use of steroids would create frequent changes in the record books, but those are all part of human achievement. Furthermore, comparisons between eras are already moot, considering the differences between the rules of today and those of 50 or 100 years ago. Also, it benefits the sports economically to allow performance-enhancing drugs. In 1999, when Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire both broke Roger Maris's single-season home run record, interest in baseball soared. Many casual fans found their accomplishments fascinating, as those men were going to a place no human had been before. A comparable analogy would be when the oldest person ever, Jeanne Calment of France, died at the age of 122 years. She would never have been able to live that long with primitive technology, but people were fascinated by her shattering the record (no other human has even lived to 120). Why should a different standard be applied to sports? Baseball was always the sport most impacted by performance-enhancing drugs. Thus, it saw the biggest excitement around new records. Today, players normally are caught and suspended when they take other performance-enhancing drugs. Thus, there is less opportunity to have the excitement of breaking records. Consequently, baseball's ratings have slipped in a time where football and basketball are basking in rising ratings relative to the average TV show. Thus, steroids should be legal in sports.",

            "conclusion": "Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) should be permitted in professional sports.",
            "premise": "As am I, thank you for accepting Pro! PEDs should not be permitted for use in professional sports (or sports at any level) for a number of reasons. First and foremost, PEDs present an enormous health risk for athletes that use them. They lead to many severe health problems, including but not limited to heart and circulatory problems, psychiatric disorders and inhibited growth and development (http://www.mayoclinic.org... and http://www.livestrong.com...). The law, in the broader view of things, aims to generally protect people from making poor decisions. If all people are treated as equals under the law, it is the duty of the law to aim to protect athletes just as it aims to protect drug users. It is therefore the responsibility of the law to warn athletes away from taking performance enhancing drugs. In the broader scope of sport, it can be appreciated that teenage athletes who train among adult ones or share the same coaches would also turn to PEDs used by the people around them (were PEDs legalized and accessible), which would not only pose even more serious health concerns but also set trends about drug culture in general, spreading the reach of recreational drug use even further. Sports are enjoyed by people because they are a visual demonstration of what human beings can achieve, individually or collectively. They are designed to amaze and put on a show, and we watch them to celebrate this human achievement. If athletes took PEDs, we would be celebrating chemical achievement, instead. Thus, PEDs could be appreciated to undermine the central philosophy of sport. Finally, a counterargument could be that not all athletes would need to take PEDs and some may choose not to without consequence- however, this is not true. Even if some athletes uphold moral or health standards to not take PEDs, they have their freedom of choice infringed upon: if they want to be successful, they will also have to take drugs. Allowing any athletes to take PEDs means no longer protecting any athletes, even ones that don't want to use dangerous drugs, from these things. This is exemplified in the American Scientific Magazine: \"Game theory highlights why it is rational for professional cyclists to dope: the drugs are extremely effective as well as difficult or impossible to detect; the payoffs for success are high; and as more riders use them, a \"clean\" rider may become so noncompetitive that he or she risks being cut from the team\" (http://www.scientificamerican.com...). Two more websites consulted: http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org... http://www.usada.org... Your move! :)",

            "premise": "\"Doing unsafe things is allowable. People have the right to do unsafe things with their own bodies.\" Did you not see what \"allowed\" refers to? Rights or not, steroids are not allowed in professional sports. \"Athletes are not slaves, existing for the sake of their examples to children. They exist for their own sake and are to be treated as such, as human beings, so long as they treat others as such. This means they are not to be forced to a course of action just because it will benefit someone else, only them initiating force can justify such force.\" I didn't say that. Obviously, an athlete should be expected to be a role model for children, since many kids will look up to him/her. This does not dictate the way they live; it simply means they should not do stupid things, cheat, etc. because that will negatively influence kids. This is why, for example, Michael Phelps got a lot of crap for doing drugs. \"\"Have to?\" No one \"has to\" do such a thing. They are perfectly able to take the drugs themselves, or work hard, or not condition themselves, as they please.\" Do you see any unconditioned professional athletes? They all have to do some sort of tough conditioning to stay sharp at their sport. And most people consider steroids cheating, or do not use them because of the aforementioned side effects. Professional athletes who do not use steroids HAVE TO work hard to stay in shape and up to expectations. \"And the use of drugs by one party does not delete the hard work by another, they are separate bodies, separate phenomena.\" EXACTLY - one party still has to go through hard work, while the other can just take drugs. \"This would be a permissible arguments if your round 1 argument did not already concede you were talking about what THE LAW should allow. As it stands it is not, it is merely a tool of deception, and I quote . . . That was at the beginning of your first round argument. That leaves no room for weaseling out of it, the resolution was explicitly clarified by you as meaning allowable by the law, not allowable by the sports league.\" Well, first, if something is illegal for use in sports, then it is not allowed for use in sports. So I can relate these arguments to the resolution even if you were right. Second, you just contradicted yourself. First you state that I conceded that I was talking about what the law should allow. But then, you say I \"explicitly clarified [it] as being allowable by the law, not allowable by the sports league\". But really, I was laying the latter all along. The very first sentence says \"illegal for use in sports\". That means that their use is punishable by law if used in sports. Now before you start saying that we should not jail people for steroid use, that's not what \"punishable by law\" means. Loitering is punishable by law; do you get thrown in jail for it? What about littering or violating curfew laws? =============================================================================== My opponent has spent all of his arguments attempting to not relate my arguments to the resolution. However, I have showed how he has misinterpreted all of my arguments. Furthermore, he has not attempted to argue with my position, and is giving contradictory and misleading \"reasons\" on why I have \"not\" supported the resolution. You have no clear reason to vote in his favor, so vote CON.",

            "premise": "\" Did you not see what \"allowed\" refers to? Rights or not, steroids are not allowed in professional sports. \" Again, you are ignoring your own statement at the beginning of the debate. You conceded the point about which meaning of \"allowed\" is to be used. \" I didn't say that. Obviously, an athlete should be expected to be a role model for children, since many kids will look up to him/her. This does not dictate the way they live; it simply means they should not do stupid things, cheat, etc. because that will negatively influence kids. \" You're contradicting yourself. The ability to do \"stupid things\" is part of the ability to choose how to live. Either you dictate how they live or you don't, there is no middle ground here. Respect their rights, or treat them as slaves. That's it. If you dictate that a person acts as a role model, this means you are dictating that they live as one. \" Do you see any unconditioned professional athletes? \" Yes, actually, in baseball for example, at some of the positions that are specialized, it is possible to just have a good technique down for pitching and hitting and not actually do much in the way of conditioning. Not optimal but some people do it with success. And you are ignoring the fact that being a professional athlete is a choice. They are free to be one or not to be one. So no, they don't HAVE TO do anything, even those whose sports do require conditioning, are not forced to choose that sport. \" EXACTLY - one party still has to go through hard work, while the other can just take drugs. \" Again that \"Has to,\" which is false, and the false assumption that the first party can't use the drugs. And if you'll notice, exhbit A, the most successful steroid users also work the hardest (See Barry Bonds' extensive workouts.) The steroids simply allow the workout sessions to last longer and be more productive. \" Well, first, if something is illegal for use in sports, then it is not allowed for use in sports. So I can relate these arguments to the resolution even if you were right. Second, you just contradicted yourself. First you state that I conceded that I was talking about what the law should allow. But then, you say I \"explicitly clarified [it] as being allowable by the law, not allowable by the sports league\". But really, I was laying the latter all along. The very first sentence says \"illegal for use in sports\". That means that their use is punishable by law if used in sports.\" You are twisting logic here, and it is you who contradict yourself. You state that i contradict myself by declaring you were talking about the law, and then declaring you were talking about the law? That is the opposite of a contradiction! Meanwhile you contradict yourself by stating you are talking about the sports league's rules, and then stating \"PUNISHABLE BY LAW.\" \"LAW\" is not what a sports league makes. It is what congress makes. A sports league has every right to forbid participation based on such grounds as steroid use... but such a rule is not a \"law,\" does not make participation \"illegal.\" Only that which is forbidden by a government body, Congress, is \"illegal.\" Unless you were trying to say I stated you were arguing it \"Should be allowable by the law, not the sports league,\" which means you misinterpreted my statement. I stated the debate, you clarified, was about \"What is allowable\" by the law, rather than \"what is allowable\" the sports league, which means you are dropping the context and thus altering the meaning of my statement. Either way I have not contradicted myself, either you misunderstand the term contradiction or you are dropping the context of a statement (Your summary of my supposedly contradictory arguments was so ambigous I have a hard time telling which.) \" Now before you start saying that we should not jail people for steroid use, that's not what \"punishable by law\" means. Loitering is punishable by law; do you get thrown in jail for it? What about littering or violating curfew laws? \" You are given fines, which if not paid result in jail. The end that lies down the road is the same, there are simply more steps. The point is that the penalty is government administered, and active, as opposed to the passive penalty of being refused employment if the prohibition were private. Jail and government-mandated fines are morally equivalent. Where one is morally unjustified, so is the other. \" My opponent has spent all of his arguments attempting to not relate my arguments to the resolution. However, I have showed how he has misinterpreted all of my arguments.\" And I have shown how you have misinterpreted mine, and thereby not shown how I have misinterpreted yours. \"urthermore, he has not attempted to argue with my position,\" Your explicit position, explicated in Round 1, is that it should be, again, ILLEGAL for athletes to use steroids. Not, grounds for a private entity to not hire, but, ILLEGAL. If you think I haven't been arguing with that position, you haven't paid the slightest bit of attention. \"nd is giving contradictory and misleading \"reasons\" on why I have \"not\" supported the resolution. \" I already demonstrated I have not contradicted myself. I hope you can do the same. It isn't my fault what you chose to open the debate with, had you not, the meaning of \"allowed\" would still be open to discussion, but your inclusion of the term \"illegal\" made certain it is not, and you have not responded to my arguments against it being illegal (or, since i am Pro, in favor of it being legal, though there is no difference between the two terms).",

            "premise": "I will use this speech to further strengthen my constructive, and refute my opponents refutations. My opponent argues that it does not make sense to legal PEDs with the intention of leveling the playing field. However, I have provided evidence that says that a majority of athletes in some sports use PEDs. Because of this, it is incredibly difficult to eradicate PEDs. This has been seen recently in sports such as baseball. Despite continuous effort by Major League Baseball to take PEDs away from the game, PED use is still widely present. This shows that it would simply be less cumbersome to allow everyone to use PEDs than to attempt to remove them entirely. My opponent also observes that PEDs increase chemical achievement instead of human achievement. However, I have shown that professional athletes still are incredibly skilled, regardless of whether or not they use PEDs. Furthermore, I have shown that people do in fact celebrate \"chemical\" achievement. An example of this would be the MLB Home Run races in the 1990's, when a majority of the contenders used PEDs. During this point in MLB history, there were more fans and spectators than ever before, which shows celebration of what my opponent dubs \"chemical achievement.\" So, it is clear that PEDs do not eliminate human achievement, and any chemical achievement that they provide is still celebrated. My opponent refutes my argument regarding the inherent dangers of sports by comparing it to teachers and welders who use cocaine. This argument cannot be weighed in this debate for two reasons. First, Professional Athletes are paid much more than welders or teachers. Second, PEDs are much less dangerous than using cocaine. Professional Athletes are being paid much more than teachers or welders, and they are also submitting themselves to the inherent danger of their sports. And I would observe that this argument was mainly put into my constructive speech to show that the dangers of PEDs do not come close to outweighing the inherent dangers of sports. Because of this, the contention regarding the dangers of PEDs cannot be weighed highly. My opponent finally argues that chemical achievement will never be celebrated, as all that people celebrate is human achievement. I do accept that people embrace human achievement in sports, as I even said that in my constructive speech. However, I have also shown that chemical achievement can be celebrated, which increases the appeal to watch professional sports. So, it is clear that PEDs do in fact level the playing field, make sports more appealing, and should in fact be legalized in professional sports. So, I affirm the resolution that Performance Enhancing Drugs should be permitted in professional sports, and I urge a pro ballot.",

They decide to participate in sports with the informed decision that they might get hurt as it is part of the sport. Performance enhancing drugs are no different. In the USA every year there are nearly 300,000 sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Athletes involved in sports such as football, hockey and boxing are at significant risk of TBI due to the high level of contact inherent in these sports. Head injuries are also extremely common in sports such as cycling, baseball, basketball and skateboarding. Many head injuries acquired, playing these sports, lead to permanent brain damage or worse. Yet we do not impose a law to ban athletes from participating in those sports. We trust their assessment of risk (1). \u00a0 All about Traumatic Brain Injuries:\u00a0http://www.allabouttbi.com/sports-related-traumatic-brain-injury/, accessed 05/15/2011 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

            "premise": "To refute my opponent's arguments and his responses to my own, one by one: 1. \"Legalizing PEDs would serve to level the playing field. According to the New York Times, more than a third of the top Tour de France finishers since 1998 have been confirmed to be doping while racing\" Response: Not only should they not be legalized, there should be more enforcement to keep them out of sports. It's not a strong argument to say \"some people are doing it anyway, we might as well make it legal so everyone can\". Some people do cocaine! Furthermore, rich athletes from wealthier countries will have access to the latest, highest-quality PEDs while poorer athletes from poorer countries which don't have the same medical or scientific advances will not be able to keep up. As long as PEDs are available (or even legal), the playing field won't ever be level. PEDs are one of the largest factors that make the playing field not be level, because they give a foothold to wealth and country of origin as deciders of athletic performance. 2. \"One of the primary reasons people enjoy watching professional sports is because they showcase the highest level of human achievement. Allowing PEDs to be used would raise the level of competition and skill in professional sports.\" Response: Allowing PEDs would raise the level of competition in an extremely uneven manner, and we would showcase chemical achievement instead of human achievement (as outlined in my first argument). 3. \"My opponent argues that PEDs provide with a large risk for athletes. However, Athletes who are using PEDs are already in a dangerous industry, and frequently become injured regardless of whether or not they use drugs.\" Response: I would call it an invalid argument to say that, because what they do is dangerous already, it doesn't matter that PEDs could make their lives more dangerous. All people are under the law and the law should protect all people. Welders have a more dangerous career than teachers, but it isn't any less against the law for them to use cocaine. 4. \"My opponent also argues that allowing PEDs takes away from true human achievement. However, being an athlete requires a high amount of skill regardless of whether or not you use PEDs. [...] Using PEDs may increase the distance of this home run, but hitting a it is still a spectacle of your own human, not chemical precision.\" Response: I agree that there is a side of sports not affected by PEDs, but I think that this argues my side of the debate more than it does yours- we will celebrate the same skills, changed or unchanged by PEDs, as human achievement. The use of PEDs therefore does not increase this human achievement and should not be celebrated, it only adds chemical achievement to what is already amazing. This is not something we want to celebrate, as it is outside of the central philosophy of sport, and it is certainly not worth the health risks or other disparities (as outlined above) the PEDs would bring to sport at any level.",

When new drugs and therapies are found, athletes turn to them and as a result are much of the time ahead of the anti-doping organizations, which need to develop methods of athlete testing whenever a new drug that is meant to be untraceable is created. In 2008 it was a big shock when Riccardo Ricco (a cyclist) was caught using the performance-enhancing drug Mircera, which had been considered undetectable for a number of years. The fact is that a ban of performance enhancing drugs enables mainly athletes from wealthy countries and teams that can afford the newest technology to go undetected, whilst others are disadvantaged (1). So because it gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy one who can pay for the undetectable drugs, we should legalize it. \u00a0 Millard Baker, Riccardo Ricco Tests Positive for Undetectable New Drug Mircera at 2008 Tour de France, 07/18/2008,\u00a0http://steroidreport.com/2008/07/18/riccardo-ricco-and-mircera-pegylated-epo/, accessed 05/20/2011",

As I do not know if you are specifically referring to one particular sport. I will proffer a brief reflection on the use and issues surrounding the use of performance enhancing drugs, in sport generally. A quick analysis indicates that worldwide, there is now a total ban on the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport. Also testing for steroid abuse, especially at a professional level is now very vigorous. I would therefore suggest that it is unlikely that, any one inducted into a professional sporting Hall of Fame today, is unlikely to have slipped through the drugs testing net. It is fair to assume that a sportsman/woman inducted into a professional sporting Hall of Fame in the past, especially in the latter half of the 20th century was using performance enhancing drugs. Though we must pay regard to the fact, that the use of steroids to enhance sports performance, was not always considered inappropriate or illegal. Would it therefore be just, to retrospectively impose bans on our veteran sporting heroes and as a consequence, strip them of their Hall of Fame status? Con. Would suggest that we let bygones be bygones. Move forward and put our trust and faith in the ability of our sports governing bodies, to thoroughly and rigorously police our modern professional sports organisations.",

Your \"Part one arguments,\" to the extent they raise true symptoms (which is not clear, because data on the symptoms of the usage of steroids at recommended dosages in healthy people is in a shortage and rather conflicting, which is perhaps why you have cited no scientific data), apply to the resolution \"Should you use steroids?\" Or \"Is hiring a steroid-using baseball player a good investment?\" Your part two arguments apply to \"Should children be encouraged to look into athletes as role models?\" (and I note they also have a flaw, how would the child feel about his uber-clean athlete role model if he found out the athlete was only being uber-clean because he was forced to? Kind of disillusioning no?) Your part three argument applies to \"Should sports leagues concerned with an image of 'hard work' or 'fairness' allow steroid users to play?\" The resolution at hand, however, is whether it should be ILLEGAL for professional athletes to use these drugs. That is, whether Johnny McSuperStrong's use of steroids is a justification to send a man with a gun to his door and stick him in a cage, shooting him if he doesn't cooperate. This raises questions of \"What are proper social limits (rights)?\" Since human beings require the application of their own mind to their own actions to live, and need to produce goods with those actions, and this is a universal need, it holds that each human who wishes to live should find it proper that others not interfere with this (the rights of liberty and property). In order to pursue this, it is of course necessary that they themselves not interfere first, for interfering with one who does not interfere removes the incentive for that other to not interfere. Thus the question in whether to violate someone's liberty or property is \"Have they violated yours?\" I await your proof that the injection of steroids into one's own body, or between consenting parties, somehow violates anyone's liberty or property.",

            "premise": "My last round arguments was seen mostly jokes, But however in this round I will get more serious. DRUGS IN SPORT The use of performance enhancing drugs in the modern Olympics is on record as early as the games of the third Olympiad, When Thomas Hicks won the marathon after receiving an injection of strychnine in the middle of the race. 1 The first official ban on \"stimulating substances\" by a sporting organisation was introduced by the International Amateur Athletic Federation in 1928. 2 Using drugs to cheat in sport is not new, But it is becoming more effective. In 1976, The East German swimming team won 11 out of 13 Olympic events, And later sued the government for giving them anabolic steroids. 3 Yet despite the health risks, And despite the regulating bodies\" attempts to eliminate drugs from sport, The use of illegal substances is widely known to be rife. It hardly raises an eyebrow now when some famous athlete fails a dope test. In 1992, Vicky Rabinowicz interviewed small groups of athletes. She found that Olympic athletes, In general, Believed that most successful athletes were using banned substances. 4 Much of the writing on the use of drugs in sport is focused on this kind of anecdotal evidence. There is very little rigorous, Objective evidence because the athletes are doing something that is taboo, Illegal, And sometimes highly dangerous. The anecdotal picture tells us that our attempts to eliminate drugs from sport have failed. In the absence of good evidence, We need an analytical argument to determine what we should do. CONDEMNED TO CHEATING? We are far from the days of amateur sporting competition. Elite athletes can earn tens of millions of dollars every year in prize money alone, And millions more in sponsorships and endorsements. The lure of success is great. But the penalties for cheating are small. A six month or one year ban from competition is a small penalty to pay for further years of multimillion dollar success. Drugs are much more effective today than they were in the days of strychnine and sheep\"s testicles. Studies involving the anabolic steroid androgen showed that, Even in doses much lower than those used by athletes, Muscular strength could be improved by 5\"20%. 5 Most athletes are also relatively unlikely to ever undergo testing. The International Amateur Athletic Federation estimates that only 10\"15% of participating athletes are tested in each major competition. 6 The enormous rewards for the winner, The effectiveness of the drugs, And the low rate of testing all combine to create a cheating \"game\" that is irresistible to athletes. Kjetil Haugen7 investigated the suggestion that athletes face a kind of prisoner\"s dilemma regarding drugs. His game theoretic model shows that, Unless the likelihood of athletes being caught doping was raised to unrealistically high levels, Or the payoffs for winning were reduced to unrealistically low levels, Athletes could all be predicted to cheat. The current situation for athletes ensures that this is likely, Even though they are worse off as a whole if everyone takes drugs, Than if nobody takes drugs. Drugs such as erythropoietin (EPO) and growth hormone are natural chemicals in the body. As technology advances, Drugs have become harder to detect because they mimic natural processes. In a few years, There will be many undetectable drugs. Haugen\"s analysis predicts the obvious: that when the risk of being caught is zero, Athletes will all choose to cheat. The recent Olympic games in Athens were the first to follow the introduction of a global anti-doping code. From the lead up to the games to the end of competition, 3000 drug tests were carried out: 2600 urine tests and 400 blood tests for the endurance enhancing drug EPO. 8 From these, 23 athletes were found to have taken a banned substance\"the most ever in an Olympic games. 9 Ten of the men\"s weightlifting competitors were excluded. The goal of \"cleaning\" up the sport is unattainable. Further down the track the spectre of genetic enhancement looms dark and large. UNFAIR? People do well at sport as a result of the genetic lottery that happened to deal them a winning hand. Genetic tests are available to identify those with the greatest potential. If you have one version of the ACE gene, You will be better at long distance events. If you have another, You will be better at short distance events. Black Africans do better at short distance events because of biologically superior muscle type and bone structure. Sport discriminates against the genetically unfit. Sport is the province of the genetic elite (or freak). The starkest example is the Finnish skier Eero Maentyranta. In 1964, He won three gold medals. Subsequently it was found he had a genetic mutation that meant that he \"naturally\" had 40\"50% more red blood cells than average. 15 Was it fair that he had significant advantage given to him by chance? The ability to perform well in sporting events is determined by the ability to deliver oxygen to muscles. Oxygen is carried by red blood cells. The more red blood cells, The more oxygen you can carry. This in turn controls an athlete\"s performance in aerobic exercise. EPO is a natural hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, Raising the packed cell volume (PCV)\"the percentage of the blood comprised of red blood cells. EPO is produced in response to anaemia, Haemorrhage, Pregnancy, Or living at altitude. Athletes began injecting recombinant human EPO in the 1970s, And it was officially banned in 1985. 16 At sea level, The average person has a PCV of 0. 4\"0. 5. It naturally varies; 5% of people have a packed cell volume above 0. 5, 17 and that of elite athletes is more likely to exceed 0. 5, Either because their high packed cell volume has led them to success in sport or because of their training. 18 Raising the PCV too high can cause health problems. The risk of harm rapidly rises as PCV gets above 50%. One study showed that in men whose PCV was 0. 51 or more, Risk of stroke was significantly raised (relative risk R02;=R02; 2. 5), After adjustment for other causes of stroke. 19 At these levels, Raised PCV combined with hypertension would cause a ninefold increase in stroke risk. In endurance sports, Dehydration causes an athlete\"s blood to thicken, Further raising blood viscosity and pressure. 20 What begins as a relatively low risk of stroke or heart attack can rise acutely during exercise. In the early 1990s, After EPO doping gained popularity but before tests for its presence were available, Several Dutch cyclists died in their sleep due to inexplicable cardiac arrest. This has been attributed to high levels of EPO doping. 21 The risks from raising an athlete\"s PCV too high are real and serious. Use of EPO is endemic in cycling and many other sports. In 1998, The Festina team was expelled from the Tour de France after trainer Willy Voet was caught with 400 vials of performance enhancing drugs. 22 The following year, The World Anti-Doping Agency was established as a result of the scandal. However, EPO is extremely hard to detect and its use has continued. Italy\"s Olympic anti-doping director observed in 2003 that the amount of EPO sold in Italy outweighed the amount needed for sick people by a factor of six. 23 In addition to trying to detect EPO directly, The International Cycling Union requires athletes to have a PCV no higher than 0. 5. But 5% of people naturally have a PCV higher than 0. 5. Athletes with a naturally high PCV cannot race unless doctors do a number of tests to show that their PCV is natural. Charles Wegelius was a British rider who was banned and then cleared in 2003. He had had his spleen removed in 1998 after an accident, And as the spleen removes red blood cells, Its absence resulted in an increased PCV. 24 There are other ways to increase the number of red blood cells that are legal. Altitude training can push the PCV to dangerous, Even fatal, Levels. More recently, Hypoxic air machines have been used to simulate altitude training. The body responds by releasing natural EPO and growing more blood cells, So that it can absorb more oxygen with every breath. The Hypoxico promotional material quotes Tim Seaman, A US athlete, Who claims that the hypoxic air tent has \"given my blood the legal \"boost\" that it needs to be competitive at the world level. \"25 There is one way to boost an athlete\"s number of red blood cells that is completely undetectable:26 autologous blood doping. In this process, Athletes remove some blood, And reinject it after their body has made new blood to replace it. This method was popular before recombinant human EPO became available. \"By allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs, We level the playing field. \" There is no difference between elevating your blood count by altitude training, By using a hypoxic air machine, Or by taking EPO. But the last is illegal. Some competitors have high PCVs and an advantage by luck. Some can afford hypoxic air machines. Is this fair? Nature is not fair. Ian Thorpe has enormous feet which give him an advantage that no other swimmer can get, No matter how much they exercise. Some gymnasts are more flexible, And some basketball players are seven feet tall. By allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs, We level the playing field. We remove the effects of genetic inequality. Far from being unfair, Allowing performance enhancement promotes equality.",

            "premise": "1) Steroids further human achievement and comparisons between human achievements in different eras are moot since the rules change so much. Steroids do further human achievement in sports. But at what cost? What is the purpose of competiting in sports in the first place? Steroids have many negative adverse affects physically (shrunken testicles, acne . . .) and mentally (aggression, violence . . .). The purpose of competing in sports is to use skill, knowledge, and physical investment as a way of competing with others. If we allow sterioids, the best players will only be those people who have cutting edge steroids. Also, it sends a message to kids growing up that they should abandon the values of fair play and seek to better themselves by finding the latest substance.2) The sports benefit economically by allowing performance-enhancing drugs. Someone lived to 122 yeard old, a feat only possible by having new, not primitive technology. The media craze didn't know at the time of their steroid use. Solving a huge math problem but always turning around and using a hidden calculator before turning back around to reveal the answer is much more impressive if people didn't know you had the calculator. People's fascination with sports would die out if they knew everyone was hyped up on steroids because it encourages unfair competition (only those who have the best, newest juice will have the benefits). In response to the analogy, living to 122 years old by having newer technology is a good thing - because there are not the same negatives associated with increasing the maximum livable age opposed to the negatives with steroid use (physical and mental side-effects) as well as the effects it would have on the spirit of the game.Baseball has a lot of steroid use. Thus, it saw the biggest excitement around new records. This is a false correlation. Nobody watches the sport just because its most impacted by performance-enhancing drugs. Otherwise everyone would watch WWE. 2,000 char limit",

            "premise": "The natural/unnatural distinction is untenable. Already athletes use all sorts of dietary supplements, exercises, equipment, clothing, training regimes, medical treatments, etc. to enhance their performance. There is nothing \u2018natural\u2019 about taking vitamin pills, wearing whole-body Lycra suits, having surgery on ligaments, spending every day in a gym pumping weights or running in shoes with spikes on the bottom. Diet, medicine, technology, and even just coaching already give an artificial advantage to those athletes who can afford the best of all these aids. Since there is no clear way to distinguish from legitimate and illegitimate artificial aids to performance, they should all be allowed. So taking these drugs is no more unnatural than what happens today. \u00a0 A practical example of an unnatural aid is the Speedo worn in 2008 at the Beijing Olympics. FINA, the world governing body of swimming was concerned about the extraordinary statistics in Beijing where swimmers wearing the Speedo LZR Racer swimsuit won 90 per cent of all available medals and broke 23 world records. Since Speedo launched the suit in 2008, 108 world records have fallen (until February 2009) (1). \u00a0 Simon Hart, Swimwear giant Speedo hit back at 'unfair advantage' claims, 02/19/2009, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/swimming/4699498/Swimwear-giant-Speedo-hit-back-at-unfair-advantage-claims.html,accessed 15/05/2011\u00a0",

The chance of a gold medal in two years\u2019 time may out-weigh the risks of serious health problems for the rest of their life. We should protect athletes from themselves and not allow anyone to take performance-enhancing drugs. An example of the pressure is cycling. The American Scientific magazine explains: \u201cGame theory highlights why it is rational for professional cyclists to dope: the drugs are extremely effective as well as difficult or impossible to detect; the payoffs for success are high; and as more riders use them, a \u201cclean\u201d rider may become so noncompetitive that he or she risks being cut from the team.\u201d (1) \u00a0 Michael Shermer, The Dopping Dillema, 03/31/2008,\u00a0http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-doping-dilemma\u00a0accessed 05/15/2011",

This line should be drawn at protecting athletes from harmful drugs and preserving the spirit of fair play and unaided competition between human beings in their peak of natural fitness. The special diet and sport training equipment, which may seem very hard and exeptional, have been designed based on serious scientific research proved and tested to fit with long-term training of athletes. Hard practice to achieve the best performance with help of these professional methods is completely a different from taking steroids and growth hormones for immediate result.",

So, when humans start taking drugs to improve performance, it is no longer a sport, it is a spectacle, because there is no human physical achievement, but instead a chemical achievement. \u00a0 It also becomes a celebration not of human physical achievement, but of human intellectual achievement, of who can design the best drugs. Even with fancy running shoes, we are still celebrating human achievement, which will not happen once you take it to the extreme of allowing drug use. This doesn\u2019t benefit athletes in the long run. Athletes won\u2019t be celebrated but scientists will!",

However, there are some harmful side effects to using them. They include: - higher blood pressure - higher cholesterol levels - higher risk of heart disease - liver damage - premature growth - testicular cancer - abnormally large amounts of acne - breast development in men This, obviously, is not good for the steroid user. Furthermore, exercising normally can avoid these problems, and regular exercise is better for physical and mental health. 2) Negative impact on children When children start to get into sports, they normally treat their favorite player as an idol, an image of what they want to be when they grow up. How would they feel if their idol essentially cheated by using drugs so they didn't have to work as hard? Furthermore, what if they decided to use steroids too, because their hero did? 3) Unfair advantage Most professional athletes work hard every day to stay in shape and sharp at their sport. Why should some players get to skip this hard work that everyone else is doing? That's all for now.",

I understand players are out there to get theirs and get as much money as they can, but what about the true players of the game who aren't using these performing enhancing drugs.

            "premise": "I would like to address the debate, however my opponent ask me to clarify the side I will support and it's quite simply the literal opposite of yours. My side is apparent simply based on the title of the debate and our positions, I will be arguing that performance enhancing drugs shouldn't be legal in every major sporting league. Also it seems you have taken care of the basic definition needed to begin the debate and I see no need for additional definitions atleast while the debate is still somewhat simple. Onto my argument 1. Equality As these drugs became allowed in sporting leagues, they would increase player production meaning in order to compete you would have to take drugs in order to win. One great example of this would be in cycling many cyclists's resorted to doping to boost their production in order to win the tour de france. So in order to stay equal to the competition Lance Armstrong took drugs alongside them, all may appear equal but in truth the drugs are expensive and discriminate on players on the league who are too poor to acquire the quantity needed to stay on par with opponents. [1] 2. Health Concerns Their are many bad health effects of anabolic steroids such as[2]: 1. Changes in liver function 2. Infertility 3. Growth of male breasts 4. Retardation in fetus's 5. Death 6. Increased aggressiveness 7. Sleeping disorders 8. Confusion 9. Paranoia 10. Hallucinations 11. A weaker immune system 12. Hair loss 3. The league's rights The league has the right to determine how the sport is played, for example in the NBA only 5 players may on the court at a time. The league itself should be able to determine drug limitations, as the league determines the game rules. [3] Sources: [1] http://www.cyclingnews.com... [2] http://www.sportsci.org...

I hereby list out my arguments: C1: Drugs like stimulant and etc. Are performance boosting drugs during sport events: Drugs like stimulant and also muscle/hormone growth are common practice in some sport areas, For example: it is common knowledge that the fighters in AFL or other television events use these drugs before the event happened. Despite many arguments that these drugs are harmful to human body, Body stimulant drugs are used in many normal competitions. C2: The current technology is expensive, And also inadequate enough. One of the most famous quote in the tour of france is the following: You have no idea what the Tour de France is\", Henri said. \"It's a Calvary. Worse than that, Because the road to the Cross has only 14 stations and ours has 15. We suffer from the start to the end. You want to know how we keep going? Here. . . \" He pulled a phial from his bag. \"That's cocaine, For our eyes. This is chloroform, For our gums. \" \"This\", Ville said, Emptying his shoulder bag \"is liniment to put warmth back into our knees. \" \"And pills. Do you want to see pills? Have a look, Here are the pills. \" Each pulled out three boxes. \"The truth is\", Francis said, \"that we keep going on dynamite. \" Henri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, Then of their bodies being drained by diarrhoea, Before continuing: \"At night, In our rooms, We can't sleep. We twitch and dance and jig about as though we were doing St Vitus's Dance. . . \" \"There's less flesh on our bodies than on a skeleton\", Francis said. This might be a joke, But the truth is, These long range races are suffering to the people who are participating in them. Also, Lance Armstrong, A legendary doping figure in the Tour De France had also talked about 1 single thing: \"It is impossible to go on without drugs. \"",

We allow world class athletes to train for 23 hours a week (on average), adjust their diets and endanger themselves by pushing the boundaries of their body. We let them do it, because it is what they chose which is best for them. According to the NFL Player Association the average life expectancy of an NFL player is 58 years of age (1). Thus already we allow athletes to endanger their lives, give them the choice of a lifestyle.

            "discussionTitle": "Statistics, Performance Enhancing Drugs, and Major League Baseball.",
            "conclusion": "Statistics, Performance Enhancing Drugs, and Major League Baseball.",
            "premise": "Abbreviations: MLB\u2013Major League Baseball. PED\u2013Performance Enhancing Drug(s). Definitions: Performance Enhancing Drug(s)\u2013substances used by athletes to improve their performances in the sports in which they engage. [1] With baseball, this usually refers mainly to anabolic steroids. [2] Thus, in this debate, \"steroids\" and \"PEDs\" will be used interchangeably. Hopefully, my opponent does not have a problem with this. Resolution: The statistics of those Major League Baseball players who, in the late 1990s until 2004, otherwise considered the height of the \"Steroid Era\" by MLB fan, were known users of PEDs or who were almost certainly using PEDs, should still be held as legitimate in assessing those players' talent relative to other MLB players. A bit of an introduction: As anyone who has any interest in MLB may know, artificial performance enhancement through PEDs has become a huge issue in the last decade or so, mainly because of the huge home run chases of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa that are credited with bringing fans back to MLB and the subsequent revelations and suspicions that the two were using PEDs, and the incredible performances of Barry Bonds in the early 2000s and the large controversies surrounding him and steroid use. Often, among the outrage from many fans towards those who have admitted to PED use, there are cries to invalidate statistics, under the pretense that these statistics are heavily skewed by illegal means. [3] \u2013 there are ridiculous numbers of sources for this; search some combination of \"steroids,\" \"statistics,\" and \"strip\" or \"asterisk\" or something and many results will pop up. My argument: I'm here to say heck naw. The statistics of those players who we now know or are almost sure were using PEDs\u2013Jason Giambi, Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds\u2013are still accurate in determining how good those players were compared to the rest of the league. 1. A PED's positive effect on baseball playing skills is unknown and likely minimal. 1a. Many of the players using PEDs were actually bottom-of-the-ladder MLB players and minor leaguers. [4] One can find the names of many of the MLB players on the Mitchell Report anywhere; here's an easy list. [5] On this list, we can see many players who were simply not very good Major League players, as evidenced most strongly by their incredibly short careers. On that list, for example, the names of players active at the time of the report, which was December 2007, is pretty low. Many of the players listed on the report as having used PEDs reportedly used them in the early 2000s but were not active by 2007. This shows that despite their PED use, they weren't good enough to stick around in the Major Leagues. If PEDs gave a huge benefit to those who used them, why did so many who used them end up being bad MLB players anyway? 1b. The physical gain from steroids, most notably increased muscle mass, is vastly overstated in its importance to playing baseball well. The key muscle group in baseball is the core\u2013abs, lower back, obliques, etc. This muscle group is the most important in generating torque in both hitting and pitching, and is thus the most important in generating bat speed and arm speed, and thus the most important in hitting baseballs hard and far and throwing sick heat (a baseball fast.) I think it's dumb to cite a source for this, but I'll just pick a couple anyway. [6] (get used to seeing [6]; it has beastly information.) [7] Another important part of baseball, actually, especially in pitching, is flexibility. [7] A flexible pitcher is able to create more external rotation of the upper pitching arm ([8]), which results in more velocity. I think it's obvious that more arm mass\u2013bicep and tricep mass, which obviously results from steroid use\u2013would inhibit the pitching arm's external rotation and thus lower a pitcher's speed. The last important muscle group in hitting and pitching is the lower body. Steroids, however, have a much more pronounced effect on the upper body than the lower body, and the upper body is actually quite irrelevant in creating bat speed or arm speed. [6] 2. The increased power numbers in the Steroid Era can be attributed to many other factors. Many people point to the huge numbers put up by Steroid Era players as evidence for PED's effect on statistics. However, there were numerous other factors contributing to a huge rise in offense. [6] One of the most notable changes was the \"juiced\" ball\u2013in 1993, the ball-manufacturing process was changed, and in a 2000 study, it was shown that baseballs in 1995 and 2000 bounced an average of 33% higher than balls from previous eras. [6] [9] (heh, 69.) Using a \"spliced\" power factor, which accounts for the changes in equipment manufacturing, there is NO \"power spike\" that supposedly occurred during the Steroid Era, as a result of PEDs. [6] I would highly recommend looking at that site, especially the \"spliced\" power factor graph. It's very interesting. 3. Due to the most likely very high numbers of players who were using PEDs during the Steroid Era, any advantage gained by a player was usually cancelled out by an advantage gained by an opposing player. [10] In essence, enough players used PEDs to create an \"even playing field.\" If 95% of the pitchers Barry Bonds faced were also using steroids, then aren't his records still legitimate? How do we know tons of players used steroids? Obviously, we don't have concrete numbers. We do, however, have player's accounts. [10] Some players have talked about the rampant steroid use in the late 1990s and early 2000s made possible by lenient drug policies, and some have suggested the idea of the level playing field. The allegations of \"rampant steroid use\" are what prompted the initial congressional investigations into MLB's PED problems. [11] Conclusion: Steroids in baseball were not a significant enough factor in statistical evidence to influence decisions on which players were the best or worst. The actual benefits players get from steroids is very questionable, considering the number of bad MLB players who have used PEDs without enough of a benefit to even stay in the Major Leagues, and considering the muscle groups utilized in baseball versus those that are enhanced by PED use. The increase in offense during the Steroid Era was influenced by other factors, most notably the \"ball juicing\" of 1993. When adjusting for these power factors that were unrelated to playing ability, there is no apparent jump in offense during the steroid era, again calling into question the effect of steroids in increasing performance. Finally, regardless of the magnitude of a PED's benefit on player performance, any benefit was cancelled or balanced by someone else's benefit. Because most players were using PEDs, their statistics, when compared to each other's, are unchanged. The widespread use of PEDs created a level playing field for MLB players. I'd like to thank in advance whoever takes this argument, and I eagerly await his or her arguments. [1]http://en.wikipedia.org... [2]http://en.wikipedia.org... [3]http://bleacherreport.com...

Some people play sports for entertainment as well. There are different types of video games. Not all of them are sports- RPG games cannot, but playing Esports competitively can. As someone mentioned in the comments, there are plenty of sports that require little physical conduct, like Go! or Chess, which, as I said before, is recognized as a sport in over 100 countries. You need to practice strategy and hone your skills to be able to stand a chance in a competition for these things, especially chess. Physical sports also require strategy, I got the definition from Dictionary.com. Also, I'm fairly sure that the definition of sport is not for entertainment. I mean, it could be, but many people play them professionally. There are also several other similar definitions that you can look at by scrolling down the list on this link: https://www.google.com... As Yos said, and I and many others have experienced, playing the games considered as Esports require incredible reflexes- pro gamers can even make as many as 400 moves on a keyboard per second, which is more than four times the average person. I may have been incorrect in my definition, but having good reflexes can certainly be counted as physical prowess. ESPN showcasing a gaming match further proves that it should be considered a sport. Esports teams are coached, like and pro athletic team would be, and some teams are even owned by people in the way football teams are. http://www.dailymail.co.uk... https://www.forbes.com...

            "premise": "It is a controversial topic that sparks feuds from both sides of the coin; are video games really sports? However, many fail to note a plethora of points and concepts that more than confirm the idea that video games sports. The definition of sports, although varying with different diction and colloquialism across many textbooks, is \"a game played either as recreation or competition.\" The argument is not semantics. Just as you can hunt game for sport, you can play video games as a sport. Whether it is physically taxing or not is irrelevant - as an example, the game of chess is widely accepted as a sport, but the game is a battle of not physical, but mental stamina. Those who play the game are indeed \"athletes\" - just not physical athletes - these video game athletes are playing sports. Video games have been gradually becoming accepted as sports, making appearances on sports channels and news worldwide. The professional scene in what is now being referred to as \"eSports\" is no joke - the prize pools for games such as Dota 2 or Halo 5: Guardians have been large, from a wallet-pleasing two million USD to a bank-crushing twenty million USD. These prizes compete with what many professional baseball or basketball players can make in a year; to say that these eSports cannot qualify as \"true sports\" is ludicrous. All around the world, there are many arguing for or against the idea that video games are sports. Only one side is correct. Due to the nature of video games, their current professional standings, and the definition of what a sport really is, it is factual that video games are a sport.

            "conclusion": "Statistics, Performance Enhancing Drugs, and Major League Baseball.",
            "premise": "Thank you, iamadragon, for starting this debate. \"1. A PED's positive effect on baseball playing skills is unknown and likely minimal.\" If the effects really were minimal, then players wouldn't be using them. Furthermore, the effects are known [1]: \"Reports indicate that use of anabolic steroids produces increases in lean muscle mass, strength, and ability to train longer and harder.\" An increase in strength and muscle mass helps in just about any sport, and training longer and harder gives a definite boost. \"1a. Many of the players using PEDs were actually bottom-of-the-ladder MLB players and minor leaguers.\" There's a simple answer here. The poor players decided that they would use PEDs to give themselves an advantage. Plus, the side effects of steroids may lead people to stop using them, which would lead to a decrease in performance, which would put them out of the major leagues. \"If PEDs gave a huge benefit to those who used them, why did so many who used them end up being bad MLB players anyway?\" 1. They were bad, which made them use PEDs. 2. They eventually quit, and therefore could not stay in the MLB. \"1b. The physical gain from steroids, most notably increased muscle mass, is vastly overstated in its importance to playing baseball well.\" Increased muscle mass helps increase the strength of the core-abs, which would immediately lead to better performance in baseball. Obviously, a pitcher would want to stay away from steroids, but a batter would use them. \"2. The increased power numbers in the Steroid Era can be attributed to many other factors.\" Yes, but they can also be attributed to steroids. The PF thing is interesting, but it does not account for any increase at all in pitching strength. \"3. Due to the most likely very high numbers of players who were using PEDs during the Steroid Era, any advantage gained by a player was usually cancelled out by an advantage gained by an opposing player.\" Great. Let's just let everybody use steroids. That way, we can have every single MLB player suffer the side effects of steroids [2], which many players would rather not do. \"'..[steroids] they are dangerous drugs, and when used inappropriately, they can cause a host of severe, long-lasting, and often irreversible negative health consequences. These drugs can stunt the height of growing adolescents, masculinize women, and alter sex characteristics of men. Anabolic steroids can lead to premature heart attacks, strokes, liver tumors, kidney failure and serious psychiatric problems. In addition, because steroids are often injected, users risk contracting or transmitting HIV or hepatitis..'\" According to a source that seems to be biased towards PRO [3], there is always a risk of side effects with PEDs. Why not avoid having to take such a risk? Plus, most players don't use steroids. This puts them at a disadvantage against the steroid-abusing players. Should we reward those who break the rules? \"Conclusion: Steroids in baseball were not a significant enough factor in statistical evidence to influence decisions on which players were the best or worst.\" 1. When the players started to take steroids, they did so because they believed that it would give them greater statistics, more victories, and an overall higher salary in baseball. (Given) 2. These players believed that steroids in baseball were a significant enough factor in statistical evidence to influence decisions on which players were the best or worst. (Re-wording of 1) A. First, let's look at the path in which we do nothing about it, and the PEDs do nothing. 3a. These players were wrong in their beliefs. 4a. Life continues, as normal. THE FINAL RESULT: The PED users are wasting their money. B. Now, if we crack down on them by declaring their statistics to be invalid, and the PEDs do nothing. 3b. These players were wrong in their beliefs. 4b. Nobody ever realizes that the PEDs do nothing. THE FINAL RESULT: The PED users are wasting their money, and getting punished for something that they believe to be true. C. If we let them slide and the PEDs actually do something... 3c. These players were right in their beliefs. 4c. They have an advantage over every player that chooses to abide by the rules. THE FINAL RESULT: The PED users are making more money, and becoming more famous, illegally. D. This is if we crack down on them, and they're guilty. 3d. These players were right in their beliefs. 4d. The players have incentive not to use PEDs. THE FINAL RESULT: The PED users have their statistics thrown out for illegal actions that falsified their actions, making the statistics fairer. So, basically, they think that the PEDs have a significant effect on their stats. Well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Let's punish them for what they believe to be true. They took that risk when they took the PEDs. It's really only fair. \"Finally, regardless of the magnitude of a PED's benefit on player performance, any benefit was cancelled or balanced by someone else's benefit. Because most players were using PEDs, their statistics, when compared to each other's, are unchanged. The widespread use of PEDs created a level playing field for MLB players.\" This means that anybody who didn't use PEDs ends up looking worse. Do you really think that it's fair to reward the criminals, and make the people who played by the rules look like wimps? A \"level playing field\" in which the cheaters always win isn't a level playing field at all. 1. http://www.drugfree.org... 2. http://en.wikipedia.org... 3. http://steroids-and-baseball.com... 4. http://www.steroid.com...",

            "premise": "Thanks to Actionsspeak for clarifying his case and for his opening remarks. This looks to be an interesting debate. I ask the audience to recognize that even his case is a departure from status quo. He would like to afford the capacity to decide whether steroid and hormone usage is allowed in any given sport to the sporting leagues themselves, and thus take it out of the hands of legislators. Con's third contention made it clear that the league, not lawmakers, should have the right to determine how a sport is played. So what we're really discussing here is whether or not the option should be available to individuals or to sporting leagues, not whether their usage should be legalized or not. This is an important distinction, and one that should be kept in mind that the American legal structures [1] aren't going to be an impediment in either of our cases as this debate goes forward. Now, onto my rebuttals. On Equality: 1. Sports aren't about equality. If it was, we wouldn't have winners and losers. The system of competition is meant to elevate those who are better at what they do, whether that's as a result of inherent capacities or how well they use their resources. No one is entitled to play professional sports \" it's a privilege requiring enormous sacrifice and massive risk, whether they use steroids or not, and most walk away. If Con wants equality, sports isn't the place to find it. 2. Sports aren't equal. Recall two things I said in R2. First, I discussed what athletes do in order to get in shape. Flying into the mountains to thicken the blood and increase the flow of oxygen through their bodies isn't something everyone can do before competitions, nor can they all find training facilities above a certain altitude. Even among those that can, not all of them will have access to top of the line equipment, masseuses, trainers, or all the other expenses required to build muscle quickly and efficiently. They don't all have access to the same megadoses of vitamin pills, dietary supplements, equipment, clothing, or medical treatments that are allowed to everyone in status quo. Hell, things like hyperbaric oxygen chambers, which increase the rate of recovery for players, are being purchased by many teams and players at tremendous costs, providing them and only them an appreciable advantage.[2] and would continue to be allowed in Con's case. Why are steroids so special? Second, I talked about how some people just have higher inherent capacities. They produce more testosterone, HGH or erythropoeitin, they can endure a faster heartbeat, or even the fact that they produce normal blood cells. Not everyone has those advantages, and Con has provided no way for anyone to make up for any such deficiencies. Only my plan seeks to solve for these concerns. 3. Con's case is worse for equality. Black market drugs are more expensive, harder to find,[3] and more dangerous, but more on that last point later. But you can look at this point one of two ways. You can accept that steroid usage causes more steroid usage, in which case Con's case is more detrimental there's already a system in place where athletes feel the need to use steroids and hormones to succeed. The only difference is that they can't use the cheapest, safest, and most well-known steroids prescribed directly by doctors at specific doses and lower cost. Con provides absolutely no reason to believe that legalization will increase usage over status quo. Even if he does, recognize that equality is only a larger problem within his case and in the status quo. The only reason why an advantage such as steroids would be considered unfair is if they're unequally distributed, but as I pointed out in the previous round, the distribution is currently as unequal as it gets. Using basic steroids and hormones instead of what's available on the black market will lower, not raise, the barrier for entry, and increase fairness to all athletes. Or you can notice that this argument has no warrant. Con asserts that steroid usage among some athletes will spread to other athletes who want to compete. This is nothing more than an assertion, and one which is not well explained. Mandatory testing programs among MLB players have revealed that a whopping 5-7% of athletes were using steroids[4], which means 93-95% of athletes were able to play at a very high level without coercion. There's no reason to believe that legalization will cause these numbers to balloon out of control. The uncertainty regarding who is using steroids/hormones in status quo, if anything, creates more impetus to use than a transparent system where everyone who does use does so openly. 4. Con also allows sports leagues to create their own barriers to entry for those with anemia, low testosterone production, reduced muscle growth, and anything else that puts them at a marked disadvantage. He allows individual leagues to discriminate against these groups, harming any sense of equality by denying access to those who could easily keep up if they had access to the available resources. On Health Concerns: 1. Athletes are already forced into an incredibly unhealthy lifestyle and die young. I made this clear in the previous round, but there's no significant difference between any of the health harms presented by Con and the ones I presented in R2. Con will have to address my point that these harms are non-unique and my hypocrisy arguments as well in the next round in order to win this point. 2. Health concerns are worse in an environment where black market drugs are the only ones being used. The reality is that the health concerns are far more excessive using designer steroids and gene doping, as I pointed out last round. Worse yet, his case only exacerbates these harms by legalizing their usage in the general community, but not in all sports. In my case, incentive to use designer steroids and gene doping is erased due to their expense and ineffectiveness by comparison. Con encourages the legal usage of the most dangerous doping substances. 3. Each athlete accepts these health concerns the moment they take these drugs. There's no reason why athletes shouldn't be able to take these concerns on themselves, especially if they know about them in advance. Since Con's case encourages athletes to pursue drugs with unknown health harms, his forces a lower capacity to consent than mine does. On \"The league's rights\": 1. There's no impact here. Con doesn't explain how changes in the way sports are played is actually harmful. Even if this is certain to happen, the lack of a harm makes it unimportant. 2. There's no warrant for this claim. Con doesn't explain how a change in one rule affects another one. The only possible warrant is a slippery slope fallacy, which has no rational basis in this debate. Worse yet, even if it was true that one rule change could link to another, the rules he's trying to link have nothing in common. The rules of what an athlete can do to their own bodies have no effect on whether any player can disregard the basic rules of how a sport is played in competition. 3. The league doesn't have a right to deny access based on any person's characteristics, training regimen, or nutritional intake. This is one of the very few influences they have on what athletes can take and use for playing their sports, and it's done with extreme hypocrisy based on shaky reasoning. Leagues should not be allowed to spurn athletes who they think have an unfair advantage based on other characteristics, and yet Con wants us to believe that this is crossing some special line. With that, I leave it to my opponent to rebut my case and respond to these arguments. 1. http://www.steroidabuse.com... 2. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com... 3. http://www.theguardian.com... 4. http://mlb.mlb.com...",

            "premise": "1a. Injuries occurred in sports are risks to your health. Steroids are also risks to your health. Therefore steroid use is acceptable. Players avoid injuries. Steroid use is intentional. Therefore you should avoid injuries and steroids for the health risks. 1b. Banning steroids for aesthetic reasons should not be a problem since we all choose to look a certain way. It is just a side effect of a harmful substance - no one chooses to use steroids just for shrunken testicles and acne unless they're insane. Also, it is illegally altering your body composition. 1c. No evidence shows that steroid use has mental side-effects. Ever heard of \"roid rage\"? \" \"Anabolic steroid use is linked not only to roid rage and sudden mood changes, but also to a higher incidence of suicide than in the general populace.\" [1] 1d. Steroids only complement existing skill and will put everyone on a level playing field. Steroids allow unnatural muscular development. It can complement existing skill and it can also allow somebody with lesser skill a greater physical advantage due to his increased muscular development. There are different kinds of steroids, not everyone will have the same ones, and those with the \"cutting edge\" ones will have the greatest advantage. 2a. My point is that the best, most cutting-edge technology is a part of human achievement. Breaking records by having an altered body composition is not human achievement, it's an achievement made by a human with superhuman alterations. This is not the point of competing in sports. 3.a \u201cBaseball was always the sport most impacted by performance-enhancing drugs. Thus, it saw the biggest excitement around new records.\u201d And your response to my claim that it was a false correlation: \u201cIt is not a false correlation at all. There may not be much interest in the WWE, but that can be for other reasons.\u201dI used the WWE as an example of how you falsely correlated interest with steroid use.char limit SOURCE: http://www.wisegeek.org...;[1]",

            "premise": "Using steroids helps you improve your skills for a certain amount of time, but in the long run it damages your body in different ways (mentally and physically). Anabolic Steroids are artificially produced hormones that are similar to the androgens, the male-type sex hormones in the body. (\"Steroids\") Steroid Supplements contain -dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione ( also know as andro) (Steroids ; Steven Dowshen, MD).For the most part, steroidal supplements, which used to be found at health food stores or gyms, are now illegal and require a prescription. Natural made steroids (from your body) are what your body produces naturally to support such functions as fighting stress and promoting growth and development. Professional sport leagues should keep the policy of no steroid use and make it stricter. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Taking steroids can cause many different side effects which can be very serious or can be long-lasting. Some of them are hair loss, high blood pressure that can damage the hear or blood vessels over time, believing things that aren't true (delusion), liver damage, aching joints, and many more. Many of these effects will stay for a number of years, and will be hard to reverse (\"Steroid Abuse in Today's Society\"). Some specific risks for women are increase in facial fair and deepening of the voice. Some specific risks for men are inability to have children and pain when urinating. People who inject the drug with a needle are at the risk of infection with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), virus that causes AIDS (kidshealth.org ; Steroids ; Steven Dowshen, MD). \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd People mostly only think about the side effects while taking steroids, but there are effects after using steroids too. A lot of people tell themselves that they'll only take steroids for a season or a limited time. Unfortunately steroids are addictive. Once people stop taking steroids they are at a risk of getting irritability, paranoia, and severe depression, which may lead to suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide(\"Steroids\" ; Steven Dowshen, MD). Also people who take steroids and stop, they are at the risk of using other drugs, such as alcohol or cocaine. The long term effects of steroid use might not show for a number of years (\"Steroids\" ; Steven Dowshen, MD). \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Current rules in professional sports on using steroids in (MLB) are not as strict as they should be( \"Should performance enhancing drugs (such as steroids) be accepted in sports?\" ; various authors). A first positive test would result in a suspension of up to ten days, a second positive test a thirty-day ban, a third positive test a sixty day penalty and a fourth positive test a one year ban (\"New Steroids Rules For Baseball\" Joel Roberts). Rob Manfred, the executive vice president for labor relations for MLB outlined the major parts of the new agreement : There would be year round testing for steroids for all its players. There will be off-season testing. Major League Baseball is expanding its list of banned substances.(\"New Steroids Rules For Baseball ; Joel Roberts\") Again steroids help you improve your skills for a certain amount of time, but in the long run it damages your body in many different ways (mentally and physically) (\"Are Steroids as bad as we think they are? Drake Bennett, Globe staff) If players actually knew the real side effects were not as many would take steroids. Many websites that sell steroids illegally do not list the actual effects of taking steroids (\"Side Effects of Steroids\", Anthony Roberts). Professional sports leagues should make it much stricter (MLB in piratical).",

            "premise": "I apologize. I forgot to source my definition. Here it is: 3. http://www.merriam-webster.com... Now, for starters, I'd like to point out that my opponent has never actually affirmed the resolution. His entire conclusion was about how he refuted my arguments, which would only stop the negation of the resolution. The burden of proof is on him, as PRO and the Instigator. Because he doesn't address any affirmation in his conclusion, he can't affirm the resolution. Therefore, you can't vote PRO, but you can vote CON, as I'm about to show you. \"My statement did not imply that.\" You said that it would help minimally. That implies help. \"How much longer? How much effort?...\" I sourced this in Round 1: \"Reports indicate that use of anabolic steroids produces increases in lean muscle mass, strength, and ability to train longer and harder.\" It seems that any training would be eased, including baseball training and sit-ups, which strengthen the core-abs. \"How do they impact life after baseball...\" No, not life after baseball. Life during their baseball career, but off of the field. For example, liver tumors that are caused by steroids don't appear until a while after the steroids were taken, at which point the player can no longer play baseball. Additionally, baldness and infertility don't affect one's baseball-playing skills, but they do affect one's social life. So, the baseball players on PEDs decide that it isn't worth it after using them for a while. \"If it was at an expense they couldn't pay...\" It helped them for a short time, but then they quit steroids and baseball. You don't see any drop in performance until then. \"This, to me, seems like nit-picking...\" You're the one who is claiming that it doesn't help the core-abs. The burden of proof is on you. It has an effect on core-abs. You're the one who's making up statistics. \"So you agree...\" However, I don't want to see everybody using PEDs, because then it forces everybody to suffer the side-effects. \"No, you cannot...\" You argue that everybody could use PEDs to balance everything out. I argue that forcing people to take PEDs to play in MLB is immoral. \"Sorry, but this is irrelevant...\" Calling their statistics illegitimate discourages usage of PEDs, which is largely a good thing. \"Like I said, this is a ridiculous distinction.\" That is because you misunderstood. \"Yep, irrelevant to the statistics.\" If something is immoral, it should not be done. \"Significant is basically the same thing as massive...\" Significant [1] - having or likely to have influence or effect That isn't even close to meaning \"massive.\" \"I said that in such a high level of competition, athletes will do anything to gain any edge, no matter how small...\" Exactly. They're using PEDs to get a significant edge, which is why the statistics become flawed. \"Glorification is irrelevant to the debate...\" You didn't answer the question. Plus, if you think that all of the students are cheating, do you let them continue, or do you crack down on them and teach them discipline? You teach them discipline. That's the only way to help discourage cheating. \"There's no reason for that moral logic to be extended to the legitimacy of statistics...\" I always thought that the athletic drive involved sportsmanship and playing by the rules. \"Wow, appeal to emotion. These few MLB players are, at this point, outliers...\" That's nice. Kill the outliers. Squash them, because they're doing the right thing. Somehow, that doesn't make sense. \"General muscle strength doesn't necessarily help baseball. You haven't even shown that it's general muscle strength...\" You haven't shown that it isn't. Plus, you didn't address the workout argument. You asked more questions. \"The rest of your statement doesn't make any sense to me, unless you're basically just outright saying that you only think a PED's positive effects affected performance...\" That's the only factor of life in which they have a positive impact. Do you think using steroids helps you when you go to the doctor? When you're trying to be a responsible parent? 'Roid rage really doesn't help there, in addition to the infertility and all. \"Yep. Thanks. Refutations and straw man labels above.\" Refutations and straw man labels removed. \"In the world of statistics, this would mean that the statistics are not skewed by factors outside of the player's own natural ability.\" Well, PEDs are far from a player's natural ability, given that they enhance perfornamce beyond normal [2]. Thus, if a player uses PEDs, then his statistics are skewed, and therefore illegitimate. \"The whole reason I started this was to argue that even though they broke the rules, their statistics were legitimate.\" That's kind of hard to do, given that to be legitimate, they have to have not broken the rules in the first place. \"You're simply saying that the fact that they broke the rules makes their statistics legitimate. You can't just say that. You're supposed to argue that. You have not negated the resolution.\" Alright then, I will. Again, the resolution: \"The statistics of those Major League Baseball players who... were known users of PEDs or who were almost certainly using PEDs, should still be held as legitimate...\" And again, with the definition of \"legitimate\" [3]: \"The statistics of those Major League Baseball players who... were known users of PEDs or who were almost certainly using PEDs, should still be held as [conforming to accepted rules]...\" And now, given that PEDs are illegal in Major League Baseball [4]: \"The statistics of those Major League Baseball players who... were known [breakers of the rules], should still be held as [conforming to accepted rules]...\" This is obviously contradictory. The statistics of players who broke the rules should he held as if they didn't break the rules. The resolution contradicts with itself [5]. Thus, it is negated. \"You have not negated the resolution.\" Now I have. Happy now? My opponent's conclusion seems to ignore the most important argument about legitimacy making the resolution impossible to affirm. It only deals with rebuttals of other arguments. In conclusion, because the use of the word \"legitimate\" in the resolution, the resolution becomes self-contradictory, and therefore cannot be affirmed. The resolution is negated. Vote CON. 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://en.wikipedia.org... 3. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 4. http://en.wikipedia.org... 5. http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "premise": "Abbreviations: MLB\u2013Major League Baseball. PED\u2013Performance Enhancing Drug(s). Definitions: Performance Enhancing Drug(s)\u2013substances used by athletes with the intent to improve their performances in the sports in which they engage. [1] With baseball, this usually refers mainly to anabolic steroids. [2] Thus, in this debate, \"steroids\" and \"PEDs\" will be used interchangeably. Hopefully, my opponent does not have a problem with this. Resolution: The statistics of those Major League Baseball players who, in the late 1990s through 2004, otherwise considered the height of the \"Steroid Era\" by MLB fans, were known users of PEDs or who were almost certainly using PEDs, should still be held as legitimate in assessing those players' talent relative to other MLB players. A bit of an introduction: As anyone who has any interest in MLB may know, artificial performance enhancement through PEDs has become a huge issue in the last decade or so, mainly because of the huge home run chases of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa that are credited with bringing fans back to MLB and the subsequent revelations and suspicions that the two were using PEDs, and the incredible performances of Barry Bonds in the early 2000s and the large controversies surrounding him and steroid use. Often, among the outrage from many fans towards those who have admitted to PED use, there are cries to invalidate statistics, under the pretense that these statistics are heavily skewed by illegal means. [3] \u2013 there are ridiculous numbers of sources for this; search some combination of \"steroids,\" \"statistics,\" and \"strip\" or \"asterisk\" or something and many results will pop up. My argument: I'm here to say heck naw. The statistics of those players who we now know or are almost sure were using PEDs\u2013Jason Giambi, Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds\u2013are still accurate in determining how good those players were compared to the rest of the league. 1. A PED's positive effect on baseball playing skills is unknown and likely minimal. 1a. Many of the players using PEDs were actually bottom-of-the-ladder MLB players and minor leaguers. [4] One can find the names of many of the MLB players on the Mitchell Report anywhere; here's an easy list. [5] On this list, we can see many players who were simply not very good Major League players, as evidenced most strongly by their incredibly short careers. On that list, for example, the names of players active at the time of the report, which was December 2007, is pretty low. Many of the players listed on the report as having used PEDs reportedly used them in the early 2000s but were not active by 2007. This shows that despite their PED use, they weren't good enough to stick around in the Major Leagues. If PEDs gave a huge benefit to those who used them, why did so many who used them end up being bad MLB players anyway? 1b. The physical gain from steroids, most notably increased muscle mass, is vastly overstated in its importance to playing baseball well. The key muscle group in baseball is the core\u2013abs, lower back, obliques, etc. This muscle group is the most important in generating torque in both hitting and pitching, and is thus the most important in generating bat speed and arm speed, and thus the most important in hitting baseballs hard and far and throwing sick heat (a baseball fast.) I think it's dumb to cite a source for this, but I'll just pick a couple anyway. [6] (get used to seeing [6]; it has beastly information.) [7] Another important part of baseball, actually, especially in pitching, is flexibility. [7] A flexible pitcher is able to create more external rotation of the upper pitching arm ([8]), which results in more velocity. [12] I think it's obvious that more arm mass\u2013bicep and tricep mass, which obviously results from steroid use\u2013would inhibit the pitching arm's external rotation and thus lower a pitcher's speed. The last important muscle group in hitting and pitching is the lower body. Steroids, however, have a much more pronounced effect on the upper body than the lower body, and the upper body is actually quite irrelevant in creating bat speed or arm speed. [6] 2. The increased power numbers in the Steroid Era can be attributed to many other factors. Many people point to the huge numbers put up by Steroid Era players as evidence for PED's effect on statistics. However, there were numerous other factors contributing to a huge rise in offense. [6] One of the most notable changes was the \"juiced\" ball\u2013in 1993, the ball-manufacturing process was changed, and in a 2000 study, it was shown that baseballs in 1995 and 2000 bounced an average of 33% higher than balls from previous eras. [6] [9] Using a \"spliced\" power factor, which accounts for the changes in equipment manufacturing, there is NO \"power spike\" that supposedly occurred during the Steroid Era, as a result of PEDs. [6] I would highly recommend looking at that site, especially the \"spliced\" power factor graph. It's very interesting. 3. Due to the most likely very high numbers of players who were using PEDs during the Steroid Era, any advantage gained by a player was usually cancelled out by an advantage gained by an opposing player. [10] In essence, enough players used PEDs to create an \"even playing field.\" If 95% of the pitchers Barry Bonds faced were also using steroids, then aren't his records still legitimate? How do we know tons of players used steroids? Obviously, we don't have concrete numbers. We do, however, have player's accounts. [10] Some players have talked about the rampant steroid use in the late 1990s and early 2000s made possible by lenient drug policies, and some have suggested the idea of the level playing field. The allegations of \"rampant steroid use\" are what prompted the initial congressional investigations into MLB's PED problems. [11] Conclusion: Steroids in baseball were not a significant enough factor in statistical evidence to influence decisions on which players were the best or worst. The actual benefits players get from steroids is very questionable, considering the number of bad MLB players who have used PEDs without enough of a benefit to even stay in the Major Leagues, and considering the muscle groups utilized in baseball versus those that are enhanced by PED use. The increase in offense during the Steroid Era was influenced by other factors, most notably the \"ball juicing\" of 1993. When adjusting for these power factors that were unrelated to playing ability, there is no apparent jump in offense during the steroid era, again calling into question the effect of steroids in increasing performance. Finally, regardless of the magnitude of a PED's benefit on player performance, any benefit was cancelled or balanced by someone else's benefit. Because most players were using PEDs, their statistics, when compared to each other's, are unchanged. The widespread use of PEDs created a level playing field for MLB players. I'd like to thank in advance whoever takes this argument, and I eagerly await his or her arguments. [1]http://en.wikipedia.org...... [2]http://en.wikipedia.org......

We don't care when football players experience debilitating injuries as early as high school, and even worse, long-lasting injuries at the professional level. An estimated one in three NFL players experience brain trauma of some sort, with life-long effects [1]. We don't care. We still watch football. From that, it can be concluded that the negative health effects of PEDs are irrelevant to the discussion of whether professional athletes should use them. It could even be argued that these negative side effects are preferable if it prevents brain trauma or other terrible injuries from the dangers of a sport itself. And so now, the only points of contention are the facts that it is unfair to athletes that do not use them, and that it is illegal. The first point may be justified easily enough. Sport is already an unfair sport. While you may practice thousands and thousands of hours, a person who's practiced half that but has a natural biological advantage can still win. Thus, it can be argued that PEDs can be used to actually level the playing field, between those who do not have as much of a natural biological advantage and those that do. It is a good point that the risk of losing their entire career may not be worth the above advantages. However, it is the choice of the athletes to take that risk, and not for us to judge them. As well, if enough athletes begin to use PEDs, it will eventually become legal nevertheless, or else the sport industry will die down. [1] http://www.nytimes.com...",

            "premise": "\"Well, at least we acknowledge that the effects exist.\" My statement did not imply that. \"It allows them to have longer workouts with less required effort. This in turn leads to an increase in the strength of any muscle in the human body. A baseball player who uses steroids allows himself to attain physical greatness more easily than a moral player.\" How much longer? How much effort? The added stamina part of PEDs is minor, especially compared to the muscle mass benefits. How does the added stamina work? Does it add stamina when working the muscle groups important to baseball? If so, please provide a source saying that. \"The side effects aren't impacting their performance... therefore quit baseball.\" How do they impact life after baseball, but not impact life during baseball? You pointed out the debilitating effects of steroids. You cannot choose to apply them to one argument but not to another by saying that they only exist after baseball. All of the sources I have cited that mention the harmful side effects of steroids do not differentiate between during a player's career and after the career, because the side effects obviously come during the steroid use\u2013i.e., during the player's career. \"No, they got better. But it was at an expense that they weren't willing to continue to pay.\" See above. If it was at an expense they couldn't pay, then steroids ultimately didn't help them. \"\"Largely\"? That means that increased muscle mass is also located elsewhere, such as the core-abs.\" This, to me, seems like nit-picking. If 99% of the increase is in the not-important-to-baseball upper body, and 1% of the increase is elsewhere, then it's still largely in the upper body. The benefit to muscles important in baseball is insignificant. Second, even if it is located elsewhere, you cannot definitively single out the core as the elsewhere. There are still many other muscle groups besides those I named which aren't important to baseball which could be benefitted by PEDs, just less so than the upper body. \"Any increase wouldn't appear because of the balanced playing field argument.\" So you agree. Good for me. \"However, I can attack your balanced playing field argument from a different, moral standpoint.\" No, you cannot. Morals are irrelevant in the validity of the statistics when used to compare player performances. \"Letting everybody become famous for illegal statistics makes more people want to use PEDs, which makes the people who originally chose not to use PEDs have to use PEDs in order to keep up, which in turn gives them undesired side effects [1].\" Sorry, but this is irrelevant. Read the resolution, specifically, \"should still be held as legitimate in assessing those players' talent relative to other MLB players.\" We are only discussing the merit of the statistics in assessing performance. Risking health and morality don't pertain to this debate, making all of your arguments about them straw men. \"Again, the side effects do not affect performance. They affect the rest of the player's life.\" Like I said, this is a ridiculous distinction. \"And even if most players use PEDs, we should just throw them out, rather than force the only remaining moral people to turn to the dark side.\" Yep, irrelevant to the statistics. \"They were expecting a significant gain, which doesn't imply a massive gain.\" What? Significant is basically the same thing as massive. This is just semantics. \"Well, that's the only reason they'd take the PEDs.\" No, it's not, and you have not provided any logical explanation why. I said that in such a high level of competition, athletes will do anything to gain any edge, no matter how small. I think this is quite logical. Players have millions of dollars at stake, especially when they are on the cusp of playing in the minor leagues and playing in the Major Leagues. \"However, if a player broke the rules to attain such statistics, then should they really be glorified for it? If you know that a student cheated, should you grade his test as normal, or should you throw it out and give him a zero? They are illegitimate, just as the student's test was illegitimate.\" Glorification is irrelevant to the debate. Your analogy basically ignores all of my arguments. Analogies for my arguments would say that all of the students cheated, and that the student's cheating basically didn't help them, and using your own arguments about the negative effects of steroids, that the student's cheating inadequately prepared him for the types of questions on the tests, and thus actually inhibited his performance. \"Here's an argument against putting PED-using players in the Hall of Fame...\" There's no reason for that moral logic to be extended to the legitimacy of statistics. The argument itself is foolish\u2013there are various magnitudes of \"good.\" A player can be extremely good, HOF caliber, and still wish to get better. Heck, I think almost all athletes want that. It's basically the definition of athletic drive. \"You assume this at the expense of the few MLB players out there who don't use PEDs, who continue to keep up what little integrity there is left in the once-great game of baseball. Harsh.\" Wow, appeal to emotion. These few MLB players are, at this point, outliers. We are only discussing statistics. \"It increases general muscle strength and allows for easier workouts.\" General muscle strength doesn't necessarily help baseball. You haven't even shown that it's general muscle strength. The benefit is concentrated in the upper body. I addressed the workout argument earlier. \"He thinks that the side effects affected their performance. However, that's the only part where the steroids had a positive effect.\" By \"he,\" I meant you. The rest of your statement doesn't make any sense to me, unless you're basically just outright saying that you only think a PED's positive effects affected performance, which seems to clearly show me and the audience that you're just selectively applying your arguments. \"What, the benefit of the doubt? Clarifications above.\" Yep. Thanks. Refutations and straw man labels above. \"Because the word \"legitimate\" appears in the resolution, I think that it's about time we gave it a definition [3]: Legitimate - conforming to recognized principles or accepted rules and standards\" In the world of statistics, this would mean that the statistics are not skewed by factors outside of the player's own natural ability. Also, you did not provide a source for this definition. \"Well, this makes it a no-brainer... The resolution is negated.\" You're completely, completely flying over the point of the debate. The whole reason I started this was to argue that even though they broke the rules, their statistics were legitimate. You're simply saying that the fact that they broke the rules makes their statistics legitimate. You can't just say that. You're supposed to argue that. You have not negated the resolution. Conclusion: Most of my opponent's argument revolve around the morality of using steroids, and morality of retaining these statistics. These arguments are all straw men. Whether or not it is moral to keep the records of those who broke the rules is completely irrelevant to whether or not the records accurately show the players' performances. The only other relevant argument my opponent gave regarded workouts, which I refuted earlier. My opponent's other argument was basically just stating that my resolution was wrong, and unfortunately, he did not support this argument at all, instead focusing on his straw men. Finally, my opponent seemed to actually agree with my level playing field argument, and often supported me when he mentioned the negative effects of steroids, and then tried to selectively apply his arguments about the negative effects of steroids. To conclude the conclusion, I refuted all of my opponents relevant arguments, and the re",

            "premise": "\"If the effects really were minimal, then players wouldn't be using them.\" Non-sequitur. This conclusion does not follow. Many players will use whatever they BELIEVE to help, even if it is minimal. In a cutthroat world such as professional sports, athletes will be doing whatever they can to gain any sort of edge. \"Furthermore, the effects are known [1]:\" You just showed me the effects of using steroids. We are arguing the effect of using steroids on baseball playing ability. I have questioned how much this muscle mass and strength helps baseball players, specifically. \"There's a simple answer here. The poor players decided that they would use PEDs to give themselves an advantage. Plus, the side effects of steroids may lead people to stop using them, which would lead to a decrease in performance, which would put them out of the major leagues.\" Uh... aren't you making my point? If the side effects of steroids eventually resulted in a decrease in performance, then steroids could have actually resulted in a decrease in performance, which means that those statistics should NOT be thrown out due to supposedly being artificially inflated. \"1. They were bad, which made them use PEDs. 2. They eventually quit, and therefore could not stay in the [sic] MLB.\" So they barely got better. That's my point. \"Increased muscle mass helps increase the strength of the core-abs, which would immediately lead to better performance in baseball.\" No\u2013the increased muscle mass is largely located in the \"thorax, neck, shoulders and upper arm.\" [1] \"Obviously, a pitcher would want to stay away from steroids, but a batter would use them.\" I provided an extra argument to show why pitchers specifically shouldn't use steroids\u2013however, this is unrelated to whether or not a batter should use them, and you have not provided any extra argument here why batters should use them. Just pointing that out. \"Yes, but they can also be attributed to steroids.\" You have not shown why. \"The PF thing is interesting, but it does not account for any increase at all in pitching strength.\" I don't know what you're trying to say here. Accounting for the ball change, offense was level\u2013therefore, PED benefit was minimal. The only argument you could be trying to make that seems relevant would be to say that since it doesn't account for pitching strength, if the trend is level, then the pitching strength was balanced would be balanced by the hitting strength. To this, I would say that you have not shown evidence of any supposed increase, and even if there were an increase, it would support my balanced playing field argument. \"Great. Let's just let everybody use steroids. That way, we can have every single MLB player suffer the side effects of steroids [2], which many players would rather not do.\" Straw man. This is completely irrelevant. We are arguing about the validity of statistics. \"According to a source that seems to be biased towards PRO [3], there is always a risk of side effects with PEDs. Why not avoid having to take such a risk? Plus, most players don't use steroids. This puts them at a disadvantage against the steroid-abusing players.\" If by biased, you mean it agrees with me, then yeah. I don't see why that's important though, especially when the things I cite are based in fact. You have not at all qualified the claim that \"most players don't use steroids.\" You have not shown why that puts them at a disadvantage\u2013in fact, you seem to have argued that it would put them at an advantage, due to the numerous side effects. \"2. These players believed that steroids in baseball were a significant enough factor in statistical evidence to influence decisions on which players were the best or worst. (Re-wording of 1)\" This is not a rewording. You are operating under the assumption that players who used steroids expected massive gain, when it is clear that many athletes would do anything to gain any sort of edge, no matter how small. \"So, basically, they think that the PEDs have a significant effect on their stats. Well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Let's punish them for what they believe to be true. They took that risk when they took the PEDs. It's really only fair.\" No, they do not necessarily expect a significant effect. You have not shown that. Your benefit of the doubt argument is unreasonable. Statistics are meant to accurately show who played well and who did not. We who use statistics for this purpose are not concerned with the morality of throwing out certain stats just to punish players, because that distorts the truth, that distorts what actually happened. \"A \"level playing field\" in which the cheaters always win isn't a level playing field at all.\" PED users don't always win because basically everyone's a PED user. That's the point. In conclusion: My opponent has not really provided evidence for why a PED user would necessarily benefit in terms of his baseball skills. Many of his arguments seem to prove my point, especially the ones about the negative effects of steroids\u2013in these, he seems to show that the statistics of PED users were adversely affected, which would make it absolutely absurd to throw them out due to artificial inflation. Some of his other arguments don't really seem to make much sense, and hopefully he'll expand on them in the next round. Overall, however, my opponent does not seem to have refuted any of my arguments, relying mainly on non-sequiturs or straw men. I eagerly await my opponent's response. Vote PRO.

            "premise": "Thank you for setting up this debate, I accept to argue that video games are not sports, that eSports are seperate from physical sports.Your definition of sport leaves out the bit about physical exertion that is prevalent in just about every online definition I've ever read, from Google to Merriam Webster to Dictionary.com. The definition of the noun \"sport\" according to Dictionary.com is:\"an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of acompetitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.\"The key word here is, of course, athletic. Video games are not an athletic activity, no matter how quickly you can move your fingers. You said in your argument that professional gamers are athletes but not physical athletes, and if we take a look at the definition of \"athlete\": Merriam Webster:\"a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina\" Dictionary.com:\"a person trained or gifted in exercises or contests involving physicalagility, stamina, or strength;a participant in a sport, exercise, or game requiring physical skill.\"Prize pools are impressive in eSports, but this does not contribute to the argument that eSports should be considered physical sports, I don't see how this helps your argument. Sports are competitions requiring physical exertion, and in the definition of \"sport\" listed above salary is not mentioned. How much professional gamers are paid has no bearing on whether or not video games are sports. eSports do appear on sports channels and sports news, but it is seperated from all of the other sports and addressed as \"eSports\". ESPN, the world's leading sports news source, has a section for eSports, but it is addressed just as eSports (http://www.espn.com...). This is because eSports are a subcategory of sports, they aren't the same thing, but they have a very similar competitive format.You brought up chess, saying that it is widely regarded as a sport. This is true, but there are good reasons for this. Chess requires peak mental condition, which requires one to also be in peak physical condition. To quote London Chess Conference: \"Peak mental condition requires being in good physical condition. Players need to concentrate totally for up to seven hours. As the stress and tension builds up, blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates all increase. Contenders for the world championships have nutritionists and fitness coaches.\"There are numerous other reasons chess is considered a sport on that website, for example chess has been recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Comittee since 2000.In conclusion, video games are not sports, they are eSports. This is a subcategory, not the same thing, different in ways that prohibit eSports from being sports. I feel like I should clarify that I have no problem with eSports, I love eSports. I follow CoD eSports (since it's the game I discovered eSports on) and right now I'm trying to get into CS:GO and Halo's professional scenes.Sources:http://www.dictionary.com...http://www.merriam-webster.com...http://www.dictionary.com...http://londonchessconference.com...",

            "conclusion": "Statistics, Performance Enhancing Drugs, and Major League Baseball.",
            "premise": "\"Many players will use whatever they BELIEVE to help, even if it is minimal.\" Well, at least we acknowledge that the effects exist. \"I have questioned how much this muscle mass and strength helps baseball players, specifically.\" It allows them to have longer workouts with less required effort. This in turn leads to an increase in the strength of any muscle in the human body. A baseball player who uses steroids allows himself to attain physical greatness more easily than a moral player. \"If the side effects of steroids eventually resulted in a decrease in performance...\" The side effects aren't impacting their performance. The side effects just impact the rest of their life. Steroids lead to a better MLB career, but it makes the rest of life worse. Therefore, it still is an increase in performance, but players eventually decide that it isn't worth it, so they quit steroids, and therefore quit baseball. \"So they barely got better. That's my point.\" No, they got better. But it was at an expense that they weren't willing to continue to pay. \"No\u2013the increased muscle mass is largely located in the 'thorax, neck, shoulders and upper arm.'\" \"Largely\"? That means that increased muscle mass is also located elsewhere, such as the core-abs. \"...you have not provided any extra argument here why batters should use them.\" They can use them to strengthen their core-abs, and they can use them to have easier workouts. \"You have not shown why.\" Clarification above. \"I don't know what you're trying to say here....\" I'm restating your \"level playing field\" hypothesis. \"To this, I would say that you have not shown evidence of any supposed increase, and even if there were an increase, it would support my balanced playing field argument.\" Any increase wouldn't appear because of the balanced playing field argument. However, I can attack your balanced playing field argument from a different, moral standpoint. \"Straw man. This is completely irrelevant. We are arguing about the validity of statistics.\" Letting everybody become famous for illegal statistics makes more people want to use PEDs, which makes the people who originally chose not to use PEDs have to use PEDs in order to keep up, which in turn gives them undesired side effects [1]. \"If we condone some players taking steroids, that puts pressure on other players to do the same if they want to be competitive. No one should have to risk his health in that way to play in MLB.\" \"You have not shown why that puts them at a disadvantage\u2013in fact, you seem to have argued that it would put them at an advantage, due to the numerous side effects.\" Again, the side effects do not affect performance. They affect the rest of the player's life. And even if most players use PEDs, we should just throw them out, rather than force the only remaining moral people to turn to the dark side. \"This is not a rewording. You are operating under the assumption that players who used steroids expected massive gain, when it is clear that many athletes would do anything to gain any sort of edge, no matter how small.\" They were expecting a significant gain, which doesn't imply a massive gain. \"No, they do not necessarily expect a significant effect. You have not shown that.\" Well, that's the only reason they'd take the PEDs. \"Statistics are meant to accurately show who played well and who did not. We who use statistics for this purpose are not concerned with the morality of throwing out certain stats just to punish players, because that distorts the truth, that distorts what actually happened.\" However, if a player broke the rules to attain such statistics, then should they really be glorified for it? If you know that a student cheated, should you grade his test as normal, or should you throw it out and give him a zero? They are illegitimate, just as the student's test was illegitimate. Here's an argument against putting PED-using players in the Hall of Fame, which can be extended to allowing their statistics to be considered legitimate [2]: \"It is because if they were that good, they would not have had to cheat and if they could have made it into the Hall of Fame without cheating, then they really blew it, but to congratulate these players for cheating is preposterous.\" \"PED users don't always win because basically everyone's a PED user. That's the point.\" You assume this at the expense of the few MLB players out there who don't use PEDs, who continue to keep up what little integrity there is left in the once-great game of baseball. Harsh. \"My opponent has not really provided evidence for why a PED user would necessarily benefit in terms of his baseball skills.\" It increases general muscle strength and allows for easier workouts. \"Many of his arguments seem to prove my point, especially the ones about the negative effects of steroids\u2013in these, he seems to show that the statistics of PED users were adversely affected, which would make it absolutely absurd to throw them out due to artificial inflation.\" He thinks that the side effects affected their performance. However, that's the only part where the steroids had a positive effect. \"Some of his other arguments don't really seem to make much sense, and hopefully he'll expand on them in the next round.\" What, the benefit of the doubt? Clarifications above. Because the word \"legitimate\" appears in the resolution, I think that it's about time we gave it a definition [3]: Legitimate - conforming to recognized principles or accepted rules and standards Well, this makes it a no-brainer. The PED users did not conform to the accepted anti-PED rules. Thus, they were illegitimate, and their statistics are therefore illegitimate. The resolution is negated. With all of that aside, I eagerly await my opponent's response, as well. Vote CON. 1. http://www.sports-central.org... 2. http://bleacherreport.com...",

            "conclusion": "Transwomen Should Be Eligible to Play Sports in the Women's League",
            "premise": "Apparently, In round one, Autocorrect mistook my commas for periods and capitalized the first letter of every word following them. I'm sorry to anyone who found this glitch distracting. If it happens again, Please forgive me, As it is beyond my control. To my opponent, That was actually a well thought out argument. No one could argue with that, The fact that a lot of thought went into it. I'm not going to argue with you for the sake of arguing with you. I'll give credit where credit is due and give you credit for not sounding as absurd as I would imagine someone on your side of the debate to. Know that your argument is not going in one ear and out the other; I'm listening. If you can prove me wrong, By all means, Please do. I want to take this matter in the right direction, Whether that's in my direction or not. You did your research, Which I appreciate, And you provided me with information of which I didn't have prior, So shame on me and more power to you. While you've yet to convince me of your argument, You've further explained it, And I'll admit, I understand it a little better. Now that I know what your problem is, Allow me to assure you that it doesn't have to be a problem. \"The statistic we should be looking at is that Male athletes tend to outperform female athletes by a consistent 10% in most categories. \"1. While most of the time, One cisfemale athlete is as good as the next, Every now and then, Few will be 10% better than the rest, And transwomen would simply be among those few; if we're allowing their superiority, I don't see why we can't allow that of a transwoman's. \"That means trans women will on average be 10% superior to females. \"1. It shouldn't be a matter of whether transwomen are \"superior\" to ciswomen but whether transwomen are women themselves. If transwomen are women, Then they should be allowed to compete in the women's league by default. Even if transwomen are biologically 10% superior, Some cismen are genetically 10% superior to other cismen, But because they're still men, They're still eligible to compete in the men's league, Despite their genetic superiority, Just as transwomen should still be eligible to compete in the women's league, If they're still women, Which you admitted they are. It's women verses women, And if a transwoman is a woman, Then she's a women, Point blank; even if they win game after game, Athletes are allowed to have winning streaks. So long as the transwomen aren't performing at a level that ciswomen are medically advised not to keep up with, Their capabilities should only push ciswomen to work harder. \"Females can win against any male in many cases. However, This doesn't mean the playing field is even. \"1. The playing ground isn't even, Nor is it supposed to be. Advantages are what differentiate the winner from the runner-ups. If no one had any advantages, There'd be no competition; everyone would run at the same speed and finish the race at the same time. \"This is the whole reason we have separated sports based on biological sex. Because females would nearly all be eliminated from competition if they were forced to compete with the more than. 1% of males that have this advantage over them. \"1. We separate males from females because the average cisman is significantly stronger than the average ciswoman, But even if a ciswoman proved herself to be as strong as the average cisman in the men's league, We would have her remain in the women's league regardless, Simply because she's a woman, Just as we should place transwomen in the women's league, Simply because they're women, Also. 2. Transwomen would not outnumber ciswoman; there's not that many of them in general, Let alone pursuing the sports industry. This is why transwomen can't compete among themselves; the competition would be scarce. If transwomen are to populate and outnumber ciswomen over time, Then I agree that they could start their own league and compete among themselves, But until then, I see nothing wrong with sharing. 3. Just as biological sex contributes to one's performance, So does race. Because African-American men have been said to have higher bone mass density, They're thought to accumulate greater muscle mass. Since 77% of NBA players (according to ESPN) are African-American, It could be said that they're dominating the men's basketball league in the same way you fear transwomen will dominate the women's league, Meaning that, Unless you're racist and think we need to exclude African-American men, You're contradicting yourself in saying we need to exclude transwomen. \"The types of transwomen who this actually effects will probably be more athletic than other transwomen on average. \"1. While average transwomen are stronger than average ciswomen, They're not inherently stronger than athletic ciswomen, Meaning that if a transwomen is dominating the women's league, It's because of her athleticism, Rather than her biological disposition, Which wouldn't stand a chance against the physicality of a pro athlete, Even if a ciswoman. \"Biological sex and genes make 100% of the difference between two athletes who train optimally. \"1. If both (biological sex and genes) make 100% of a difference, Then disqualifying one and not the other is a contradiction of which can only be rationalized by either accepting both or accepting neither. 2. First, You say that no one should have biological/genetic advantages, And then you say, Because everyone is training optimally, That that's all anyone has to rely on, Which is another way of saying no one should have the only thing anyone has. \"Your argument, To prove your point, Has to be for the annihilation of sex-based sports. \"1. Your argument, To prove your point, Has to be for the annihilation of diversity in sports. 2. You can't allow certain types of women to complete in the women's league without being prejudice against those of whom you're excluding. \"Do we allow performance enhancing drugs or not? \"1. No, Because people would overdose trying to one-up each other. \"Drugs are prohibited largely. \"1. More so because athletes would overdose on them than because it'd give them an unfair advantage. Even pro wrestlers in the sports entertainment industry aren't allowed to take drugs, And drugs wouldn't change their performance because it's predetermined, But because they're dangerous, They're prohibited. 2. Water or any form of hydration improves an athlete's performance more than anything, But because everyone has access to fluid, We don't see it as being an advantage, But if drugs were safe, Everyone would have access to them, As well, And then we wouldn't see them as being an advantage, Either. \"Currently in most leagues we try to be 'fair. ' The definition of fair in this case is that everyone competes with what their body naturally does, \"1. If this makes sense to you, Then, By your logic, Having transwomen compete in the women's league is only fair, Because they're women (as you agreed) who are simply competing 'with what their body naturally does. '\"When it comes to 'fair' sports, Transwomen are allowed to control their levels of testosterone and estrogen. Biological females are not. \"1. They're only allowed to lessen their level of testosterone. \"This comes into play even more when transmen are concerned. They are literally using performing enhancing drugs. \"1. They're using prescribed drugs? This is like accusing an athlete with asthma of cheating for opening their airways and allowing oxygen to flow freely in and out of the lungs with the use of an inhaler. If they're deprived of oxygen, We have to provide them with some, Just as we have to provide testosterone to transmen because they're deprived of that. \"Why do you think there is such a large disparity in transwomen victories and transmen victories? \"1. I'm not arguing whether transwomen have an advantage but whether it's okay that they have an advantage, And according to your definition of \"fair, \" it should be. There's my second argument. Here's to round two.",

            "premise": "\"Diet, exercise, and vitamin supplements also can increase muscle mass and bone density why aren't these an \"UNFAIR\" advantage. Further steroid use has been shown to offer enormous benefit, when taken correctly, in regard to performance and physical/mental health to the user. There are risks to taking steroids, however there are also risk when exercising or taking other beneficial drugs or undergoing cosmetic surgery.\" If you consider Diet, and exercise those you are working for, yes if you get better from them it is fair because you worked hard to get that way. Should a person who does 200 pushups a day and gets super buff, just be outdone by a person who take steroids? Also vitamin supplements don't do 1/8 as much as steroids do to the players, and day by day more are becoming illegal. \"It is only \"cheating\" if players had agreed not to participate or been required not to participate in steroid use. If they were allowed then it is no longer \"cheating\" because it is fairly playing by the rules, which also negates the ethics of the matter. Diet, exercise, vitamins/supplements, and proper health care are all things that can give an athlete advantage. What is the defining difference between steroids and these? Should vitamins/supplements and proper health care be considered Cheating or Unethical because another athlete feels compelled to do the same to improve his/her performance?\" Which they have been........It is against the law to participate in sterood use. Which sport allows steroid use? All the other things are tethical because those you work for as I stated above, while steroids its a free ride and all you do is take them and become the best player. Conclusion: Steroids should banned in all sports because they offer unfair advantage to a player who takes them. Steroids do nothing but tempt players to take them. If they were not around sports would be a lot more honest and fairer in competition. Steriods should be banned in all sports",

They have a negative effect on long-term health. Athletes would be proned to use those substances to relieve many stressors like pressure to perform, Physical pain, Injuries, And retirement for the sport. Growth hormone are banned by the WADA because it increases muscle mass and decrease adipose tissue. Athletes use those because of their anabolic effect on muscles. According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Half of all recently surveyed athletes admitted they would be willing to take a drug even if it would kill them eventually. They would only focus or care about winning events and makes athletes feeling coerced to use those drugs in order to compete or win. Just because on average the athletes want to use these drugs or do use those drugs does not make it okay. For example (hypothetical) if on average or majority of people support slavery that does not make it okay or provide any proof of it \"goodness. \" The WADA, USADA, And I. O. C. All work collaboratively in sharing information to keep an eye on doping agents, Retains ownership of blood and urine samples, And work together efficiently to enhance testing effectiveness. Abusing drug to increase athletic abilities is definitely an unfair advantage. Not to mention the \"blood doping\" they use, It increases the risk for heart disease, Stroke, And blood clot in the brain or lungs because it boosts the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. The other PEDs, Increase the risk for high blood pressure, An enlarged heart, Heart attack, Stroke, Irregular heart rate, High blood temperature, And paranoia. Moreover on C2: [USADA] --- Anabolic-steroids effects on health; - (physiological) liver damage, Premature closure of the growth centers of long bones (adolescents) which result in stunted growth, And disruption of puberty. - (psychological) increased aggressiveness and sexual desire. Sometimes resulting in abnormal sexual or criminal behavior. - (males) breast tissue development, Shrinking of the testicles, Impotence, And reducing sperm production. - (females) deep voice, Cessation of breast development, Growth of hair on face etc, Abnormal menstrual cycles. --- HGH (human growth hormones) - (physiological) hypertension, Blood cancers/leukemia, Anemia, Heart attacks, Thyroid problems, Severe headaches, Loss of vision, High blood pressure and heart failure, Tumors and diabetes. --- Stimulants - (physiological) insomnia, Anxiety, Dependence and addiction, Weight loss, Dehydration, Tremors, Increased heart rate and blood pressure, And increased risk of stroke and heart attack. --- Blood doping - (physiological) increased stress on the heart, Blood clotting, And stroke. Responding to C2: Yes the technology is very expensive and doesn't produce the same effects for performance as drugs. Again that does not justify or prove that it's healthy or promotes a \"good\" perception on athletes competing. You mostly use quotes, I don't really see how this one was an actual argument.",
