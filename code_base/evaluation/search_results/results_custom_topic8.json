            "premise": "Abortion should be legal. Within this four-word phrase, we already stumble upon ambiguity. When we describe abortion as \"legal,\" do we attach any qualification? My opponent concedes we should. For instance, in cases in which the mother's health is affected by the child. I might argue that this concession already cedes the entire debate: if any instance of abortion can be considered appropriate then abortion should be considered legal. However, I will attempt a more thorough address of the Instigator's points. The instigator first claims that abortion should be illegal because abortion is equivalent to killing living humans. A complicated subject is difficult to reduce to such concise terms. Therefore, I ask of the instigator: \"What is a human?\" \"What makes it living?\" \"Should we avoid ending life in and of itself?\" It is my opinion that some address need be made of the the above queries before a proper debate can be entered. -A first and unedited draft by the Agonist",

But does the government have the right to control what a girl does to her own body? Does the government have jurisdiction over any person's own body and what happens to it? I do not believe it does. By controlling the circumstances under which a woman can have an abortion the government is essentially controlling the rest of her life for her. The descion to get an abortion can effect her education, her chance to be employed, and even her relationship with other people in her life. I do not believe that a government body (especially one that is overwhelmingly masculine) has any right to decide a woman's life for her.",

            "premise": "OK, I thank my opponent for taking this losing battle. And placing coherence points. As I have had this debate before hand and would like my points to be known. (https://www. Debate. Org/debates/Should-late-term-abortions-be-legal/1/) Here you can see the truth and facts that can't be ignored. (1) Should Abortions be legal? This is a very simple question. It is not difficult to answer at all. And you did not even answer if it should or should not be. This type of fence riding is problematic, As I am providing truth and facts and the definite answer. (2) My side is the pros of Abortion, It does not matter if it is legal in some states or not. As it is happening in these states anyway, Abortion is a million dollar industry and is still growing. With abortions costing women about $400 bucks a pop. (That is the price of a new PlayStation) with the baby parts being taken and sold to many company's around the world for live saving research and flavor enhancement of soft drinks from Pepsi. (3) At no point did I bring up Religion. Or the moral argument. At no point will baby murder ever be moral. Even pro-abortion people don't claim baby murder to be moral. There is also money to be made from abortions. The Government allows abortion and the government is always right about everything. Just ask Obama! (4) Who said anything about consent? What does sex and rape have anything to do with all of the money that can be made from killing baby's for medical research? These women consent to paying $400 bucks a pop for up to 15 abortions in their lifetime! That is some serious cash! Basic math points out that is a estimated $6000 dollars from every abortion seeker in the US. (The data on abortions displayed on the Worldometers' counter is based on the latest statistics on worldwide abortions published by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO, Every year in the world there are an estimated 40-50 million abortions. This corresponds to approximately 125, 000 abortions per day. ) (5) Rape? When did I bring this up? But, It should be noted. That many teen aged girl get abortions after being raped by a family member. http://afterabortion. Org/rape. Html \"How can you deny an abortion to a twelve-year-old girl who is the victim of incest? \" Would that webfoot child not be better off murdered and sold to Pepsi? Clearly the Government profiteers have a solution for everything! Allowing more sex with more women. You should be thanking the government officials we have. (6) Conditions? Women sign a waver that has terms and conditions at the time of the abortion. If you don't want to have a girl in China, Murder is a common choice that many parents give. Other choices could include having the girl child and then selling it into Human trafficking. Many people forget. Human trafficking is not just people who are alive. But, People who are dead or body parts for medical research. (7) The pro abortion angle, Is clearly the better choice chosen by many in the governments around the world. And by the corporations that make millions from the practice. Also, Con did not even talk about how abortions started as part of a eugenics program to reduce the black and Hispanic population. Dodging debate topics is not having a well though out opinion. https://www. Youtube. Com/watch? V=fxIgq9D2or4https://www. Youtube. Com/watch? V=-yBnIvNq-nI",

If the government bans abortion then they would be forcing a woman to have a child. If a pregnant woman doesn't have an abortion then she is going to have a child. So if the government takes away that right then pregnant women will have no choice but to have a child. Adoption is a option that is not used often after a woman gives birth to a child. Most women don't want to put their child up for adoption. If the government bans abortion then some women will have an unsafe abortion. More women will have an unsafe abortion if abortion is illegal. Every year approximately 78,000 women die from unsafe abortion. If abortion is legal then less unsafe abortions will occur. Abortion is a safe medical procedure. 88% of women who have an abortion do so in their first trimester. Medical abortions have less than 0.5% risk of serious complications and do not affect a woman's health or future ability to become pregnant or give birth. The government should make sure that late term abortion is safe. The fetus is in the woman's body so therefore the government should not control their bodies. Banning abortion is bad for women and is anti-women's rights.",

            "conclusion": "Abortion should be legal",
            "premise": "== Intro ==In this debate, I'll defend abortion being legal for some period in the pregnancy. This precludes Con from making arguments relating to abortion being immoral after a certain point in the pregnancy. The BoP in this debate is shared, both because of a lack of a clear status quo (though in most countries, abortion is legal) and because this is a normative resolution.Con needs to argue that abortion should be illegal *throughout* the pregnancy, with the two exceptions listed in R1. Note that Con has to defend bans on abortion even in cases where it is required for good mental health of pregnant individuals, and in cases where, for instance, contraception fails or there's fetal impairment. I also have fiat over measures to make abortion more safe, accessible, and cheap, and I support measures to ensure that.== My case ==I'm going to advance three claims: (1) that pregnant individuals have a right to abortion, (2) that allowing abortion prevents dangerous back-alley abortions, and (3) that legalizing abortion reduces the numbers of unwanted children in society, which is a benefit. Each of these three contentions affirms the resolution independently; if I win even one of them, vote Pro. (C1) Pregnant individuals have a right to abortionA. AutonomyBans on abortion prevent pregnant individuals from exercising a choice in terms of what they are allowed to do with their bodies. Governments ought not prevent people from exercising choices unless there is direct harm to others. As John Stuart Mill explains, \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against [their] will, is to prevent harm to others.\" [1] If the state bans abortion, it prevents people from exercising free will. Why should states follow this standard of respecting free choice? There's three reasons for this: (1) The state derives its legitimacy from the consent of the governed. The harm principle acts as a mechanism to ensure that the state is protecting the will of its people. (2) The harm principle is the best utilitarian goal, because each individual is best placed to decide their own interests and to weigh their own pleasure and pain. Given that calculations of pleasure and pain are subjective, when these are felt by the same person, that person should be able to make these decisions. (3) Empirical evidence suggests that states with more political and social freedoms also have greater rates of human development. [2]Now, Con might argue that abortion harms the fetus, and is therefore immoral. However, the fetus isn't conscious until 24 weeks of pregnancy. Consciousness only arises between the 25th and 30th week of pregnancy. [3] [4] Given that the fetus is not a conscious person, killing a fetus is akin to killing a plant -- a living being which cannot feel. B. Self-defensePregnant individuals have a right to self-defense. People who are denied abortions face immense psychological harm. According to a University of San Francisco study, \"women are much more emotionally stressed if they are denied an abortion initially than if they received one upon request.\" [5] A 2013 study by Roca, et al. concludes that \"[c]ompared with women who obtained a near-limit abortion, those denied abortion felt more regret and anger, and less relief and happiness.\" [6]This offers an independent reason to allow abortion. First, it means there's significant harm to people who are denied abortions. The state has an interest in preventing psychological harm to its citizens. Therefore, abortion should be legal. Second, it means people should have a right of self-defense, against psychological harm. If Con concedes that abortion should be legal to protect the lives of pregnant persons, then they concede that there's a balancing of rights here. Given that the fetus cannot feel mental states, the right of people to escape psychological harm and exercise their autonomy outweighs. Conclusion: Given that the fetus is a non-conscious entity dependent on the parent for survival, banning abortion is an unjust restriction on the free will of individuals to control their bodies and to defend themselves against psychological harm.(C2) Allowing abortion prevents back-alley abortionsA. Bans on abortion cause people to turn to harmful back-alley abortionsThe alternative to legal abortion in licensed clinics is back-alley abortions. There's two warrants for this. First, on an analytical level, people continue to want abortions even when it's illegal. They're often in desperate positions which prevent them from having kids or are afraid of the emotional harm which will result. They also often don't have access to adoption, and don't want to carry the fetus to term. This means they're likely to turn to illegal means of abortion when they don't have access to safe, legal abortion.Second, there's empirical evidence that proves this claim. Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times explains, \"A comprehensive global study of abortion has concluded that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not, suggesting that outlawing the procedure does little to deter women seeking it. Moreover, the researchers found that abortion was safe in countries where it was legal, but dangerous in countries where it was outlawed and performed clandestinely.\" [7] Indeed, back-alley abortion accounts for 13% of deaths due to pregnancy. [7] At least 22,800 women die each year from complications of unsafe abortion. [8] The reason these back-alley abortions are harmful is the lack of regulation and the lack of clinics to approach. Illegal clinics and pregnant individuals themselves (when self-aborting) tend to use brutal methods such as beating the abdomen hard, piercing the amniotic sac with a sharp object, and using poisons. [9] [10]B. Legal abortion reduces back-alley abortion ratesThere's two pieces of analytical justification for this. One, these unregulated clinics (as well as self-abortion) are illegal, meaning people are disincentivized from pursuing them, when there's access to legal clinics. Two, people recognize that a legal, regulated clinic is much safer. Together, this means that the existence of legal clinics takes down the business of unregulated abortion, due to a lack of demand.This is also empirically true. For instance, in South Africa, after abortion was legalized, abortion-related maternal mortalities reduced by ninety-one percent. [11] This means that, in Con's world, abortion continues, and is far more dangerous. Vote Pro because legal abortion saves the lives of individuals. (C3) Bans on abortion lead to more unwanted childrenBanning abortion means there's a large number of unwanted children, insofar as some people still choose to not break the law and don't engage in abortion. Adoption isn't enough to give homes and families to these children. Randie Bencannan of Rewire explains, \"Recent statistics show that approximately 14,000 newborns are adopted annually in the United States through voluntary placements, a number that has remained flat for about 20 years. Meanwhile, in 2011, 1.06 million abortions were performed -- the lowest number in decades.\" [12] These children experience massive challenges. In some cases, they're sent to a broken foster care system. Children in foster care are four times more likely to experience sexual abuse than other children. [13] Moreover, as Pam Fessler of the National Public Radio notes, \"many former foster kids have a tough time out on their own. When they age out of the system, they're more likely than their peers to end up in jail, homeless or pregnant. They're also less likely to have a job or go to college.\" [14] In other cases, they're retained by their families. In these cases, the children face significant problems. (1) They're more likely than other kids to die at an early age. According to one 2016 study in the US, \"[S]tates with restrictive abortion policies increase IMR for black women by 2.214 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.\" [15] Another study in Finland found that children born due to denied abortions had an infant mortality rate of 24 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. [16] (2) They face economic and psychological disadvantages even in the long term. They perform worse in school, are more likely to face mental illnesses, and more likely to be poor. [16] (3) This hurts economic productivity. For instance, in Romania, \"children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults . . . [and] crowding in schools, due to the large increase in fertility immediately following the abortion ban, lowered educational achievements of the cohorts affected.\" [17] There's even some evidence that legalizing abortion reduces crime rates, which, even if questionable, is disconcerting. [18]More unwanted children hurts the parents. Parents who're denied abortions are more likely to face psychological problems, have worse relationships, and are twice as likely to face intimate partner violence. [19] Moreover, women who are denied the ability to abort are also adversely affected in terms of economic productivity. Indeed, \"[w]omen who were denied an abortion are three times more likely to be unemployed than women who were able to access one.\" [20] People denied abortion are also four times more likely to be pushed below the poverty line. [21] Conclusion: Banning abortion causes parents to have unwanted children without access to adoption, significantly harming the future prospects of these children, throwing these parents into poverty and unemployment, and causing significant negative impacts to society.For all the above reasons, vote Pro.Sources: http://www.debate.org...",

            "premise": "Thank you Con. I have sucessfully showed that, letting a women abort her child is reasonable, and yet a propper decision because she wished to do so. It *is* considered morally right, because it is not illegal. she has the freedom to do so. Con then states \"interaction between the State and the person who may have the abortion\" so, is aborting a baby was such a crime, they would make it illegal right? They would make it illegal becuase it is inhumane to the child. Yet, they allow the women to have the right to abortions. They shall not deprive a women of her rights, or make her feel guilty for her actions and choices. The goverment allows abortions, because it is just. Con the gose on to claim that we arent debating \"the legality of abortion, rather the action itself.\" Yet, is abourtions were un-just wouldn't they make abortions illegal. Making it legal proves that it *is* just. Con then says \"This debate is not about whether people should be \"denied\" abortion, rather about the action itself. Likewise this debate is not about the governments involvement. It is simply about whether Abortion is Just.\" Again, the same rule applys. The goverment guarentees the well-being and saftey of individuals. The definition of Just is \"agreeing with what is considered morally right or good\" Basically, the goverment allows abortions because it is moraly right, and good. Individuals have freedom to choose what they wish. Conlusion: * Note that not mande a new argument in this round. He didn't follow the debate structure. He did not provide any arguments asy to *why* aboirtion is un-just. Instead, he corrected my argument. To be fair to him, I will not post a new argument, instead I extend.",

There may be more after the response. A. Banning abortion in all cases is bad. 1. Banning abortion in all cases is ridiculous, there are several cases in which not allowing an abortion would be unethical and unhealthy. 2. Women whose health is put at risk by child birth should be allowed an abortion. 3. Women who have been raped should be allowed an abortion, it would be immoral to force her to keep a symbol of her rape for her whole life. B. Exceptions should be made at least in the cases above. C. If you are to accept this, pragmatism forces us to make abortion legal. 1. Any women can claim that childbirth will hurt her. This can all be easily forged with some doctor's writing, ultimately, that means that anyone can claim for an abortion. 2. Rape must be proven in court. It takes more than 9 months for someone to be proven guilty without a doubt, and thus, we are forced to grant an abortion before a conviction. Also, a women could claim to have been raped and not have proof, so ultimately, she must also be granted an abortion. Anyone could claim rape, and this means that we would be having people lie for the sake of having an abortion. Ultimately, this is another reason to legalize abortion. D. Abortions will happen anyway 1. Abortions will not be stopped, only driven underground. 2. It's better for the country for abortions to be done legally and safely than in an ally with a cloth-hanger. E. Vote AFF, it would be a wicked thing to deny abortion in all cases, and these exceptions force us to allow abortion in all cases.",

            "premise": "Access to an abortion should be legal for these reasons. First, access to abortion is a part of American history. It wasn't until the 1900's that abortion was illegal in every state, and even then it was still permissible in certain circumstances. Thus women have had access to legal abortions longer than they have been barred from it. Second, abortion should be legal because it safeguards women. Making abortion illegal won't prevent abortion it will prevent safe abortions-- to the risk of women. The truth is that women facing poverty, abuse, or simple lack of preparation will seek abortions if they want them. Outlawing abortion would result in a return to back ally treatments, rusty coathangers, and harm to the most at risk and in need women. Finally, abortion should be legal because women have a right to self-determinism. By outlawing abortion we are saying that women are subject men's procreative whim. It supposes that women should be in bondage until they deliver a man's offspring. In essence, we would be arguing that woman lose their agency and autonomy, their very humanity when they become pregnant-- be it through rape, incest, abuse etc.",

            "discussionTitle": "Abortion should be legal",
            "conclusion": "Abortion should be legal",
            "premise": "1. Abortion is about allowing woman the right to make choices about when they want to have children in relation to their age, financial stability & relationship stability. It is the not the place of government to legislate against woman's choices. 2. Raising a child is not an easy task & requires social & emotional commitment coupled with financial resources. As such if a person feels they are not ready for a child, it means the pregnancy is unwanted & resultant allowing a fetus to grow into a child is worse than abortion since the resultant child will grow in a non conducive & destructive environment without the love, care & stability that a child needs. 3. The argument against abortion is a moral argument which is subject to personal interpretation so should not be legislated against. Those see it morally allowable to do abortion should be provided with the means to do so & those who don't believe in abortion should have the choice not to have an abortion 4. A fetus is not legally or scientifically a person or human being so abortion cannot be equated to murder or taking a life since the fetus is not a person nor alive. 5. A fetus is like a brain dead person with no self awareness or consciousness so it is actually dead. 6. Prohibiting abortions doesn't stop abortions, women would simply seek abortions via illegal means which are unsafe & illegal, so it is better to provide woman with safe & legal ways to do an abortion. 7. Abortion prevent unwanted & unplanned pregnancies which prevents child neglect since the mother does not want to have children at that moment in time. 8. Making abortion illegal is also a class struggle since the rich can always go to other places where it is legal & have an abortion whilst the poor cannot do this, but have to resort to unsafe abortions which can lead to their death. 9. Making abortion illegal is more or less compulsory pregnancy which contradicts the quest & fight for freedom. 10. Making abortion illegal will increase teenage pregnancy (children having children). This usually leads to illegal abortions which can lead to death or permanent health defects, poverty, joblessness, hopelessness, and dependency. 11. A woman's right to choose abortion is a \"fundamental right\" 12. Personhood begins at birth, not at conception. Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy (fetus), not a baby. Personhood at conception is not a proven biological fact. Fetuses are incapable of feeling pain when an abortion is performed. 13. Access to legal, professionally-performed abortions reduces injury and death caused by unsafe, illegal abortions. 14. The anti-abortion position is usually based on religious beliefs and threatens the vital separation of church and state. Religious ideology should not be a foundation for law. 15. Modern abortion procedures are safe. The risk of a woman\"s death from abortion is less than one in 100,000, whereas the risk of a woman dying from giving birth is 13.3 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies. 16. Access to abortion is necessary because contraceptives are not always readily available. Women need a doctor's prescription to obtain many birth control methods, such as the pill, the patch, the shot, and the diaphragm. 17. Abortion gives couples the option to choose not to bring babies with severe and life-threatening medical conditions to full term. 18. Many women who choose abortion don't have the financial resources to support a child. 19. Motherhood must never be a punishment for having sexual intercourse. 20. A baby should not come into the world unwanted. 49% of all pregnancies among American women are unintended. Having a child is an important lifelong decision that requires consideration, preparation, and planning. 21. Abortion reduces crime. Teenage girls, unmarried women, and poor women are more likely to have unintended pregnancies, and since unwanted babies are often raised in poverty, their chances of leading criminal lives in adulthood are increased. 22. Do we have the right to force the mother to keep the baby solely because she consented to participate in these sexual activities? Do we have the right to take away another\"s right as we continue to fight for other rights? Why do we take away the rights of a woman because she has the potential to have a baby? 23. We get right to life, liberty & pursuit of happiness when we are born. he fetus does not have these rights until it is born. So abortion is not murder & abortion does not go against the rights of a fetus since it does not have any until born. 24. Every woman has the right to do whatever they want with their body aka Bodily Autonomy. This is one of the reasons why it is illegal to take organs from the deceased that have not signed off permission. If we continue this right after life, why do we strip it from a pregnant woman? Why would you grant a dead person a right that you wouldn\"t give to someone that is alive. 25. If someone needs something donated that you have, you are not legally obligated to donate anything. This parallels to pregnancies because a fetus does need these resources, but the mother is not legally obligated to keep giving this baby her resources. Denying to give someone a body part is not illegal, so terminating a pregnancy should not be illegal 26. Legal abortions protect women's health. Legal abortion not only protects women's lives, it also protects their health. For tens of thousands of women with heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia and severe diabetes, and other illnesses that can be life-threatening, the availability of legal abortion has helped avert serious medical complications that could have resulted from childbirth. Before legal abortion, such women's choices were limited to dangerous illegal abortion or dangerous childbirth. 27. Being a mother is just one option for women.* Many hard battles have been fought to win political and economic equality for women. These gains will not be worth much if reproductive choice is denied. To be able to choose a safe, legal abortion makes many other options possible. Otherwise an accident or a rape can end a woman's economic and personal freedom. 28. Even when precautions are taken, accidents can and do happen. For some families, this is not a problem. But for others, such an event can be catastrophic. An unintended pregnancy can increase tensions, disrupt stability, and push people below the line of economic survival. Family planning is the answer. All options must be open.

            "premise": "Thank you for coming to tonight's debate.Since my opppnent has made himself 'pro' in a debate where the resolution is \"Abortion should be legal,\" I take it that he intends to carry the burden of proof. He did not stipulate that the burden of proof would be shared, so I will not be arguing that \"Abortion should not be legal\" (unless it becomes necessary in the course of the debate). I will simply offer rebuttals to Pro's arguments. If his case survives my critique, then he should win. If his case does not survive my critique, then he should lose.With those preliminaries out of the way, let's look at his arguments one at a time. From reading his post, I can discern three arguments: (1) the argument from the right of a pregnant woman to not have a child, and (2) the argument from the dangers of illegal abortions, and (3) the argument from bodily sovereignty.I. The right to not have a child.1. If abortion were not legal, then pregnant women would be forced to have children.2. A pregnant women should have the right to prevent herself from having a child.3. Therefore, abortion should be legal.The problem with this argument is that the first premise is just a tautology, and the second premise is a re-wording of the resolution, which means his argument begs the question. Essentialy, he's saying (1) If abortion were not legal, then it would be against the law to have an abortion; (2) it should not be against the law to have an abortion; (3) therefore, abortion should be legal. Pro has attempted to hide the circularity of his argument by the way he worded his premises.II. Illegal abortions are unsafe.1. If abortion is not legal, more women will have unsafe abortions.3. Therefore, abortion should be legal.Notice that what's missing from this argument is the second premise. Without a second premise, the conclusion doesn't follow, so this is an invalid argument. I could make guesses about what the second premise is, but then I might be accused of the strawman fallacy. In that case, I'll wait for Pro to supply the second premise.III. Bodily sovereignty1. The government should not control a woman's body.2. Making abortion illegal controls a woman's body.3. Therefore, the government should not make abortion illegal.This argument is problematic because there is a relevant exceptions to the first premise. If a woman had no other way to feed her child than to breast feed it, then the government would have the right to enforce a law that mothers breastfeed their own children. The alternative is that the government should allow mothers to neglect their own children, leaving them to starve to death. But having a law that expects women to breastfeed their own children means that there is a law that controls a woman's body. So although we might say that in most cases, the government should not control a woman's body, that is not without exception.ConclusionThe \"right to not have a child\" is just a rewording of \"the right to have an abortion,\" so the first argument is circular. The second argument is invalid because there's a missing premise. The third argument is unsound because the first premise is false on the basis that there is an exception that is relevant to abortion. So all three arguments fail.",

            "discussionTitle": "Abotion should be legal",
            "conclusion": "Abotion should be legal",
            "premise": "1. Abortion is about allowing woman the right to make choices about when they want to have children in relation to their age, financial stability & relationship stability. It is the not the place of government to legislate against woman's choices. 2. Raising a child is not an easy task & requires social & emotional commitment coupled with financial resources. As such if a person feels they are not ready for a child, it means the pregnancy is unwanted & resultant allowing a fetus to grow into a child is worse than abortion since the resultant child will grow in a non conducive & destructive environment without the love, care & stability that a child needs. 3. The argument against abortion is a moral argument which is subject to personal interpretation so should not be legislated against. Those see it morally allowable to do abortion should be provided with the means to do so & those who don't believe in abortion should have the choice not to have an abortion 4. A fetus is not legally or scientifically a person or human being so abortion cannot be equated to murder or taking a life since the fetus is not a person nor alive. 5. A fetus is like a brain dead person with no self awareness or consciousness so it is actually dead. 6. Prohibiting abortions doesn't stop abortions, women would simply seek abortions via illegal means which are unsafe & illegal, so it is better to provide woman with safe & legal ways to do an abortion. 7. Abortion prevent unwanted & unplanned pregnancies which prevents child neglect since the mother does not want to have children at that moment in time. 8. Making abortion illegal is also a class struggle since the rich can always go to other places where it is legal & have an abortion whilst the poor cannot do this, but have to resort to unsafe abortions which can lead to their death. 9. Making abortion illegal is more or less compulsory pregnancy which contradicts the quest & fight for freedom. 10. Making abortion illegal will increase teenage pregnancy (children having children). This usually leads to illegal abortions which can lead to death or permanent health defects, poverty, joblessness, hopelessness, and dependency. 11. A woman's right to choose abortion is a \"fundamental right\" 12. Personhood begins at birth, not at conception. Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy (fetus), not a baby. Personhood at conception is not a proven biological fact. Fetuses are incapable of feeling pain when an abortion is performed. 13. Access to legal, professionally-performed abortions reduces injury and death caused by unsafe, illegal abortions. 14. The anti-abortion position is usually based on religious beliefs and threatens the vital separation of church and state. Religious ideology should not be a foundation for law. 15. Modern abortion procedures are safe. The risk of a woman\"s death from abortion is less than one in 100,000, whereas the risk of a woman dying from giving birth is 13.3 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies. 16. Access to abortion is necessary because contraceptives are not always readily available. Women need a doctor's prescription to obtain many birth control methods, such as the pill, the patch, the shot, and the diaphragm. 17. Abortion gives couples the option to choose not to bring babies with severe and life-threatening medical conditions to full term. 18. Many women who choose abortion don't have the financial resources to support a child. 19. Motherhood must never be a punishment for having sexual intercourse. 20. A baby should not come into the world unwanted. 49% of all pregnancies among American women are unintended. Having a child is an important lifelong decision that requires consideration, preparation, and planning. 21. Abortion reduces crime. Teenage girls, unmarried women, and poor women are more likely to have unintended pregnancies, and since unwanted babies are often raised in poverty, their chances of leading criminal lives in adulthood are increased. 22. Do we have the right to force the mother to keep the baby solely because she consented to participate in these sexual activities? Do we have the right to take away another\"s right as we continue to fight for other rights? Why do we take away the rights of a woman because she has the potential to have a baby? 23. We get right to life, liberty & pursuit of happiness when we are born. he fetus does not have these rights until it is born. So abortion is not murder & abortion does not go against the rights of a fetus since it does not have any until born. 24. Every woman has the right to do whatever they want with their body aka Bodily Autonomy. This is one of the reasons why it is illegal to take organs from the deceased that have not signed off permission. If we continue this right after life, why do we strip it from a pregnant woman? Why would you grant a dead person a right that you wouldn\"t give to someone that is alive. 25. If someone needs something donated that you have, you are not legally obligated to donate anything. This parallels to pregnancies because a fetus does need these resources, but the mother is not legally obligated to keep giving this baby her resources. Denying to give someone a body part is not illegal, so terminating a pregnancy should not be illegal 26. Legal abortions protect women's health. Legal abortion not only protects women's lives, it also protects their health. For tens of thousands of women with heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia and severe diabetes, and other illnesses that can be life-threatening, the availability of legal abortion has helped avert serious medical complications that could have resulted from childbirth. Before legal abortion, such women's choices were limited to dangerous illegal abortion or dangerous childbirth. 27. Being a mother is just one option for women.* Many hard battles have been fought to win political and economic equality for women. These gains will not be worth much if reproductive choice is denied. To be able to choose a safe, legal abortion makes many other options possible. Otherwise an accident or a rape can end a woman's economic and personal freedom. 28. Even when precautions are taken, accidents can and do happen. For some families, this is not a problem. But for others, such an event can be catastrophic. An unintended pregnancy can increase tensions, disrupt stability, and push people below the line of economic survival. Family planning is the answer. All options must be open. Abortion should be part of a country's contraception policy. People should plan their families & society must allow women to end unwanted pregnancies, in order to deal with failures of birth control. Some methods of contraception in fact amount to abortion during the very earliest stage of a pregnancy. Abortion should be legal but discouraged. Legal simply because it is a choice, and what grows inside your body is yours. But discouraged because there are other more effective ways to prevent pregancy than abortion like contraception.",

I am arguing the right point in the wrong debate. What I am saying is that abortion is wrong. You are saying abortion should be legal. Well, I agree. Abortion should be legal because if it isn't, we end up with really bad scenarios like in Dirty Dancing (Yes, I have seen that movie). When people need abortions, they go to the back allies and get some half wit who just got his medical license revoked to cut them open and take out the baby. Well, that isn't safe. Abortion should be legal, but there should be tons of regulations on getting one. For example, rape. If you get raped, that is one way you should be ALLOWED an abortion. But if you are a 25 year old woman who got knocked up a month before her wedding, to bad. No abortion for you just because you want to look good in your wedding dress. What I am trying to say is we are both right. Abortion is wrong but unfortunately should be legal so that when someone NEEDS it, they have access to it and don't have to go to some shady guy in a back alley. I probably won't make a next round argument as I have nothing to argue for. My point doesn't belong in this debate, and I should have thought about it more before I jumped in.",

            "premise": "I accept. As Con, I will argue that abortion should not be legal. In what follows now, I will first present my argument and then refute what Pro said in his first round. But before I do this, I would first like to note something important. Although I am against abortion, there is one situation in which I believe that abortion is justifiable, namely, when the life of the mother is directly threatened.My ArgumentShould abortion (the killing of an fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy) be legal? Well, in order to answer that question, we must first know what the fetus is. If the fetus is just a meaningless thing, like for example an insect, then why shouldn't it be legal to kill it? However, what about if the fetus is a human being? Should abortion be legal then? Of course not. It would be absurd to argue that abortion should be legal if the fetus is a human being. So, what is the fetus? Is it a human being? Yes. We know from science that from the earliest stages of development, the fetus is a distinct and living human being. In fact, we also know from science that a new human being comes into existence at conception, as the standard text of Human Embryology and Teratology states, \"Although human life is a continuous process, fertilization/conception is a critical landmark, because under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.\" [1]Indeed, it is surely absurd to say that the unborn isn't a human being. If it isn't a human being, then what is it? A lion? Or maybe a cat? Of course not. The fetus is obviously biologically human, genetically human, and a distinct member of the species homo sapiens. Even Peter Singer himself, although being a pro-choice philosopher, accept the humanity of the unborn: \"It is possible to give 'human being' a precise meaning. We can use it as equivalent to 'member of the species Homo sapiens'. Whether a being is a member of a given species is something that can be determined scientifically, by an examination of the nature of the chromosomes in the cells of living organisms. In this sense there is no doubt that from the first moments of its existence an embryo/fetus conceived from human sperm and eggs is a human being.\" [2]David Boonin, also a pro-choice philosopher, writes:\"Perhaps the most straight forward relation between you and me on the one hand and every human fetus on the other is this: All are living members of the same species, homo sapiens. A human fetus after all is simply a human being at a very early stage in his or her development.\" [3]Pro's ArgumentPro said two things in his first round. Pro first said that \"The legality behind abortion is very clear. Our \"unalienable rights\" -- as implicitly stated in the Constitution -- ensure us \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" That's exactly right. However, the right to life, liberty and happiness, is something which the fetus should be given too, because as I have clearly showed, the fetus is also a human being.After saying this, Pro said that \"Without legalizing abortion, women wouldn't be granted the right to care for their own bodies and make decisions regarding their unborn child/children.\"This is completely mistaken. Without legalizing abortion, what women really wouldn't be granted the right to do, is to kill an innocent human being. ConclusionThe fetus, as I have clearly showed, is a human being. Thus, abortion (which is the killing of an human being, namely, the fetus) should not be legal.Sources[1] http://www.caseforlife.com... This site presents several quotations from medical experts in the field of embryology who all confirms the fact that the fetus is a human being and that a new human being comes into existence at conception.[2] Peter Singer, Practical Ethics, page 85-86.[3] David Boonin, A Defense of Abortion, page 20.",

            "premise": "First, it must be established that I oppose the principle of destroying a human life, no matter how small. This moral implication do not compare to my three contentions which will show all voters that abortion should remain legal in the US. Initially, abbortion has been previously illegalized. The results of this ban were catastrophic. Women received \"Dark Alley Abortions.\" Allow me to elaborate. Women were determined to get an abortion, regardless of the legality. Since it was illegal, these women could not go to a respectable doctor in a sanitary practice for a good doctor would not break the law for them. Instead they had to go to sleezy, unlisenced practices who no little about how to properly abort a baby. It doesn't stop there though. The doctors rarely sterilized equipment and did the operations in unsanitary alley ways or other dark dirty locations where the police would not likely find them. Many women were raped by sleezy doctors and died of blood loss or infecion caused by unsanitary equipment. There is no evidence to suggest that this same scenario would not occur if it abortion became illegal. To prevent this horrible scenario from reoccuring, abortion should remain legal. Secondly, desperate situations such as rape demand abortion. Many women are emotionally unable to bear a rape child for nine months. As a matter of fact, news sites such as CNN provide plenty of instances where women in this situation have committed suicide. Abortion must remain legal to protect rape victims. This right must be maintained for all women though otherwise it could be considered a bill of attainder. Finally, the majority of abortions are done by impoverished and/or teenage woman. A recent university study proved that children of these groups of women usually have a low quality of life, often become a burden on society, and are more likely to end up in trouble with the law. Additionally, if unwanted children are born, they will be forced into foster homes or orphanages where they will unfortunatley cost society. As sad as it is, most abortions leave society better off. I urge a pro vote.",

            "premise": "Thanks to Con for accepting this debate today. I wish him the best of luck.The resolution is whether abortion should be legal or not. I will give one example of why abortion should be legal, and if I do not receive a concession; I will introduce a second contention in round two. ((Yes, I'm that confident!)) Contention One: Maternal DeathsMaternal deaths are when the death of the mother will occur while pregnant. Often, if the pregnancy is allowed to be continued - the mother will die. However, if an abortion is carried out, the mother will live. This can happen, in the case of eclampsia or infections[1]So, allow me to present Con with two scenarios:1) In scenario one, the act of abortion is illegal and thus, the pregnancy cannot be terminated early. As a result, the mother dies. Also, due to the lack of almost everything for the child, the child will die as well. Con would present a case - willing or no - where this hideous scenario could play out.2) Now for another scenario, the one I'm for, where abortion is legal. To everyone's sadness, the foetus will die due to the termination of the pregnancy. HOWEVER, the mother might still live. Therefore, in all likelihood, we have only lost one life. It is important to recognise that in both scenarios, the foetus will die. This is unavoidable and thus, objectively speaking, irrelevant. What is relevant? The life of the mother. In the case I am presenting, I give this mother a chance to live. In Con's case, we have a dead mother on our hands because abortion would be illegal. I would ask Con to justify why abortion should be illegal even though the foetus dies either way. I do not see abortion as killing a child in all cases; I see abortion as saving a mother. ((I am not suggesting at all that Con wants this kind of thing to play out; I am merely demonstrating that the case Con is debating for - illegal abortion - it will play out.))It is possible that Con accepts abortion to be legal under these circumstances. If that is the case, Con has conceded this debate, because the stance Con is taking \"Abortion should be illegal\" has no asterisks attached to it and nothing the rules changed this. I will eagerly await my opponent's response(s)! Until next round!Source(s):[1]WHO report, 2005",

Abortions cause phycological damage.[1] I want to point out that some of your points are irrelevant. These include: \"10.

To start things off, I will be presenting some points that prove why abortion is not really immoral and that it should be legal. Judith Jarvis Thomas makes three valid points. First, if you deny the mothers right to an abortion, you are dehumanizing her and giving more rights to the fetus than to her. This is not fair. Everyone should have equal rights. Second, say you are kidnapped and forced to provide life support to a random stranger. Is it your responsibility to provide support for this stranger? Third, say the women does not want a child and she uses contraception. Still, she winds up pregnant. Now she is forced to give birth and raise a child who she does not love or want. Also what if the Woman if raped? What if the child is the result of incest and is going to be born with countless birth defects? What if carrying the child to term endangers the mother's life? What if the mother is too young to care for a child? There are so many circumstances in which abortion should be allowed. It should be legal. Thank You",

So if a kid procrastinates, which means he is irresponsible, should he be punished by law? Or what if I oversleep? The law should be concerned with protecting it's citizens from other citizens, not to try to be a nanny. 1. Life Organism My opponent argues that since a fetus is an organism, then abortion should not be legal. I have two objections to this: A. Life forms aren't necessarily human beings. A plant is an organism. An insect is an organism. Cattle are organisms. So everything I kill a mosquito I should be imprisoned? Everything I eat a salad I should be arrested? Every steak I touch should give me 15-25 years in jail? Preposterous. B. Murder is defined as the intentional killing of a human being. Not all life organisms, such as a fetus, are humans. Thus, abortion should be legal. =====Conclusion===== My opponent has not shown how killing a fetus is murder. He has not shown how killing organisms should be murder or should take importance over the rights of a mother.",

Let it be known that I did in fact agree with my opponents statement that been a potential human does not make you a human in the case of an embryo. I also provided a much more in debt definition of the word human being which does not contradict my opponents definition. I also provide a standard for defining what a person is. My arguement that arbortion should be illegal because it takes away the fetuses life is not based solely on the definition of a human being but more on the definition of \"Rights\" and how to distinguish rights from duties. I will also like to point out that this argument was not addresed at all by my opponent. \"I would like to point out something. Con used the word fetus eight times. I specifically argued that abortion should be legal during the first trimester. During this stage we are talking about zygotes and embryos, not fetuses.\" My opponent did not specify the word embryo in the introduction of the debate. My opponent's words are as followed: \"I argue that abortion should be legal During the First Trimester.\" The first trimester as i recall is the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. A fetuse according to googles definition is \"an unborn offspring of a mammal, in particular an unborn human baby more than eight weeks after conception.\" This means that the word fetus is appropriate when describing the first trimester of pregnancy. \"What about the kids that are forced to go without food because their parents cannot afford it?\" Like I said in my first round of argument, value is brought on by the smallest things that makes life worth living. This means that the slightest chance of forming a meaningful relationship with someone is enough grounds to argue that that individuals life is valuable. This again does not require that the person has an exceptionally high standard of living. It should be noted that many of the arguments that I formed in my first rebuttal were ignored by my opponent. This includes my characteristics that makes an organism a person, definition and distinction of rights and duties, value of life argument, and even my argument on a woman's right to her body.",

Definitions/Explanations Restricted abortion should be legal = By this I mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy. Abortion - is the end (termination) of a pregnancy. A low-risk surgical procedure called suction aspiration or suction curette is generally used for first trimester abortions. Medical (non-surgical) abortions using medications such as mifepristone (RU486) are available in some clinics. The embryonic period in humans begins at fertilization (penetration of the egg by the sperm) and continues until the end of the 10th week of gestation (8th week by embryonic age).

Your opponent clearly won, And all the words you were saying didn't make sense, And your \"points\" were trash. Looks like it's going to happen again this debate. \"Should Abortions Be Legal? \"If it's a \"simple\" question, Why are abortions legal in certain parts of the world and illegal in other parts of the world? If it was simple, It would be either legal or illegal in all parts of the world. So what do you think about that? Enlighten me. Of course it isn't difficult to answer because it's a matter of opinion, But you must look at things through all aspects and angles rather than troll or say things that have absolutely nothing to do with abortion. \"And you did not even answer if it should or should not be. \"In my second point I stated that I'm against abortion, Meaning that I'm insisting that abortion should be illegal. I thought that was pretty self explanatory. Your second point. \"That is the price of a new PlayStation\" \"Flavor enhancement of soft drinks from Pepsi. \" Lol. . . \"At no point will baby murder ever be moral. Even pro-abortion people don't claim baby murder to be moral. \"That's interesting. Be careful because you're contradicting yourself. Consent. I mentioned consent because it has something to do with sex and thus getting pregnant. A lot of women have consensual sex and still have an abortion which is wrong. You basically asked to have a baby, Yet you're killing it? No. Rape. Just because there's something you didn't bring up does not mean I'm prohibited to say it. I'm bringing up my own points from my brain, I'm not piggybacking off of you. Your R1 was idiotic, So I had to show a contrast between your R1 and my intelligent R1. In case you weren't aware, Rape has something to do with abortion because it has something to do with sex and thus getting pregnant. Conditions. Are you serious on this point or are you trolling big time? Why would parents in China not want a girl? By them keep killing females, Wouldn't that only stops the chances of the population, Since girls grow up into women and can birth children? Pro choice angleI guess all that matters to you is the money made. Would you support murderers killing innocent people and making money off of it? Enlighten me. I ignored your point about \"blacks and Hispanics\" because that made zero sense. I never heard of that. Instead of expecting me to flesh out your points, Why don't you do it yourself. Also, I see you're a racist. Great job on your other debate. I'm black by the way. So make sure you tread very lightly. Would you like this to be a civil mature debate about abortion, About black people, Or about you being a troll?",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for starting this debate. I haven't debated in awhile, and I'm bored. So let's go: I affirm that abortion should be legal because it should be the woman's choice (her body). Additionally, it is NOT murder therefore making the priority the woman's body. Note that definitions of laws and such will be kept under the jurisdiction of the United States. I don't intend to argue about abortion cases in other countries and it doesn't seem my opponent does either (though I doubt the definitions of murder are vastly different amongst most countries). =====Counterarguments===== \"because abortion is killing some one,in the law it is a crime,\" ----> Killing someone (murder) is defined in US Law as intentionally causing another person's death without legal excuse or justification [1]. Note the usage of \"person\". A person is defined in U.S. law as either a human being [2] or a corporate, business, etc. The second definition is irrelevant to this debate. Once again, note the usage of \"human being\". In current United States law, at the moment of birth a biological being becomes a human being [3]. Thus, legally abortion is NOT a murder so this claim is FALSE. \"and just because it is not born yet does not justify taking a life.\" ----> Does masturbating become murder? If so, OH THE TYRANNY! \"Most abortions are teen abortions most for teens wanting to have \"fun\" and not think about the cause and effects of what they are doing.\" ----> Please show me the statistic for this claim. Even if this is true, so what? \"Just because some teen who doesn't want the burden of being mother shouldn't have the right to kill a baby.\" ----> It's not a baby. It's not a human being. It's not a person. It's a FETUS. It's a MASS OF TISSUE. Kinda like a tumor that grows fast. \"they must learn that its there fault in the first place,thats like some one robbing a bank and not think your gonna go to jail for it.\" ----> Erroneous analogy. Robbing a bank is a crime. As I have shown earlier, abortion is not. =====Conclusion===== I argue that since a fetus is not a human being, then the mother's right should be considered paramount. My opponent has failed to show how abortion is murder. ---References--- 1. http://www.criminal-law-lawyer-source.com... 2. http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com... 3. http://www.eileen.250x.com...",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for providing this interesting and controversial topic of debate. 1) I believe this to be an irrelevant point as we are arguing whether or not it SHOULD be legal, not whether or not it IS legal. 2) Once again, my opponent is using already-existing legal documents to prove his point. I believe this should be disregarded for the same reason as his first point. a) If the mother cannot handle a child for whatever reason, then it is her responsibility to make sure she doesn't have one. 3) My opponent mentioned that not even 1% of pregnancies are from rape. In fact, his source says that \"LESS than 1% of all abortions take place because of rape and/or incest.\" So, part of that \"less than 1%\" is incest, meaning that even less is rape. Now, considering that minuscule percentage, I believe that the downsides of abortion heavily outweigh the benefit of less than 1% of pregnant women getting an abortion. (Plus, not all women want an abortion, even after rape. So the percentage becomes even smaller). Now, onto why abortion should NOT be legal. A) Killing a person: Abortion can be compared to murder, as it is the killing of an embryo, a human. That embryo could have been a great benefit to society, but will no longer be. Abortion is murder, just under a different name. B) Devaluation of human life: Abortion is like a \"cancel\" button. The cancellation of human life becoming a regular occurrence makes human life worth nothing as you can simply make it or take it away at any time. C) Less responsibility: Legal abortion results in men and women taking less responsibility for their actions as they can just cancel it at any time, which leads to the further devaluation of human life. D) Contraception: In our time, contraceptives are very accessible. This means that couples have no excuse to have an unexpected child, and if they don't want one, then it is their responsibility to use contraceptives. Use of contraceptives is a better alternative to abortion in every way. I await my opponent's response.",

These are a pregnancy resulting from rape, and a pregnancy that significantly threatens the woman's health or life. Under all other circumstances, abortion should be illegal. The Argument 1) Abortion is no different from homicide. Homicide is defined as the killing of a human being by another (1). Since a fetus is an individual member of the species homo sapiens - a human being, that is - intentionally killing it is homicide. 2) The argument that this is a woman's rights issue is a red herring.

Regardless of whether abortion is legal or not, there will be those who will seek out abortions anyway. Abortions received in a clinical setting are much safer than other methods, as they are performed by and under the supervision of those in medical professions who know what they are doing and what to do in case of emergencies. Abortions performed at home, such as with coathangers or any of the various methods often used in the hopes of inducing a miscarriage (blows to the abdomen, intentionally eating foods one is meant to avoid during pregnancy, etc.), are done without this medical supervision and often in the absence of any medical knowledge by the pregnant woman. Safer abortions should be provided because it would minimize the amount of deaths and complications due to abortions. Argument 2 Abortion ought to be legal because it is the right of the woman. If we accept the premise that a human being is the owner of their own body (which we must if we're debating laws in the first place, because why would we tell someone what they can and can't do with something if they aren't in control of it anyway?), then that human being also has the right to decide what to do with his or her body. If a woman doesn't wish to be pregnant, she shouldn't be legally denied an abortion, because denial of that abortion would force her to make a choice that she doesn't want to and shouldn't have to.",

This round is for acceptance of the debate. Definitions pro-choice: the mindset that a woman has the right to abortion. This does not mean a pro-choicer thinks abortion is moral, just that a woman has the right to one. pro-life: The mindset that abortion should be illegal. abortion: The act of aborting a baby VOLUNTARILY.

            "premise": "I never stated that nobody should be legally required to do something they don't want to. I stated that pregnant women should have the right to choose if they want to have a child or not. Having children should definitely be optional regardless of if the woman is pregnant or not. The government should not force pregnant women to have a child. If you care about fetuses more than women's lives then you should remain pro life. The fact is that approximately 78,000 women die from unsafe abortions. The number of women who die from unsafe abortions will increase if the government bans abortion. Why should the government protect lives that aren't humans over women? Women's lives are way more important than fetuses. Fetuses are not humans because the definition of humans does not apply for fetuses. Source: http://dictionary.reference.com... In regards to protests, Abortion is currently legal under certain circumstances, There has not been tons of protests because majority of Americans support the right to have an abortion under certain circumstances. If the government bans abortion completely which majority of Americans would oppose than there will be more protests. Look at the abortion polls. Source:http://www.gallup.com... In regards to the child, if the child does become a criminal then it may be killed or put in jail depending on the situation. Some criminals gets killed during the crime scene. Criminals are allowed to get killed if they commit murder. You were wrong when you stated that criminals are not allowed get killed. There is a justification for having an abortion if the child might become a criminal. If the child grows up to be a criminal than it effects people. If it is not raised well then it might become a criminal. The child could grow up to be a good person or a bad person. The way the child is raised effects what the child will turn out to be. In regards to raising a child, It is okay for a woman to have an abortion to prevent herself from taking care of it. Abortion is not killing a child. It's killing a fetus. Like I just stated fetuses are not humans. If you count all the humans in the world you wouldn't count fetuses. If a woman doesn't have enough time or money to raise a child then the best thing to do is either have an abortion or put the child up for adoption. Most women don't want to put their child up for adoption. Another thing I want to point out is that most pro life people only support the right to have an abortion in cases of rape, incest and when the woman's life is at risk. My opponent probably supports it in those cases as well. Well in cases of rape if a woman has an abortion than that's also killing a fetus. Conservatives talk about why fetuses should have the right to live when they support the right to have an abortion in cases of rape. Conservatives are hypocrites. Abortion is killing a fetus regardless of the case. I support the right to have an abortion regardless of the case. The government should not dictate what a woman could do with her own body that's abuse of power. My opponent does not believe in women's rights instead he believes that the government should control women's bodies. Banning abortion would be bad for women and is against their rights. http://www.womenscenter.com...",

S is being challenged and debate of the topic has been fired up for the longest. My side: I am against abortion. Access to abortion whether it's legal or not varies from state to state and it also varies from country to country. In Ireland for example, Abortion is illegal unless there are circumstances where the health of the mother is at risk due to the pregnancy. A fetus is a person from the moment of conception. A baby's heart begins to beat at about 3 weeks old, Therefore a baby is a real living person and killing it is immoral. Religions. Many religions are also against abortions. In the bible it states \"Man shall not kill\". Hindus and Buddhists believe the act of abortion is one of the greatest possible sins. Consent. If a woman willingly has sexual intercourse then she should not abort as that is her responsibility because she consented. For every action there's a reaction. In that case, It would be immoral to abort and that isn't right. If you do not wish to get pregnant you should either abstain or use some sort of contraception be it a type of birth control or condoms. Rape. Some women become pregnant as the result of sexual assault. No woman should be forced to conceive a baby that was a result of a rape. I believe a woman can abort if they were raped, Because it was forced and it wasn't consensual. Conditions. Other reasons are that abortion allows the parent to discriminate against the child. One of the most common conditions that it's screened for it down syndrome. There are some instances in pregnancies where the baby is diagnosed with down syndrome are aborted. The trouble with these tests is that they are not always accurate, Meaning the baby is aborted on the chance that the child might have down syndrome, Not because the baby does have it indefinitely. Pro-choice angle. At the end of the day, Women do have the right to choose whatever they want to do as it is their body. I'm not saying otherwise, But I'm just saying I am more against abortion than for it. Abortions should be only done if rape was involved or if the health of the mother is at risk (Ireland example) as I said before. The unfortunate problem is that abortion is also done for the wrong reasons, Such as consensual sex.",

If they don't want to have a child, then they should not have sex. -Refer to my point 19 (19. Motherhood must never be a punishment for having sexual intercourse.) -Refer to my point 22 (Do we have the right to force the mother to keep the baby solely because she consented to participate in these sexual activities? Do we have the right to take away another\"s right as we continue to fight for other rights? Why do we take away the rights of a woman because she has the potential to have a baby?) -Refer to point 24 (Every woman has the right to do whatever they want with their body aka Bodily Autonomy. This is one of the reasons why it is illegal to take organs from the deceased that have not signed off permission. If we continue this right after life, why do we strip it from a pregnant woman? Why would you grant a dead person a right that you wouldn\"t give to someone that is alive.) -It is the right of every woman to make choice as regards their bodies & when they want to have children. What of women's rights -Shall we then blame women for being biological the sex that has to bear children. -It is mainly because of man who do not want to take responsibility for the actions that many woman are forced to have abortions -A child is the product of sex between two people so you mean to say you are okay with man who go about impregnating woman and not taking responsibility 2. If the fetus is beyond 23 weeks, it can feel pain. -If thats the case then lets make abortion legal for pregnancies less than 23 weeks, which i think is the law. So we agree abortion should be legal. The question is upto how many weeks should abortion be considered legal 3. Abortions cause phycological damage -I assume you meant \"physiological damage\" -If abortion is done by qualified medical practitioners following the medical guidelines, research actually shows that there is a greater chance of dying from pregnancy than from dying from an abortion -the problem is the back-door abortion centers, these are mostly caused by making abortion illegal or too costly for the poor to access. 3. On teenage pregnancies. Here are 5 facts (a) Teenagers are having more sex than before (b) Teenagers are having more unprotected sex than protected sex (c) As a result teenagers are having more teenage pregnancies (d) As a result teenagers are having more children than before (e) As a result teenagers are having more abortions than before -So in addition to giving teenagers more sex education, we also need to provide them with legal & safe ways to have abortions as opposed to unsafe & illegal abortions. -If we make abortions illegal, teenagers will have more children -If we have abortions legal they will have less children -This affects their prospects in life for being financially free of dependance and being financially secluded Fewer rounds for debate ensures that each person makes a solid case. The next round is the last one so please provide all your rebuttals",

Abortion is a safe medical procedure, that shouldn't be repealed because of the morals of certain religious groups. Unfortunately, often times this particular argument becomes a quarrel because it becomes a moral thing, and you can't debate morality. According to the National Abortion Federation (2), Abortion is very safe- 97% of abortions are effective and have no complications, only 3% of abortions have minor complications that are harmless. If abortion is a safe and isn't causing any harm-- why should we repeal a woman's choice to have it? Therefore, if abortion is safe, the federal government has no reason to repeal abortion laws. 1) http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2) http://www.prochoice.org...",

When does life start some say when an egg is fertilized but could that egg become a FULLY FUNCTIONING human being no if it was not in the womb, the earliest survivor of a premature birth is 21 weeks; even doctors will not provide assistance if it is befor the 24 week cut off. http://miscarriage.about.com... if life is said as something that can live without the womb than the earliest a human is alive is 24 weeks into the pregnancy. So life is at twenty four weeks but if the woman has known she was pregnant for 22 weeks than has she had enough time to think. Most women would have the hardest decision of their life during this 24 weeks, the real question on abortion is not if its should be legal but when should the cut off for an abortion be.",

            "conclusion": "Abortion Should Remain Legal",
            "premise": "\"the prevention of harm to the woman is the only valid legal reason\" That is not true, an abortion could be performed for any reason, if the woman wants it. And even if it is made illegal for a woman to have the right to an abortion for birth control reasons, then the laws should be changed. This is a bill that will probably be signed to ensure the rights for women to get abortions. http://en.wikipedia.org... 'A fetus with deformities? Which deformities? What's a \"life of suffering? People with disabilities aren't all wallowing in misery.' A fetus can have plenty of deformities, such as permanent mental or physical disabilities. Sure, some people with disabilities aren't all wallowing in misery, but that's not true for all handicapped people. It should be the choice of the woman whether she wants to bring the baby out into the world to live a non-normal life, or not let that happen. 'I'm saying that when an abortion is no longer necessary, because of alternative treatments, there is no longer a compelling interest for abortions to be legal.' Even if we develop alternative treatments, there could still be reasons for abortion. Such as using embryonic stem cells from aborted fetuses - which have the potential to replicate themselves into any type of tissue - could be used for huge advances in medicine, and even save lives. Also, even if alternatives to abortion and other ways of getting embryonic stem cells are developed, then we could stop having abortions then. But right now we don't have those things now, so abortion has to remain legal for the time being. 'The point is that human life exists along a continuum, and along that continuum there exist stages where, as you said \"a fetus could be considered human.\" I am not arguing that conception is such a stage, but I don't need to because the morning after pill fixes that problem without abortion.' Morning-after abortion pills don't work if the woman finds out she's pregnant later than a day after. I don't advocate abortion as the only means of birth control, but it should never not be an option. 'A fetus may, in fact, have rights, because it may be human, and not merely a potential human.' How could you consider a fetus equal to a human being? I already stated how it is NOT a human. It is a potential human because it is only alive because of the mother's body, and is incapable of many human functions. It also does not have rights because it is part of another human's body. The woman should be in control of that fetus because it's part of her own body. 'Sure. I like people more than things. But seriously, she could have the child adopted, or be required to seek potential adoptive parents before birth. There are certainly enough people who would like to have children.' Just because you're willing to, doesn't mean everyone is. Many people couldn't afford to pay for the millions of unplanned babies born if abortion was made illegal. Also, why should that woman have to carry that baby around for 9 months and endure labor and pregnancy, just to give that child away? There are still going to be many planned children put up for adoption. Also, would you really deny a rape victim from having an abortion? 'Yes. Potential should not be thwarted because of origin.' Seriously, what's your problem? You value embryos over a grown person's control over their own life? You're okay with women getting raped and having to be pregnant and care for a kid, just because you don't agree with the decisions they make over their own bodies? 'I am positing that a procedure may exist to remove the child safely from the mother and incubate it so that she can get on with her life. When this happens, labor pains can no longer be taken into account as an ethical concern.' What don't you understand about us not having those advances yet? 'The \"genes of a rapist\" argument is eugenics speak. Many children of rape are adopted and go on to live 'normal' lives. Rape is borne out of the effects of certain experiences on those organisms that develop as a consequence of their genes. ' That's not completely true, actually a lot of actions in humans have some hereditary factor in them. Even suicide is part hereditary. Sure, some kids born from a rape victim turn out okay, but it's the woman's choice whether she wants the kid or not. 'This is an argument for better birth control, not abortion.' You still don't understand that we don't have all the advances in birth control that we'd like to have. Currently, abortion is the only type of birth control necessary in a lot of situations. Even if anti-choice people make abortion illegal, that won't stop abortion. Plenty of women will get back-alley abortions which are much more dangerous than the regular abortions legal today.",

According to Anne who wrote the article \"what if abortion were illegal?\" Says that of they were to make it illegal ot would cause a lot of problems. It could possibly have women try to do \"home remedies\" that can hurt themselves. Also, if abortion was illegal where they lived, some women may travel to far places where it legal just to get it done because they really desperate to have the procedure. So basically some women will still go out of there way just to have this done, because that's what they want for themselves for many reasons.",

We are arguing whether or not it SHOULD be legal, and using existing legal documents to prove this is the same as using the Bible to prove the existence of Jesus. \"Dropped - Bad Childhoods /Mother can not take of the kid\" As mentioned, if the woman cannot take care of a child, it is HER responsibility not to have one. \"The reason it already is legal is because it *should be* legal.\" This is silly logic, as the legality of something does not mean it should be. The fact that something happens doesn't mean it should happen, just like since rape happens, that doesn't mean it should. \"A woman has her right to her own body as does anyone. Taking that away from her is going against a document that was made to provide us with the greatest possible freedom.\" The problem with this statement is that we're not talking about the woman's body, but the growing body inside her. No one has the right to the growing human. \"What he is stating is that is is perfectly fine to tell around 30,000 women yearly that they have to carry a child because they were sexually assaulted on no fault of their own, even if it could mess up their lives forever.\" I have not once said that. I said that the negatives of abortion outweigh the positives of far less than 1% of pregnant women getting an abortion. My opponent fails to provide a source for his \"30,000 women\" statistic, so I could ignore this all together. \"My adversary just asserts that an embryo is a living human, without providing any evidence to support it.\" My opponent questions if a fetus/embryo can be called alive. A fetus/embryo is made of living cells, making it a living organism. \"You are not terminating a life, but the chance of a life existing.\" My opponent is mistaken, as he does not believe an embryo is a living thing. I proved above that an embryo is, in fact, a living thing and therefore, abortion is the killing of that living thing. I would like to note that my opponent has dropped my argument about the devaluation of human life. \"He just asserts contraceptives work all the times\" I never said that either. This is the second time my opponent is putting words into my mouth. I said that contraceptives are easily accessible in most modern societies and that they are a better option than abortion. Indeed, contraceptives don't always work, but they are very effective. The best methods fail only 0.05%! http://www.cdc.gov... \"so the numbers are drastically smaller than my adversary makes them out to be\" I did not include any numbers other than rape statistics in my Round 2 argument. I do not know what my opponent is referring to (it is now up to the voters to decide). \"... it prevents bad cases of children being raised in homes that cannot afford them\" Once again, if the couple cannot afford, it is their responsibility not to have a child.

            "premise": "Greetings. Let's pose the question: \"Should abortion be (il)legal? \"This is a very difficult question to answer without bias and it comes down to your fundamental beliefs, But it is clear that the right to abortions in the U. S is being challenged and debate of the topic has been fired up for the longest. My side: I am against abortion. Access to abortion whether it's legal or not varies from state to state and it also varies from country to country. In Ireland for example, Abortion is illegal unless there are circumstances where the health of the mother is at risk due to the pregnancy. A fetus is a person from the moment of conception. A baby's heart begins to beat at about 3 weeks old, Therefore a baby is a real living person and killing it is immoral. Religions. Many religions are also against abortions. In the bible it states \"Man shall not kill\". Hindus and Buddhists believe the act of abortion is one of the greatest possible sins. Consent. If a woman willingly has sexual intercourse then she should not abort as that is her responsibility because she consented. For every action there's a reaction. In that case, It would be immoral to abort and that isn't right. If you do not wish to get pregnant you should either abstain or use some sort of contraception be it a type of birth control or condoms. Rape. Some women become pregnant as the result of sexual assault. No woman should be forced to conceive a baby that was a result of a rape. I believe a woman can abort if they were raped, Because it was forced and it wasn't consensual. Conditions. Other reasons are that abortion allows the parent to discriminate against the child. One of the most common conditions that it's screened for it down syndrome. There are some instances in pregnancies where the baby is diagnosed with down syndrome are aborted. The trouble with these tests is that they are not always accurate, Meaning the baby is aborted on the chance that the child might have down syndrome, Not because the baby does have it indefinitely. Pro-choice angle. At the end of the day, Women do have the right to choose whatever they want to do as it is their body. I'm not saying otherwise, But I'm just saying I am more against abortion than for it. Abortions should be only done if rape was involved or if the health of the mother is at risk (Ireland example) as I said before. The unfortunate problem is that abortion is also done for the wrong reasons, Such as consensual sex.",

            "discussionTitle": "Abortion should remain legal in the US",
            "conclusion": "Abortion should remain legal in the US",
            "premise": "Thanks to the Con for accepting this debate! I wish this to be a fair and great debate! To reiterate, I will be arguing the following statement: \"Abortion should remain legal in the United States.\" With that, I will clarify the conditions of my contention. I am arguing that any abortion restrictions and laws should remain as they are, withno suggested changes or additions. I am arguing that current abortion regulations need to stay the way they are. This means that my contention also suggests that abortionshould not be outlawed, and thatother forms of abortion should not be made legal if not already. This is an important part of my argument. Also, while my personal views on abortion are varied, I still argue my statement because I know it is the best for society. I encourage any readers and also the Con to take an unbiased approach to reading and taking part in this debate. Now, my first argument: I: Women have the right to choose what to do withtheir body It is a known fact and idea, that everyone is entitled to the right to choose. To choose what brand of food they wish to buy from the store, or what color to die their hair. We also have the right to choose on decisions that have to do with our bodies. In a life or death situation for another person, legally, you have the right to choose whether you want to donate the means to save that person's life (without legal consequences). [1] In the same way, we are also entitled to choice when it comes to things that have immediate or prolonged consequences, such as committing a crime or doing drugs. Stretching that idea out, women have the right to have an abortion, as it is a part of their body. We know this because the society we live in is all based off of the free choice of Americans. At the current standards, a woman seeking an abortion goes through many steps to actually terminate her pregnancy. Depending on the state, some are required to go through counseling, and permission from a parent (in minors) or a doctor-- however, all over America, women seeking an abortion go through the shaming of society of their decision, while still making the decision to terminate their pregnancy. [2] We know that a lot of things are being done to deter that choice, but like a good and civilized society,we still allow those women to have their freedom of choice. II: Personhood doesn't begin until viability After arguing the reasoning as to why women undoubtedly have the right to their own body, the question still remains: when do fetuses have the right to their own body? It is a known fact, in science and in the law, that life in the womb begins when the fetus is capable of living on its own. When is this? \"..20 to 35 percent of babies born at 23 weeks of gestation survive, while 50 to 70 percent of babies born at 24 to 25 weeks, and more than 90 percent born at 26 to 27 weeks, survive.\"[3] So generally, fetuses are more than likely to be considered viable at 26-27 weeks, and in the most rare cases, maybe 23 weeks. A vast majority of states ban abortions after 20 weeks, while some even ban abortions after12 weeks. [4] Abortion isn't even legal while the fetus is considered viable! So, if the fetus is not yet its own person, not yet capable of even surviving outside of the womb, then it is assumed that everything is indeed a part of the woman's body. This means until the fetus has reached personhood, women have the right to choose what to do withtheir body. This means that if abortion is only legal while the fetus is not capable of living on its own, then abortion isnot an illegal practice, and should remain a legal option to women in early stages of pregnancy. III: Completely enforcing anti-abortion laws is impossibleLet's assume just momentarily that abortion was banned everywhere. In a situation where Congress easily passed legislation that prevented women from getting abortions in any conditions, and no other country in the world provided legal options to terminate a pregnancy. This would still not prevent abortions from occurring. Women seeking an abortion for whatever reason, are more than likely still going to get an abortion in whatever way possible, despite it being illegal. People argue all the time, \"If you make guns illegal, people are still going to get guns, just illegally.\" This is a true statement that has just as much truth when it comes to abortions. You just simply can't forbid a woman from terminating her pregnancy and hope that laws and regulations are going to act as a deterrent in a world like that. This leads to my next argument; IV: The risk of illegal abortionsThis is my last and most important argument. In that country where no woman could legally get an abortion, they will find a way to get one should their situation be that desperate. This will lead to illegal abortions, which are not safe at all. When a person that decides they cannot have a baby for social or financial reasons, and they are determined that they do not have the means to bring a child into the world, then they will also be determined to end that pregnancy in anyway possible. This is a sad but absolutely true statement.Illegal abortions took place in the so called back-alleys, and they were not safe or something anyone wanted to think about. Before Roe v. Wade, illegal abortions were done in many terrible ways, some of which including coat hangers, illegal drugs, knitting needles or even a punch to the stomach. These methods were unsafe, and led to many women dying as a result of it. The statistics are saddening. [5]It has been wisely said, \"Roe v. Wade was not the beginning of abortions, but rather the end of women dying because of them.\"This is my strongest and main argument to keeping abortion legal in the United States. Abortion needs to remain to be a legal option for women, as it is their choice, and it is not up to anyone else. Whether we disagree with their decisions or not, certified abortion clinics should remain to be legally open to any women in any circumstances. [1]https://www.academia.edu...

            "conclusion": "Abortion should remain legal in the United States",
            "premise": "Note: I do not advocate or condone every abortion that happens, but what I feel is irrelevant. I am going to take you through you some logical processes to show why abortion should be legal. This is not a debate about whether or not abortion should be legal in (x) or not legal in (x). We are debating if there are some circumstances that could possibly occur that would warrant an abortion. If there are some circumstances in which an abortion should be permitted, it should therefore be legal and allowed by law. My adversary is taking the stance that there are no circumstances in which abortion should be legal. So now let me being with some of my contentions Contention 1Is a fetus a life or is it a human life. I am not going to spend much time on this because it is overall irrelevant to some of the points I will be making. I would like to spend a small bit of time on this though, just to clarify some basic thoughts. I have just posted this topic to the challenge leader board, and I am writing this on word before my adversary posts his first round. So I am quite sure he will spend a copious amount of time explaining that a fetus is in fact a life. I will not even contest this point; it in fact is a life. That point cannot be argued or disputed. The next logical question one may ask is whether or not it is a human life. This is a far more in-depth question. My adversary will surely spend some of his allotted words on presenting the fact that a fetus is a life at conception. Again this is not the underlying question. This is the basic process of thought in which most people would exhibit. (A) A fetus is a life and it was conceived by a human, therefore the fetus is a person or a baby. I think this exhibits some flaws in logic, because the next logical step that my adversary would take is that killing this person or baby after the time it was conceived would be murder. Murder \u2013 The act of unlawfully taking an innocent life without justification. So how do we define what makes us human. I would almost argue for the fact that the fetus would have to exhibit pain, feelings, emotion, and conscious. It must have some type of senses. If ending a life were considered murder, we could be put on trial for stepping on an insect. An insect is a life, and almost anything we can imagine is in fact living. This is in fact almost impossible to show and prove at what stage it develops these qualities, which is why it is such a controversial issue. This varies from state to state and is also a huge reason that late term abortion is banned. One of many studies shows this. \u201cAnand argues that because fetuses can respond to stress or other stimuli at 20 weeks, abortion after that point causes them \"severe and excruciating pain.\" The bulk of the scientific literature on the subject, however, finds that the brain connections needed to feel pain are not in place until at least 24 weeks, which is also the earliest possible time a fetus becomes viable outside the womb. Anand's testimony has been used to justify state and federal laws banning abortions after 20 weeks; those efforts have passed in nine states since 2010.\u201d\u201cDr. Kanwaljeet \"Sunny\" Anand, a University of Tennessee professor of pediatrics, anesthesiology, and neurobiology who has promoted the idea that 20 weeks post-conception is the point when a fetus begins to feel pain. None of this evidence follows or aligns with almost any other scientific research done on this subject\u201dWhile a fetus may be a life, it does not start to develop characters that humans share until around 20-24 weeks. I do not need to spend much more time on this because as I said earlier, it is irrelevant. Contention 2Abortion in cases where it could danger a mother\u2019s lifeFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s pretend my adversary is right. Let us say that a fetus is in fact a living breathing person, and acting on abortion is committing murder. Now we have an entirely different issue. What happens in a situation where the mother could die from the pregnancy? If abortion is banned, the most obvious answer is that she will die. Whether this will or will not occur a majority of time is erroneous, but claiming that abortion should be outlawed all together would give no choice to the mother in this situation if it did actually happen. These are just a few facts on how many pregnancies can be fatal. \u201cGlobally, an estimated 287,000 maternal deaths occurred in 2010\u201d \u201cOf all pregnancies anywhere, 15 percent will have a potentially fatal complication. In the developing world, having a baby will be the riskiest thing a woman will do. \u201cNow there are a few ways we can look at this. If this is an early term pregnancy and we know for a fact, that if the pregnancy continued the mother would die. There is a big problem with this and it is cited and acknowledged by multiple people(A) If the pregnancy continues, the mother will die. If the mother dies, the child will die.(B) If the pregnancy is ended through abortion, the child will die, but the mother will live.Now you face a dilemma. Either way the child is going to die, so the only just cause is to save the mother. That is one way an abortion should be justified and not illegal in all circumstances. Now let us review a situation in which the baby could live if the mother would die. (A) Having the child will result in the death of the mother, but the child can be saved(B) Ending the Childs life would save the motherNow there is a much bigger dilemma. A life is going to end either way, so we have to gauge the value of a life. There is no objective way to judge this. Imgaine if a robber breaks into your house and points a gun at your wife and newborn child. He then gives you the choice that one may live and the other may die. He even allows you time to discuss this with your wife to see if she is willing to die. This is a situation that surpasses common law because of the situation. Much like murder in the case of self defense. While murder is wrong, it is justified within the situation. This is almost the same situation with abortion, with fatal situations playing the role of the robber. There is no way for anyone outside of that family to judge the value of a life. This is a difficult circumstance to be put in, but with the child having no way to respond in both situations, the only viable way to judge this is let the parents decide. In the case of abortion they have never seen this child, or have not developed the same type of connection in which the husband and wife have. Imagine if you are with a girl for 7 years, and at the age of 25 she encounters this situation. A good amount of people would choose to keep the wife alive or want their wife to stay alive. The main thing is, that they are allowed to have that choice. When my adversary is claiming, that there is no situation in which abortion should be allowed. He is taking his perspective of abortion and what he would do in this situation, and applying it for all situations and circumstances like this. This can and should not be done. In this type of situation, only that family has the right to choose the outcome. Contention 3Abortion in cases of rape. Now if we can condone abortion in the previous situation, and say that we do in fact have a reason to allow abortion and end a \u201clife\u201d, let us go to the next most logical step. Again imagine a 16 year old girl walking home from school. She is raped and gets pregnant. If we are not allowing her the right to have an abortion, we are essentially screwing up her life or even potentially killing her future. She had no say in what happened, because of someone else\u2019s choice, she has to bear this child. If we make it illegal, she is forced to bear this child for months. Suffer the pain and agony of going through this pregnancy. Endure the emotional and mental stress of someone else\u2019s indiscretion. It could mess up her grades in school, and she could be held back. Even if she forced her to have the child, some states give the rapist visitation rights! That would be more of an emotional bullet. Again this was not her choice to go through this pain for months on end, with the possibility of it messing up her future. In regards to this situation, it is her choice to do what she wants. If she wants to bear the child because of moral and ethical reasons that is fine. If she does not want to suffer through the pain and agony of pregnancy at such an early age, we should also give her the option to opt out. This was not her choice or was caused by any action of her own. It is her body, and we are forcing pain on her in which she did accept or welcome. Some facts on rape related pregnancies that show common they are\u201cthe national rape-related pregnancy rate is 5.0% per rape among victims of reproductive age (aged 12 to 45); among adult women an estimated 32,101 pregnancies result from rape each year. Among 34 cases of rape-related pregnancy, the majority occurred among adolescents and resulted from assault by a known, often related perpetrator.\u201dWith it happening more often than we think, I think it is only acceptable that we give the woman the right to choose what to do in this situation. It is not our place to issue and objective commandment or law, saying that she must suffer for the mistakes of others. We all are not religious, and hold to such an ideology. In Closing.This debate is about one of two choices. First we can make abortion illegal regardless of all circumstances, and not have a viable option when extreme cases do arrive. Second we could leave the option on the table for certain situations that go beyond the norm. How often it may or may not occur should be non factor. If we make this illegal and take it away all together, we are putting people in impossible situations. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... http://www.savethemothers.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Abortion should remain legal in the US",
            "conclusion": "Abortion should remain legal in the US",
            "premise": "First things first: When making this debate, I was in a rush and I had copied the debate itinerary from another one of my debates, and forgot to change the settings so that this would be a 4 round debate. I have spoken with Nonsense, and we have agreed to continue the debate as normal, and in place of a fourth round, I will start a new 1 round debate which will act as the round for our rebuttals and conclusions. Thanks to the Con for accepting this debate! I wish this to be a fair and great debate! To reiterate, I will be arguing the following statement: \"Abortion should remain legal in the United States.\" With that, I will clarify the conditions of my contention. I am arguing that any abortion restrictions and laws should remain as they are, with no suggested changes or additions. I am arguing that current abortion regulations need to stay the way they are. This means that my contention also suggests that abortion should not be outlawed, and that other forms of abortion should not be made legal if not already. This is an important part of my argument. Also, while my personal views on abortion are varied, I still argue my statement because I know it is the best for society. I encourage any readers and also the Con to take an unbiased approach to reading and taking part in this debate. Now, my first argument: I: Women have the right to choose what to do with their body It is a known fact and idea, that everyone is entitled to the right to choose. To choose what brand of food they wish to buy from the store, or what color to die their hair. We also have the right to choose on decisions that have to do with our bodies. In a life or death situation for another person, legally, you have the right to choose whether you want to donate the means to save that person's life (without legal consequences). [1] In the same way, we are also entitled to choice when it comes to things that have immediate or prolonged consequences, such as committing a crime or doing drugs. Stretching that idea out, women have the right to have an abortion, as it is a part of their body. We know this because the society we live in is all based off of the free choice of Americans. At the current standards, a woman seeking an abortion goes through many steps to actually terminate her pregnancy. Depending on the state, some are required to go through counseling, and permission from a parent (in minors) or a doctor-- however, all over America, women seeking an abortion go through the shaming of society of their decision, while still making the decision to terminate their pregnancy. [2] We know that a lot of things are being done to deter that choice, but like a good and civilized society, we still allow those women to have their freedom of choice. II: Personhood doesn't begin until viability After arguing the reasoning as to why women undoubtedly have the right to their own body, the question still remains: when do fetuses have the right to their own body? It is a known fact, in science and in the law, that life in the womb begins when the fetus is capable of living on its own. When is this? \"..20 to 35 percent of babies born at 23 weeks of gestation survive, while 50 to 70 percent of babies born at 24 to 25 weeks, and more than 90 percent born at 26 to 27 weeks, survive.\"[3] So generally, fetuses are more than likely to be considered viable at 26-27 weeks, and in the most rare cases, maybe 23 weeks. A vast majority of states ban abortions after 20 weeks, while some even ban abortions after12 weeks. [4] Abortion isn't even legal while the fetus is considered viable! So, if the fetus is not yet its own person, not yet capable of even surviving outside of the womb, then it is assumed that everything is indeed a part of the woman's body. This means until the fetus has reached personhood, women have the right to choose what to do withtheir body. This means that if abortion is only legal while the fetus is not capable of living on its own, then abortion is not an illegal practice, and should remain a legal option to women in early stages of pregnancy. III: Completely enforcing anti-abortion laws is impossible Let's assume just momentarily that abortion was banned everywhere. In a situation where Congress easily passed legislation that prevented women from getting abortions in any conditions, and no other country in the world provided legal options to terminate a pregnancy. This would still not prevent abortions from occurring. Women seeking an abortion for whatever reason, are more than likely still going to get an abortion in whatever way possible, despite it being illegal. People argue all the time, \"If you make guns illegal, people are still going to get guns, just illegally.\" This is a true statement that has just as much truth when it comes to abortions. You just simply can't forbid a woman from terminating her pregnancy and hope that laws and regulations are going to act as a deterrent in a world like that. This leads to my next argument; IV: The risk of illegal abortions This is my last and most important argument. In that country where no woman could legally get an abortion, they will find a way to get one should their situation be that desperate. This will lead to illegal abortions, which are not safe at all. When a person that decides they cannot have a baby for social or financial reasons, and they are determined that they do not have the means to bring a child into the world, then they will also be determined to end that pregnancy in anyway possible. This is a sad but absolutely true statement. Illegal abortions took place in the so called back-alleys, and they were not safe or something anyone wanted to think about. Before Roe v. Wade, illegal abortions were done in many terrible ways, some of which including coat hangers, illegal drugs, knitting needles or even a punch to the stomach. These methods were unsafe, and led to many women dying as a result of it. The statistics are saddening. [5] It has been wisely said, \"Roe v. Wade was not the beginning of abortions, but rather the end of women dying because of them.\" This is my strongest and main argument to keeping abortion legal in the United States. Abortion needs to remain to be a legal option for women, as it is their choice, and it is not up to anyone else. Whether we disagree with their decisions or not, certified abortion clinics should remain to be legally open to any women in any circumstances. [1]https://www.academia.edu......

            "premise": "I want to thank my opponent for giving a more substantial response this time.I and V. The right to not have a child if you don't want to.In this round, Pro combined I and V into one argument. In the previous round, he had dropped I. That argument was circular, but V had a missing premise. I attempted to provide a premise that would make the argument valid, but Pro rejected that premise. He didn't replace it with anything else, though, so that leaves his argument invalid. He essentially just pounds the podium, and says, \"The government should not force pregnant women to have a child,\" which is the issue under dispute.II. Unsafe abortions.In the original round, his argument from unsafe abortions was invalid because there was a missing premise. In the next round, he just restated it without defending it against my critique. In this round, he restates it, but then adds that the government should protect the life of women over that of fetuses. But the problem with this argument is that unless a woman's health were seriously at risk, abortion is optional. The government wouldn't be endagering women by prohibiting abortion. Women who chose to have illegal abortions would be endangering themselves. Moreover, if abortion is a serious moral crime, it doesn't make sense to keep it legal to protect those who choose to do it. Should we make burglery legal so that it will be safer for people to rob homes? Surely not!IV. Protests.Earlier, I made two points: (1) that there would be protests whether abortion is legal or not, and (2) this is irrelevant to whether abortion should be legal or not. In answer to 1, Pro doesn't deny that there would be protests either way; he just says there would be more if abortion were illegal. I concede that point. However, it is still irrelevant to the question of whether abortion should be legal or not.VI. might become a criminal. (I accidentally labled this V in the last round.)Earlier, I said you can't kill criminals. Pro corrected me by saying you can kill some of them. But that doesn't help his case because my point was that if you can't even kill criminals who are guilty, then surely you can't kill the unborn who are innocent. Even if there are some criminials who it's okay to kill, it doesn't follow that you can therefore go ahead and kill the innocent, too.He elaborates on how aweful it would be if there were more criminals, but he still doesn't answer my objection. In what universe is it okay to kill the innocent just because they might some day become criminals? That makes no sense.VII. Time, work, and money (I accidentally labled this VI in the last round.)Pro neglected in the last round to explain how it follows that it's okay to kill the unborn if it takes a lot of time, work, and money to raise them after they're born. In this round, he still didn't make that connection. Instead, he said the fetus is not a human. Well, that's a different argument altogether. I'll deal with that in a minute, but in the meantime, he still needs to provide the missing premise that explains how it follows that it's okay to kill the unborn as long as raising them takes a lot of time, work, and money.VIII. The unborn are not humanIf the unborn are not human, then that renders all of Pro's previous arguments null and void because if it's not human, then you don't need all these justifications for killing it any more than you need justification for any other elective surgery. A person born with an extra finger doesn't need any justiication to have it removed other than the fact that he wants to.But his claim that the unborn are not human is plainly false. Does he imagine there's a possum in there? Or perhaps a tomatoe? We know it's a human because its parents are human, it has human DNA, and if allowed to it will go through every stage of human development. He cites an online dictionary to prove that fetuses are not human, but if you click on over, the definition does not actually exclude fetuses from humanity. So his source does not support his argument.IX. Pro-lifers are hypocrits because they are okay with abortion in the case of rape and incest.That's true of some pro-lifers, but not all. Anyway, this arguments commits the ad hominem fallacy because he's attacking the character of pro-lifers rather than their arguments. This is the mother of all non-sequiturs. It doesn't follow that because some pro-lifers are hypocrits that therefore the pro-life position is false. And it certainly doesn't support his claim that abortions ought to be legal. We can dismiss this argument as irrelevant.ConclusionPro dropped III in the last round, and he hasn't picked it back up. That's nine arguments so far, and every one of them has failed. I wonder if we'll get some new arguments in the next round. Or maybe he'll patch some of these up a bit. We'll see.",

            "premise": "My opponent's arguments almost invariably rely on the premise that abortion is not homicide - or that foetuses have no right to life. Obviously if this premise were true then all of Pro's arguments would be be perfectly correct. If we only consider the welfare of the mother then it is clear that we ought to allow her to abort safely and easily. However if the premise is false, and abortion is indeed homicide, then my opponent is guilty of making false syllogisms. Note that I will be arguing that abortion should not be legal in all cases apart from cases where the mother would be under severe physical risk if she were to continue the pregnancy. Why abortion is homicide P1: Abortion is the deliberate killing of a human foetus by another, P2: Homicide is the killing of one human being by another, (1) P3: A human foetus is a human being, C: Abortion is homicide Homicide is illegal (apart from justified homicide, but abortion does not fall under this bracket), and so if abortion is homicide, then it logically follows that abortion should also be illegal. I do not know which (if any) of my premises my opponent disputes, so I will wait until he/she voices her objections. Response to Pro My opponent's main argument is that 'Outlawing abortion will not stop abortion'. However, this is a nonsensical argument to use in opposition to outlawing abortion. We outlaw actions because they are immoral (in general), irrespective of whether outlawing the action would actually stop the action. For example, outlawing theft does not stop theft, but it is non sequitur to suppose that this is any reason to legalise theft. The same applies to murder, slavery, torture and many other horrible things. Pro also seems to have forgotten the fact that pregnant women choose to have an illegal abortion, it's not as if they are forced into it against their will (even in cases of this, the problem to be dealt with is to punish the person who forces the woman to abort, not to legalise abortion). Therefore, as women choose to have an illegal abortion, knowing that it is a dangerous procedure, they are willingly putting themselves in danger and therefore they are partially culpable. The woman can simply choose to not have an abortion. Ultimately, abortion is not a necessity. My opponent raises the problem of pregnancies caused by rape, and goes on to liken it to a forced organ donation. Yet this is a poor analogy for two reasons: 1. There is an unique obligation in society for parents to protect their children, yet there is no obligation to protect other people. If we change the analogy to a scenario where a young child will die if his mother does not donate a kidney to him, it would be abhorrent for the mother to then refuse to do so. 2. Refusing to donate a kidney to someone who needs it in order to live is different to directly killing someone. The former is just letting someone die naturally, whereas the latter is the direct and deliberate murder of someone. Abortion is the direct killing of the foetus, whereas refusing to donate a kidney is letting someone die naturally. Pro goes on to say that legal abortion is necessary to allow medically necessary abortions (which I take to mean cases where the abortion is to save the mother's life). Apart from the fact that it is perfectly possible to allow medically necessary abortions and not abortions in other circumstances, only 0.00014% (2) of abortions in the past ten years in the UK have been to save the mothers life. It is absurd to suggest that we should make the 99.99986% other abortions legal for such a negligible minority of cases, especially considering then in every single one of these cases a human life is destroyed unjustly. The last argument presented is that legal abortion is a relatively safe procedure. Yet this only considers the safety of the mother, it is the most unsafe procedure possible for the foetus. Furthermore, just because something is safe it does not mean that it should be legal. Tax avoidance is safe, but it does not follow that tax avoidance should be legal.

            "premise": "\"The prevention of harm to the woman is not the only reason for abortion, an abortion could be used for other reasons such as birth control, the prevention of a fetus with deformities from having a life of suffering, among other reasons.\" Yes, but the prevention of harm to the woman is the only valid legal reason, and that reason was essentially decided along ethical lines \u2013 it's also the only valid ethical reason. A fetus with deformities? Which deformities? What's a \"life of suffering?\" People with disabilities aren't all wallowing in misery. \"An abortion could be necessary when it is too late to use other methods of birth control. And it doesn't make sense to say that women will always get an abortion instead of using other methods of birth control earlier. A woman will realize that it is easier to use protection opposed to not and always having to get abortions.\" That is absolutely true. I'm saying that when an abortion is no longer necessary, because of alternative treatments, there is no longer a compelling interest for abortions to be legal. \"It is not possible to determine? Do you consider sperm to be human? Many people let millions of sperm die every day, but that will never be illegal. Some people think that a fetus becomes human when it can survive outside of the body. Some people think it becomes a human after it leaves the body. There can be many points when a fetus could be considered human, but the moment of conception is certainly not one of them. The moment of conception merely creates a cluster of cells that is incapable of thinking, showing emotion, of being conscious. A woman can choose where to draw the line of when the fetus is human, making abortion illegal is not the solution.\" You ignore my point, and then drew completely different conclusions from your interpretation of it. The point is that human life exists along a continuum, and along that continuum there exist stages where, as you said \"a fetus could be considered human.\" I am not arguing that conception is such a stage, but I don't need to because the morning after pill fixes that problem without abortion. Abortion is a procedure that is not performed on unfertilized eggs and sperm, or even on early stage zygotes, but on embryos and fetuses. The discussion of the validity of human life is only valid within this range. \"That may be true, but that 'someday' hasn't happened yet. For now, abortion must remain legal.\" This is not what you were arguing. You were arguing that \"abortion should remain legal\" because \"women should have the right to their own bodies, not the government. A fetus is not a human, it is a potential human. Because of that, a potential human does not have any rights.\" A fetus may, in fact, have rights, because it may be human, and not merely a potential human. Just as you said, definitions differ. By asserting that the fetus' rights are never taken into account, you are making an argument that abortions are justified no matter what happens. After all, if one being has rights and the other does not, then there is nothing stopping the one being from doing as it wishes to the other. I am arguing that abortion rights should not remain legal indefinitely, as you have proposed, because there may (and likely will) come a time when abortion is no longer a valid ethical risk to take. Other Reasons for Abortion \"A woman may want to get an abortion because she can't pay for the child. Would you want to be paying with your tax dollars for those unplanned children?\" Sure. I like people more than things. But seriously, she could have the child adopted, or be required to seek potential adoptive parents before birth. There are certainly enough people who would like to have children. \"Also, would you really deny a rape victim from having an abortion?\" Yes. Potential should not be thwarted because of origin. \"Would you expect her to care for a baby she didn't ask for, have to endure 9 months of pregnancy and labor, and have that baby as a reminder of the incident and that the child carries the genes of a rapist?\" 1.I am positing that a procedure may exist to remove the child safely from the mother and incubate it so that she can get on with her life. When this happens, labor pains can no longer be taken into account as an ethical concern. 2.The \"genes of a rapist\" argument is eugenics speak. Many children of rape are adopted and go on to live 'normal' lives. Rape is borne out of the effects of certain experiences on those organisms that develop as a consequence of their genes. You can not inherent actions, just (possibly) a likelihood to commit certain actions given similar circumstances. http://forums.adoption.com... \" Also, it shouldn't only be for a rape victim, there are other woman who don't want to carry that fetus around for 9 months that is an accident that a lot of parents would love less than a planned child.\" This is an argument for better birth control, not abortion. \" And think of all the unplanned children adding to the population that is already starting to overcrowd, and how a kid would react if they found out that they were an accident.\" This is also an argument for better birth control, not abortion.",

            "premise": "First I want to specify that, although I believe abortion should be legal, it should only be when something is wrong with the pregnancy. I feel this way because when the mother to be's life is in danger due to a failed surgery, and infection, or any other possible failure of pregnancy, it is not right to force her to live out the pregnancy, if she feels it is not worth the risk. In 2013, approximately 289000 women died due to failed childbirth, according to http://www.who.int.... http://www.cdc.gov... says that almost 4,000,000 babies are born each year, meaning that in 7% of births, approximately, the mother dies. That is a lot of mother's deaths. However, the number of failed pregnancies that kill mothers compared to the number of deaths to mothers during abortion is very high. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1/100000 (or .001%) of abortions resulted in the mothers death in 2010. Based on a 2010 study by Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, most fetuses can't feel pain until at least their 26th week. Most abortions take place before week 13. Only 1.4% occurred after week 21, which means that even less than that occur where the baby feels pain, according to the website http://www.abort73.com.... Based on a University of California at San Francisco study, women denied abortions became 3 times as likely to be below the poverty level than women granted access to abortions. 76% of the people rejected access needed unemployment benefits, compared to the 44% of women who received abortions. Also, people rejected access to abortions due to having an abusive partner were over twice as likely to become victims of domestic violence.This is my proof that says that abortion should be legal.

            "premise": "1. What are the burdens? The resolution states that abortion shouldn\u2019t be legal in any situation. Pro\u2019s burden, therefore, is to show that abortion should be legally impermissible. My burden is to show that, in at least one situation, abortion should be permissible. 2. Life of the motherI believe that abortion ought to be legal in cases where there is a threat to the mother\u2019s life when not aborting. The American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians explains, \u201cAbortions are necessary in a number of circumstances to save the life of a woman or to preserve her health. Unfortunately, pregnancy is not a risk-free life event.\u201d [1] The cases where abortion is necessary include severe infections, heart failure and severe cases of preeclampsia [2].Pro might argue that there are alternatives in such cases, and that medical technology has sufficiently progressed to prevent necessity of an abortion. First, those are wrong misconceptions, and abortions are actually often necessary. Second, even if that were the case, when there is a better chance at the life of the mother being saved from an abortion, it ought to be done. Why value the mother\u2019s life over the life of the fetus? First, the fetus lacks any sentience or ability to experience sensation. Morality hinges on fulfilling interests, and the fetus does not have an interest to avoid death. Second, if the child is born without a mother, there might be multiple psychological difficulties faced by the child -- which are definitely harmful. 3. LibertyPeople have the liberty to do whatever they want -- without the state controlling them -- unless this liberty causes actual harm to non-consensual others [3]. The reason to support this is that the government lacks any legitimacy if it legislates against self-regarding acts. The purpose of government is to prevent harm from others, else people don\u2019t recognize the legitimacy of the state. Abortion doesn\u2019t actually \u201charm\u201d anyone, because the fetus is unable to feel or perceive anything [4, 5]. Lacking any interest, the fetus does not experience any harm from an abortion, so nobody who doesn\u2019t consent to the abortion is harmed. As such, the right to have an abortion is a part of this liberty. 4. ConclusionFirst, I have shown that abortion should be permitted in cases where the mother\u2019s life depends on it, since the state ought to value the mother\u2019s life over the fetus\u2019s life. Second, I have shown that the right to have an abortion is an essential part of liberty since it causes no harm to the interests of a non-consensual other. For those two reasons, vote Con.

I suggest they take a more altruistic approach and think of people who don't necessarily share their view. According to a national poll, about 70% of people believe that abortion should be legal and many of them believe that life begins at birth. I actually do concede that morals did formulate some of the current laws, but it is the morals of citizens-- the nation's conscience of which most believe in that abortion should be available. It is \"we the people of the United States,\" therefore if legal decisions are based on the morals of citizens who agree with abortion than there is no debate-- it is already decided.",

If we take away the freedom for a woman to have an abortion, anyone can make the argument to take away any other freedoms. What if someone's religion is that you must have a male be your first born (which it is in some cultures). If abortion is illegal than that would contradict the 1st amendment in the constitution saying that we must have freedom of religion. If we don't have freedom of religion than what was the purpose of the founding of this country. Most of the people left Europe to the United States for freedom of religion. As much as I think abortion is a morally wrong thing, I don't get a say to what people have a right and wrong to do.

            "conclusion": "Abotion should be legal",
            "premise": "I will begin by stating my argument against abortion, and then respond to my opponent's points. To clarify, I will be arguing that abortion should not be legal, apart from cases where it is a necessary medical procedure in order to save the life of the mother. Why abortion should be illegal My argument is as follows: Premise 1: Abortion is the deliberate killing of a human foetus Premise 2: A human foetus is alive, and so therefore a human foetus is a living human being Premise 3: It is not morally justified to remove the life of a human being Premise 4: Only that which is morally justified should be legal Conclusion: Abortion should not be legal Now I will support my premises: Premise 1 Abortion is defined as: 'Expulsion from the uterus of the products of conception before the fetus is viable.' (1) We know, due to the definition of 'viable' in this context, that this procedure will necessarily kill the foetus. Therefore, abortion is the deliberate killing of a human foetus. Premise 2 First I will affirm that a foetus is alive, then I will use this conclusion to affirm that a human foetus is a human being. Life is defined as: 'The condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death' (2) Foetuses grow and are subject to continual change preceding death (3). They have the capacity for reproduction given time to develop naturally. Furthermore, to suppose that a foetus is not alive is to either state that a foetus is dead or inanimate. It is not dead because something must have once lived in order to be dead, and it is not inanimate (4). Therefore, a human foetus is alive. All life is characterised into species (5), and as we have affirmed that a human foetus is alive we must also accept that it must belong to a particular species. A human foetus's genetic makeup is most similar to the genetic makeup of the species homo sapiens and so a human foetus is human (which perhaps goes without saying, as if it was not human then we would not refer to it as a human foetus). Therefore, a human foetus is human. Therefore, a human foetus is a human life, which is to say that it is a living human being. Premise 3 To say that it is not morally justified to remove the life of a human being is to say that we ought not to kill human beings. There are many reasons why I am justified in asserting this moral truth: Rule Utilitarian approach - Having a rule stating 'do not kill human beings' will result in a greater amount of happiness than the absence of such a rule, therefore this it is moral to abide to this rule. Deontologist approach - Killing of a human being is wrong because it is a maxim that cannot be universalised; no rational human being would freely consent to live in a society that permitted the killing of human beings. Evolutionist approach - Permitting the killing of human beings is evolutionarily disastrous, for obvious reasons. The killing of human beings is not morally justified according to the vast majority of normative ethical theories. If my opponent disagrees and argues that killing of human beings is justified (aside from cases of self-defence), then she will have the burden of proof, as she is making the positive claim that killing of human beings is morally justified. Therefore, it is not morally justifiable to remove the life of a human being. Premise 4 Although it seems pretty common-sensical that only morally justifiable actions should be legal, I will analyse it under the main normative ethical theories in order to demonstrate why only morally justifiable actions should be legal. Rule Utilitarian approach - Having a rule stating 'legally permit immoral actions' will result in a lesser amount of happiness than a rule saying 'legally prohibit immoral actions', therefore this it is moral to abide to the rule that we should not legally permit immoral actions. Deontologist approach - Legally permitting immoral actions is wrong because it is a maxim that cannot be universalised; no rational human being would freely consent to live in a society that permitted immoral actions. Evolutionist approach - Permitting immoral actions will create a society where immoral actions are prevalent, this will negatively effect the quality of our offspring and so it is not evolutionarily beneficial. I assume that my opponent agrees with premise 4, but if not, the above analysis verifies it. Therefore, only that which is morally justifiable should be legal. As I have now asserted the veracity of all my premises, the conclusion deductively follows. Therefore, abortion should not be legal. Argument from Consistency In order to hold a rational moral assertion, it must be consistent. So, in order to be rational, we must abide by the maxim: 'Treat someone as we would consent to be treated if we were in the same situation as that someone.' An example of moral inconsistency would be stating: 'I am morally justified in throwing sticks at my mother, but I would not consent to having sticks thrown at me if I was in the same situation as my mother'. I argue that abortion is inconsistent according to these terms. To assert that abortion is morally justified is to be morally inconsistent, as it is equivalent to saying: 'I am morally justified in killing a human foetus, but I would not consent to being killed if I was a human foetus.' Unless, of course, the pro-abortionist would consent to being killed if they were a human foetus, but I highly doubt they would be serious in holding this conviction. This becomes especially prevalent because it is not hypothetical, as everyone was once a foetus and so nobody can be exempt from the consistency criteria. As asserting the moral permissibility of abortion is inconsistent, it is an irrational moral belief. It is absurd to suggest that actions should be legalised if one cannot be rational in supporting them, so abortion should not be legal. I will now respond to all my opponent's arguments within the character limit I have. 'Abortion is about allowing woman the right to make choices about when they want to have children in relation to their age, financial stability & relationship stability. It is the not the place of government to legislate against woman's choices.' It is definitely the government's choice to legislate against women's choices if the choice harms another human being, as abortion does. It would be odd to suggest that the government should not legislate against murder simply by virtue of the fact that a woman chose to commit it. 'Raising a child is not an easy task & requires social & emotional commitment coupled with financial resources. As such if a person feels they are not ready for a child, it means the pregnancy is unwanted & resultant allowing a fetus to grow into a child is worse than abortion since the resultant child will grow in a non conducive & destructive environment without the love, care & stability that a child needs.' 'Abortion prevent unwanted & unplanned pregnancies which prevents child neglect since the mother does not want to have children at that moment in time.' I agree, but this is a false dichotomy. A baby can be put up for adoption at birth, so it is not a choice between abortion and raising a child. 'Those see it morally allowable to do abortion should be provided with the means to do so & those who don't believe in abortion should have the choice not to have an abortion' This statement has very strange implications, as it implies that anyone should be allowed to do something so long as they believe that they are morally justified in doing so. Yet this would mean that we should allow murderers who believe that their actions are morally justified to commit murder. 'A fetus is not legally or scientifically a person or human being so abortion cannot be equated to murder or taking a life since the fetus is not a person nor alive.' See premise 2 of my initial argument. 'A fetus is like a brain dead person with no self awareness or consciousness so it is actually dead.' Definition of dead: 'Having lost life' (6). A foetus has never lost its life (irrespective of whether it ever had life) and so cannot be dead. 'Prohibiting abortions doesn't stop abortions, women would simply seek abortions via illegal means which are unsafe & illegal, so it is better to provide woman with safe & legal ways to do an abortion.' If one freely chooses to murder their foetus then they are, to some extent, forfeiting their protection. Let me suppose an analogy; legalising burglary would make burglaries much safer for burglars, yet this is hardly a valid justification for legalising burglary. The same applies with abortion. I agree that prohibiting abortion does not stop abortions altogether, but it reduces them significantly. In 1969 (when legal abortion facilities were implemented) there were 53643 abortions compared to 21400 when abortion was illegal in 1966 (7). This is 32243 abortions that were caused by the legalisation of abortion. I have run out of characters now, but I will finish rebutting my opponent's arguments in round 2.

            "conclusion": "Abortion should be legal",
            "premise": "I guess we can thank Pro for keeping it short since there are so many rounds.In the last round, Pro gave three arguments for why he thinks abortion should be legal. I answered all three arguments, explaining why each one fails to establish the resolve. Pro didn't even attempt to defend any of those argument. He just let us know that \"My arguments are not false\" and that he \"stated each of my arguments in more than one sentence\" in order to \"prove that those arguments are valid.\" He dropped I and III, and all he did was restate II without defending it against my critique. There's still a missing premise in that argument.Pro expressed his wish that I would make an argument against the right to have an abortion. Doing that would take up space, though, and as I pointed out in the last round, Pro did not stipulate that the burden of proof would be shared in this debate. I have not agreed to accept the burden of proof, so I'm not going to waste space trying to make a case against abortion unless that's the only way I can refute his arguments.Pro has introduced some new arguments, so let's look at those.IV. If abortion is illegal than there will be a lot more protests going on.I'm not really sure how this is relevant. Whether abortion is legal or illegal, there are going to be protests. If it's legal, pro-lifers are going to organize protests (as they do).[1] If it's illegal, pro-choicers are going to organize protests. So what? This is not relevant to the resolve.V. Women who are pregnant will have no choice but to give birth to a child even if they don't want to.I'll probably be accused of a strawman argument, but I'm going to take a stab at supplying the missing premise to make this argument valid.1. If abortion is illegal, then pregnant women will be required to given birth even if they don't want to.2. Nobody should be legally rquired to do something they don't want to.3. Therefore, abortion should not be illegal.That second premise is obviously false, which can be demonstrated with a reductio ad absurdum argument, like so:2. Nobody should be legally required to do something they don't want to.4. Bubba doesn't want to drive under the speed limit.5. Therefore, Bubba should not be required to drive under the speed limit.Since it is perfectly justified to forbid Bubba from speeding even though he wants to speed, premise 2 is obviously false.I suspect Pro will accuse me of making a strawman argument since Pro never asserted 2. But if Pro rejects 2, then he needs to replace it with a different premise in order to make his argument valid.V. If that child is not raised well then there will be a good chance that the child will become a criminal.Again, I'm not really sure how this is relevant. What exactly is the argument here? What is the hidden premise? I'm guessing it something like this:1. If an unborn fetus might grow up to be a criminal, then a mother should have the right to abort it.2. Any child might grow up to be a criminial.3. Therefore, all mothers should have the right to abort their young.This is a strange argument. The mere possibility that the fetus might grow up to be a criminal is no justification for killing it. We don't even have the right to kill people who have already grown up and actually become criminials, so how can we justify killing a fetus who hasn't committed any crimes at all yet? Surely, there's more to this argument than Pro is telling us. As it stands, this argument is fallacious.VI. Raising a child takes a lot of time, work, and money, which some people don't haveApparently, if raising a child takes a lot of time, money, and work, it's okay to kill it. Well, I think Pro needs to give us a little more argument before this one will go through. How does it follow that because having a child takes a lot of time, money, and work, that women are therefore justified in abortion? Pro doesn't tell us, so this really doesn't even amount to an argument.ConclusionPro just asserts these things as if he thinks it's obvious that his conclusion follows, but it is far from obvious to me. He needs to tell us how it follows from these various statements that abortion ought to be legal. These statements really don't even amount to arguments. I've done the best I can to turn some of them into arguments, but I've had to make guesses about Pro's premises to do it. But even my best guesses don't salvage his arguments. They all fail anyway.[1] http://texasrallyforlife.org...",

            "conclusion": "Abortion should be legal",
            "premise": "pardon my delayed response, I'd like to thank my opponent for starting this debate.ladies and gentlemen, what is the definition of 'legal'? legal [adj]: permitted by law.Well, we could have seen that one coming. But the point of this is that if abortion would be illegal then there won't be ANY exceptions to that rule, no situations will be fit for an abortion legally. The structure of my argument is three-fold. One will be dealing with the morality of the action itself, the second one will deal with special exceptions and the third one will deal with how far legal actions can go. In order to win the debate my opponent must not only prove that there is no morally acceptable situation in which abortion is the answer but also that the best way to fight abortion is with legal constraints, he must defend ALL RESOLUTION CONDITION that I'll put forth. With that in mind, let us move on to the first section:Is it morally correct?Let's picture a scenario: you're young, your free and you just finished any and all educational paths that you wanted to finish. You, being a dreamer, want to travel the world and experience things you've never experienced. You want to love, to be loved and to enjoy life to the fullest. This little fantasy isn't so far fetched and sounds rather enjoyable, right? Now, let's say that I come along and say: \"You're not allowed to go anywhere\" and tie you to the house. You're stuck, cannot enjoy life, cannot chase your dreams and forced to sit around the house doing whatever needs to be done. you never live because I said that you had to stay in your home and are not allowed to leave. Did I violate your right? Is it morally correct of me to obligate you to abandon your dreams? Of course it isn't. But this is happening every day everywhere and we cannot deny that.But what if we replace me in the story with an infant, a child? Is it still morally incorrect? forcing a woman to have a child she does not want and therefore effectively \"tying her to the house\" is just as bad as barricading the door. It's her body and legally obligating her to follow the law and denying her the right to chose is just as wrong as the opposite pole. Why should we focus on the rights of the child, a random group of cells that do not posses self-awareness, cannot think, does not feel and in no aspect is more of an human than any of the bacterial clusters that live in your intestines over the rights of the living mother that HAS a life. The person that is currently self-aware and sentient? what makes the child more important than the mother and/or the father that will also indirectly be tied in this? Resolution condition 1: If my opponent cannot properly defend that the unborn child is more worthy of rights than the parents he has lost this debate, take note of that dear readers.A child is not a human anymore than a blueprint is a house. it has all the potentials to be a house, but it isn't a house. demolishing an already built structure just so the blueprint gets a chance to be a house as well is absurd. Abortion is just as moral as violating human rights, which would you rather choose?Is it never acceptable?If we circle back to the definition of legal: something not permitted by law. Does this mean that there are no valid exceptions? We must assume so, because no matter what happens doctors are not above the law. If the mother isn't in grave danger the operation itself would become illegal and thus won't be performed. Isn't this reasonable? but wait, what about the two situations already described by my opponent?\"the only reason to have a abortion is if you are raped,[or] the mother's life is at risk if she gives birth. \" So, we have two situations where my opponent concedes that abortion might not be such a bad thing. IF the mother's life is in danger the doctor in question has to perform the operation as part of his civil and professional duty. It is in his power to rescue the woman, he is obligated to do so. So we both concede to this point; The doctor is above the law if her life is on the line. However, we do not agree on the former situation: If a woman is raped her life is NOT in danger. She is scarred, she is violated and she is filled with sorrow, anger, fear and disgust, but she isn't in danger. Why is it now suddenly ok to go above the law? Why should she be excluded and why should we go against the right of the child?This leads us to the first major contradiction in my opponents case. When we're not talking about rape a fetus has potential, it might live a great life, could be given away to an orphanage and has rights that must not be violated, its murder. But when the child is a result of rape, it has no potential? What makes this child right less? It had nothing to do with the rape, it's not it's fault. Why should it be discriminated against when some other fetus has all the rights in the world? Does the history of the father make this child any worse? Is it evil and deserves to die because it has a rapist father? It's the same child, it has the same rights.Resolution condition 2: If my opponent cannot defend the paradox that a child that is the result of rape has less rights than any other child, he has lost the debate.Is legal banning a solution? The law is meant to be broken. This isn't something that is generally supported or correct, but it is still so. The harder we press to ban a certain matter the more active it gets. You can look at drug abuse and prostitution to see that. It's still peaking again and again, underground it flows like water and we cannot stop it, we cannot monitor it. Whatever is banned becomes black market material. Abortion is no different. Abortion is LEGAL and still over 700.000 die from ILLEGAL operations[1]. If abortion is banned illegal operations will only increase, will only spiral out of control. When something is legal we have a chance to monitor it, tax it and make sure safety regulations and health conditions are always met. with abortion becoming black we can no longer monitor it, it becomes hidden, unsafe and dangerous. Think clamping the limbs and dragging them out is bad? Sticking a metal coat hanger inside the genitalia of the woman and scraping the child out is much worse and the child STILL dies. Which leads to the final condition:Resolution condition 3: If my opponent cannot explain how illegal operations can be dealt with in a safe efficient manner, he has lost the debate.Dear readers of the debate, I have specified why the resolution \"Abortion should be illegal\" cannot work, and why it contradicts itself. I have presented my opponent with three vital questions that his entire case must rest on and I wish my opponent to properly answer them; for abortion is more than just a selfish act that allows parents to party a bit longer into the lifetime. Abortion is a tool to aid us in preserving our own human right, our own power to control our own bodies and not be bound to the house by someone that cares not what we think. Abortion is a basic human right, and making it illegal is not an option.1) http://www.genderacrossborders.com...",

            "premise": "Round 2: Should abortion be legal in the U.S.A.? U.S. Constitution Yes, I believe that abortion should be legal in all states and all American women are entitled to choices regarding their own welfare. It is insensitive to dictate what women can and cannot do in a country that promises freedom. Most advocates for our constitution would say that abortion is a violation of our natural rights because \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d (U.S. Declaration of Independence) Although life is promised to each citizen of the United States of America, does a woman\u2019s underdeveloped fetus count? No, they are not legally citizens until birth. With that take into account, we also notice that the constitution was written to defend freedom and protect all of its citizens. \"\u2026 establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare \u2026\" (Preamble- U.S. Constitution) I have no right to claim that any life is less valuable than another, but for the sake of our constitution- the basis on which our country was developed- we must protect women's rights over their own bodies. Protection of women\u2019s choice should be reserved regardless of the circumstances. Even some of our greatest leaders agree.... \"You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health. And reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal, safe abortion.\" -Hilary Clinton \"No politician should make decisions about women\u2019s health\" -Barack Obama Modern Law The moral confliction about abortion is that it is considered murder. I disagree. First, allow me give you dictionary.com's definition of murder: \"Law. The killing of another human being under conditions specifically covered in law. In the U.S., special statutory definitions include murder committed with malice aforethought, characterized by deliberation or premeditation or occurring during the commission of another serious crime, as robbery or arson (first-degree murder) and murder by intent but without deliberation or premeditation (second-degree murder)\" dictionary.com In the United States of America it is legal in all 50 states to get an abortion, therefore making it a surgery, not murder. Because abortion is not outlawed in any state, it would be foolish to call abortion \"murder.\" Supreme Courts & Science When the supreme courts faced the legalization of abortion they declared that there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that the fetus is alive, therefore it would be irrational to revoke women\u2019s constitutional rights for ignorance. Scientific studies suggest that life (as we know it) is not developed until the third trimester. Regardless to these laws, rights, and scientific studies, women have rights lawfully and constitutionally, but there has not been enough science to strip them of their rights. The ultimate question is: Who are you to control someone else\u2019s life? (Especially when there are no certain as to when life starts)",

Hence the law should change accordingly to the consensus.Otherwise we're not a democratic nation anymore. Since abortion is widely approved, I believe that it should be legal in whatever countries more people say yes to abortion. 5.Pregnant mothers murder There seems to be an error because you didn't finish the sentence nor did you make a valid argument.However this is rather irrelevant to begin with since we're not debating whatever law is consistent or not. 6.Religion Indeed my opponent is right concerning this. Extra arguments: 1.Abortion is practiced even if its illegal.According to Planned Parenthood, \"In 1972 there were 1,000,000 illegal abortions and 5,000 to 10,000 women died from them.\" When Roe v. Wade passed in 1973 (a year after the above-mentioned statistic), deaths from abortion drastically dropped. This is supported by the National Center for Health Statistics' own statistics. 2.Law doesn't make something right so if abortion is wrong then it still has to be legal because this is a democratic nation hence we have to follow the consensus. However I dont think that abortion is wrong. 3.The government has no right to enforce an opinion on its people if most or even many people disagree. Even if it was a fact the government is allowed to pass a law which contradicts the consensus or even the near majority (unless the near majority is willing to obey) I await my opponents response",

            "premise": "Judges please note: This round is exclusively for arguments; After a thorough research I will try to quote experts who have extensively dealt with the subject of abortion. Proponents, identifying themselves as pro-choice, contend that choosing abortion is a woman's right that should not be limited by governmental or religious authority, and which outweighs any right claimed for an embryo or fetus. They say that pregnant women will resort to unsafe illegal abortions if there is no legal option. Although the Catholic and Lutheran churches oppose abortion, more of their members believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases versus illegal in all or most cases (51% vs. 45%, Lutheran; 48% vs. 45%, Catholic). [1] A woman's risk of dying from having an abortion is 0.6 in 100,000, while the risk of dying from giving birth is around 14 times higher (8.8 in 100,000). [2] The mortality rate of a colonoscopy is more than 40 times greater than that of an abortion. [3] The US Supreme Court has declared abortion to be a \"fundamental right\" guaranteed by the US Constitution. The landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, decided on Jan. 22, 1973 in favor of abortion rights, remains the law of the land. The 7-2 decision stated that the Constitution gives \"a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy,\" and that \"This right of privacy... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\" [4] Personhood begins after a fetus becomes \"viable\" (able to survive outside the womb) or after birth, not at conception. [5] [6]Embryos and fetuses are not independent, self-determining beings, and abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, not a baby. A person's age is calculated from birth date, not conception, and fetuses are not counted in the US Census. The majority opinion in Roe v. Wadestates that \"the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment [of the US Constitution], does not include the unborn.\" [7] A baby should not come into the world unwanted. Having a child is an important decision that requires consideration, preparation, and planning. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment stated that unintended pregnancies are associated with birth defects, low birth weight, maternal depression, increased risk of child abuse, lower educational attainment, delayed entry into prenatal care, a high risk of physical violence during pregnancy, and reduced rates of breastfeeding. [8] 49% of all pregnancies among American women are unintended.[9] Abortion reduces crime. According to a study co-written by Freakonomics co-author Steven D. Levitt, PhD, and published in the peer-reviewed Quarterly Journal of Economics, \"legalized abortion has contributed significantly to recent crime reductions.\" Around 18 years after abortion was legalized, crime rates began to drop abruptly, and crime rates dropped earlier in states that allowed abortion earlier. Because \"women who have abortions are those most at risk to give birth to children who would engage in criminal activity,\" and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments, crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion. [10] Many religious organizations and people of faith support women's reproductive choice.Although many religious groups oppose abortion, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations are all officially pro-choice. [11] [12] [13] The Bible, despite interpretations to the contrary, contains no explicit condemnation of abortion, and does not portray the killing of a fetus as equivalent to the killing of a human being. In Exodus 21:22-25, the crime of causing a woman to miscarry is treated as a property crime, whereas killing the woman is considered murder and is punished with the death penalty. [14] While the Catholic and Lutheran churches oppose abortion, more of their members believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases versus illegal in all or most cases (51% vs. 45%, Lutheran; 48% vs. 45%, Catholic). [15] Joe Biden, 47th US Vice President, stated in Oct. 2012 that \"I accept my church\u2019s position on abortion... But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others...\" [16] SOURCES [1] Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, US Religious Landscape Survey: Religious Beliefs and Practices: Diverse and Politically Relevant, religions.pewforum.org [2] E.G.

For this reason and others, women and men fought for and achieved women's legal right to make their own decisions about abortion. However, there are people in our society who still won't accept this. Some argue that even victims of rape or incest should be forced to have the child. And now, having failed to convince the public, certain of these people have become violent, engaging in a campaign of intimidation and terror aimed at women seeking abortions and health professionals who work at family-planning clinics. Some say these acts will stop abortions, but that is ridiculous. But, the same urgent reasons will exist for safe, legal abortions as have always existed.",

            "premise": "Here is the overview of The United States Pro-Choice Movement, according to Wikipedia (for an example).\"Abortion-rights advocates argue that whether or not a pregnant woman continues with a pregnancy should be her personal choice, as it involves her body, personal health, and future. They also argue that the availability of legal abortions reduces the exposure of women to the risks associated with illegal abortions. More broadly, abortion-rights advocates frame their arguments in terms of individual liberty, reproductive freedom, and reproductive rights. The first of these terms was widely used to describe many of the political movements of the 19th and 20th centuries (such as in the abolition of slavery in Europe and the United States, and in the spread of popular democracy) whereas the latter terms derive from changing perspectives on sexual freedom and bodily integrity. Abortion-rights individuals rarely consider themselves \"pro-abortion\", because they consider termination of a pregnancy as a bodily autonomy issue, and find forced abortion to be as legally and morally indefensible as the outlawing of abortion. Indeed, some who support abortion rights consider themselves opposed to some or all abortions on a moral basis, but believe that abortions would happen in any case and that legal abortion under medically controlled conditions is preferable to illegal back-alley abortion without proper medical supervision. Such people believe the death rate of women due to such procedures in areas where abortions are only available outside of the medical establishment is unacceptable. Some who argue from a philosophical viewpoint believe that an embryo has no rights as it is only a potential and not an actual person and that it should not have rights that override those of the pregnant woman at least until it is viable. Many abortion-rights campaigners also note that some anti-abortion activists also oppose sex education and the ready availability of contraception, two policies which in practice increase the demand for abortion. Proponents of this argument point to cases of areas with limited sex education and contraceptive access that have high abortion rates, either legal or illegal. Some women also travel to another jurisdiction or country where they may obtain an abortion. For example, a large number of Irish women would visit the United Kingdom for abortions, as would Belgian women who travelled to France before Belgium legalized abortion. Similarly, women would travel to the Netherlands when it became legal to have abortions there in the 1970s. Some people who support abortion rights see abortion as a last resort and focus on a number of situations where they feel abortion is a necessary option. Among these situations are those where the woman was raped, her health or life (or that of the fetus) is at risk, contraception was used but failed, the fetus has acute congenital disorder and defects, incest, financial constraints, overpopulation, or she feels unable to raise a child. Some abortion-rights moderates, who would otherwise be willing to accept certain restrictions on abortion, feel that political pragmatism compels them to oppose any such restrictions, as they could be used to form a slippery slope against all abortions. On the other hand, even some pro-choice advocates feel uncomfortable with the use of abortion for sex-selection, as is practised in some countries, such as India.\" [1]Wikipedia is the most reliable source for any argument because it has a much broader overview.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org...",

What exact point in a pregnancy, event horizon if you will, that you think abortion is no longer appropriate?I refer to Con to the previous round...\"I am open to the idea that maybe abortion should be more restricted in the later stages, but being open to that possibility is not the same as just assuming it, I would need to see arguments in support such a thing that can withstand critical scrutiny.\"Since among other things I believe that rights/interests need to be balanced against one another in any given situation where they conflict, I am open to the possibility that maybe in the latter stages of pregnancy the rights/interests equation changes so much that a restriction on the bodily right becomes at some point becomes justifiable.Consider Roe vs Wade...\"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of abortion. It was decided simultaneously with a companion case, Doe v. Bolton. The Court ruled 7\u20132 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's two legitimate interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life.[1] Arguing that these state interests became stronger over the course of a pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the third trimester of pregnancy.\" [1]2. Are we debating restricted abortions or unrestricted abortions?I refer Con to round 1...\"Restricted abortion should be legal = By this I mean abortion should be legal for a woman to choose in the embryonic period of pregnancy.\"I would remind Con as per rules for round 4, Rebuttals to things in previous rounds, No new arguments.Sources[1] https://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "conclusion": "AAN Tour: Voluntary Abortion should be legal",
            "premise": "IntroductionI thank Con for accepting the debate on this controversial topic.I will use this round for my arguments on why \"Voluntary abortion should be legal\".ArgumentsC1: The ability of a woman to control her body is part of her bodily rights.This is the main argument that I'm going to present. My position is centered on the argument of bodily rights and bodily integrity. The violation of these is unethical and intrusive.This argument alone is enough to justify the legalization of abortion.-Bodily integrityThis is the inviolability of the physical body and it involves different rights that should be guaranteed to women. Some of these rights are related to reproductive and sexual rights.The bodily integrity ensure total control of the woman's body and the decision to continue a pregnancy or not.-Abortion in the bodily rights' argumentEvery woman has the right to chose what to do with her body and have others respect this bodily autonomy.Legal abortion ensures the ability of a woman to control her body which is not possible if she is forced to continue a pregnancy.-Abortion as a reproductive rightReproductive rights definition is:\"Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children\" [1]Safe and legal abortion is part of the reproductive rights of every woman and it's heavily related to the bodily rights.If abortion is illegal, women would be deprived of these rights that are fundamental in a modern society.-Beginning of life or personhood is irrelevant to the debateThe beginning of life and/or personhood is definitely an interesting topic that is as controversial as this debate, but it is not relevant because of the bodily rights' argument.The rights should be respected independently of things like if the fetus is alive, a human being or a person.This is important to note because this is a part of a common argument against abortion and the ability to choose and control of the woman's body.This is easier to see and understand if we replace the fetus with a grown adult. This adult is alive, is a human being and a person but no one should be forced to donate organs or give his body to save the life of this person.In other words women should not be forced to continue a pregnancy (donate her womb) to the fetus, even if this is alive/human/person.For this reason the argument of life and personhood is irrelevant to the discussion.C2: Making Abortion legal makes the procedure safer.Abortion is a safe medical procedure when is done properly.This can only be ensured if abortion is legal. -Illegal abortion won't stop abortionsWomen try to get abortions, even if this is illegal. For example, abortion used to be illegal in the US. Untrained \"doctors\" and conditions without medical standards were common characteristics of illegal abortion. Inducing own abortions were common too.This conditions didn't stop women to get these abortions.Estimates of the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year only in the US. [2]-Unsafety of illegal abortionMaking abortion illegal is a barrier to accessing safe abortion services and endangers women's health. Before making abortion legal an estimate of 5000 women died each year because of unsafe abortions [3]Illegal abortion is still the leading cause of maternal death. 47000 women die each year because of this. [4][5] -Surgical abortion is a safe medical procedureWhen abortion is practiced by a trained person, the procedure is safe with little to no risk.It's complications are less serious than those related to giving birth. [6]ConclusionPro has presented a compelling case for the legalization of Voluntary abortion.The arguments were related to the bodily integrity of women and the safety of abortion in the world.I await for Con's arguments.Thanks.

Actually what they are saying is by normalizing the \"queer\" you are then going to have a control issue therefore \"dictatorship\" normalization happens when we begin to accept that which is different this making it normal... So what your sources are saying is that by making it legal you will create a dictatorship... Kind of contradictory... Furthermore... Voters should vote pro because I am the only one to actually stay on topic... The topic was not \"how to prevent dictatorship\" it was \"should abortion be legal\" and as it stands, murder in this country is illegal... And if we can come to a consensus that abortion is murder (it is in fact killing an organism that has brain function) then it stands to reason that abortion in and of itself should be illegal.",

Pre-Teen is raped, Woman has no husband/reltives and is to die due to disease after child is born). So it must be legal, and you can't have thousands of people deciding whether or not the abortion should be carried out, since it is extremely hard to do so and it will be based solely on personal opinion.If the abortion is WANTED by all living parents, it is probably the most logical choice, seeing as the parents will not love the child at all if they are forced to have it, and a Foster home will mean decades and likely an entire life of physical and sexual harassment.So if Abortion is needed due to a condition (Disease, Rape), Then it is obviously neccesary.If it is wanted by parents, then there will be some possibilities:1- Parents have an Abortion, no big problems2- Parents are forced to have a Baby, they do not love baby and it grows up to be a bad person or a mentally weak person due to years of lack of love and, possibly, harassment 3- Parents are forced to have a Baby, they give it up for Adoption, Baby is Harassed (It will, don't say it won't) at Foster home, grows up to be a bad person or a mentally weak person due to years of lack of love and harassment If it were me, I'd probably not make the Baby suffer so much and simply pick choice 1. Please explain how choice 1 is unwise.I await your response.",
