This quote means that 86 OUT OF 100 SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WANT A TEACHER TO BE FIRED - but will not do so because the proccess is to draining. But what does that leave our learning and growing generation with? Many teachers who do not care, teach well, or put effort in their work? That is certaintly what this is going to result into if we do not abolish it quickly. Also check out this statistic of who is in favor (people in general) \"An Apr.-May 2011 survey of 2,600 Americans found that 49% oppose teacher tenure while 20% support it.

            "premise": "Here are some facts against Teacher Tenure: Teacher tenure creates complacency because teachers know they are unlikely to lose their jobs. Tenure removes incentives for teachers to put in more than the minimum effort and to focus on improving their teaching. [8] Tenure makes it difficult to remove under-performing teachers because the process involves months of legal wrangling by the principal, the school board, the union, and the courts. A June 1, 2009 study by the New Teacher Project found that 81% of school administrators knew a poorly performing tenured teacher at their school; however, 86% of administrators said they do not always pursue dismissal of teachers because of the costly and time consuming process. It can take up to 335 days to remove a tenured teacher in Michigan before the courts get involved. [2] [4] Tenure makes seniority the main factor in dismissal decisions instead of teacher performance and quality. [21] Tenure laws maintain the \"last-hired, first-fired\" policy. On Feb. 24, 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the Los Angeles Unified School District, claiming that basing layoffs on seniority harms younger teachers as well as \"low-income students and persons of color.\" [22] On Oct. 6, 2010, both sides settled to cap or end layoffs at schools. [23] Tenure is not needed to recruit teachers. Sacramento Charter High School, which does not offer tenure, had 900 teachers apply for 80 job openings. [3] With job protections granted through court rulings, collective bargaining, and state and federal laws, teachers today no longer need tenure to protect them from dismissal. [24] For this reason, few other professions offer tenure because employees are adequately protected with existing laws. [25] Tenure makes it costly for schools to remove a teacher with poor performance or who is guilty of wrongdoing. It costs an average of $250,000 to fire a teacher in New York City. [27] New York spent an estimated $30 million a year paying tenured teachers accused of incompetence and wrongdoing to report to reassignment centers (sometimes called \"rubber rooms\") where they were paid to sit idly.Those rooms were shut down on June 28, 2010. [6] With most states granting tenure after three years, teachers have not had the opportunity to \"show their worth, or their ineptitude.\" [28] A Nov. 21, 2008 study by the University of Washington's Center on Reinventing Public Education found that the first two to three years of teaching do not predict post-tenure performance. [29] Tenure does not grant academic freedom. No Child Left Behind in 2001 took away much academic freedom when it placed so much emphasis on standardized testing. [10] According to an Oct. 1, 2006 survey published in Planning and Changing, 56% of school board presidents disagreed with the statement that teacher tenure ensures academic freedom. [18] Tenure at the K-12 level is not earned, but given to nearly everyone. To receive tenure at the university level, professors must show contributions to their fields by publishing research. At the K-12 level, teachers only need to \"stick around\" for a short period of time to receive tenure. [30] A June 1, 2009 study by the New Teacher Project found that less than 1% of evaluated teachers were rated unsatisfactory. [2] Tenure is unpopular among educators and the public. An Apr.-May 2011 survey of 2,600 Americans found that 49% oppose teacher tenure while 20% support it. Among teachers, 53% support tenure while 32% oppose it. According to a Sep. 2010 report by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, 86% of education professors favor \"making it easier to terminate unmotivated or incompetent teachers - even if they are tenured.\" [31] [32] Teacher tenure does nothing to promote the education of children. Former DC Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee said in 2008, \"Tenure is the holy grail of teacher unions, but it has no educational value for kids; it only benefits adults.\" [27] Teacher tenure requires schools to make long-term spending commitments and prevents districts from being fiscally flexible. Teacher employment contracts generally lack provisions for declining enrollment and economic turmoil. [33] Tenure lets experienced teachers pick easier assignments and leaves difficult assignments to the least experienced teachers. Senior teachers choose to teach more resource-rich and less challenging populations instead of the classrooms that would benefit the most from experienced teachers. [34] Public Agenda President Deborah Wadsworth argues that teacher tenure leads to \"a distribution of talent that is flawed and inequitable.\" [34] Most school board presidents criticize teacher tenure. In an Oct. 1, 2006 survey, 91% of school board presidents either agreed or strongly agreed that tenure impedes the dismissal of under-performing teachers. 60% also believed that tenure does not promote fair evaluations.

            "premise": "Thank you sara_ann_dee for her argument. In this debate, I will argue that \u2018there should be a teacher tenure.\u2019 Whether this tenure is reformed, or reduced to only applicable to some teachers, does not matter as long as I am able to prove that \u2018teacher tenure\u2019 should, in some form, exist. Voters should vote for me if I am able to do this. Although rebuttals are reserved for the next round, I urge that voters should not blindly accept my opponent's point as I have already discovered some problems in them. First I will define the word \u2018tenure\u2019.Tenure: tenure is a form of job security for teachers, given after a probationary period. Please note that: Tenure doesn\u2019t guarantee lifetime employment. It simply protects teachers from being dismissed without just cause. Teachers with tenure are entitled to a hearing in which the school district must prove that the teacher failed a specific standard that\u2019s required of the teacher. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Teaching is a very important profession. Being a teacher, you pass knowledge on to the next generation and if you also do research, you make new discoveries and question the way things are; in other words, challenge the status quo. Teacher tenure ensures that teachers can perform these two tasks by protecting their academic freedom. Moreover, teacher tenure raises the standard of education to a higher level by attracting more capable people to enter this field and allowing teachers to focus on teaching than not being fired. In short, tenure makes sure that the functions of such an important profession can be carried out without any hindrance, that such an important job is done at a high standard, in the hands of gifted people. 1. Teacher tenure protects the academic freedom of teachers. Academic freedom is of paramount importance. Academic freedom prevents any political, intellectual, or religious orthodoxy from hampering the discovery of knowledge and the study and criticism of intellectual or cultural traditions. Without the assurance of academic freedom, many teachers may be discouraged from taking novel or unpopular positions. Important ideas might not be advanced and intellectual debate and advancement would suffer. Protecting the academic freedom of teachers may sound like something that is only beneficial to teachers. However this is not true. With teacher tenure, teachers\u2019 academic freedom of teaching controversial subjects is also protected. This is beneficial to students because they will be exposed to a wider range of views and topics and they will acquire more knowledge. But more importantly, they will also develop critical thinking skills and instead of blindly accepting what others say about it, they can question the legitimacy of them on their own. Another example that demonstrates the importance of protecting academic freedom is Galileo and his support for the Copernican Theory. [1] In this case, there was a violation against Galileo\u2019s academic freedom to support Copernican theory, a very important theory in astronomy, which has a profound impact on mankind. If this violation had been successful, it could have barred this theory reaching other people; consequently, we may never have gained the knowledge that Earth in fact orbits the Sun; and without this knowledge, NASA would never have been able to send a probe on a 7.5 billion km journey to Pluto and we would never have received pictures of such a beautiful place. 2. Teacher tenure is necessary to provide a high standard of education to students. Tenured teachers cannot be dismissed without a just cause as I have mentioned at the very beginning of my argument. Therefore it allows teachers to focus on their job and act in the best interest of students (e.g. failing a student with powerful parents when it is necessary so that he realizes he has to improve) instead of having to worry about political correctness and keeping their job. This ensures that the education that we give to students is of the highest standard. Secondly, according to [2], the admission requirements for future applicants to teacher colleges will increase in the next few years. It is shown on the National Education Association website that teachers make less than other professions receiving similar training and responsibilities. [3] The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that public schools will need more than 440,000 new elementary and secondary teachers by the end of the decade to replace retiring baby boomers. [4] These sources show that more people, and more talented ones with higher academic achievements are needed as teachers, an occupation that is not that well paid. Teacher tenure solves this problem by attracting talented people to become teachers by giving teachers security and stability to their jobs. This is extremely important because only by having good teachers and having enough of them can we provide education of a high standard to students. Brief summary of my arguments 1. Tenure protects academic freedom, allowing teachers to perform research freely and teach controversial subjects.2. Tenure attracts more gifted people to enter this profession and allows them to focus on teaching, thus raising the standard of education to a high level.Again, I have not dropped my opponent's points. I will simply address them in the next round in accordance to the rules of this debate. Links: [1] https://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://www.huffingtonpost.com... [3] http://www.nea.org...

            "premise": "Quotes used in my debate are all included here. (I know this is not exactly allowed and it's really messy and confusing but 10,000 characters (approx. 1500 words) really isn\u2019t enough for 10 rebuttals.) Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 1\u2019: \u2018a\u2019 (this is where Quote a. from the picture should go) Pro is presupposing that teachers will become complacent if they know they are unlikely to lose their jobs. However, 1. Pro does not give any proof that supports this. 2. A study suggests that academic performance does not slack off after tenure. [1] (Downloadable on the website). It measures the productivity (total number of papers) and impact (citations of papers) of the economics and finance faculty from top twenty-five schools and it finds that they are consistent before and after tenure. 3. There are other incentives for teachers to work. [1] points out that other incentives including pay rise, reduced teaching load and more research funds. Pressure from colleagues and academic discipline are also incentives for teachers to work. Therefore, I can conclude that \u2018reason 1\u2019 is invalid. (Although [1] is focused on professors, some incentives I have listed in 3. are also shared by K-12 teachers.) Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 2 and 6\u2019 \u2018b\u2019\u2018c\u2019 What Pro says is misleading. Tenure may make it difficult to remove under-performing teachers but it makes it EQUALLY DIFFICULT to remove good teachers. But isn\u2019t this the whole point of tenure - to protect teachers from being fired without a just cause, so to protect academic freedom and increase the quality of education? Also, how many under-performing teachers are there anyway? Teachers perform poorly either because they don\u2019t have the ability to perform well, or they are able to but they are simply complacent and therefore not willing to make an effort. The latter I have already proven to be unlikely in my \u2018Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 1\u2019. The former, as I will explain now, is unlikely too. If a teacher were inept, he wouldn\u2019t have been employed and wouldn\u2019t have been granted tenure in the first place. This isn\u2019t really a disadvantage because under-performing teachers are rare while many more teachers and students can be benefitted. \u2018d\u2019 Exactly. There are laws our there designed to remove tenured teachers. It is the administrators\u2019 fault that for some reason they do not use these laws to dismiss teachers, not tenure\u2019s fault. I do agree that tenure makes it difficult to fire under-performing teachers. However, these teachers are rare and it is equally difficult to fire good teachers. If school administrators can utilise tenure well then both under-performing teachers can be fired and good teachers can be protected. Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 3\u2019 A large number of people being against tenure cannot explain whether tenure is inherently good or bad. Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 4\u2019 \u2018e\u2019 This is a short-sighted and superficial statement to make and Pro fails to realise the indirect effect tenure has on students. Tenure gives teachers academic freedom to teach controversial subjects. Students are being taught these and it is already evident how students are affected and benefited. Students develop critical thinking skills and gain knowledge to a wide range of topics. Other benefits of students are mentioned in previous round. The statement that teacher tenure does nothing to promote the education of children is simply not true. Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 5\u2019 \u2018f\u2019 This merely shows that the system used to grant tenures to K-12 teachers is not strict enough. At best, it only shows that some sort of reform may be needed to change the way tenure is granted at K-12 level, but tenure itself is fine. Also, this argument only focuses on K-12 teachers, and I will remind voters professors are also included in this debate. Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 7\u2019 \u2018g\u2019 I have already explained in my 2nd contention that tenure can attract people to become teachers. So now the question is whether tenure is NEEDED to do so? The answer is yes, because less people can apply for teacher college and an estimated of 440,000 extra teachers are needed to replace baby boomers. This I have also explained in my 2nd contention. Further evidence that supports this is a webpage on the California Teacher Association website, titled \u2018Impending Teacher Shortage Crisis\u2019 [3]. Pro has given the example of a school in Sacramento (Capital of California) to show that there isn\u2019t a teacher shortage. However, it is only the example of a single school and it does not show the general pattern while the statewide statistics do. Also, Pro overlooks other factors that could attract an unusually high number of teachers to apply for jobs at this school \u2013 e.g. a high salary. In conclusion, Pro\u2019s point is invalid because I have pointed out the problems with the example she uses. I have also provided a more representative data that disproves her point. Furthermore, I have explained in my 2nd contention about how tenure can and needs to attract people to become teachers. Rebuttal for \u2018Reason 8\u2019 \u2018h\u2019 1. The fact that there are multiple methods to protect teacher from dismissal does not mean that teacher tenure is unnecessary. If, according to Pro\u2019s logic, only one way of protecting teacher from dismissal is needed, then shouldn\u2019t \u2018collective bargaining, state law and federal law\u2019 be unnecessary too because \u2018job protections granted through court rulings\u2019 can offer this protection already? Wouldn\u2019t she be contradicting herself by listing 4 alternatives when she is saying that only one is needed? 2. If that was not what she meant, if she is also acknowledging that different methods can co-exist, then why choose teacher tenure to be the one to be abolished? Pro says teacher tenure has many disadvantages, but I\u2019ve refuted her arguments about these disadvantages already in my above rebuttals. Also, the other methods she has listed do have some of the disadvantages that teacher tenure has too because they have similar purposes. 3. If you look at the sections related to alternative methods to protect teachers from the document Pro used as evidence in her argument, (p.4, paragraphs 2-3) [4] it says: \u2018i\u2019 The document does not see these alternatives as a long-term solution, but only as a temporary measure to protect teachers during the period of tenure law reform in NJ. \u2018It does not in any way, describe these alternatives as effective either, saying that all they merely do is \u2018not leave teachers at the mercy of cruel and capricious boards of education.\u2019 In the last few sentences, it even stresses on the benefits of tenure. The conclusion is that the evidence Pro uses doesn\u2019t actually support her claim. If anything, it is CONTRADICTORY to her entire position in this debate. Pro does not give any explanation to why tenure in particular should be abolished but not other methods of protecting teachers. The evidence given by her \u2013 not only is it unsupportive of her argument \u2013 it is even against it. Rebuttal for \u2018Rebuttal for \"high standard\"\u2019 I have explained in my Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 4\u2019 how tenure can have indirect effects on children too. Pro shouldn\u2019t just focus on direct effects and it is a shallow thing to do so. Furthermore, Pro has completely dropped my point on academic freedom and tacitly agrees that it does benefit people (\u2018j\u2019) but she tries to deny the merit of it by claiming it does not benefit students. Therefore, my point still stands. Tenure protects academic freedom, allowing teachers to perform research freely and teach controversial subjects, which benefits students. Rebuttal for \u2018Rebuttal for \"high standard\"\u2019 Pro argues that my 2nd contention is false in her rebuttal. Her reasons for this are: 1. \u2018k\u2019 This, I have already explained why it is not true in my \u2018Rebuttal of \u2018Reason 1\u2019: Pro failed to support \u2018reason 1\u2019 with proof; I have provided studies that disprove it; I have explained that there are other incentives for the teacher to work. 2. \u2018l\u2019 If you look at [2] and [4] of the previous round you will see Pro\u2019s assertion \u2018m\u2019 (incidentally, she uses the wrong \u2018then\u2019) is already proven false by sources I have cited in the previous round and she hasn\u2019t given evidence in this round that proves otherwise. \u2018n\u2019 [3] of my previous round has already proven this false. I have proven both of these reasons given by Pro as false thus her rebuttal of my point is invalid. Therefore, my point still stands, which I will repeat here once more: Teacher tenure provides a high standard of education to students. Also, I want to point out that Pro\u2019s rebuttal of my 2nd contention is not supported by evidence and merely based on assertion. Why should you vote Con? Pro has explained the disadvantages of tenure but most of which have been refuted. I have explained the advantages of tenure, which Pro has either dropped or attempted to refute but does not succeed as I have proven her rebuttals invalid. This means I have successfully shown that there should be teacher tenure because the advantages outweigh the disadvantages while Pro has not shown why there should not be teacher tenure I have met the criteria for me to win this debate but Pro hasn\u2019t. Also BoP should be on Pro because she needs to explain why the status quo should be changed but she fails to fulfil this BoP. Other than that Pro has, on many occasions, failed to provide evidence to support her claims and in her rebuttal of my 2nd contention, Pro\u2019s blatantly disregards the sources I have cited in the previous round and she continues to make unfounded assertions, which are already proven false by these sources. Pro\u2019s arguments heavily rely on \u2018appeal to emotion\u2019 and \u2018circular reasoning\u2019. [1]http://papers.ssrn.com...; [2] Deleted [3] https://www.cta.org...

            "premise": "I thank Pro for challenging me to this debate. Since I assume their opening statement was made in their R1 post, I will begin mine as well. I will be arguing against the idea that tenure for college professors should be abolished. I have three main claims: [Claim 1]: Tenure is a necessity [Claim 2]: Tenured teachers can still be fired (and other misconceptions) [Claim 3]: Research supports tenure [C1]: Tenure is a necessity The concept of tenure dates back over 100 years ago to the early 20 century, when working in the field of education was much different than what it is today [1]. It was female-dominated, classrooms were larger, and working conditions were poorer [2]. Before tenure, teachers could be fired for any reason. If a teacher had the audacity to get married or, even more horrific, pregnant, the schoolboard could immediately fire her. Tenure and teachers' unions were created to guarantee some amount of job protection for teachers. They wanted the peace of mind to know their job wouldn't be terminated for seemingly no reason. At the high school level, most schools require teachers work at the same school for 3-5 years before being considered for tenure, and there are many factors taken into account, with the most important one being a teacher's ability to teach. At the university level, I believe you have to have taught for 6 years before tenure consideration. Once a teacher is granted tenure, however, it does not mean they are immune from being fired. \"Tenure protects academic freedom. In the absence of tenure, teachers may be fired for any reason. Teachers may be fired if the principal doesn't like them or if they are experienced and become too expensive. Teachers may be fired for being outspoken. [2]\" In other words, tenure gives teachers a safeguard to be able to be more involved with the decisions being made at their school, as opposed to being complacent and accepting any and all changes. At the college level, this is incredibly important as professors want to challenge their students and (sometimes) have them confront and critique their already-established beliefs. When I took a Sociology course my senior year of university, our professor warned us of an upcoming lecture the following week where she was going to discuss religion and look at many of the popular ones under a critical lens. I thought this was a strange warning, as anyone whose convictions are strong enough should be fine with having their beliefs challenged. To my surprise, however, many students' parents would contact her to complain. Tenure in this situation protects the professor from being fired simply because a student didn't like one of their lectures. [C2]: Tenured teachers can still be fired (and other misconceptions) There are a lot of myths surrounding the idea of tenure, which is primarily the reason why I accepted this debate in the first place. Some people, for example, think that tenured teachers cannot be fired and have permanent job security forever and can therefore sit back and be a less effective teacher with no criticism whatsoever. This is absolutely not true. Again, tenure grants teachers job security and the inability to be fired without due process. Ineffective (or \"bad\") teachers can still be terminated. However, I think firing someone with no intervention or professional development workshops to help them is a bit harsh. Tenure (especially at the university level) is something that needs to be earned from the hardest-working teachers after a long and arduous process. They have to have committed some amount of research outside their teaching hours, demonstrate very strong teaching abilities, among many other factors. Tenure does not \"protect\" \"burnt-out\" teachers either. \"How many students have complained about a teacher they see as too strict or \"boring\" - only to realize later in life that this teacher made a profound difference in their lives? Research shows that there is no one style that equates to effective teaching - which underscores why a fair hearing is needed before the imposition of a serious consequence such as firing a teacher who has demonstrated years of effective teaching. [3]\" [C3]: Research supports tenure Not only have we established tenure does not help bad teachers keep their job, but there is abolutely no research that suggests students perform worse on standardized tests when taught by a tenured teacher, nor is there evidence that supports perform better with non-tenured teachers [2]. Not only this, but tenured teachers and professors also feel to have a higher obligation to be involved in school-making decisions. \"Research finds that when teachers have a say in how schools are run, they are more likely to be invested in the school and to stay longer, and are more engaged with colleagues in cooperative work. [4]\" In conclusion, tenure is a necessary provision for good teachers and promotes a stronger school culture, thus increasing academic achievement, not hindering it. The myth that tenure protects ineffective teachers is simply untrue. I await Pro's response. Thank you. Sources: [1] http://www.peoplesworld.org... [2] http://www.nytimes.com...

Tenure, briefly stated, is an arrangement whereby faculty members, after successful completion of a period of probationary service, can be dismissed only for adequate cause or other possible circumstances and only after a hearing before a faculty committee. The Association, also from its inception, has assumed responsibility for developing standards and practices, sometimes in cooperation with other organizations, to give concrete meaning to tenure. Key Association policy statements are the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, the 1958 Statement on Procedural Standards in Faculty Dismissal Proceedings, and the Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure. I would like to allow the Pro to decide which definition will be used. So far as the debate structure goes, I would like the second round to be stating preliminary arguments. he third and fourth used for rebuttal and concluding statements accordingly, as long as this is amiable to the Pro. I look forward to this debate, best of luck. Sources 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://www.aaup.org...",

To begin, i'd like to state why teachers unions should be abolished. Teacher's unions are detrimental to this nation's public education system because, teacher's have the to strike which interrupts learning of the student, tenure, protection for proven noneffective teachers, and union's donate to politicians to advance their own agenda. These unions put their own agenda in front of what be a number #1 priority for them, teaching this nation's children.",

            "premise": "\"Verizon and general motors aren't teaching the future.\" Of course they are not but a union is a union. If it is my opponent's argument that the teachers union should be abolished because they have the ability to strike, perhaps my opponent can state how many times teachers have took to the picket lines, the length of time of the strikes and exactly how these strikes hurt the future of America. Please elaborate how this is relevant to the debate. The barrier to entry into the profession is relevant to this debate. A teacher in New York City has a to achieve a level of education comparable to doctors and attorneys. New York is a right to work state, meaning that employees can be fired at any time for any reason, except if the employer violates the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. With this being said, it is my argument that it would not be beneficial to society if a teaching professional who has obtained a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, passed state licensing exams, and completed an internship to be terminated simply because a principal may not like the teacher personally. A principal could do this if it were not for the protection that the teachers union provides. \"Your right. There are a lot more variables to why a student might fail. But when you have a teacher who is show over and over again to be proven ineffective, that's not a coincidence. But because it's nearly impossible to fire that teacher due to the unions, there's a problem.\" It takes 3 years of teaching in a classroom before tenure is awarded. When a teacher becomes tenured the teacher is considered to be qualified to continue as a teaching professional. In the event that a school board or city wishes to terminate a teacher, the first step in the process is remediation, where the teacher is given a 1 year period in which to improve his or her job performance. In the event the teacher fails during the remediation period a series of hearings take place to ensure the reasons for the teacher to be fired are warranted. This process takes approximately 10 months but only takes place if the teacher requests the hearings. At the end of the hearings, which again take approximately 10 months if the school board agrees with the finding the teacher is terminated. [1] As you can see, this process takes approximately 2 years in which a majority of the time is spent trying to correct the teacher's deficiencies. It's not impossible, it's called due process. \"That's not a sufficient enough argument to justify why teachers deserve union protection.\" Fair enough, \"the point of tenure is to protect teachers from arbitrarily being fired. Teachers need protection from over-zealous bosses and ideological politicians. This is the same thinking behind seniority rules, which protect more expensive teachers from being laid off due to budget cuts. Teaching is not a high-paying job compared to jobs in the private sector, and one of the benefits is some job security. Occasionally this means bad teachers take longer to fire.\" [1] I have an idea! How about we make teachers unions illegal, and if a teacher is show to be effective we give them a pay raise, if not we fire them. Simple. Merit pay is a topic for another debate but if a teacher is not performing as he or she should they can be fired via due process. I fail to see how abolishing the teachers union will have a positive effect on the education the future of America receives. [1]http://www.forbes.com...",

When the evaluations came out in the ny post last month it raise a couple of questions. Mayor Bloomberg wanted to give out an incentive to those teachers who have excelled or achieved the goal within each grade level. He wanted to offer the teachers a 20,000 dollar award and begin to open up 50 more schools including charter schools to have more teachers apply for these positions and scope the children of tommorrow.

C1: Tenures prevent teachers from being arbitrarily fired, which allows academic freedom. If there was no tenures they could be fired for teaching about issues contrary to what the administration believes. My opponent tried to make it disappear by saying, \"it has nothing to do with tenures.\"C2: Tenures help draw and retain better teachers. It does this by having great job security, which rivals all other careers. If it was not for tenures, we would have worse teachers due to no job security. Again my opponent never did respond.My opponent also danced around my rebuttals. R1: My opponent attempts to assert that new innovative teachers will not be able to get a position. I then proceed to crush that argument in the next two rounds. The two things I prove are that teachers are needed and tenures actually foster an environment of innovation. R2: He makes an assertion that tenures will do great damage to the economy. However, I disprove that by showing teachers will make more. Like any industry, when people can be fired who make more they will be. That is why tenures help prevent seasoned teachers from being fired over salary. He decides to completely drop the argument after that. R3: Then he makes the claim that if a teacher is tenured they can not be fired. Which is completely false and a huge misconception. I prove that by providing links. Again, he chooses not to respond. 1. He never responded to my contentions.2. His contentions were completely defeated by my rebuttals.3. Drops all arguments in round 44. He committed multiple fallacies, especially in round 4.Vote con!",

            "premise": "Arguments: The Flaws With the Current SystemTest Scores: The National Center for Fair and Open Testing (NFT) (1) notes that many schools focus a little too much on tests scores for teacher evaluation in order to get grants from No Child Left Behind. So the school's real reasoning behind giving test scores too much worth when it comes to teacher evaluation is not actually the accuracy of such an evaluation, but the opportunity to obtain grants. Principle Reviews: This one is very obvious. Teachers can easily change up their regular way of teaching the moment a principle walks in. I see this all the time with teachers that I have had.Of course, both these factors should not go away but it is clear that something is missing. NFT explains, \"To measure teacher and principal quality and effectiveness, use multiple measures based on school and classroom evidence.\" Accuracy of Student EvaluationsStudent evaluations are just what high schools need to correctly asses teachers\u2019 abilities. The Atlantic cites a study performed on various teacher evaluations filled out by students. (2) These evaluations were proved to be much more accurate than any known way of assessing a instructor\u2019s abilities. This study was able to show that teachers with high ratings were able to fit in six more months of learning than teachers with the lowest ratings. This shows that students don\u2019t always give teachers high ratings because they like the easiness of the class. Improves the School SystemTeacher's Union Exposed notes that today, bad teachers are actually protected (3). Only 1 in 1,000 bad teachers are fired. This is because once teachers gain tenure, they basically cannot be fired. It takes about 3 years of mostly positive evaluations to achieve tenure in most cases. As I have proved above, the current evaluation system can protect bad teachers because test scores and administrator assessments alone cannot accurately measure a teacher's worth. By adding the accuracy student evaluations, the chance of bad teachers getting tenure become much lower. Student's First Organization (SFO) strongly believes that student evaluations are the key to putting students first which should be the ultimate goal in every school system. I'll get more into that later. Benefits the Student and TeacherStudents: Obviously, if the student is put first, the students will be satisfied. Nubia Baptestie enjoyed this system being integrated into this school system (2). \"A classmate standing next to her shook her head. They should've done this since I was in the eighth grade.\" Ben Johnson, a teacher and administrator himself, conducted a study showing that there is an overwhelming gap between what students expect from their teachers and what they actually get. The average gap is 35% (4). No one can assess a teacher's abilities better than a student because they are being taught by the teacher daily. If students feel like teachers cannot meet their expectations, student evaluations of teachers will give them a way to make their voice heard. (not just to the administration but to the teacher)Teachers: With this point, I'm mainly talking about the teachers who strive to learn how to teach better. Above, I showed the large gap between students expectations of a teacher vs. what students receive. When students note what teachers do right/wrong, teachers can know how to improve their methods of teaching. ConclusionElaborating on Student's First Organization card: According to SFO, \"If our evaluation systems put students first, this dissonance would be impossible. Good evaluations are honest and transparent, are calculated in an understandable manner, accurately asses overall performance, and identify opportunities for teachers to improve.\" Essentially, this can only be done with student evaluations. Benefitting the school by picking out the good teachers and making sure the school's priorities are right, benefitting the students by helping them feel like they have a say, and benefiting the teachers by letting them know how to improve is why these evaluations should be integrated into high schools (5).

            "conclusion": "Should teachers union be abolished",
            "premise": "I would like to begin my rebuttal by addressing my opponent\"s statement that \"teachers have to strike.\" As with any unionized profession a strike is a last resort and normally occurs when there is a standstill in negotiations. However, in places such as New York City, teachers are not allowed to strike as a result of the Taylor Law [1]. The Taylor Law makes it illegal for any unionized public employee to strike. In the event that public employees do strike they are penalized by having to pay two (2) day\"s worth of wages for each (1) strike day. Stating that teachers have to strike is the same as saying that auto workers have to strike. With regard to tenure, tenure is earned after a probationary period of 3 years. [2] During this 3 year period a teacher can be terminated for being ineffective. Although the term tenure is, for the most part, synonymous with the profession of educator the term probationary period is not. Correction officers, police officers, firefighters and others in public service must also serve a probationary period in order to be afforded union protection against unfair and unjust termination. Non effective teachers are not protected by tenure. As with any unionized member in any profession, a non-effective employee can be terminated for job performance whether tenured or not. However, being tenured allows for due process should a school district or city wish to terminate a teacher for ineffectiveness. My opponent is correct in the statement that \"unions donate to politicians to push their own agenda.\" However, the teachers union is one of many unions. Basing an argument on this statement, I could easily argue that all unions should be abolished on this premise. However, unions donating to push their own agenda are no different than a person voting Republican, a person voting Democrat or for any other party line. Politics in itself revolves around agendas. Why does the National Rifle Association donate approximately $7,000,000 per year to Congress? [3] One has to ask, what is the agenda of teachers in the public education system? Personally I feel it is to educate the future of America. If not, why deal with the negative stigma of the profession which on average earns a person approximetly $42,000 per year.

First off, I'd like to state my rebuttals to his arguments:R1: The fallicious logic connects being \"arbitrarily fired\" to having tenures. First, people don't get randomly fired unless for economic reasons. Even so, this would mean firing those without tenures which: - Supports my 1st point that new teacher possibilities are eliminated- Shows how unfair tenures are to new teachersR2: As a link to R1 the moral of the argument is flawed. Based on Con's work-for-treat idea, teachers would be encouraged to fight for their positions through pulling down others from getting a job. Also, he states that removal of tenures would drive away \"great teachers.\" He forgets that without tenures, the best teachers with new and innovative ideas continue to teach and are not \"arbitrarily fired\" without a definite reason. I would like to highlight are the flaws in my opponent's rebuttals to my points. They orginate from a lack of understanding of American economic stand and society markets. These are elaborated in the following:CR1: Con's entire argument in invalid. His sources are out-of-date and range from 2007-08 when there were many teachers needed. In 2011 to present, the situation is much different with a dearth of teaching positions. http://tinyurl.com... [1] CR2: Tenures have nothing to do with teachers getting paid more. I stress Con to reflect upon the definition of tenure which is longer stay, but no implication of more pay. http://tinyurl.com... [2]CR3: Con supports my 3rd point. Indeed tenures do not protect those from illegal acts. However, tenures do provide people with undesired personal values (such as smoking outside of campus--see my support 3) to continue to influence many children on a daily basis. http://tinyurl.com... [3] Con's points and sources are invalidated and rebuttals are refuted. Once again, I'd like to thank Con and viewers for spending their time and energy for this debate.",

            "premise": "I am for the removal of tenures for teachers. There are 3 reasons that justify my position:1. Tenure PossibilitiesTenures allow for teachers to be guaranteed a lifetime teaching position according to the definition of tenure in the structure of this debate. By having this set out, many new teachers are prevented from teaching positions. Many include: - New people with new techniques for students- Fresh graduates with an eager heart to teach- People with new knowledge of a particular subjectBy barring these people from jobs, we stunt the growth of a new generation of Americans that provide our future with updated knowledge, ideas, and techniques. 2. Economic View From an economic viewpoint, tenures pull down our economy. Through keeping old teachers in positions, tenures make money flow only towards older generations of teachers. Thus, there is an imbalance of currency distribution which will:- New generations of teachers will struggle to earn a living - Contribute to the slowdown of money flow and economic downturn- Disable young people from working and benefiting the US while givingolder people the majority of money -- an imbalance3. Abuse of Teaching PositionsThrough allowing teachers fulfilling a number of years to have permanent jobs, tenures open the gateway for abuse of teaching positions. In 1999 six professors sued the state for banning them from watching porn on state computers. Tenures allow abuse of positions for people such as: - Those with corrupted moral standards- Teachers who might harm children indirectly through their depravity- Teachers not conductive to learning environmentNote that this \"corruption\" is not limited to being illegal in the sense that an arrest is at issue but also for such things that don't infringe on the law but still might be harmful for student values such as smoking outside of the school.Sources: http://tinyurl.com...http://tinyurl.com...http://tinyurl.com...http://tinyurl.com...http://tinyurl.com...",

However teachers in other places can still go on strike as they did in Chicago (the 3rd largest district in the US) in September [1]. During this 3 year period a teacher can be terminated for being ineffective. Again this is true. One again though after tenure is earned the process of firing a teacher is long complicated process that is costly [2]. In New York firing a teacher is like breaking a diamond. What happens is the ineffective teachers typically get passed along from school to school without ever getting fired. I'd agree with my opponent\u2019s agenda point. why deal with the negative stigma of the profession which on average earns a person approximately $42,000 per year. It's important to that teachers wages tend to rise with experience and there are other factors too like cost-of living. For example a teacher North Dakota makes half of the average salary but living costs are cheaper in North Dakota then in New York [4]. The reason we should deal with the negative stigma is because as said they're teaching the future of America. There only a handful of jobs that guide the direction of America\u2019s future economic viability. [1] http://www.huffingtonpost.com...

What happens if teachers are not protected by tenures? They will be fired as soon as they start making more money. You can see that happens in every field of work. Thus, tenures do help teachers make more money. 1)http://www.huffingtonpost.com...R3: My opponent proposed in round one that tenures make teachers unfireable. I then completely refuted that point by providing a source. He then tries to cover up his defeated argument by saying they can not be fired for smoking.

            "premise": "To My Future Opponent: Thank you for accepting my challenge. I started this debate to learn the pros and cons of this subject, and I chose the side that is my personal opinion (for now). Please feel free to any styles of debating. However I find it a more constructive debate if you hit each of my points as well as making your own. Hobey ho, lets go! In public high schools, tenure is considered a right for teachers who have passed their (usually) 3 year probationary term. Roughly 2.3 million public school teachers in the U.S. have tenure. (Time) Tenure is job security aimed at impeding wanton firing of \"unpopular\" teachers. Although noble in theory, tenure is simply wrong. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Point 1) If a teacher deserves to be fired, it is a daunting task for the school district to do so, leading to bad teachers staying in the system. According to a recent article in Time Magazine, \"Though tenure doesn't guarantee lifetime employment, it does make firing teachers a difficult and costly process, one that involves the union, the school board, the principal, the judicial system and thousands of dollars in legal fees. In most states, a tenured teacher can't be dismissed until charges are filed and months of evaluations, hearings and appeals have occurred. Meanwhile, school districts must shell out thousands of dollars for paid leave and substitute instructors. The system is deliberately slow and cumbersome, in order to dissuade school boards and parents from ousting a teacher for personal or political motives.\" As I mentioned before, a noble attempt at stopping corruption, yet it fails to recognize bad teachers in general. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Point 2) There are numerous cases of teachers that deserved to be fired, proved difficult because of tenure. Yet again, from Time, \"A Connecticut teacher received a mere 30-day suspension for helping students cheat on a standardized test; one California school board spent $8,000 to fire an instructor who preferred using R-rated movies instead of books; a Florida teacher remained in the classroom for a year despite incidents in which she threw books at her students and demanded they referred to her as \u2018Ms. God.'\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Point 3) Tenure can easily lead to teacher complacency. This point is simply logic. If a man or woman has a job they know they won't be fired from (within loose limits), are they really going to work extremely hard to better themselves at their job? In today's world, probably not. The same goes with teachers. Please note, I'm not saying all teachers are lazy scumbags who deserve to be fired, but this is simply a problem with tenure. I'm 100% sure that we've all had a teacher who just didn't care anymore. Mine was in a science class. She never taught a thing. All we did was handouts. Easiest \u2018A' I've gotten in my life, but that's not the point of school. Tenure allows for \u2018Blow off classes' and \u2018easy a's', but is that necessarily a good thing, especially with legislation requiring standardized tests. If students are doing poorly, school districts get less grants, making it even harder to educate new students. It's a slippery slope that many schools are finding themselves in. You may be saying that tenure isn't the only cause of this, but it is a factor. Bad teachers = bad students. Simple. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Possible Solution: Get rid of the tenure system and create a new teacher grading system in which good teachers are kept and bad teachers are fired. I've been thinking about the education system a lot recently, and the only possible alternative I could find in my mind, is a merit based system. It would keep crass politics out of the system by assuring teachers their job (if they are up to it). I propose a three part test. A) Course Knowledge Exam- The teacher ought to know what they are talking about. B) Teacher Improvement Standards- There are numerous workshops and the like that are available to teachers. They should be required to attend a certain amount of such meetings yearly to keep up with the times and teaching styles. C) In Class Examination- Although teachers are often subjected to scheduled \"watching\" periods in which an official of the school sits in on a lesson, this is not enough. They should have a set number of random sit ins to insure the teacher is actually teaching, instead of simply making a show on that one scheduled day.",

Should the status quo not be challenged, especial If the status quo is harming America\u2019s economic performance, and damaging America\u2019s schools? Also, this debate is not about whether education and teachers are important. Of course I realize the value of teachers and education. This is the common ground that we both agree on. However, it is because I favor them that I am opposed to teacher unions. Education and the future of America should not be hijacked by special interests aimed at helping adults rather than students. To state that anti-union is anti-teacher is like saying being in favor of antitrust law is anti-business. Protecting Teachers My opponent first claims that teachers need protection. This is a false claim. Here\u2019s why a school board would be unwilling to fire a teacher haphazardly: First, the process of searching and finding a teacher is a lengthy and expense process. To find a teacher one has to look over many applications, set up interviews, and pay for advertising the job. Once the teacher is hired, one has to pay for teacher orientation, and file paper work for the new employee. Second off, it\u2019s risky business to fire a teacher that is competent and replace him or her with a teacher that has the potential to be incompetent. In the hiring process, even If one thoroughly looks over credentials, there is still a great possibility that the applicant is incompetent. So as long as the teacher has a decent level of competency, it is much better for the school to keep the teacher then to fire the teacher and risk a new teacher. Third, If a school or school district is known to have a high turnover rate, then it\u2019s unlikely that competent teachers will apply there. Therefore a school district is unlikely to do this. Employees in the private sector do not need to be protected, in which 93.1% of employees in the private sector are not part of unions. Even in the public sector, 63.8% of employees are not unionized. However, it should be noted that If incompetent teachers are not fired, then it means that recent college graduates and those seeking a teacher position that are component are unable to do so. The problem is that teachers are protected too much. It is nearly impossible to fire a teacher once he or she receives tenure. In New York City, a \u201crubber room\u201d was creates specifically designed to pay bad teachers to do nothing. Literally, teachers that got in trouble for sexual misconduct, unwilling to follow the curriculum, or abusiveness were just sent to a building to do what they wanted with pay and benefits[1]. Teachers receive more job security than any other occupation. There is no reason for this. Protecting bad teachers simply hurt the schools. Students do not learn what they need to. Often times, teachers need to review material that should have been learned previous years, but an incompetent teacher simply did not teach the material. This drags everyone down. Education is too important for bad teachers to recieve protection. According to this video, If just the bottom 6-10 percent of all teachers were eliminated, then American education would be at the level of Finland, a nation with top education.(watch 1:08 onward). Past Practices If I am correct, my opponent\u2019s main argument here is that teachers have the right to collective bargaining because it is not specifically prohibited in state and local law. This argument fails for many reasons. For one, this debate framework is based on moral principles not legal principals. I specially stated that I was using an Unitarianism framework. This is a basic appeal to authority argument, using the law as a legit authority. It would equivalent to if this was the year 1940 in Nazi, Germany for me to argue that one should not hide Jews from the government because it is against the law. Second, this argument easily fails once a law is introduced to bar teachers from collective right bargaining. Other Legal Issues I will repeat my argument that I stated earlier. Legal issues should not be a major consideration since laws can be changed, and are not a moral authority. My opponent states that teachers should receive collective bargaining rights since other public employees like firefighters, police, etc. also maintain the right. Just because other public employees engage in collective bargaining does not make it morally right. This is analogous stating that a murderer should not be locked in jail since other murders get away with it scot free. I am against collective bargaining in the public sector. I would remove the collective bargaining rights of firefighters and other public employees, however this debate is specifically about teachers. In terms of the argument that the NLRA does not cover public employees, there are also many checks that exist in the private sector that reduce the power of unions while these checks do not exist in the public sector. It should also be noted that many public employees can not engage in specific collective bargaining tactics. For example, police officers are not allowed to go on strike. So it is not unreasonable to remove teacher\u2019s rights to collective bargaining. Specialization and Demands My opponent states that since teachers invest in a college education to obtain a teaching degree, that he or she should be protected. I will explain the problem with this. There is no reason to suspect that teacher unions increase teacher employment. If you protect bad teachers you can\u2019t let potentially good teachers enter the market. So this argument actually works in my favor, since college graduates spend many years studying the field and get into debt, only to find that they can\u2019t get a job because there are no vacancies. It\u2019s also another point in my favor that teacher unions increase the salary and benefts of teachers, creating a surplus of teacher applicants and increasing the number of those who will invest in a teaching degree but will not be able to find a teaching career. Many other jobs that require more specialization are less protected. For example, Doctors and Lawyers have to spend much more years and tuition to practice in the field. However, neither doctors nor lawyers are unionized. One out of every 57 doctor will lose their medical license and one out of 97 lawyers will lose their license to practice law. Remember, this is losing their license to practice, not just getting fired, the latter a far less severe punishment. For teachers, 1 in every 1000 teacher is fired after tenure for performance based reasons [2]. However, the question is: should people be protected from the financial risks they make? No. Society should not bare the risks of an individul's choice. An entrepreneur that decides to start a new business must bear the risks as well. Consumers should not be forced to buy the product and the business should not be protected. If new technology automates jobs, then there\u2019s no reason these jobs should be protected. Once one gets into the mindset that jobs must be protected in order to save them from mal-investments, economic growth, consumer choice and efficiency cannot be maintained. Jobs will always exist through this creative destructive process; they will just be reallocated to different fields. Even If a college graduate is unable to find a teacher career, a college degree is versatile and many people enter careers outside of their specialization. Conclusion: I have refuted the legal claims and protectionism claims my opponent has made. I look forward to my opponents response to my arguments. http://tinyurl.com...[1] http://www.youtube.com...[2] http://tinyurl.com...[3]",

While some students learn with hand-on experience others learn from reading a book. The teacher's job is to help the student succeed. A teacher's evaluation is mostly based on student's test averages and school grades. A teacher job is to teach the students. If a student does not learn then the teacher has not done their job. Opposing Argument #2 Mentally Challenged Students Are you expecting students who have obvious learning dysfunctions to learn at the same pace as normal students. Almost every school I have been in there has been a mentally challenged students. Every one had a personal aide to guide and teach them. The teachers would take their time to carefully teach them at their own pace. Opposing Argument #3 Student Attitude Some students may have a lazy attitude where they do not want to do homework. A teacher then should start to take away their free time. At my high school if you below a 70% then you only got half lunch periods, and you could not leave school campus. During that time whichever class you were failing that teacher would help you. If teachers teach their students good attitude at young ages then it will stick with them through life. It will show them that you can't just give up and not do it. Overall a teacher need to teach consequences. Conclusion: A teacher should be there to help the student succeed in life. A teacher is not Boss at a work but more of a trainer for life.",

            "conclusion": "High schools should add students to the teacher evaluation system.",
            "premise": "My CaseThe flaws with the current system:My opponent talks about the pros of both the current methods of evaluating high school teachers. I'll cover both methods.1. Test Scores My opponent concedes that schools are motivated to use tests as forms of evaluation because they get grants. This is important because this means that schools are motivated by something other than benefiting their students; they have no actual justification for such an evaluation used alone. My opponent explains that the teachers actually do have control over the scores of their students. I would agree with this to some degree; I am not in any way advocating to get rid of test scores as a form of evaluation. My opponent is right to some degree when he says that tests as evaluations show how well a teacher teaches material. However, there will always be students who do well on tests even when they have a neglegant teacher, and there will always be students who do badly even when they have a diligent teacher. When students fill out the evaluation form, they can answer constructive questions that will result in a much more complete form of evaluation than any test.2. Principle Reviews For this point, my opponent cites some evidence that is sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as the American Federation of Teachers. My Atlantic card I mentioned earlier notes that generally teachers are the ones that tend to be against student evaluations being integrated into the teacher assessment system. This article is sponsored by the American Federation of Teachers, and since teachers are often times against such a form of evaluation, the article contains a biased point of view. Also, the article never mentions anything against evaluations from students. It only talks about how to make principle/test evaluations stronger. The article states, \"Evaluation procedures must address this complexity--they should not only assess individual teachers but also help them continuously improve.\" Student reviews fit this criteria. I will how later on.Accuracy of student evaluations:1. My Atlantic Card My opponent attacked this card by showing that principle evaluations can prove the same points as student evaluations. I'll get into why they can't on the next point. It is important to observe that my opponent did not cite a study showing the exact accuracy of principle evaluations; therefore, he has no way of showing that principle evaluations can do the same things student evaluations can do. As my Atlantic Study shows, students assessing their teachers is the most accurate form of assessment.2. Addressing Biases My opponent explains that biases cannot be ruled out. I would agree. Bias will exist, but as my pieces of evidence show, bias is not going to be as big of a problem as one may think. In fact, administrators also can be biased. Gender bias is a major problem with administrators (1). I won't get too much into that issue, but there is always the possibility that a certain gender could get special treatment from various administrators. Also, Education Week explained that the research by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (my opponent cites this earlier) is correct, several disturbing patterns were found. It turns out that teachers were evaluated by administrators got significantly worse reviews from administrators if they taught a lower level class with students that were hard to teach. Student evaluations can show that teachers instructing challenging classes may be good at what they do, although the students may not always succeed (2). The article states, \"It creates a system that is demonstrably and palpably unfair to teachers, given that they have little control over the performance of the whole school,\u201d the report states.\" I have proved that teachers with good student evaluations are better teachers, and that student evaluations have no correlation with a student's actual grade made a point earlier: students sign up for different levels of classes (pre-ap/AP/on-level). This means they will have similar expectations. Bias can cause administrators to give on-level teachers lower ratings even if they don't deserve them. Since students in an on-level class have similar expectations, they will be able to adequately assess their teachers abilities the way they should be assessed.Lastly, my opponent explains that students are not qualified. I gave examples of the questions that students will be asked in the previous round. Since they spend at least every other day with their teachers, they are certainly able to answer simple questions about their teacher's performance.Improving the school system:1) My opponent explains that the tenure system is flawed, not the evaluation system. I agree the tenure system is flawed, but it will be much harder for a teacher to get tenure if they receive consistent bad reviews from students.2) I would like apologize; I made an error in the first round in argument that addresses teachers being fired. My Teachers Union card is not talking about bad teachers, but teachers in general. The evidence (which will be linked below) states only 1 in 1000 teachers is fired for performance related reasons. If we look at lawyers, 1 in 97 get fired for performance; with doctors, 1 in 57 are fired for such reasons (3). The bottom line is teachers have a much lower standard than other careers, which is wrong because, \"Wright, Horn, and Sanders (in press) have demonstrated that, within grade levels, the single most dominant factor affecting student academic gain is teacher effect.\" Teachers are what effect students the most and the should be held to a high standard (4). Student evaluations (which I have proved accurate) will hold them to that standard.3) My opponent compares students assessing teachers to customers setting prices of food in a restaurant. This analogy is simply unrealistic because teachers have a lasting impact on the lives/education of students; food/prices at a restaurant do not. My opponent talks about how students don't know the standards of teaching, just like not all customers know the standards of a restaurant. It is important to remember that we are debating the high school evaluation. By the time students get into high school, they should know the difference between good teachers and bad teachers; at a restaurant obviously there will be people who don't generally eat out (making them ill-qualified). Remember, student evaluations are not just a sheet where students put their opinions. Students fill out sheets of constructive and easy-to-answer questions.Benefits the teacher/student:1) My opponent explains satisfying the student is unimportant and that the gap between student expectation vs. what they actually get is inevitable. Look at the question: Why do we have schools? The answer is: To teach students. If students are not satisfied, they won't be taught well. Simple. As I said before, the gap is inevitable. However, teachers knowing why this gap exists for them makes them better teachers. And students feeling like they have a say gives them satisfaction because they finally have an ability to dictate some of what happens with their teachers.2) My opponent says students can walk up to teachers and give them suggestions; thus, positively impacting the teacher. This is completely unrealistic. Students will most likely not have the confidence to pull such a stunt, and the teacher will most likely find the student to be condescending. The solution is student evaluation because they will be anonymous if the teacher were to look at them.Opponent's CaseI'll go ahead and cross-apply my attacks in the same format as my opponent to make things simpler since I have already attacked my opponent's case in the previous round.Students have Different Ranges of What To Expect*As I said there, students have signed up for similar classes have similar expectations. Also, my Atlantic Card shows that since teachers with higher ratings teach more. This means students simply expect teachers who will teach them adequately. Also, many of the questions that would be on the evaluation are not opinion questions.Qualifications*again, see attack #2 of \"addressing bias\"*Students spend a lot of time with their teachers. Answering questions about the teacher is simple.Expectations*see attack #1 on benefiting student/teachers*Current System*see attack #1 and #2 on \"flaws in the system\"*For these reasons, vote pro.Thanks again to Unknown_player for accepting!!

The children have a very small part in deciding which teacher gets a grade of achievement or under achievement. The Department of Education grades them on their own merit system and procedure that the department calls for. Why would nyc leave the grading system up to students who are in the learning process themselves that would be ridiculous. The teacher is the one who has to follow a curriculum and depending upon how well the information is portrayed and received by the students the teacher has the obligation to go forth and give the students an outlet to scoping the minds of tommorrow. The teachers will be graded based upon their attendance, their overall rates of the reading and math scores of the students, the parent teacher meetings about the student, the interaction between the students and the teacher. The teacher is no longer comfortable in having tenure they have to work hard in order to keep their position. This gives the teachers a heads up on how well or not well they are doing their job and also it gives those who want to have a career in teaching an incentive or how they can change or better the school system for the students learning and for the teachers who are constantly learning everyday. The Department of Education has the guidelines for these teachers conduct and achievements and the students can only be surveyed as to what the class has given them not much of a which teacher needs to go or stay but what each teacher can do to keep the students attentive and how they can make it more interesting and exciting to learn new material. The students are like the lab rats except there is no harm being done to them intentionally.",

I want to start off by taking off the CR's:Weak points: ~ CR1- Con's CR1 has nothing to do with this topic. \"What administrators want\" have nothing to do with tenures. I suggest Con to focus on the debate. ~ CR2- I urge Con to read my counter rebuttal. I addressed the flaws in the idea that \"\"The financial and career safety tenure provides, persuades better qualified candidates to be teachers.\" In Round 3, R2. Con has no reply and concedes.Now here are some things I would like to address for Con's Rebuttals:CR1- As shown in previous points, Con has ignored my arguments. I clearly provided how tenures inhibit new ideas in my 1st Support. He concedes. Also, notice that he provides his main point that \"they don't have to worry about being fired they are free to experiment\" near the end of the debate. Abusive argumentation is abusive.CR2- Once again, Con ignored my point that people aren't arbitrarily fired in my R2, Round 3. Furthermore, as he has also shown, when those without tenures are fired, those with tenures will NOT be fired which is unfair and supports my 1st and 2nd supports. CR3- My creative opponent has ignored the core of my argument. The point is that teachers may have undesirable habits on their personal basis but still influence children on a large scale. It doesn't have anything to do with other jobs-- the point is kids are affected by those that are backed up by tenures. Also, I did not say that tenures make teachers \"unfirable\", but rather harder to fire. Please don't stick words in my mouth. Here are some flaws with Con's argument as a whole:1. He concedes to many of my rebutals and agrees with my arguments.2. Con digresses from the main debate, while I stayed on topic.3. He overlooks the definition and supports/facts around tenures, while I have brought the debate back on track. Thank you to Con again for his efforts and viewers for their time.

            "conclusion": "A teacher's pay should be merit-based.",
            "premise": "My opponent makes some excellent arguments and it is obvious that she and I agree on a great deal. It seems to me however that her argument centres more on the inadequacies of the current testing system and on the possibility of corruption than on the actual resolution of this debate. My position is that if a reliable means of testing the 'distance travelled' in academic achievement by each pupil was in place and the opportunity for corruption was removed then a teacher's pay should be merit-based. To find more reliable means of testing that are less susceptible to corruption and not \"monumentally expensive\" we have to look no further than one of the links provided by my opponent: http://www.fairtest.org... \"Better methods of evaluating student needs and progress already exist. Good observational checklists used by trained teachers are more helpful than any screening test. Assessment based on student performance on real learning tasks is more useful and accurate for measuring achievement - and provides more information - than multiple-choice achievement tests.... ....Trained teams of judges can be used to rate performance in most any academic or non-academic area. In the Olympic Games, for example, gymnasts and divers are rated by panels of judges, and the high and low scores are thrown out. Studies have shown that, with training, the level of agreement among judges (the \"inter-rater reliability\") is high. As with multiple-choice tests, it is necessary to enact safeguards to ensure that race, class, gender, linguistic or other cultural biases do not affect evaluation.\" I believe that a simple peer-evaluation system could be put in place to help prevent corruption. If a teacher is setting, teaching, invigilating and marking their own tests then obviously there is potential for dishonesty. If these tasks were shared amongst colleagues, perhaps even teachers from other schools, there would be much less opportunity for a teacher to dishonestly affect a student's score. To examine my opponents main points: 1. Is not really an argument against merit based pay but is an examination (no pun) of the flaws of standardised testing. To say there is \"no way to accurately measure student achievement\" seems defeatist to me, just because standardised testing is not accurate doesn't rule out other methods (as shown in my opponent's source). If the current political climate doesn't favour other methods it does not necessarily follow that better ones could not become accepted. 2. Does not argue against merit-based pay, only against bad testing methods and corruption which I have addressed above. 3. Everything in this paragraph I whole-heartedly agree with but again it talks of the unfairness of the current system, not the one I propose. In the UK we have a system where schools are ranked in a 'league table' based on exam results. This leads to the best schools getting bigger budgets so they hire the best teacher's at higher salaries and teach the kids from the richest families because school's performance affects property prices. This is a corrupt system that maintains an artificial elite. The system I propose would involve all teachers at all schools receiving the same basic salary but with individual bonuses based on the improvement (not the grade) of each individual. 4. My opponent says:\"The impacts of merit pay are clear. Highly qualified teachers will take positions in schools where they can achieve. Mediocre teachers (the ones left) will take positions in the schools that need highly qualified teachers instead.\" I believe that in the system I advocate the best teacher's would instead be motivated to work at the worst performing schools, because there they would have the most opportunity to make substantial improvements, thereby earning bigger bonuses. And, briefly to look at my opponent's responses to my previous points: 1. Discussed above, the affirmation will not \"discriminate against certain teachers based solely on the area in which they choose to teach.\" They should be rewarded for the improvements they make not the actual level of ability of their pupils. 2. I think 'distance travelled' could easily be tested by an independent party comparing the work of pupils between one semester and the next. 3. I agree completely that sales has nothing to do with teaching (I attempted to make this clear when I raised the example) I was using it merely as an example of how performance related pay clearly affects motivation. 4. Again, measures including those I mentioned above should of course be taken to prevent such corruption and just because current tests are \"deeply flawed\" and ripe for abuse, it does not follow that if this situation were fixed teacher's pay should not be merit-based. 5. In listing negative impacts my opponent seems to be referring to the impact of systems such as the UK 'league table' model that I mentioned above. I do not advocate schools with the best overall exam results being able to pay a higher salary to teachers. I think that is wrong. I think teachers should be paid for the positive impact they have on young peoples education, not because they are teaching a privileged minority. A teacher's pay should be merit-based. Thankyou.",

            "conclusion": "The collective bargaining rights of teachers should be removed",
            "premise": "Thanks to Darkkermit for his argument. I\u2019m now going to pick up where I left off in refutation. My opponent speaks of increasing efficiency in education by removing collective bargaining. He hasn\u2019t shown though, that bargaining itself, is responsible for the inefficiencies. I\u2019ve seen no fix so far that warrants an intrusion on the rights of teachers to make choices about their representation. Finances are a consideration, but school districts are NOT able to raise taxes. They can ask for an increase in the budget, but are unlikely to see any change, other than negative, when times are bad. A union can not \u201craise the price of it\u2019s labor\u201d, it can only ask for that raise in negotiations. One of the biggest expenses in any industry is labor costs. That will not change by removing bargaining. Common sense dictates that making a profession less financially secure, and denying rights based on public sentiment will dissuade people from joining the profession. This will lead to having to keep bad teachers, not because of the union, but out of necessity. We\u2019re going to get what we pay for. My opponent talks about differences between public and private sector bargaining, and percentage of union workers. Those things are largely irrelevant to the resolution. It should be noted that the decrease in private sector union members coincides with the loss of middle-class manufacturing jobs, and also an increase in worker protection mandated by law. Many things workers enjoy today, OSHA safety regulations, 40-hour work week, overtime pay, vacations, FMLA and military leave, etc., can be attributed to the struggles of unions. Those benefits aren\u2019t only given to union workers though, thus my contention that unions affect ALL workers in a good way. Unions act as a check and balance system, the only options are to keep them, or depend on increased governmental regulation. Below is an excerpt from a very interesting, and relevant article that all should read.(4) \"Legislated labor protections are sometimes considered alternatives to collective bargaining in the workplace, but the fact of the matter is that a top-down strategy of legislating protections may not be influential unless there is also an effective voice and intermediary for workers at the workplace\u2014unions. In all of the research surveyed, no institutional factor appears as capable as unions of acting in workers' interests (Weil 2003). Labor legislation and unionization are best thought of as complements, not substitutes.\"He argues against education being a public service, but it is what it is. He is free to fight for change, but in the meantime, his disagreement with the system does not warrant punishing teachers. They have a right to fight against that change, just as he does to fight for it. Teacher strikes are becoming a thing of the past. Many states are passing no-strike laws. Though pro-union, I agree with this trend, and so do many teachers(1). I do not defend teacher's strikes, and refer back to my argument about finding a middle ground and not allowing the hard-liners, on either side, to be in complete control. There is a middle ground, and many states are finding it, where strikes are concerned. My opponent keeps alluding to difficulty in firing teachers. I've shown that tenure and dismissal is set by the states, not the collective bargaining process, and should not be part of this debate. These videos and articles do nothing but attempt to prejudice the reader, and distract from the issues. They are highly prejudicial, and should not be given weight in the decision. They are evidence of the highly political nature of my opponents position.Introduction Sorry that my opponent resents my statement. Perhaps if the status quo were being challenged for the right reasons, and teachers weren\u2019t scapegoats for the anti-union movement, I might be more receptive to his cause. With due respect, having a financial stake in something does not make us experts in what the real problems are in that system. Teachers are there everyday, in the classroom, they know what the problems are, they are the experts, not us. If my opponent valued teachers, as he claimed, he would respect that fact. He would also respect their ability to know what they need, and allow them to make choices for themselves, rather than protest against them under the guise of protecting them. The only \u201chijacking\u201d being done, is that of their individual rights and freedom of association. Protection My opponent\u2019s argument seems to me to be a clear impact turn. First he argues that it\u2019s too hard to fire a teacher, but here he has presented evidence as to why it SHOULD be hard. This argument shows why it is not in the best interest of education, or the public, to fire teachers except in clearly egregious cases. Also, I restate that tenure is usually a matter of law, not bargaining. What if the bottom 6-10% of teachers are those in the most difficult schools, with the most difficult students?? Does that mean that they should be fired just to make room for unproven college grads?? Of course not, that\u2019s absurd and unless they can be shown to be deserving of termination, my opponent\u2019s above argument is why it\u2019s in no one\u2019s best interest. My opponent has yet to address the issue of teachers being at the mercy of the quality of students.I\u2019ll say again that teachers are the only ones who know what protections they need. For someone who isn\u2019t a teacher to claim to know what workplace issues they face, and need help with is absurd. Unions provide many protections for the rights of teachers, not just disciplinary issues. Past Practice There is no pre-set framework that I must abide by in this debate. My opponent is free to make whatever arguments he wishes, as am I. We could not do justice to a debate on this subject if we did not consider legal issues. Past practice means that if an employer gives a right to workers, and it is clearly understood by both parties, they cannot just arbitrarily remove that right without due process. Creating a mob mentality and attacking the rights of a group without due process is immoral. As I said this is a case-by-case issue, applicable in some, not so in others, depending on laws in that state. When laws are passed banning the right, then we have a different discussion. Until then legal issues must be considered. Other Legal Issues My opponent seems to be injecting his morals here, but what makes his morals the authority that all should be bound by?? He doesn't like unions, that's fine, he has the right not to join one. Yet he's in favor of taking away another's right to decide for themself. Why is that the correct moral position?? I maintain that if one group of public employees has a right, it is discriminatory to remove the right from another group. The strike issue has been addressed. The same checks exist in the public sector. ALL employees are bound by budgets, whether they're public or private sector.Specialization It is not the job of unions to create jobs, to use that as an argument them is misleading. Doctors and lawyers usually work for themselves, under their own license. There are many organizations that represent the interests of these professions. The AMA (2), APA, the Bar Association (3), to name a few. Are they politically active?? Yes. Do doctors and lawyers have a right to have a voice in our political system, where it affects their profession?? Yes, and so do teachers. \u201cSociety should not bare the risks of an individul's choice\u201d- Society demands specialized degrees for this service to the public, those who comply should be rewarded, not penalized and raked over the coals just because there are a few bad teachers.1. http://www.nysdeputy.org...2. http://www.ama-assn.org...?3. http://www.americanbar.org...4. http://www.epi.org...",

            "conclusion": "The collective bargaining rights of teachers should be removed",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for the debate. CON falsely claims that I have not shown that collective bargaining are responsible for education inefficiency. I have shown multiple reasons why collective bargaining is inefficient. It is mathematically proven to be inefficient based on the theory of monopolies. It is also responsible for inefficiency by blocking education reform. CON states that school districts cannot raise taxes. However teacher unions finance politicians in exchange the politician raises taxes, which would allow increasing the budget. AFT has donated millions of dollars in campaign contributions. However, teacher unions do increase the size of the school budget. CON even states that the biggest expense is labor. Yet teacher unions are directly responsible for the high cost of labor since collective bargaining raises that cost. As I already showed, teachers are paid more than psychologists, and public teachers receive much higher salaries then private nonunionized teachers. CON states that removing collective bargaining rights will create bad teachers since they will get paid less. First, If a teacher cannot be fired, then the teacher will have less of a financial incentive to teach well. Second, If falling salaries create poor teachers, then the school district will increase teacher salary. No unions required. Privatized schools do better than public schools, yet pay teachers less and do not unionize teachers. CON dismisses the difference between public and private sector bargaining, but does not give an explanation why even though I showed why public sector bargaining is quite different and more dangerous to economic liberty than private sector bargaining. Rejecting an argument arbitrary is not a form of argumentation. CON states unions are responsible for many government worker regulations, yet there is no proof that either unions are responsible or that the regulations are good. OSHA safety regulation has done nothing to increase safety, and the rate of reduction in workplace fatalities has not decreased due to OSHA [1]. Mandating a 40-hour work week is also pointless. People choose work based on how much he or she is willing to work. Hence, this is why part-time jobs exists. The market works so that workers salaries and working conditions improve as capital resources and technology improves, and no unions or government intervention is needed. Henry Ford decided to pay his workers a higher salary, give them less hours of work, and created a sociological department to improve workers lives. Henry Ford did not do this out of generosity, because he wanted healthy workers and less turnovers. He was actually quite anti-union as well. CON\u2019s only rebuttal to education being a public service is that \u2018It is what it is\u2019 and even confirms that teacher unions are responsible. What he is rebutting is wrong, since I favor school choice. School choice is what makes US universities the best in the world. CON argues against a program proven to work that the teacher union blocks. CON states that tenure and dismissal is set through the states and should be part of the debate. This is wrong. His own source shows that teacher unions play a part in tenure. \u201cThe following are some of the matters that are often the subject of this bargaining: Tenure\u201d[2] Also: When school attendant, Michelle Rhee proposed a voluntarily two-tier track to either have teachers have tenure or give teachers the potential to earn as much as $140,00 per year, the teacher union needed to vote on the proposal. Why are they voting if they have no say? [3] Introduction: CON is using ad homeinum attacks to discredit me. He says that the status quo is not being challenged for the right reasons. I just provided arguments and reasons in this debate to explain the problem. And somehow I should be discredit since I have a financial incentive, yet somehow teachers do not have a financial incentive to keep the status quo. Really? Also CON accuses me of not being an expert and should listen to the teachers, yet what about the school attendances that try to push education reform yet fail? Isn\u2019t the school attendant the expert in education? Why aren\u2019t the teacher unions listening to them? What about the teacher in the video I showed that spoke out against the teacher unions? Con is trying to discredit me without providing any arguments. This is a foul debate tactic. Protection: CON states that this is a clear turn, without actually citing why it should be a turn. Does he want teachers that commit sexual misconduct, abusiveness, and do not follow the curriculum? Extend arguments that teachers do not need to be protected due to internal system that protect teachers. CON keeps on going on the fact that teachers are at the mercy of the students. This is like stating that doctors are at the mercy of their patient. Everyone realizes that a patient dying from terminal cancer is different from a patient dying from a broken arm. Everyone knows that teaching students that are not educated to begin with is difficult. I already explained that teacher performance can be evaluated by measuring the performance of students before and after the school year. CON then tries to attack my claims, stating that I\u2019m not a teacher. So what? Does he seriously believe that somehow private teachers and lawyers attract much more bad performers then public teachers, and that\u2019s why the teacher firing rate is so low? Give me a break. I was a high school student a few years back with good grades. There were some really bad teachers out there. Past Practice Resolution: The collective bargaining rights of teachers should be removedImplementation: Create a law that removes the collective bargaining rights of teachers There, refuted. Other Legal Issues Create a law that removes collective bargaining rights of state employees. There, refuted. As explained earlier, state budgets can easily be increased through taxation obtained through coercion. The product in the public sector does not need to be demanded unlike products in the private sector. If you have a relentless private union who refuses to compromise, the company goes bankrupt. If you have a relentless public union who refuses to compromise, the government raises taxes or increases the debt. Teacher unions and other public unions pay off politicians to raise taxes or increase the debt in order to finance their budgets. Specialization CON states that it is not the job of the union to create jobs. So this argument is nonsense, since a teacher is still taking a huge risk since a job cannot be guaranteed. In fact, based on my previous analysis, unions make the risks greater. The AMA and bar association are quite different from AFT since lawyers and medical professions lose their license much more frequently then teachers, do not contribute any campaign money to politicians, and are used to improve the profession. Go on to the AMA and bar association and you\u2019ll find published peer reviewed journals, ways to improve oneself professionally. Go on AFT and you\u2019ll find almost none of that. CON uses the excuse for lawyers and doctors that many of them work individually. Note that many doctors work at hospitals, and many lawyers work at law firms and corporations, yet are not unionized. Also note that a teacher can work independently as a tutor. CON still not explain why teachers should be \u201cprotected\u201d due to financial risks, but not others. Conclusion: CON fails to defend his arguments and instead uses ad homenium attacks and appeal to (false) athority arguments isntead of actually takig on my arguments. I look forward to the final round. http://www.coyoteblog.com...[1] http://www.enotes.com...[2] http://teachersunionexposed.com...[3]",

            "premise": "I am not against unions per se. In certain industries unions are useful, but unions with excessive power are a problem. I have a particular issue with teacher's unions that make it near impossible to fire a teacher after tenure, which in itself is an insane system. What other job do you have guaranteed security after three years no matter how bad you are? Teacher's unions hurt the education system by creating a system where there is little or no incentive to really be excellent. Instead a teacher will just do the basics because they aren't going to be fired after tenure. And many teachers are let go right before tenure just because it is so hard to fire them after it. The tenure system rewards mediocrity and ensures that departments and schools will continue to be filled with poor teachers. This is terrible for kids who are taught by them. The real crux of my problem with unions is when they get arrogant and demand excessive things. Incredible union demands in the auto industry now cripple domestic companies who are forced to pay massive health care and pension costs. All of these things hurt industry. I also hate strikes. They serve little purpose other than to irritate and disrupt the lives of thousands. If a teacher's union calls a strike then the people hurt are the kids; if it's a transport worker's union like the recent ones in New York and Philly the entire area suffers. No group should have the power to do this kind of damage to an entire economy. Finally, I hate the way unions act politically. They endorse Democrats almost always and use member funds to further their agenda, which almost always means funding Democrats regardless of member's wishes. They support laws like the destruction of the secret ballot so they can bully people into unionizing. They engage in smear campaigns against non-union companies like Walmart and use their political influence to try and hurt Walmart by the force of government. In general unions are constantly diminishing in this country and they're desperate to gain new members. In conclusion my problems with unions can be boiled down to four things then - excessive demands that cripple business, strikes that hurt entire economies, extremely biased political action using member funds, and the attempt to abuse the power of government to force people to unionize and hurt companies that don't wish to organize. Unions must be put in check and the unholy Democrat-union alliance must be curtailed.",

There are so many teachers with licenses that don't teach well at all. Just because a teacher has a license doesn't mean that they are better at teaching a subject than a person who doesn't have a teaching license and probably knows more about the subject than the teacher with the license. Actually, the way a student performs after being taught is a perfect reflection of a teachers teaching ability. According to your side on this, a teacher with a license should be capable of teaching any student how to correctly use spelling and grammar skills, right?",

            "premise": "All 50 states including the District or Colombia and Porto Rico required teachers to have a license. But why do they require it? According to the Board of Education they require teachers to have licences so parents know that their kid is being thought by someone who knows what they are talking about. Every school wants their students to actually have a excellent learning experience and have a bright future. Teachers have to get background checks while they are in the process of getting their license. They get this so the Board of Education knows that students and other teachers know that this person is safe to be around. Background checks are used to make sure that a convicted felon is not working in a place where they can harm people. Parents should know that their children will be safe at school and is around a positive role model. Now I notice multiple times that you mentioned my grammar and spelling and I know that your just a freshman in high school like me so how do you know what grammatically correct and what's spelled corrected. You know as much about literacy as I do. What gives you the right to say someone doesn't speak grammatically correct or doesn't know how to spell. You and I both have different views on what's grammatically and how something is spelled it all depends on where you were raised and live. For example the UK has different views on language arts and literacy than the USA. Every where in the world grammar and spelling is different. What we think is grammatically incorrect could be grammatically correct somewhere else. I was raised in the south and was raised differently than you. What the south think is grammatically correct is different from what the Midwest thinks is grammatically correct. For example the word ain't I was taught that ain't was a word and is proper grammar that how most kids in the south were taught. Now someone from the Midwest might think differently. So you shouldn't point out someone's grammaratical correctness because you don't know how they were taught especially when they were taught in different parts of the country or different parts of the world. Your also just a highschooler you don't have a degree in language arts and other literacy things so you shouldn't be saying anything about my or anybody grammar or spelling. It was a pleasure debating with you",

            "premise": "The creation of national social policies which provide secure, and stable, wages for teachers is fundamental. Social policy can make satisfied teachers. A key concern amongst teachers is finance - inadequate wages and insurance. Teacher wages is considerably lower than other formal professions - combining to enforce low morale and occupational motivation as pay is too low to sustain individuals and households (Bennell, 2004). In South Africa an average teaching salary is 19,535 ZAR in contrast to the 28,235 ZAR average granted in all jobs in South Africa (Salary Explorer, 2013). Further, social policy is required to introduce teacher pension schemes. Pension schemes are provided for workers within the formal employment sector, by various public organisations - including the government and GEPF[1]. However, some national pension schemes are more developed than others and teachers need to be ensured the profession can provide investments for future security. An ageing population only reinforces its importance. [1]\u00a0See further readings: GEPF, 2013.",

Of course, I agree with my opponent's point that teachers should not be spending class time texting on their phones or something of the sort. But in order to respond to emergencies they will need to carry cellphones to school as I stated above. Hence teachers should be allowed to have cellphones at school. In addition cellular devices can be used in other ways as well which is productive for the class. For instance, if it is a smartphone then the teacher can look up information if a student asks a tough question. Even though there may be laptops or such devices, a smartphone is a good backup device if the teacher's original device is not functioning properly. Hence teachers should be allowed cellphones at school.",

            "premise": "I guess this is rebuttal 2?To make it easier for everyone to see (mostly me), I'll attack her case first.Flaws with the current system:1) Test Scores: If we're being technical here, grants actually could help the students because it goes into the school and not in the pockets of the administration. Test scores are just a tool for the administration to use in teacher evaluations, and they aren't used alone. Tools are useful. While there are students who do well with negligent, there would be a re-occurring pattern by the test scores for the majority of students who are in between good test takers and bad. I'll get to the student evaluation effectiveness later. 2) Principal reviews: Attacks my evidence by using evidence that doesn't relate. If she were to find evidence that proves that this piece of evidence is actually biased and not just facts about teacher reviews. This evidence actually doesn't mention student evaluations. This is the reason I used it. It gives good evidence that simply shows the current system. We could argue source credibility this whole time, but I'm going to focus on what really matters: the arguments. Accuracy of student evaluations: 1) The Atlantic Card: My opponent attacks principal evaluations by stating that I have no evidence on how accurate they are exactly by a study. It's not that I found statistics that were against me in this point or for me and I didn't post them. I just haven't found anything. Due to time constraints, I have no time to search all day for this one piece of evidence. Proving that they are effective should be enough for me here. The reason my opponent could easily find evidence for herself is because a majority of the schools don't use student evaluations on teachers, so a study would be simply to do. She can state that because of the evidence, she's right, but then I could say the same thing. 2) Addressing biases: my opponent and I are speaking of two different biases when we compare gender bias and just not liking the teacher. There is a lot more that would cause somebody to give a teacher a bad review with a bias than gender bias. Gender biases are easily detectable. In my opponents own words, students should be top priority. If students aren't succeeding and the teacher is good, there needs to be a change. If students gave the teacher a good review, there would be no change and students would continue to do poorly. Student achievement cannot be ruled as unimportant. It is half or more than half of what a teacher's job is next to being a good teacher. If they truly are good teachers, we should see it in student achievements without student evaluations. Lastly, students are not qualified. As I've said many times before, students don't understand everything that goes into being a teacher, or being a part of administration. It's the job of the administration to decided who is qualified as a teacher or not. They set the standard, not the students. Improving the School System: 1) Tenure is flawed. Like The evidence in R3 said, they give it by seniority and not teacher capability. This point is irrelevant. 2) Thanks for clearing that up. I'm guessing that my opponent thinks all teachers doing a poor job should be fired rather than helped to become better teachers. They don't need to be fired if they're doing a poor job. My opponent alludes to the idea that this means they are held to a lower standard. Without evidence, there is no way to prove this. With all of the evidence I provided in R3, we can see that they are not held to a low standard. 3) My opponent attacks my analogy. I simply came up with it on the spot to be clever. I couldn't find anything better to compare that would fit the best. Of course restaurants don't have a lasting impact, but I was simply trying to point out why students are not qualified and that it is the job of the administration to set the standard. I won't defend my analogy because it's just a tool for my main argument: the administration knows a ton more about teaching than students making them more qualified that students. That was my point. There is certain complexity to teaching that students couldn't answer questions about since students only have general knowledge. Benefits the teacher/students 1) a lot of kids hate school and still learn. A lot of people eat when the don't like the food. Either way, they get what they need. 2) The teacher could also make a survey just for students to fill out without the evaluation. If they care that much, they should care enough to do something like this. My case: Students have different ranges of what they expect: Students even in the same exact classes will have different expectations in a teacher in general. They all have opinions on what is good and bad teaching. This is a fact. Qualifications *see attack 3 on \"Improving school system\" and attack 2 on \"addressing biases\" Expectations This goes back to my first and second point. Current system For the reasons that students evaluations would cause problems in the current system, and the current system evaluates teacher adequately and accurately, this point is proven. I have proven this throughout the debate. ---For the all of these reasons and the reasons in previous rounds, vote con. Thank you debatability. It was an honor. Muchas gracias all voters tambien.",

            "premise": "When you are a teacher, it is very likely that children will look up to you. The problem with that is that when they become fond of you, it is only to convince the teacher to give them better grades. This has happened many times in my school, and when the teacher finds out, I can tell she seems hurt. Plus, what is so great about getting along with children? It has no benefit at all. Of course, it might be for self-pleasure, but look what happens in the end; the teacher ends up getting hurt. Even if the bond is real, the teacher probably has friends of her/his own and the student too. The teacher would spend an overall of only 45-55 minutes with that student. As you teach, it is true that you review things from the past, but it gets even more boring every single school year that passes by. You would get tired of teaching the same thing over and over again. If it is boring to some students, it would just be a waste of the teacher's and the student's time. Being a teacher comes with risks. A report from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, published earlier this month, found that threats and assaults were becoming a 'daily reality' for teachers. More than half of school staff had been attacked or intimidated by pupils or parents in the last year, according to the report. Of those, more than eight-in-10 said the aggressive behavior from pupils took the form of insults, seven-in-10 said they had been intimidated or threatened and almost half had been physically attacked.

This also terminates a teacher's fear of being fired, so even a good teacher can get lazy.Students are assigned to the public school in their area. This forces some students to attend a more corrupt, or dangerous school, and ensures that the school will have enough students to stay open. The school can change the additude of the students, and lead them to failure.Common Core Standards - the poor teachers that tenure protects are now educating their students with common core standards. It would be bad enough if all teachers were at least average in performance. Common core is widely known as not being very efficient, and soon will be limmiting students. Government officials could soon start poisoning the minds of students with common core standardsPublic schools can be under-funded, which can lead to cancellation of activities like choir, band, dance, and theater. Over-achieving, intellingent kids are often a minority. They will be discouraged among students, and taught that smart means unpopular. There are many popular misconceptions and myths about private schoolStudents can use money to pass a class, or get good grades - this is a common, and hilarious myth. Private schools have very strict rules about giving a teacher any money, even as a gift. Especially in middle and high school, where students are more likely to try cheting. If you were to ask anyone at a private school, student or teacher, they would all tell you that no one tries to use money to pass classes.All students in private school are rich, and upper class - this is a steriotype. Students in private school are mainly upper-middle class, or somewhere in that area. Some students even get work-study oppritunities, which lets lower-class students attend private school for cheaper. They only have to help with a little work, like helping to clean after school. Low-8ncome students also can receive free lunch. Of coarse, some students in private school are richer. What other school would these students go to?Students are all very sheltered from the real world - a very common steriotype. Since most people go to public school, private school students will live in neiborhoods with public school students, and can become friends with them. All private school students are aware of the problems low class families face. They learn from the news, from public school friends, and from common knolwdge. Anyway, is being sheltered from drugs, alcohol, and other illegal activity really a bad thing? In a private school, students have a safe, pure, and healthy learning environment.",

The first is to stipulate as factual Instigator's contention bad teachers are allowed to remain in the classroom rather than give an opportunity to more innovative and qualified teachers. The second is to state it's not the unions fault. The fault lies with the administration and with the school board. What Instigator suggests is the unions not do their job or at least one of their jobs which is to represent and protect the interests of their members. Ethical standards and legal requirements do not allow them to decline to represent 'bad' teachers. There is a way to get rid of bad teachers-- school boards can enact policies allowing for removing such teachers; and administrators can document cases against them. Unions can fight it as they should but if the school boards and administrators do their jobs the bad teachers will go-- and the good teachers who may be unfairly or mistakenly targeted. will be protected. It is the last point why unions should be allowed to protect bad teachers",

I provided it for those who need a reminder on school shootings and the statistics of deaths.\"We want our students to feel safe and secure in the learning environments, so it makes no sense to put them in that situation\"I'm not proposing that we arm teachers all the time. I'm simply saying that teachers should have access to some sort of weapon for self defence and the defence of students.I said this in the beginning: \"If teachers were equipped with guns or defensive objects (eg tasers)[...]\" A weapon, anything used against an opponent, could be considered a taser (http://dictionary.reference.com...). Which as we know is harmless.You may argue that tasers will only scare the students. But considering how kids watch TV (http://www.pbs.org...) these days, it will only affect a small percentage of the students to know that their teacher has access to a taser that might not even be exposed. Looking at the shooting of Washington:http://www.nydailynews.com...http://www.kirotv.com... Where a teacher tried to stop the shooter...\"She\u2019s the one that intercepted him with the gun. He tried either reloading or tried aiming at her. She tried moving his hand away and he tried shooting and shot himself in the neck\u201d Imagine the scenario if the teacher has a taser:1)\"He tried either reloading or tried aiming at her.\"2) Teacher tasered student.3) 911 dispatch arrives in time to prevent any further deaths.\"We want our students to feel safe and secure in the learning environments, so it makes no sense to put them in that situation\"Will the students feel more insecure if the teacher just saved their lives?\"Many measures can be used to prevent kids who would want to shoot up a school from committing the action. Typically those children get the guns from their parents. If we mandate gun safes in homes, children will not get their hands on guns.\"Which will be easier?1) Arming teachers with tasers2) Getting background checks on all parents and refusing their kid tuition if they have a gun. And then debating gun control.Situation 1 seems more likely to happen.Furthermore, students die of alcohol poisoning all the time (https://www.google.com...). What makes you think controlling guns will be easier and more effective?In conslusion:It is only logical that as long as we moniter teachers with tasers, schools will be just as safe, if not more safe...",

            "conclusion": "High schools should add students to the teacher evaluation system.",
            "premise": "Before I begin, I made a minor mistake with my websites when. I sourced them in R2. I accidentally made it to where it simply took you to the home page. If you wish to see the exact page I looked at, here they are for R2: (1) http://njmonthly.com... (2) chrome://external-file/Adolescents'%20Expectations%20of%20Teachers.pdf -this one is being tricky for some reason.

(4) http://www2.ed.gov...(5) http://www.ed.gov...(6) http://files.eric.ed.gov...Now attacking my opponents case: \"The Flaws With the Current System\" -Essentially, I will also be building up my point, the current system is the most effective way to evaluate teachers, while I attack my opponents arguments on this topic so that I don't have to repeat myself later. 1) The first issue was the test scores. My opponent tried to prove that test scores have little worth when evaluating a teacher. She argued that they only give the tests for grants. While this is true, they play a major role in evaluating a teacher. The standardized tests show how much a student has learned. My opponent mistook my statement she quoted by thinking that I meant it doesn't involve the teacher. The tests completely rely on what the student has learned from the teacher. The teacher controls what he or she teaches and how well he or she teaches it, but the teacher cannot have actual physical control over the actual score. It is accurate because it shows what the teacher has been able to teach in the school. 2) The second issue is principal reviews. Here is a piece of evidence that sums up my point. \"More recent research suggests that principal evaluations are most accurate at the top and bottom ends of the teacher performance range. Observations of teachers\" classroom performance and standardized test scores measure different dimensions of teacher performance.\" Principal reviews can pick up anything that the standardized test scores leave out. This fills the gaps, thus making the system strong. There is argument over a teacher changing teaching once a principal walks in, but this is only part of principal reviews. A majority of it is based in teacher leadership meetings, seeing student achievement, seeing the depth of information by end-of-the-year tests (finals), other administrator reviews, and even student assessments (2). This keeps the sight for error broad so that nothing is missed while keeping it professional and using qualified personnel. This proves that the current system is in no need of extra variables that would cause inaccuracy in the future. \"Accuracy of Student Evaluations.\" -I will build up my complete opposite point, A system with students added would not be accurate, in the process of attacking this point. 1) My opponents evidence form The Atlantic that shows that teachers with high ratings could fit 6 more months of learning than those with lower ratings is irrelevant. The school could have easily known this by the various methods I listed above in principal evaluations. For example, by seeing the finals, the administration could have easily come to this conclusion because the depth of information on it would significantly lower for the teachers with lower ratings. Having students evaluate the teachers in this situation was completely unnecessary......(about the students getting it right?).... 2) Addressing biases, there is no way to prove they don't exist because they do. This affects the rating................................ My opponent states that the two pieces of evidence make students qualified when in reality, it would only prove that they aren't not qualified. Just because they won't lie or call a teacher bad because of grades doesn't mean they are qualified to know the standards by which the teacher is held at the school. Therefore, they are not qualified by this argument even IF it were correct. Improves the School System -For this one, I will simply attack it. 1) Teachers that gain tenure get it because the tenure system is flawed itself and not a direct cause of the teacher evaluation system. It has become \"a system that favors seniority and ignores merit sends a terrible signal to anyone thinking about teaching\" (3). To prevent this, schools need to pay more attention to student achievement (3). Schools aren't giving tenure because of good teachers necessarily. 2)Saying \"bad teachers\" is a loose term that can be taken on many levels. There are no direct and specific qualifications for the word \"bad.\" The evidence does not say anything about whether these so called \"bad teachers\" were new, experienced, well-educated themselves in their subject, etc. If it was proved that this large amount of teachers that weren't fired were inefficient and couldn't do their job, then I'd like to hear the argument. 2) The current system puts students first without giving them power that is not theirs. The whole basis of teacher evaluations is to make better students and provide a better education. Here is an analogy. Restaurants always put their customers first. This doesn't mean they get to decide what a good price is for the quality of food. The owners get to decide that and they will fail as a restaurant if they have badly priced food or just terrible quality food. If reasonable, serious people were able to decide as customers what the price of the food should be, it would inevitably be lower than its true quality and price. The customers know nothing of the restaurant world so they aren't qualified to do this. It is the same with students. They don't know enough about the standards of a teacher to put a \"price\" on their teaching. For all we know, they could have a brand new teacher that's working really hard but just hasn't figured it out yet. It is the responsibility of the owner, or administration, to set the standards and hold the chefs, or teachers, to that standard. Benefits the Student and Teacher. -This simply goes back to my two arguments: Students have many different ranges of what they expect in a teacher, and It is inevitable that students will expect something that the teacher will not meet.. I will support these two while attacking my opponent's argument. 1) It won't benefit the student. Satisfying the students isn't the primary focus of a school. It is unimportant. The gap that opponent speaks of is inevitable. Students don't 100% expect the same kind of teacher in his or her style of speaking teaching, control of the class, personality, or methods of teaching. There will always be a gap. Not reaching the expectations of the students isn't always a bad thing. For lack of specifics, we must rule in the great possibility that the expectations were only not met by slight differences and not necessarily completely drastic being the opposite of expectations. It is possible that the expectations were merely approached which isn't all of the sudden wrong. This also goes to my point of student expectations that cannot possibly be met. This must be considered also. 2) it won't benefit the teachers spoke of in this point. Students at any point in time can walk up to teacher and talk to them about this issue of teachers wanting to become better. If they truly do, I'm sure they won't mind that a student gives feedback. Some teachers might even ask on their own. Student evaluations would simply turn feedback from students talking to writing. It's easy either way, it does neither harm nor good. Thus, it is unnecessary. >>>>>To make things clear, I will show exactly how I defended my arguments and defend the ones I have not addressed in the attack on my opponents case: Students have many different ranges of what they expect in a teacher. *see attack 1 on \"Benefits the students and teachers\"* My opponent attacked my argument by bringing up the format of the evaluation and trying to show that it would make it more accurate. In the study, the evidence I provided, it was a survey of what they wanted in a hypothetical teacher. They had different preferences. This would obviously reflect on the evaluation. I know for a fact at my school, some teachers are despised by students while others find them amazing. There is too much of a contrast to give an accurate evaluation. There need to be qualifications for students to have the right standard to evaluate the teachers. *see attack 2 on \"Flaws with the current system\" and attack 2 on \"Improves the school system\"* It is inevitable that the students will expect something the teacher will not meet. *see attack 1 on \"Benefits the students and teachers.\" The current system is the most effective way to evaluate teachers. *see attack 1 and 2 on \"Flaws with the current system.\" and basically everything else* For the many arguments above, students should NOT be added to the teacher evaluation system.

The nuns focused on Jesus and the bible, where my science teacher focused on God. My science teacher's \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d was, since God created everything, therefore, the physical Laws of Nature are the handwriting of God and the scientific method was a way to read God's handwriting. In essence, the Laws of Nature were here before the birth of Jesus. His \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d about the handwriting of God being more accurate than man's written scripture about God, was an enlightening moment. Since teachers are \"not perfect,\" those prophets (the ones who write scripture) are also teachers, and therefore, they too are \u201cnot perfect.\u201d In summary, from my science teacher's \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d was, for those of faith, including preachers and prophets, should be careful when studying man's written scripture about God. We must remember man is fallible, and those who study such scriptures may misinterpret of what God wants; therefore, God gets--and, in some cases, God help us all.I was very fortunate to have a science teacher who gave his \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d on the difference between the handwriting of God, relative to man's handwritten scripture about Jesus and God.I will advise Pro to be aware of institutional biases in \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d that exist throughout all educational systems. The subjects having the least bias in \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d would be mathematics followed by physical science. All other subjects are a function of \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d not only by the \u201cteacher\u201d but by the authors who write the text books you study from. My advice to Pro, is to understand \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201copinions\u201d are an inseparable part of humanity. And in saying that, while doing your homework, use the internet to challenge your teacher. Not to spite your teacher, but to enjoy the zenith in learning the spectrum of \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201copinions.\u201d This zenith is the nursery in the genesis of your \u201clove of wisdom,\u201d Greek translation: philosophy. Your philosophical evolution is a function of a teacher's \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cpersonal opinions.\u201d Where everyone, is a \u201cnot perfect\u201d teacher.",

            "discussionTitle": "The collective bargaining rights of teachers should be removed",
            "conclusion": "The collective bargaining rights of teachers should be removed",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for participating in this tournament. As part of the debate format, in each round one is either affirming one's own case or making a rebuttal. Never both in the same round. This is to save character space. The final round is a conclusion, in which no arguments or rebuttals are made. Each side just makes a case why he felt his arguments were better. If my opponent accepts these conditions then we shall proceed. Definition Collective bargaining \u2013 workers do not bargain their salary as an individual, but collectively as an organization, usually through a trade union that represent their interests, using various tactics to obtain higher salaries and benefits, which would fail under individual action. I will use the moral framework of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism states that an action should be taken If the utility, or well being of society, will be improved overall from that action. I concede that removing collective bargaining would harm employed teachers. However in this policy, the benefit teachers obtain are so low in comparison to the utility society would receive that the good outweighs the bad. I will make the assumption that education benefits society. Education teaches students critical thinking and students learn information that can benefit themselves through a higher salary and benefit society as a whole. Schooling is an issue that affects everyone. Everyone has had to go to school at some point in their life and many parents have children in school. A well educated population is necessary If a nation wants to remain a wealthy nation and to uphold the ideas of the republic. I can embark more on why education is important, but unless questioned, I will assume it is a given. I will also demonstrate that removing collective bargaining rights would increase the efficiency of school systems and would allow for school reforms that would improve education. This benefits society since it reduces costs on education and improves education. It will note why collective bargaining in the private sector is vastly different then collective bargaining in the public sector. The collective bargaining power of unions in the private sector is relatively weak. If a labor union demands higher compensation, the private firm may be unable to deliver it, since the polices can bankrupt the firm. This is the reason why only 6.9% of workers in the private sector are privatized[1]. However, labor unions in the public sector are more powerful because they receive compensation from the state. State programs do not compete fairly against private programs. As a result, 36.2% of public employees are unionized[1]. The state can obtain funds from tax payers, offer their services for \u2018free', and create laws that either disallow or make it difficult for private companies to enter the market. Private companies can only make a profit If consumers are willing to pay for the product, while the public sector can extract money through force. If one does not want a \u2018public good', then he or she has to pay for it anyways or else be thrown in jail. Therefore, since the public sector does not need to worry about bankruptcy and acquiring funds as much as the private sector, labor unions can increase the price of their labor and block reform that will improve education. Teacher unions also have incredible political and social power. If a teacher union decides to go on strike then news media and parents will be in a frenzy. Parents will be upset that their child is not getting an education and it will obtain press coverage. Politicians will be blamed, and possibly lose reelection over the ordeal. Therefore, teacher unions can use strikes far more effectively more than almost any other organization. In terms of political power, teacher unions greatly influence public opinion. For example, many people believe the myth that teachers are overpaid, which I will explain later. Parents, teachers, and celebrities were able to create a huge rallies in Washington DC and Wisconsin to support them[2]. Teacher unions use their fees to pay for politician's campaign fees and lobbying. The National Educational Association has spent over 12 million dollars in Washington from 2008-2010.[3] \"Coincidentally\" , the NEA spent over twice as much money they do normally during the same time period that school choice movement became big and three well made documentary videos advocating school choice and reform. Even liberal president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, known for dramatically increasing the size of the public sector stated: \"The process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service,\" [4] It is a myth that most teachers are underpaid. As John Stossel segment shows, teachers are paid more than the average wage in America. They also enjoy many perks such as pension plans, job security, and summers off. Hour per hour, teachers make more than psychologist, chemists, and physical therapists. People choose a job based on a number of reasons. However, people are free to choice a job that he or she finds most satisfying or pays well. Nobody is forced to work an \u2018underpaid' job. If teachers were indeed \u2018underpaid' we would expect to see a shortage of teachers and people would not apply to be a teacher. However, If anything there is a surplus of qualified teachers. In some cities, there is a 12:1 ratio between applications and open jobs [5]. These statistics are from BEFORE the great recession. This surplus is bad since potential teachers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to attain a degree in education, only to find that there are no jobs in education. It should also be noted that it is nearly impossible to fire a bad teacher. While in most occupations, If one is bad in one's profession or behaves poorly, he or she is fired. However, due to tenure, the legal fees, amount of steps and length of time it takes to fire a tenured teacher makes the process impossible. Accordingly, approximately only 1 in 1000 of teachers are fired while most other occupations have a much higher firing or turnover rate. For example 1 in every 57 doctors will lose their medical license[6]. Teacher unions have also successful been blocking educational reforms that would improve America's education. For example, school vouchers have been proven to improve children's reading, math and writing comprehensibility however teacher unions are taking measures to make sure these reforms do not occur[7]. Likewise, teacher unions also blocking reforms to use merit-pay. For example, in Washington DC, the school chancellor offered a plan in which teachers could give up tenure-pay for the opportunity to potential earn as much as $144,000 based on merit per year. The union would not even allow the issue to come to a vote.[6] With improvements in technology and access to capital, almost all goods and services have improved since 1970. Modern cars, phones, televisions, and computers have all improved. Many of these products are even cheaper than they were 40 years ago. However, education has become more expensive and test scores have not improved at all[8]. It is because the collective bargaining power is so strong that America has not seen any improvements in education. Removing collective bargaining power would improve schools, and reduce cost on education that taxpayers have to pay through coercion. http://tinyurl.com...[1] http://www.youtube.com...[2] http://tinyurl.com...[3] http://www.youtube.com...[4] http://tinyurl.com...[5] http://tinyurl.com...[6] http://tinyurl.com...[7] http://tinyurl.com...[8]",

With that said, I will explain why teachers pay should not be raised. But before I do that, let me say that the burden of proof belongs to my opponent. PRO must prove why teachers' pay should be raised, as she does not in R1. Contention 1: Pay is enough currently. Currently, teachers get an annual $47,602 (http://www.aft.org...) The average salary for an American is $43,444 (http://en.wikipedia.org...). As we can clearly see, teachers are earning more than the average person, so a pay raise would not be needed. Contention 2: Most teachers don't deserve it. Most teachers do not even earn the money they receive. 1/3 of Americans can not locate the US on a map, 3/4 can not locate Iraq on a map, and US high schoolers are the 2nd least educated (stupid, if you will) out of 13 major countries tested like Sweden, Canada, Mexico, and the UK. Indeed, certain teachers, like gym teachers, do not even put that much effort into their jobs and do not provide their students with the skills they need. Contention 3: Benefits. Teachers, in addition to the salary they receive, get multiple benefits. Most teachers get a guaranteed salary, summer break, free lunch, and a pension plan. Thank you, I now await my opponent's rebuttal.",

            "premise": "Resolved: That merit pay based on student achievement should be a significant component of K-12 teacher compensation in United Sates public schools. This is last months Public Forum topic. Also, this round will be run exactly like a Public Forum round, minus the cross-examination. For those unfamiliar with Public Forum (or PF) each side first presents a case, without a rebuttal. The second round, each side then makes arguments against the other side. The third round, is again, a rebuttal of sorts, but a bit shorter, and emphasizing on MAJOR points, but I won't be nit-picky, argue what you wish. Because we aren't speaking, there aren't limits on how much you put in here. And finally, the \"Final Focus\" as we, PFers, call it. Summarize why you won, sway the judge(voters in this case). Also, in PF, no sort of formalized plan WHATSOEVER may be proposed. Also, no kritiks (the resolution IS debatable, no arguing that it's not.) or counterplans, etc. We are arguing whether the resolution is true or false, nothing else. Our president, Barack Obama, said in 2009 that, \"Many have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom\" Because merit pay could boost our economy, motivate teachers, and because the current compensation system is faulty my partner and I stand in firm affirmation of today's resolution, which states: Resolved: That merit pay based on student achievement should be a significant component of K-12 teacher compensation in United Sates public schools. Before I begin, I'd like to clarify a few terms: Merit pay: is a compensation system whereby base pay increases are determined by individual performance according to the University of Minnesota's glossary of compensation terms. Student Achievement: is defined as the quality and quantity of a student's work according to Merriam Webster This now brings me to my first contention, which states, merit pay can boost our failing economy. Most teachers are considered to be middle to lower class. John Elder, Professor at Yale University said that, \"Bonus money would best be directed towards people who can't afford to save money at any time \u2014 because they're behind on their bills or in need of dental work or a few things for the kids with Christmas looming.\" If they get bonuses of $1,500, which was seen in Minneapolis's MPPP program or ones as large as $20,000 as seen in Massachusetts in 1998 it will be spent. With approximately 6.2 million teachers in the U.S. even small bonuses could turn into a large sum. Spending this money puts money back into our economy, which helps this entire nation out of this recession. This much money could jump start our economy and help alleviate the effect of the current recession. This brings me to my second contention, stating: merit pay will motivate teachers. No one can deny that money is a powerful motivator. If teachers are paid more based on how their students are doing, they will try to help their students excel. Gary Ritter, Director of the Office for Education Policy has said in 2009 that, \"There is one area where the evidence is clear--effective teaching is the single most important school-related factor in determinating student success.\" You can see that motivated teachers are vital to student success, and merit pay would aid in motivating mediocre teachers. Also Gayor McCown, Executive Director of the Teaching Commission has said, \"Ensuring that some portion of compensation is based on student performance is a step in the right direction. Such a system would acknowledge a teacher's abilities and efforts in the classroom, and could potentially act as an excellent motivator for all teachers to focus more on what really matters: student performance.\" Bringing me to my third and final contention, stating: the current compensation system is not working. It rewards meritocracy, underpays good teachers, and ultimately causes a shortage in teachers across the nation. Mediocre teachers do much less work, and their students do not reach their full potential, and yet they're paid as much as an intelligent and engaging teacher! According to Victor Lavy, Research Associate at the Centre for Economic Policy Research, \" Few things are more frustrating for high performers than to be treated exactly like their less committed peers. Today, the profession repels too many energetic practitioners by expecting teachers to willingly sacrifice professional growth, advancement and reward. The steps that need to be taken are straightforward. Teachers' compensation should be based on performance rather than simply on experience and credentials.\" It's obvious that merit pay is the only way to solve this problem. Even president Obama believes the current system is faulty. He has said, \"I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences. The stakes are too high.\" Here he was referring to our current teacher compensation system. Victor Lavy has also said that, \"Assuming that the compensation system accurately identifies productivity, basing pay on performance will attract and retain the best teachers\" The current compensation system is unfair and drives the aspiring and current teachers away from the profession, which is causing a teaching shortage. You can clearly see that it is not working efficiently, and that merit pay would be a good addition. I close with a quote from our president last February, \"In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity, it is a pre-requisite.\" Merit pay is a way that students' education could be further improved. Because merit pay could help our failing economy, as well as motivate teachers, and because it would be a great addition to our current, defective compensation system I strongly urge a ballot for the affirmative.",

            "conclusion": "Teachers should not help students with bad grades.",
            "premise": "Thank you for replying back. Here are my rebuttals for your arguments.Counter for Argument #1: I believe you are correct on how students learn differently and how all are of different intelligence. But in the beginning of life, it would be logical that everyone has equal intelligence in the beginning. However, everything changes as time progresses and each students' character develops along with work ethics and such. If a student is aware that he/she is getting bad grades and he/she is continuing to get that with awareness, who is to blame for that? I will definitely agree that the teacher's main job is to teach, as it is spoken in the title. They are also trained to teach and they would have lectures that are well developed, concise, and express the main idea. If the student fails to pay attention to such things, that is obviously his/her fault. It is hard to understand how one would not understand that. I will not argue that every student learns differently either but the teacher will cater to that as he/she is aware of that. My point is that if a student fails even if a teacher does all she could to teach and explain the lesson and the student still fails, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. However, if the teacher does not meet those qualities that I listed earlier, the teacher would be gone of course.Counter for Argument #2: Okay, for my first arguments earlier, I did not include anything about mentally challenged students or students with learning dysfunctions. I don't believe they have the same pace as students as everyone knows. They should be in a different class anyways that are meant specifically for them where they are paired with other individuals that have the same problem, therefore making things much more equal. I apologize for not taking any statement on students with learning dysfunctions earlier.Counter for Argument #3: I believe those punishments you listed can only solve things temporarily, meaning the years that a student is in that specific school or other schools that have similar practices. As I mentioned before self motivation is key and that is what students should learn earlier. That is why I propose the fact that students should be much more independent by solving his/her own problems. Otherwise, they'll face something bigger in the future. On the part where you say that \"a teacher needs to teach consequences\", that should be part of their job anyways. Otherwise my concept would not be as what would be planned. I feel like when teachers teach of such consequences, the students don't really feel that \"shock\" unless they really experience it for themselves, and that is if they hit rock bottom. \"If teachers teach their students good attitude at young ages then it will stick with them through life\"If a student is taught any attitude or ethic, they will most likely stick through it if almost nothing gets in the way. But unfortunately, many things are able to get in the way. Social media is one thing with all the celebrities and such. For example, you are probably aware of how many celebrities (specifically actors, and musicians) gain fame that defy the teachings that hard work, self motivation, and work ethic gets you a Rolls Royce, Rolex, and a mansion. Some students could think that they will be that next celebrity and they don't have to do all that to be successful. Another example can be how a lot of mainstream music talks about partying and having some sort of pleasure with no display of the cold harsh reality. Many young adults and children's perspective of how to be successful can be altered and be different than what was taught from the beginning. Their innocence is changed from what they have seen and they start to attempt to be that ideal painting that is created by that side of society. Like you are basically saying, children are sponges, they will absorb anything that is said by someone of recognition or/and authority. Those who stay with what they have learned from parents and teachers will be the ones succeeding and being the strongest of the pack.Concluding: The teacher's job and their job is to cater to how a student learns, but those who do not understand no matter what (not including students with learning dysfunctions), they are not fit to what will lie in the future. Students with learning dysfunctions are a different story. The student has a big part as he/she really controls the outcome of his/her future so it is really up to them on how they choose. The least a struggling student can do is obviously change their grades. He/she would know who they are and generally know what bad grades can do but like I mentioned before, are aware of the consequences but don't feel that hard impact at that moment or/and when they are taught. I am not saying that all students who struggle (or in general) are like that but many are. Thank you once again and I hope to hear how you will counter my arguments.",

            "premise": "I'll assume those are your arguments. Then I'll try to be as short as possible as well, but i'll include formatting. One. Relativity. A relationship that goes beyond teacher-student affects other students indadvertedly. One kid sees that another is getting special treatment, even if it's only a smile or hello in the morning, and a little part of them gets triggered. They start thinking something's unfair and they take action against it. I don't know to what extent this relationship is intact and visible between the student and teacher, however even just one time that the teacher takes the kid away to say anything to it w/o the others being called, that child is now the teacher's pet and the other kids' superior, even if nothing happened. In one fell swoop, a kid that gets even an ounce of special or different treatment can become the person the class outcasts. Two. Fish in the pond. You're thinking along the lines of \"why not,\" by expressing that there is very little risk to such a relationship, it's beneficial for the kid to have someone, but this person is still a stranger. A child needs peers not figures in their life. Friends are more important than contacts at this point in a child's life. A teacher will not bring anything to the child's life that a close friend or caring parent could. So, if you need someone to rely on in your life, to tell your problems to, and someone who can help you, there are many other people you can turn to, and many caring peers, of your own age, are always around you in these situations. Three. A fallacy. The effect I describe under point 1 affects all other arguments. This is a psychological condition. The teacher is responsible for many kids and cannot be allowed to look after one of them more closely, it ruins the system. Then, if the teacher does do this, the other kids cast this special child out. There's nothing different about this one child, but the teacher's contact made it different. What this means is that no matter the relationship the teacher has with the child, extremely positive, necessary, or just friendly, if another classmate sees it, they will feel inadequate, saying \"Why didn't the teacher choose me?\" We cannot run this risk of affecting a lot of other kids for the sake of one kid who needs someone to help them in their life, especially since that child has alternatives it can turn to.",

            "conclusion": "A teacher's pay should be merit-based.",
            "premise": "I'd like to thank my opponent for his thoughtful and well-rounded first round post. I'll begin with my arguments, and then address each piece of my opponent's advocacy. 1. As my opponent acknowledges in his case, nations need more educated children. In order to meet this goal, most nations, and all first world nations, have responded by creating universal assessment tools to gauge student achievement in its public schools. The result has been standardized tests, generally built by states/localities and given to students each year. The federal government then examines the scores of these tests. Per almost all current educational research, these tests are statistically and empirically non-indicative of student achievement, progress, or even potential, which many in the educational field argue cannot be tested or measured.(1) Therefore, there is no way to accurately measure student achievement in a way that is politically viable and accurate, as the political climate of today demands hard numbers, which are impossible to deliver. 2. Grades and corresponding GPAs are equally unreliable for a number of reasons. Teachers, like police officers, directly control all evidence of their merit. Without severe and monumentally expensive supervision, teachers will always be able to corrupt assessment results, even on statewide exams, to increase their pay. There are countless cases of teachers who have manipulated grade systems or test systems for their own benefit. Even state governments have been accused of and confessed to \"dumbing down\" assessment tools in order to secure monetary benefits or administrative stability. When was it that the number of teachers and governments attempting to cheat assessment tools began to exponentially rise? 2000, when the Bush administration fielded and implemented the No Child Left Behind Act, which directly tied these assessment tools to merit-based benefits for schools.(2) 3. If being judged by a state or nationwide standard, historically and empirically low-performing schools are distinguished by socioeconomics, geographical location, and ethnic background. Urban schools and rural schools routinely get the short end of the educational stick. Those schools are underfunded due to high levels of poverty, they are unable to pay teachers as much so they get poorer quality of teachers, less resources, and less face time with students. Naturally, they will consistently underachieve with standards that cannot physically be met in these schools. Educational research confirms that this is so. Teachers know this, too. This is why the federal government has had to begin offering numerous incentives for highly qualified teachers to take jobs at rural and urban schools, include college loan forbearance, loan forgiveness, and tax incentives. All of this work to get good teachers into the areas where they are needed most, to catch up decades of consistently mediocre education, will be reversed by the merit pay system, since the students in these disadvantaged areas will never perform as highly in quantifiable assessments as advantaged students. 4. The impacts of merit pay are clear. Highly qualified teachers will take positions in schools where they can achieve. Mediocre teachers (the ones left) will take positions in the schools that need highly qualified teachers instead. This will lead to the above-mentioned corruption within the education system in order to gain merit pay, even as high as the state level. This will affect student achievement in myriad, terrible ways. (1): http://www.fairtest.org... (2): http://www.susanohanian.org... Note: these are what I have on hand. I have many more extensive, specific studies if you like :) And my opponent's case: Quick note on outside-of-US anecdotal evidence: as long as the example could reasonably be applied to the US, my opponent can introduce any evidence he likes. \"I point out that I believe in western society today, our teachers are under-valued, under-appreciated and under-paid. I certainly do not propose reduction in any teacher's salary but instead, I would like to see those who perform best rewarded even more.\" 1. Very true. However, the affirmation's plan will only entrench this mistreatment, as it will clearly discriminate against certain teachers based solely on the area in which they choose to teach. \"Student achievement. I think it is important to recognise that this should apply not merely to getting the highest marks or the most number of A-grades in a class but should rather be a measurement of the 'distance-travelled' by pupils.\" 2. This is, indeed, a valid part of student achievement. Unfortunately, there is no way to measure this, along with all of the other facets of academic achievement, in a universal way, which is what merit-based pay would entail for the purposes of accountability. \"Performance related pay is a powerful tool in Employment. While it is suitable for many jobs it is not suitable for all.\" 3. Teaching is inherently different than sales, and this is important to note in reference to merit pay. Sales commissions are based on a quantifiable standard: did the person make the sale? Yes: that representative will get a percentage of the commission. No: no commission. First of all, educational achievement and potential cannot be quantified in nearly the same way. The only way to universally quantify it is to use standardized testing, which fails miserably to prove any sort of academic achievement. \"An example of a less appropriate field would be police-work. Rewarding an officer on their number of arrests or conviction rates does not seem a good idea to me as this would encourage them to be over-zealous and perhaps even tempt them into corruption and tampering with evidence as well as criminalizing more of the general population.\" 4. In a similar vein, teachers and states alike have freely admitted to corrupting test results or corrupting the test itself. Several states have been found to manipulate test difficulty, format, and content in order to ensure more passing students. This only happened when the No Child Left Behind Act was enacted under the most recent Bush administration, in which funding and school functionality became tied in the same merit-based way to academic success based on universal, quantifiable academic assessment tools that are in and of themselves deeply flawed. \"I think teaching is an appropriate profession to apply performance related pay to as the benefits would clearly outweigh any negative impact. I would like my opponent to explain why it is not and what negative effects she believes that it would have.\" 5. The negative impacts are outlined in my case, and affect both students and teachers. Teachers will be paid less for working in certain socioeconomic, geographic, and ethnic locations. Therefore, teachers will leave the schools which need their expertise the most in order to seek pay increases. The US government is already having to lure highly qualified teachers to these areas in order to keep them there. These underprivileged schools cannot stand this strain. This is where the students suffer, as mediocre teachers will be able to find jobs more easily in already struggling schools, which will simply lower the quality of education in urban and rural areas, resulting in an even greater educational gap in the nation. Hence, not only will merit pay for teachers not improve the world, but it will devastate any attempts the government is currently making to level the educational playing field. In essence, using assessment in relationship to teacher pay is a recipe for disaster. While assessments are valid and necessary, tying them to teacher pay is a drastic mistake on the part of any nation, especially if those assessments are universalized, even by state governments. I look forward to my opponent's response!",

You say that they will be a distraction to students, well this is agreeable to some extent but there is a possibility of an emergency (such as the teacher's spouse/child is in critical condition due to accident). And teachers know that nobody should call them unless it is urgent (they should tell their contacts that). Even if that does not seem good enough, they have break times where they can use phones.",

            "discussionTitle": "Should teachers union be abolished",
            "conclusion": "Should teachers union be abolished",
            "premise": "The teachers in Chicago did indeed strike. As I stated earlier in my argument a strike is normally a last resort and is a result of a breakdown in negotiations which is exactly what happened in Chicago. [1] Strikes that come to mind included the auto workers of General Motors as well as the workers of Verizon in New York. Arguing that the teachers union should be abolished because some can strike is the same as saying that the auto workers union should be abolished because they can strike. My opponent has stated that \"In New York firing a teacher is like breaking a diamond. What happens is the ineffective teachers typically get passed along from school to school without ever getting fired.\" My opponent is correct in stating that firing teachers in New York is costly. I will attack this argument making two points. My first point is that New York State has a very high barrier to entry into the profession of teaching. Teachers must obtain a Bachelor's Degree in order to obtain their Initial Teaching Certificate which is valid for a period of five years. During the period of time the teacher is earning his or her Bachelor's Degree the teacher must also obtain the Internship Certificate. Within this five year period the teacher must also earn a Master's Degree and must continue ongoing professional development in order to earn the Professional Certificate. [2] There are also exams that must be passed in order to obtain both the Initial Certificate and Professional Certificate. My second point is that there is a serious question as to exactly what makes a teacher ineffective. Politicians and the media alike feel that the most effective way to evaluate a teacher is to tie the teacher\"s performance to standardized test scores. However, simply tying teacher performance to standardized test scores ignores the individual learning ability of each child, economic factors and most important as far as I'm concerned is the level of involvement of each student\"s parent or parents. How can a teacher should be held accountable for a student not performing if the student continuously misses classroom days, does not complete homework assignments and project assignments? A student such as this will simply not perform up to standards. A teacher\"s job is to educate children not raise peoples children for them. If a school district or city feels that a teacher is that detrimental to students then why is cost a factor, especially if educating the future of America is of the utmost importance? With regard to my opponent\"s final point with regard to salary and negative stigma, salaries in most professions will vary depending on cost of living within different geographical areas. However, when considering the level of entry and education needed to become a teaching professional there are easier alternatives that can earn a person with the same level of education. In fact, approximately 20% of teacher quit the profession with two years. [3] According to a survey conducted by The National Center for Education Statistics \"61% cited more professional working conditions in their new careers verses their time teaching. That same group said their workload was 65% more manageable outside of teaching and they were 65% more likely to better balance their personal and professional life after leaving their teaching career.\" [3] There is no denying that being a teaching professional is a difficult career. In my opinion it makes it even more difficult when the general population has no idea of how difficult and challenging the career is. Especially when politicians who have never been in a classroom setting wish to dictate exactly how to educate students and wishes to terminate teachers as being ineffective when there is no concrete way to judge exactly what makes a teacher ineffective. For this reason alone, teachers deserve union protection. I fail to see any argument that my opponent has made thus far that shows how abolishing the teachers union will have a positive impact on the education received by America's students.

Typical teachers will always ask for the student to take off, or put away, their items before taking it. In my opponents case where the teacher took his or her hoodie, it was my opponents fault technically. First off, my opponent even admiteed to what the teacher could have thought, with the following quote: \"I know that they think you have a gun and all that\". If you knew what they thought, why did you put on the hood in the first place? Secondly, did you look at the school's policy? In most schools, my school for an example, they have a no hood policy where you can't where a hood within the building; but only when outside with bad weather. Kids have gotten in trouble for doing it, and thats their fault and not the teachers.To conclude, teachers should have a right to take away certain things within school. If the item seems harmful, they will most likely ask for the person to put it, or take it, away; otherwise its the students responsibility. The moral, think before you do.",

            "conclusion": "The 3 necessary qualities for a 'good' teacher.",
            "premise": "Hello to my opponent, and thank you for such a debate as this. I will stand on the opposing and represent the Con in this debate. So based on what the Pro has outlined in their constructive there three necessary qualities for a teacher to be considered \"good\" Therefore the burden of the Pro is to push and advocate these points, and the Burden of the Con is simply to disprove the pro (If I'm off-base please let me know in the next round) Simply put if by the end of this debate you still agree with the Pro, he wins If not the Con wins. Therefore I offer this opposing view to my opponent's stance- A teacher is something much more than a simple instructor. Teachers give up their lives (and a good portion of their potential pocket book) in order to invest in younger generations. And while these teachers do so much in this regard, they get no substantial monetary gain nor any kind of real benefit other than getting to know their students and watching them grow. Therefore When we try to consider what makes a good teacher, not only are there many more than just three points we must consider; but when evaluating the Pro's arguments we see that these three points do not describe a quality teacher. For example in their first point they claim a teacher must know their own limitations. This is stoutly wrong on so many levels. Why? Because in order for a teacher to \"know their limits\" they must first evaluate themselves- thus causing them to lose the ability to teach and make their students grow. Instead at this point their focus in now on themselves, they worry and stress \"Am I a good teacher?\" \"Maybe I shouldn't teach this lesson after all.\" \"Class today we're just going to watch a movie\" So in the end when we think teachers must know their own limitations there are many loses. Firts the teachers looses out because they are less able to teach, the students lose out because their ability to learn in inhibited, and society loses out because their next generation is lessened. Also on the argument regarding a Drama teacher becoming an astro-physics teacher, who's to say they couldn't do it? Drama teaches you the abilty to act, so even when the teacher didn't understand the material they would be able to act like they do. and as long as they just continue to refer back to their own material the students will learn. Now let's go on to the second point my opponent advocates, that teachers must know their student's limitations. To this point I cannot disagree more! It is not a teacher's job to see what a student's current potential could be and nudge them there, but it is a teacher's job to see more in that student than they could ever see in themselves, and push them to that extreme! one awesome examplet would be the movie \"stand and deliver\" http://www.imdb.com... While this man's student's could barely do basic math, and they where in a situation where rising above their status seemed impossible he taught them advance calculus instead of remedial addition. Another great example (and personal favorite) would be \"freedom writers\" http://www.imdb.com... here we see the exact same thing, a teacher who is not satisfied with just meeting their student's limitations; but instead takes them to a whole new level. While her freshman english class came to her barely literate; by their graduation they understand both interpretation and execution of the written word. Now finally my opponent claims that A teacher must remember their role. Now to this we must ask several questions, for now I will suffice with two. First what is a teacher's station? to teach and help their students grown. Second, how should the teacher do this? However best helps the student grow! Refer to my prior examples in my attack on my opponent's point 2. of course the student must and will grow at their own pace, but that doesn't meant a teacher shouldn't continually challenege a student. A teacher must absolutely do such a thing as this. And so in conclusion, I end with this. Teachers are so very much more than just simple instructers; they give their lives to their students and help them to grow. and so while being considered \"good\" really isn't even possible (there are just too many variables) the points my opponent offers definately do not meet the criteria. I'll hand it back over to Pro now!",

            "premise": "Based upon the opposing sides wording, I am having some difficulty in discerning what they are proposing. View 1 of what opposing side is saying. If you take the plain letter wording of what opponents argument is, it it would be, \"Teachers should give marks to students without showing racism.\" I believe a simple response would be: \"showing racism\" is not the problem, instead it is the lack of showing racism that is worse. Consider this example, Teacher A: Gives student a grade of a C on a paper and in the comments writes \"Irishmen cannot understand this topic because they are always drunk and therefore your opinion is terrible\" Most likely this showing of racism would result in a grade protest and academic disciplines. However, if Teacher B shared teacher A's view about the Irish but did not outwardly show racism it would look like this Teacher B: Gives student a C on the paper because he assumes Irishmen cannot understand this topic, then writes in the comments \"your lower grade reflects a failure of understanding of the topic\" In both examples the grade was not based on the student's ability; instead, it was based on the racist teachers' view and student received a C. However, in the second example, when the teacher did not outwardly show racism, the student would likely have no knowledge of the teacher's racial motivation and he also would have to look harder to find some sort of proof. Therefore, in this example it is better for a teacher to show racism in marks, then it is to have racism underlying a mark but not be expressed. View 2 of what Opposing side is saying. In order to provide cognizant view for me to debate I will summarize and rephrase opponents argument into something more articulate. OLD ARGUMENT \"Teachers should give marks to students without showing racism. Yes it's true. i have seen in some schools and some universities, teachers are showing racism in giving marks. They are giving more marks to the students those who are good for them and familiar to them. I'm strongly disagree with this kind of teachers. Some teachers are looking country wise to give marks. They are giving more marks to their own country students. What is the purpose of this?\" Opponents new argument:In my experience across several schools and universities, Teachers are subjectively grading students based upon various categories. These categories include whether they like the student 2. whether the student is agreeing with them and finally 3. Whether the student is foreign or of a different ethnicity. Subjective grading is bad and therefore teachers should dismiss them. View 3 of what opposing side is saying (this one is probably off and utilized a lot of reading between the lines) In my experience teachers are racist because they did not give me good grades and other people did get good grades. ARGUMENT: I will wait for opposing response before I write anymore, hopefully they can clarify and we can have a good discussion on the use of subjectivity in grading.",

This is what you said, \"Let me put it simply, without teachers there would have been no man on the moon. No vaccines. No indispensable medicines. \"Blacks\" and \"Whites\" would still be segregated and the hole in the Ozone layer would be twice as big.\" It is true that teachers have profound role on their students but only some, not all. On the other hand there are teachers who are horrible, and further more teachers are not only bad but criminals who can be indulged in heinous crimes against the children. Given the reality of situation first you need to get all teachers to be the best group in the world's history then maybe you could argue for your cause. Till then your assumptions are juvenile. And secondly you brought the stats for teachers in Australia, if teachers are teachers then why didn't you argue for the teachers in the third world countries, should they not be paid the same as others in different countries according to your aforesaid principles. I appreciate you trying to talk about this with the minister even though i might different on your way and talking points. Simply quoting a newspaper doesn't prove the findings, what was the methodology, until you come to terms with that, your arguments fells short that learning is proportional to teacher's pay. Having received no contact from the deemed \"education\" experts, I relied on two of my lecture and homework giving teachers for their views on the issue I was raising. Visualising a teaching utopia with the aid of my question, both teachers were quick to respond. To my surprise, both Teacher A and Teacher B had contrasting views on the issue I was raising. From Coming from the United Kingdom, Teacher .................................................................. of teachers, Teacher B addresses the issue in a larger picture including the Australian workforce. Till here, nothing whatsoever was a any source of your point just a story. Yes, I agree teachers can inspire the leaders and workforce of tomorrow, but also can parents, friends, family and so many other sources. I am not against paying teachers higher or as a matter of fact anybody else for that matter. But the world we live in is primarily run by economics. Personally I would love everybody to be paid enough that they would spend their lives peacefully, but you should bring in more economic argument for this to happen and maybe a selection process where you can find the best teachers. I would love to have a healthy debate.",

            "conclusion": "The collective bargaining rights of teachers should be removed",
            "premise": "I thank Dark for his argument, and will now attempt to chip away at his opening.\"I will use the moral framework of utilitarianism.\"I would argue that utilitarianism is self-contradictory, and immoral. It purports to protect the well being of society but, in practice, it forces the morality of some to govern all. Society includes all of us, but who benefits from allowing my opponent's morals and values to rule our country?? Only my opponent, and those with a similar ideology benefit. To allow a few to decide what is best for all, based on their own values, while ignoring the values of others seems immoral. How can this be what's \"best for society\"??I would be remiss if I didn't admit that utilitarianism, to a degree, is the basis of our legal system, but there's another principle at play, within that system, that was much more prevalent on the minds of our founding fathers. My opponent has the right to protest the status quo and push for change, because of that principle. It's because of that principle that I argue that teachers should keep their right to unionize, and have collective bargaining. That principle was the guiding ideology, as the framers of our constitution hashed out the final language. That principle is \"Individual Rights\". The rights of an individual, in a free society, to make decisions for themselves is the very reason that our founding fathers knowingly, and intentionally, tried to limit the power and size, of the government(1). Our constitution tries to protect individuals from the \"tyranny of the majority\", but if not kept in check, that tyranny is exactly what utilitarianism brings to the table.Another problem with the use of utilitarianism is the fact that my opponent wants to use it as grounds for fighting against unions, in general, but his ideology demands an \"all or none\" approach. It doesn't leave enough flexibility to come to some common ground, a way in which many of the ends he seeks can be realized, while still respecting the rights of workers to make their own decisions. It simply assumes that there can be no middle ground, and refuses to allow it. That is the problem with the ideological hard-liners on both the left, and right. This \"my way or the highway\" approach to governing should be rejected by all of us because it is usually ineffective, polarizing, and unnecessarily unfair to it's victims. There IS a sensible middle ground on this union issue, and when there IS a middle ground, utilitarianism need not be invoked. That is what's best for society. My opponent concedes that teachers will be harmed, but claims that collective bargaining has little value for teachers, and removing it is \"best for society\". My wife is an English/Literature teacher, she has two Master's degrees and a Bachelor's in Adult Ed. She has taught at every level, including a prison education program. Over her 23 year career, she has worked both union and non-union jobs. Although non-union now, she realizes the importance of collective bargaining rights, and the positives those rights have for ALL teachers, not just union. Unions strive to raise the standard of living for workers, and in doing so they also indirectly effect non-union workers in a positive way. The fear that their employees will unionize inspires employers to make changes that are beneficial to the employees, who are the backbone of their organization. This raises the standard of living, and brings dignity and financial stability to employees, who are otherwise at the mercy of their employers. Those on the far right, who I usually side with, seek to remove this positive force. That puts employees back at the mercy of employers. If the employer wants a new yacht, what's to stop him from simply cutting pay, increasing his profit margin, thereby justifying a huge raise or bonus for himself?? Removing unions, and bargaining rights, effectively lowers the standard of living for both union, and non-union employees. How is that best for society??A big part of my opponent's argument is based on him wanting education to be privatized, instead he is \"coerced\" into having to pay taxes to help pay for education. That seems selfish to me. People were coerced into paying taxes for his education, but now it's time to return the favor and he doesn't like it. That illustrates the nature of humans to be greedy, and that's the reason that teachers don't want such a vital service, education, turned over into the hands of corporations who's main goal is financial benefit. Teachers unions aren't the only ones not wanting that. My opponent has a right to fight for that change, if he wishes, but is it fair for him to take away the rights of others who oppose him, so that his ends become easier to attain?? I say no, but that's exactly what my opponent advocates. Do we need education reform?? Do we need to make the system more financially efficient?? Absolutely, on both counts, but a common sense way of accomplishing that can be found without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. That answer begins with identifying the real problems rather than using the teachers as pawns for political gain. Those on the anti-union side have created a witch hunt against \"bad teachers\". What about the nearly four million other teachers, who serve the public well as educators for our kids?? They watch the coverage of bad teachers, and are more ashamed than the rest of us, yet they go to school the next day and work hard, focusing on what they got into education for, the kids. The problem with my opponents' argument against tenure, in this debate, is that tenure and dismissal proceedings are a matter of state law, not the subject of collective bargaining. Lawmakers made firing teachers, and the process, intentionally slow and cumbersome to discourage firings for personal and political reasons. The union's only role in tenure, is that it's required by law to represent it's members during the process. Perhaps the \"rubber room\" video should be shown to my opponents state lawmakers instead of being used to prejudice the public against unions. Here is a quote from the page linked below(2).\"Each state provides laws governing education agencies, hiring and termination of teachers, tenure of teachers, and similar laws.Subjectivity and cronyism are reasons that unions oppose the merit pay system. Another reason is, as I mentioned in my opening, teachers are at the mercy of the quality of their students. They can, and do, reach many difficult kids, but they are not miracle workers. I ask you, how would you feel if your pay was decided by how well your co-workers did??On the pay issue, perhaps my opponent needs to speak to teachers, instead of John Stossel. You can't figure an hour-by-hour comparison unless you factor in ALL the hours that teachers put in. He bases his figures on the school day, but doesn't factor in all the hours at home and weekends, grading papers, preparing lesson plans, private tutoring, on the phone with parents trying to find a way to reach a difficult student, spending 800-1000 dollars out-of-pocket for supplies for kids that can't afford them, etc. They usually spend 1-2 weeks after the school year in meetings, packing their rooms, etc., then 1-2 weeks before the start of the year in meetings, and unpacking, prep, etc. This is one of the problems with people who know so little being given such a big voice over people who are actually trained, and have years of experience doing. They don't show the public the whole story, just their own spin.I contest the other parts of his argument, but am out of space so I'll deal with them in round 3.1. http://www.usconstitution.net...2. http://www.enotes.com...",

I know most members of this website find semantics annoying and cheap but since I'm arguing for the PRO side of this resolution I still feel a need to point out an important semantic flaw. The Resolution is 'Computers CAN replace...' and even from reading Con's first argument you can see he has already admitted that it 'CAN' be done though he say's it would lose an important quality desired in a teaching environment. So by Con's own admission the Resolution has been affirmed PRO; that Computers CAN indeed replace human teachers. For that reason alone Pro already wins this debate; but lets pretend I don't for the sake of making this debate longer and more entertaining. My following arguments will apply as if the Resolution were 'Robots will...' or 'Robots should...' replace human teachers. Well I suppose it would be more accurate had I put 'Computers' rather than Robots, but you cant talk about this subject without getting into robots. http://www.msnbc.msn.com... and the truth of the matter is (if you click on the link I just gave) Robots (a kind of computer) have ALREADY started to replace teachers. And all the things my opponent worries over being lost appears to have been programed into this robot teacher. She can even 'scold' a student if need be. So a robot is just as capable as a human in the teaching application. Not to mention the advantages of having a controllable programmable teacher. Once we make all teachers robots you wont have messy problems that put your school on the news in a bad way when your teacher sleeps with their students. http://shavedlongcock.blogspot.com... You also can rest assured that the robot teacher will only teach what is in the school board agreed upon agenda. if your school said evolution would be taught, you wont need to worry about the teacher taking the personal liberty to 'make aware' their students of a controversy surrounding this topic if you don't want them too. their is very little you can do to censer human teacher's from teaching what 'they thinks important' that the school board doesn't. Next off education is perhaps the most debt inducing expense any state has. Teacher Unions are often considered one of the strongest Unions out their, making sure they can fight for every dollar they can get in their salary. remove these humans you have to pay every week for the robots you only have to purchase once and you just made running the educational system financially possible to pull off without going into debt. Some of you might go 'isn't that slavery, to employ people your not going to pay but rather pay to own'. The answer is No. their robots no one cares. Robot labor is the closest we can ever get to slave labor again while it's still moral. I think we should not miss out on this opportunity. So what do we want between the 2? Teachers that teach the things we voted on they should teach for sure and nothing else. True control over what our kids are learning? Do we want a real solution to state debt by taking teacher salaries out of the budget? Do we want to do the right thing and protect our kids from seductive randy teachers who would steel their innocence at the age of 14? Or are we going to risk our kids safety with real people? Are we going to compromise our control over what they learn by employing rouge humans? Are we going to miss an opportunity to make a feasible cut from the educational budget that could bring your state out of debt? I think the answer is clear for anyone who truly care for our young students out their. Certain jobs should only belong to robot computers, and teaching is one of them. I look forward to your response. ;)",

            "conclusion": "Students and teachers should not \"friend\" on facebook",
            "premise": "Thanks to Con for her courtesy. While Con believes that the teacher's professional reputation and authority would be undermined, I believe it could actually be strengthened as the teacher showed that they did not allow themselves to be victimized, and as such present a harder target. While there are cruel individuals in the world, not everyone in it is cruel, not even close. If I'm understanding you correctly, you claim that a criminal could pose as a teacher on Facebook and lure students to them? The students could probably deduce that the \"teacher\" was actually an impostor just by actually asking the teacher about in at school. If the student did not attend the same school as the \"teacher\", they did not really have a student-teacher relationship. In event of an unlawful action, police could access the social media records and find out what happened. I agree that a degree of professionalism should be maintained between a teacher and his or her students, however I disagree that a teacher should not be your friend. Throughout high school I had a fair mix of \"friendly\" teachers who tried to be friend-like, and \"traditional\" teachers who opted for the traditional, detached manner of teaching. I, and many of my peers, learned better with the \"friendly\" teachers because we felt that they cared about our learning more than the \"traditional\" teachers and also found them easier to talk to about academic problems. I do not believe a student's safety would be at risk because they were friends with their teacher on Facebook. Besides, if the teacher wanted to, they could make an account for their personal life, and another one for their students to ask questions on. As I stated before, through social media a teacher would be able to remind nearly all their students about homework or projects in a more effective way than emailing, simply because teens check their Facebook more often than their E-mail.",

            "premise": "Think about it what if a teacher had a gun. There would be a great chance for a child to actually take the gun and use it in school. Some children might snatch the gun while the teacher isn't looking and how many mass murders have you seen on TV lately ever since the sandy hook shooting? Basically none. School security has improved and it isn't stupid when someone locks the doors in the lunchroom and call it stupid. I had a lockdown once and my teacher covered the door. And when someone tried to open he couldn't open because of the lockdown plan. It is not very stupid indeed Some teachers shouldn't even have a gun because what if a child is unstable and later on he gets on hold of it and causes a rampage. And you cannot always count on the person who has a gun will be a good guy teachers cause crimes also and if teachers cause crime what makes sense to give them a gun. The point of this debate was for me to show you that guns should not be in the hands of teachers and your point is that teachers need to have guns. Here are my extra reasons 1) Teachers are there for learning not to become a police officer defending themselves with gun. 2) There will be probably less children attending the school and children do not perform well if they are nervous taking exams. They will become nervous if a teacher is having a gun in their classroom. The children will be scared if they think the teacher will shoot one of the students and end up becoming scared and nervous. 3) Teachers are not good supervisors. And they aren't because I bet you all of you out there know when your teacher leaves the classroom sometimes she may not leave a teacher watching the students the out come will be a child carrying a gun. Also what if you were at the back of the line next to the teachers desk and the teacher wasn't looking a child would be tempted to grab hold of the gun. Showing all of this concludes that teachers should have no guns in their hands. Your turn",

            "conclusion": "Teachers having guns in the class room.",
            "premise": "There are a series of things that can go wrong with possessing a gun. In this case scenario, the teacher could forget to put the safety lock on and could shoot themselves, or another, if too much pressure got on the trigger. A student could also get their hands on it, especially if they found out about it. At schools there are a group of good, neutral, and bad students. In schools now adays, students sexually assault, bully, and even sometimes kill one another. There is always that one student, that if they got hold of a gun would go berserk. Even if it were locked up there is always that one student that'll do whatever it takes to get what they want. Anyways, why have the teachers possess them. Many schools have security guards that are trained in their field of duty, and with a gun. A lot of the time they won't even carry a gun. They may instead rely on their own strength, or pepper spray, etc. In my opinion there is just not a huge reason for teachers to need one. If you're that concerned with safety carry around pepper spray. If that's not enough maybe you could have tranquilizing blow-darts, or a security guard designated for a specific classroom. To counter warriorcat227's argument that,\" If ONE teacher would have had a gun in Conn. those kids would have lived to see there next Christmas.\" If one security guard would have been there in Conn., one security guard who is TRAINED with a gun, those children would have lived. If one teacher or security guard had pepper spray in Conn. those children probably would have survived. Besides, how can you be positive that, If ONE teacher would have had a gun in Conn. those kids would have lived to see there next Christmas? What if the teacher had been shot first, what if the teacher had tried to shoot but their safety lock was on, what if the teacher had tripped when trying to shoot, huh? You just don't know. There are too many variables to take into the case. You didn't witness it hands on, you can't replay it and change various variables. You aren't God. I feel bad about what happened in Conn. too. Maybe a gun would have helped. But maybe pepper spray or a pocket knife (I'm not for pocket knives) would have helped too. Suppose those children had survived though. It would have affected them for life. They could have afterwards been diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) or paranoia. With that in mind say they possessed a gun. They could be so paranoid that someone is trying to kill them. The child (when older) could then hunt someone down. But that's ok, right? It's ok for them to have a gun, especially since their influential teacher's used guns. Not only bad guys have guns. And the good guys should use them whenever they feel endangered ,even if they're not, because the good guys use them. \"Our schools should be safe, positive environments, and having guns under teachers' desks or in closets not only sends the wrong message to our children, but puts their lives in danger the minute they enter school grounds, as every child would become a potential victim of a gun accident. We should be teaching our children that gun violence is never a way to settle differences and does not solve problems,\" Mark Takano said. Guns are not suited for the classroom! Warriorcat227 and I have two more rounds left. I could go on and on, but I'll save it. Ultimately, teachers shouldn't have guns in the classroom. There are a series of events that can go wrong with guns in the classroom, especially with an untrained teacher using a gun. Thank you.",

            "premise": "Your starting argument may sound fine and dandy to those who do not know that a public school is funded and run by the local government (private school funding as a whole is generally not struggling due to tuition and private donations, I should be clear that this discussion does not apply to private schools nearly as much). Public schools are generally a direct reflection of the success of the local government in which they are placed. So if they live in a poor and impoverished neighborhood, their students given the supplies to match, but that's a separate debate (whether or not the allocation of finances is fair throughout all communities). Only a fool would look at increased spending as a whole and say \"okay now, it hasn't worked\". If the average CEO has a record year of sales and brings in more profit than ever recorded, does it go straight to the employers? No. He reinvests in his company for growth, he raises the exec pay rates, he gets bonuses and a new car, THEN MAYBE whatever is left over goes to his employees 2-5% yearly raise (which is generally what they get regardless of the amount of excess funding). Point being ALLOCATION OF FUNDING should be the focus. Not a flat fact of \"people got more money\", it doesn't pan out. Cost of spending per student DOES NOT mean that those children or their teachers got that funding directly. They simply said X amount when somewhere, and we have Y amount of student, and they created that statistic with division. It DOES NOT mean the funds were allocated to the teacher salary of the students resources. I agree with \"teachers should be rewarded for their passion through incentives and bonuses. But how many public schools offer those and in which amounts? I'd love to see those statistics, I had a hard time finding them. I appreciate you agreeing with my point in the importance of teachers with regard to the training of other professions. And if there was an easy way to truly reward good teachers and punish bad ones with incentives, then great. But I feel that raising all teachers pay would eliminate the use of politics for others to get ahead, rather than performance. And for those who under-perform, give 'em the boot.",

In such countries as Zimbabwe, some kids dont even have a clue as to what a computer looks like and yet they have the highest literacy rate in Africa. Now if you compare the funding of the United States to that of Zimbabwe you find that we actually have an excess of funds and there really arent any needs to match those. Why should government waste resources on satisfying contented wants of the teachers. There is no need to augment the wages of the teaching staff. What they do is out of passion and not the love of money. So what if Floyd is earning $83k per sec. Its his job to wow the millions of enthusiasts that watch across the world and these enthusiasts also include a sizeable number of teachers...He is bringing in a large volume of foreign revenue through boxing yet the teacher is bringing nothing more than boredom to a small uninterested class. If a teacher would get as much as an engineer, who do you think would want to go to varsity for some challenging task when you can just get a teaching degree in college and get just as much cash..clearly this motion does not stand",

            "premise": "I would like to first draw attention to the fact that the wording of the motion is a case of scopal ambiguity*: \"Teachers who aren't here for more than 90% of the year should get fired\" ^^This could mean either that we should fire any teachers who have an attendance of less than 90%, or we should fire any teachers who have an attendance of less than 10%. I feel I can argue against either, hence I have accepted nonetheless, but I feel I should point out that the motion is ambiguously defined, and that traditionally is considered to work in con's favour. Regardless, it will allow the debate to progress more smoothly for pro to clarify what they meant at the start of their R2 speech. My argument will be as follows: 1) An absent teacher does not usually damage a student's education. 2) There are perfectly legitimate reasons why a teacher may need to be absent for over a year (i.e. would have 0% attendance) but should not be fired. Firstly, most schools have systems in place to account for the event that a teacher is absent- they have supply teachers whose entire job is to cover for teachers who are absent. Though not clearly stated, pro appears to be talking about secondary/elementary schools, and a supply teacher can teach, for instance, how to solve a quadratic equation, just as easily as the full-time teacher could. It therefore does not harm the students' education. Furthermore, there are legitimate reasons why a teacher may not be able to attend school for over a year. For instance, if they are diagnosed with cancer, and have to undergo a year of chemotherapy, and hence have to take a year out. This person should not be fired for being in that situation, and pro did not include any indication in the motion that exceptions may be made if the teacher has a perfectly good reason for being absent. Maternity leave is a much less drastic example- the school year is 36 weeks**, which would make being absent for four of them enough to push one under the boundary pro proposed. After giving birth, one is entitled to up to 52 weeks*** maternity leave. So, in short, an absent teacher is not as damaging to students' education as pro suggests, and there are perfectly valid reasons a teacher may be unable to attend for up to a year. As such, I urge voters to side against the motion. *(An explanation of scopal ambiguity: from 1min 15secs). **(According to: https://www.google.co.uk...;*) ***(According to https://www.google.co.uk...;*)",

            "conclusion": "A teacher's pay should be merit-based.",
            "premise": "Thanks again to my opponent for what continues to be an interesting and stimulating debate. I will adopt the same approach as my opponent has done in this round and begin with general arguments before moving on to specifics. My opponent and I agree that the current system of standardised testing is inherently flawed. We also both agree that the current situation where schools in more privileged socio-economic areas attract the best teachers because of higher salaries is unfair and not in the interests of improving the education of the population as a whole. I have proposed a system of equal pay with bonuses awarded to teachers who can demonstrate the most significant improvements in individuals learning, based around independent peer evaluation. I believe this would alleviate most of the problems in the education system that my opponent describes. She maintains that peer evaluation is non-viable and that the problems she outlines are tied directly to the idea of merit-based pay. It is these contentions that I will attempt to disprove in this round. \"1. The peer evaluation system is not politically, logistically, or ethically viable, or at least not moreso than a standardized testing model.\" I believe that the fairtest.org article clearly argues that it is ethically and logistically preferable to standardised testing. As for party politics, as I suggested in the previous round these should not be allowed to get in the way of the fact that we 'should' be implementing the best policies possible. \"a. It isn't universally applicable in any way: keep in mind that my opponent clearly conceded that, in order to pay a teacher based on merit, the measurement of the merit must be universally established.\" Sincere apologies to my opponent if I have misled her in any way, but I'm not sure what I said that suggested I conceded this fact. I don't remember arguing for a universal testing system and don't advocate one, I believe the pupils should be assessed on their individual achievements not on their conformance to a standardised grade or even curriculum. I did suggest a universal basic rate of pay for teachers (before merit-based bonuses) so maybe this is where the confusion arises. \"Which teachers will assess? How will the localities be assigned assessment teachers? How will we ensure that all assessors have the same concept of how to meet educational goals?.... ....b. It isn't logistically possible: teachers are already incredibly pressed for time, especially with shrinking budgets and school years..... ....c. It doesn't solve the problem of flawed assessment systems: how will peer evaluating teachers measure academic success? Via grades? GPA? Test scores? Project results?\" I don't claim to have all the answers to making peer-evaluation work, but I think the panel of independent judges assessing student performance as described in the fairtest.org article sounds like a decent model. As I said I don't necessarily support a standardised curriculum, but trained judges should be able to accurately assess whether a pupil's knowledge and academic abilities have improved without resorting to such a system and without as much opportunity for the teacher who will be rewarded being able to unfairly manipulate the results. Remember that we want teachers to be motivated to do their best to improve their students results. We just need to make sure they do this fairly. A system that rewards the bad teachers and the good the same does not motivate either to try harder. \"1. I've disproved my opponents alternative as viable above. I also would like to point out his concession on accountability requiring universal standards, which is key to why his alternative cannot be successful. 2. Corruption is inherent in merit-based pay.\" I don't think proving that there would be difficulties in implementing something is the same as proving it non-viable, certainly not the same as proving it should not be a desired course of action. Again ,apologies but don't recall making this concession and can't find it when scanning through previous rounds. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I do not believe my opponent has proved that corruption is inherent to merit-based pay. \"states were not doing this until their educational performance affected school budgets. It is directly analogous to the affect merit pay will have on individual schools and students.\" I see these as two distinct situations, not directly analogous at all. In my model which is just one of countless hypothetical ones you could apply, bonuses would apply to individual teachers not school or state budgets, which would be a very different case. \"3. The problems of socioeconomic, ethnic, and geographic locations will still exist within that utopian plan. These problems are inherent with or without peer evaluation. There is nothing to say that a given peer evaluation team would not be a suburban team coming into a rural school, or an urban team coming into a suburban school, where the learning environment can be completely different.\" I think the fairtest.org article again makes it clear that for such a system to work \"it is necessary to enact safeguards to ensure that race, class, gender, linguistic or other cultural biases do not affect evaluation.\" So there is something in my argument to say that such a situation as described by my opponent should not occur. \"my scenario of teachers flocking to places where merit-based pay is far more likely will become a quick reality.\" Yes but in the \"utopian\" system these places would be exactly those where performance is lowest and are in most need of good teachers. This would ultimately be of great benefit to society as a whole, a better educated populace being more economically sound and (in theory at least) having more regard for law, order and decency. \"The public will not accept, and should not accept, two classrooms of the same grade with vastly different abilities.\" There will always be children in every classroom with vastly different abilities. People are all better at different things. The idea of every child nationwide of a certain grade being at exactly the same level of achievement can not be a reality, so why every class? \"Improvement is only a piece of achievement, as my opponent admits in his initial debate posting.\" Maybe this then was perceived as my concession of universal standards: \"this should apply not merely to getting the highest marks or the most number of A-grades in a class but should rather be a measurement of the 'distance-travelled' by pupils.\" I can see how my use of 'merely' could have been misconstrued to suggest the notion of incorporating but I think 'rather' makes my real position clearer. \"2. While you may think it is easy to implement, two things stand in the way of us accepting this as a possible reality\" I never meant to imply it would be easy just not \"monumentally expensive.\" The fact that something is difficult does not make it impossible and does not mean if it is a good idea we should not attempt to implement it. Due to space limitations I apologise that I can not answer my opponents last three rebuttals in this round, but if my opponent invites me to, I would be happy to display my responses in the comments section. Anyway I believe I have argued that corruption is a separate issue and not necessarily inherent to merit-based pay and that peer-evaluation while admittedly having it's difficulties could effectively diminish the spectre of corruption. Once again a teacher's pay should be merit-based. Thanks.",

            "premise": "I accept my opponent's altering of the definition. I will now proceed to protect my original arguments while piecing apart my opponent's arguments. CONTENTION 1 Yes, it is better to save the lives of, say, 5 children rather than none, yet it is far better to prevent the occurence of a shooting altogether. My opponent seems to almost accept the fact that there will be shootings regardless, and that all we can do is to minimize the effects. This is not true. It would be far more effective to invest into more police officers (I will expand upon this in the third contention), better security systems such as gates, and programs to help a potential shooter before the shooting actually occurs. Also, policemen nation-wide have a hit rate of about 34 percent of all bullets fired. This includes suicides among policemen. If policemen, who's entire careers revolve around enforcing laws using physical violence (if necessary), only have a 34 percent hit rate, then what will the accuracy be like of a teacher, who has little experience in an actual gun fight, is a nervous wreck, has heard shots already being fired down the hall, and is very emotionally attatched to the children she/he has suddenly been tasked to protect. If anything, the teacher might hit another student, or instigate even more shooting once the shooter come under fire. Think also of the availability of the weapon. It is unlikely that the teacher keep it on their person, because a gun holster or strap requires a blazer over it, which is highly unrealistic for hot weather. So the gun would most likely be placed in a locked drawer, which would be extremely difficult to access in the case of a shooting. I will expand upon cost issues and limited police force in the third contention. SECOND CONTENTION Given that a background check is required, many of these background checks are not effective, as my opponent admitted. \"Easily near by teachers can come and shoot the out of control teacher \" this is a complete logical falacy. First of all, the motion states that teachers have the right, not that it is a requirement, so not every teacher may have a gun. Also, how long does it realistically take to kill a room full of un-armed students? Too long for it to be stopped. And finally, if you did not arm teachers in the first place, this scenario would have no chance of occuring! Therefore, my opponent has in fact stated why teachers should not have guns, since they have stated a disastrous scenario in which a teacher posseses a weapon. THIRD CONTENTION I assume that there is a lack of policemen to secure the schools because of lack of funds. Yet if the guns are payed for by the individual teachers (and remember, not all will have it, for it is not required, only a right), very few will have one, for a gun, plus a concealed weapon liscence, as well as ammo and gun-checkups are very expensive relative to a teacher's generally low salary. If the govenrment is paying, then again, this will be of much cost for the govenrment, including background checks and periodical checks. These funds instead could be diverted to hiring more police officers to serve these schools, and increased security to stop the problem before it occurs, not while it already has happened. Also, if a rehabilitation program is offered in a more friendly, effective manner to the whole student body, troubled students may first consult with a counselor before any extreme measures are taken, or may be more easily identified with a more extensive, better funded program(s).

Having teachers armed shows that violence and weaponary is okay and it sets a bad example for kids and kids can get scared and lose trust in their teachers if they have guns with them all the time. And if teachers prefer not to carry it around with them because kids are scared of them and they put it in something like a safe, if a bad guy goes into the classroom, the teacher cant just be like \"Oh wait a second, let me get my gun out of the safe to shoot you first.\" Teachers are only supposed to educate, not go through training to get rid of bad guys. It's expensive for the training teachers will need to handle guns. Instead, schools should have a better security system or have special trained people to roam around the school to protect the students.",

I'm not claiming \"teachers would go out and shoot a student cause they're scared,\" I am saying that teachers can, and will, make mistakes of poor judgement and someone will get hurt. Yes most teachers will call the office if an altercation were to arise, but my concern is other teachers. We already as a nation have issues with inadequate or unsuitable teachers. Potentially giving them a gun is going to exasserbate the problem. Link here: https://www.usatoday.com... Also, teacher's don't \"sit there while children get shot,\" they have lockdown drills to keep the shooter from knowing students are in a room or not. An excercise that is completely negated when a teacher pops open a door with the intent to shoot the shooter back. This idea also forgets that if the teacher misses because of being in a high stress scenario, or if the shooter shoots the teacher first, the students in that specific room are only put in more danger. We can't expect the individuals in a dangerous situation to \"rise to the ocassion\" every time and save the day. Do not glorify gun fights as a means to solve shootings as it will only lead to more deaths. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You quoted the intorductory sentence in my argument, not the conclusion. I am concerned about the bias that individual teachers have, racially, ethnically, based in gender, or otherwise. Of course teachers are people, that's the point. I also never brought up anything regarding the 2nd ammendment, that is a bigger argument that this one is merely a part of, in other words, only tangentially related to what I was saying. You also completely assumed my stance as I have said nothing about the 2nd or gun control laws in general. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, to start Israel is misused in debates like these https://www.timesofisrael.com... As stated in the article, armed guards are there for protecting the students from foreign terror attacks, not gun wielding countrymen. The reason for Israel's lack of mass shootings is because of their strict gun control policy, not because of some guards: https://www.nytimes.com... Note, they don't just have less school shootings, but all types of mass shootings. Also one armed individual isn't going to single-handedly save the day, there are several instances of school shootings where there were in fact armed guards or police officers: https://www.theguardian.com... https://www.huffingtonpost.com... This evidence is somewhat anecdotal however declaring Israel to be some sort of example of armed guards being the solution to our school shooting dilema is just misrepresenting the facts.",

Striking is an effective method of making change, however not when it is at the expense of an innocent third party - especially one that cannot necessarily understand the reasons for, or the consequences of, the strike. And I'm sorry, they \"then have to deal with unappreciative children on a daily basis\"? If that's the case, they shouldn't be a teacher at all - I'm confident the issue has nothing to do with teachers feeling that the children are unappreciative, it is that they feel they are not being treated fairly by the government. They should absolutely be able to demand better working conditions, striking is certainly not the only means of doing this, and is an extreme and inappropriate method to use in this situation - not to mention the message that it sends to children that when you don't get your way, you should just quit.",
