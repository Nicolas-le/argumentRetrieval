To be fair and honest, I\"ll say there are benefits, much in the same way doing heroin feels great\"for a while\"then things start to go downhill. Benefits: You will be protected from the majority of a wide array of debt collectors. You will, on a chapter 13 plan, be able to pay back mortgage, etc., etc., at a chosen rate. Consequences: Bankruptcy will destroy your reputation. By law, bankruptcy is on the public record. People all around you will find out about it. Many of these people will not be kind, including people in your circle of friends, or even your family. You can bet it will be truly stressful. First off, your credit will be absolutely destroyed for some time. Credit companies will make life hell. Banks and the like won\"t give out mortgages, car loans, etc., so good luck buying things. It will become more difficult to get a good job, being that many employers nowadays check credit information before hiring. Future landlords will decline you, because they will check your credit. Your insurance may very well take a leap into the heavens, and, if you discharged medical debts, your health is at risk, because hospitals and the like won\"t want to treat you. If you discharge a mortgage or a car loan, you may lost them to the bank. Aside from those reasons above, you must calculate how you will feel, as a person, who cheated the system, which is what you are doing. You are a failure and a liar in some respects. Unfortunately, many folks are forced into bankruptcy, but to choose to declare bankruptcy to worm your way out of paying off debt\"that is not okay. That is how the U.S. got itself into its current state.",

            "discussionTitle": "Student Loan Debt",
            "conclusion": "Student Loan Debt",
            "premise": "I thank Evolution078 for the topic. ==Burden of proof== As the instigator, my opponent has the burden to prove why student loan debt is bad. ==Rebuttal== ---Con's \"contention\"--- My opponent seems to offer a plan here: that all parents be required to donate $24,000 a year to their child's college tuition. There are a couple problems with this: 1. Poor people often live hand-to-mouth and cannot afford to accumulate $96,000 in savings per child. [1] 2. This is still not enough money. Attending Harvard costs $60,000 per year, for example. [2] Even someone's parents who donated $24,000 per year would still need a student loan in the amount of $36,000 per year. ---My opponent says that without money, students are forced to join the military or go to community college--- He purposely ignores student loans here. Student loans are provided at extremely low interest rates and are tax deductible. [3] Student loans are the best possible deal someone could get while borrowing money. ---Con's \"arguments\"--- 1) My opponent offers a theoretical example of a poor family who makes roughly $25,000 a year. He subtracts the cost of housing and food for a family of two and says this would leave \"Jimmy\" with roughly $7500 a year to put in the bank for his child's college. My opponent forgets payroll taxes amounting to $1500 a year, cost of transportation amounting to $2500 a year, and cost of clothing amounting to $1250 a year. [4] [5] Assuming his employer provides health insurance, Jimmy will also pay $1500 a year out of pocket for his premiums. [6] Lastly, my opponent forgets to factor in the high cost of raising a small child, which amounts to roughly $3500 a year. [7] After all these costs are factored in, Jimmy is roughly $3,000 in debt per year. Jimmy has zero money left for savings and will actually owe $54,000 in debt by the time his adopted child reaches age 18. Conclusion: Jimmy cannot afford to pay for his child's college tuition. Student loans will be necessary if his adopted child wants to attend college. A) My opponent argues that median incomes are high in California. However, California is one of the wealthiest states in the Union. The poorest states in the Union have median incomes much closer to Jimmy's income. [8] In addition, all my opponent's arguments here assume that he has proven that even a family living on minimum wage can afford college tuition and is just being selfish and buying \"cool knick knacks.\" Jimmy clearly can't afford tuition if you factor in all the costs. Keep in mind, also, that tax rates go up with income, and that food, clothing, and transportation costs are calculated as a percentage of income, so these costs rise as well with income levels, since the cost of living is higher in wealthier places. My opponent has yet to prove that someone with California's median income could afford full tuition payments. 2) My opponent essentially makes the argument that eliminating student loans will boost the economy However, student loans are just like any other type of loan \u2013 they allow people to defer immediate payment in order to engage in pursuits that will pay significant dividends further down the road (college, law school, medical school). In this way, loans make the economy more efficient. Imagine what would happen in the business sector if loans to entrepreneurs ceased to exist. No one would start new companies. The same will happen in technical fields if student loans cease to exist; there would be no more lawyers and doctors. 3) My opponent argues that student loans contribute to the national debt. However, the national debt is caused by accumulating federal budget deficits. Congress borrowing money is solely responsible for the national debt. Personal debt does not contribute to this national debt figure. 4) My opponent argues that people can get student loans if the costs are higher than average (his example is doctors) The average cost of tuition for a private 4-year college in the U.S. is $27,000. [9] The average tuition cost for medical school is $25,000. [10] Under his standard, doctors could not get student loans. 5) What my opponent is essentially advocating here (in his #5) is a collapse in consumer spending. A collapse in consumer spending would plunge us even further into recession. According to the San Francisco Chronicle on September 26th, \"the collective purchasing behavior of American households may determine whether the nation continues to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression or slips back into recession.\" [11] When people buy clothes and toys, employers can start hiring again. Without consumer purchases, employers will have to continue layoffs. 6) My opponent argues for a regressive system Forcing people to save additional money for college each year, based on a regressive system, would have the same effect as raising taxes. Raising taxes during a recession would have a catastrophic effect on the economy. [12] ==My case== C1) Orphans Orphans have no parents, by definition. They require student loans if they want to go to college. C2) Parental rights The average parent in the U.S. spends a quarter of a million dollars to raise a child to the age of 17. [13] Parents have a right to enjoy their own incomes once their child reaches adulthood. If they get more satisfaction from taking a trip to the Caribbean before they die, parents should have the right to do this instead of being required to spend $100,000 on college tuition. If, however, parents get more satisfaction from helping their child pay for college, they should have the option of paying in full. But it should be the parents' right to make the decision of what to do with their money. Adult children are not entitled to this money as a birthright. This is a slippery slope. If parents must save money for their adult children for college, why not require parents to also set up a fund for their adult children to buy a home? How about a dowry fund for marriage? Why not legislate that parents must buy their children a car? C3) Paying the difference My opponent has not allocated enough money to college students to pay tuition for expensive private 4-year colleges and has not left many college students with enough money for room and board. Student loans would still be required to pay the difference between parental donations and what is still owed. C4) People who change their minds My opponent says that if a child does not attend college or drops out, parents can liquidate the college fund. However, people often change their minds and decide to attend college later in life. These people would not be able to afford college without student loans. C5) Stock market crashes Often, people save for college by investing their money in the stock market. A downturn would erase someone's college savings, necessitating student loans. C6) Lower attendance Since many people would now not be able to afford tuition, fewer people would attend college, law school, medical school, graduate school, and business school. Educational declines over a period of many years would erase trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy, as people become manual laborers instead of engineers, doctors, and lawyers. For all of the above reasons, I urge a Pro vote. ==Citations== [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com... [3] http://tinyurl.com... [4] http://tinyurl.com... [5] http://tinyurl.com...

            "premise": "In advance I would like to thank the Pro for taking this debate. I am interested in the topic at hand. I wish to debate it only for an exchange of opinion so in the end I can come to a conclusion based upon rationality. Con's Contentions; Parents should be forced to contribute at least an average of $24,000 a year for 4 years towards their child's higher education needs, This would be per child. I understand there are a lot of scenario's as to why a child may not receive money towards a higher education. The child is then left with a couple options, military, scholarships if they do well in school or they can choose to go to a community college if they choose to obtain a higher level of education. My arguments are debated below. Argument; 1.) The average adult begins their college education at the age of 18 or 19, this is generally some time after the completion of high school. If a parent saves $5,400 per year for 18 years, they would accumulate $97,200. This would be sufficient to pay for the average higher education fee of about $24,000 per year, $96,000 for 4 years. -Let us use a fictional character named Jimmy. Jimmy works a construction job full time (40 hrs a week) making $13.00 an hour. Jimmy is a single dad who resides in California. He then decides that he would like to adopt a child, he knows that he will have to contribute $5,400 a year to their child's higher education. Jimmy's annual salary is $24,960. When I had lived in California my rent for a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house was $700, utilities usually would be $300. So we will go on to assume that Jimmy pays $1,000 a month for housing. This then leaves Jimmy with $7,560 a year. Between my wife and I, we consume $400 a month on food. Annual rate is $4,800, we will assume Jimmy uses the same amount on himself and his child. This leaves Jimmy with $2,760 a year. A.) \"The median household income in the United States is $46,326. Here in California people have a hard time understanding that yes, 50 percent of our population live on $46,000 or less a year. Dual earner households have a higher median income at $67,348.\" It is apparent that some one making a below average income is capable of paying for their child's higher education. Now you ask your self, why would any one want to work their butt off only to pay for some one elses well being? The answer is essentially an opinion, maybe the joys of having a child supersedes their will to own all the cool \"Knick Knacks\". 2.) What would this do for our families, our society, and our nation as a whole? If Jimmy's parents had paid for his education. Jimmy would not have student loan debt, Jimmy then could pay for his child's education so on and so forth. B.) The average student amasses over $20,000 in student debt toward their first degree. This being true the $96,000 Jimmy had saved for his child to go to school would eliminate this debt. I am no expert in this field, but wouldn't eliminate student debt keep money flowing in the economy & essentially keep it growing? Not only that but Americans would not have to fear living a life in debt. 3.) C.) Let us take a look at our national debt; $13,736,959,182,346.04 (13 Trillion) \"The estimated population of the United States is 309,464,240 so each citizen's share of this debt is $44,389.49.\" After looking at these statistics & reviewing the average students debt after a higher education, its apparent that student debt is a large contributing factor to this nations overall debt. What If your parents do not want to pay for your education? It is called scholarships, work hard & be rewarded. Military, serve your country and you will reek the benefits of the GI Bill. 4.) Finally let us take a look at the fact that different levels of education will cost various amounts. Those that require much more money than an average higher education should be allowed to take student loans. This is as long as they are on track to graduate, and their profession should allow them to pay back their loans quickly & offer the society much more. For example; Doctors. 5.) Why not just let families decide if they would like to pay for their child's education? My rebuttal is this, Human beings are selfish. Maybe selfish is an inadequate word to portray my thoughts. But essentially humans want all the cool things without the baggage. We want to own a BMW, A Lexus, a brand new Ford F350, pop out 8 kids while we eat Applebees every night. My point is humans live outside their means. They end up straining our society by contributing little to nothing. If we didn't make it mandatory for them to contribute the $5,400 a year they wouldn't. Make our nation stronger & smarter by contributing to education. If your child chooses not to obtain a higher level of learning then you now have $96,000 eliminating any other debt you may have obtained. 6.) Families should pay different amounts based on household income. I realize that making a individual pay $5,400 on a $24,000 is unreasonable. The lack of money could lead to more crime in our society. In this scenario the family should only be charged $1,500 so on & so forth. If you fall under $18,000 a year you should be exempt from fees. Conclusion; Again I would like to thank the Pro for taking this debate. I am interested in the response. For Pro to win this debate I would like him/her come up with logical and rational reasons why my argument is unreasonable. Resources; A.) http://www.mybudget360.com...

            "premise": "Opening Statements I thank my opponent for accepting the debate, and hope for a good one. I will separate my arguments into 5 sections so as to make them more structured. Federal Student Loans Have Caused an Education Bubble Over the past few decades, tuition has skyrocketed inside the United States. Between 1978 and 2012, the tuition in the US has increased 1210%, or 12-fold.(1) This is also 4 times faster than the increase in the consumer price index. This is obviously a huge problem, so the first steps we must take to come up with a solution is to look for the cause or causes. Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, stated that \"The basic problem is simple: Give everyone $100 to pay for higher education and colleges will raise their prices by $100, negating the value of the aid. And inflation-adjusted aid--most of it federal--has certainly gone up, ballooning from $4,602 per undergraduate in 1990-91 to $12,455 in 2010-11. As it did in the housing market, free or reduced priced has artificially inflated the price of college education. Thus begins a classic upward price spiral caused by government intervention: Subsidies raise prices, leading to higher subsidies, which raise prices even more. Yet this higher education bubble, like the housing bubble, will eventually pop. Meanwhile, large numbers of students will graduate with more debt than they would have in an unsubsidized market.\"(1) Patrick Hedger, a policy analyst from FreedomWorks, found that \u201cStudents are taking out cheap loans as liberally as colleges spend their tuition. With money readily available at low rates to anyone who asks, students never think twice and colleges have no incentive to keep prices low. The end result is tens of thousands of dollars worth of each student\u2019s tuition being spent by universities on superfluous things designed simply to draw more and more students and their government-backed blank checks.\"(2) Federal Student Loans Have Cause a Rise in Tuition As a result of the Education Bubble, tuition has been artificially inflated through government intervention. Chris Edwards, from the Cato Institute, explains that \u201cIt is a matter of supply and demand. More and more Americans have sought a college education which has pushed prices higher. Ordinarily, such upward pressure would be restrained by consumer willingness to pay, but as government subsidies have helped absorb tuition increase, the public\u2019s budget constraint has been lifted.\u201d(3) Peter Wood, a professor at Boston University noted that federal subsidies \u201care seen by colleges and universities as money that is there for the taking \u2026 tuition is set high enough to capture those funds and whatever else we think can be extracted from parents.(4) Federal Student Loans have Harmed Students Not only do student loans cause a rise in tuition, they also harm students various ways. A. Cause Unemployment In 2012, about 1.5 million, or 56%, of bachelor\u2019s degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed, the highest since in of least 11 years.(5) How could this have happened? Patrick Hedger explains \"\u201cFederal student loans, which are soon to be the only education loans available, severely up start the market and are directly responsible for the surge of under-and unemployed youths with bachelor\u2019s degrees.\u201d B. Students are Negatively Impacted by Debt The American Association of State Colleges and Universities found that \u201cStudents often see higher education as the primary path to upward mobility, but when they accumulate excessive debt, this pathway quickly becomes riddled with pitfalls. Students graduate with debt may put off life milestones such as buying a car, owning a home, getting married, or entering certain low paying professions like teaching or social work.\u201d (6) Also from the AASCU, \u201cParticularly worrisome is that the number of college graduates with $40,000 in student loan debt has increase 10-fold in the past decade. Those numbers pose long-term threats to recent college graduates lifelong decisions, but the financial future of borrowers who do not earn a degree is even bleaker.\u201d C. Student Loans Harms Students' Credit Score Student loans also put many students at risk of ruining their credit score if they fail to pay off the extremely high debt on time. \u201cBecause your student loans are little to be your first significant loan into the world of credit, it\u2019s imperative that you handle these loans wisely.\u201d \u201cMissing even one payment can trash your Credit Score. And a bad Credit Score can lead to higher costs for loans, higher insurance premiums, and trouble when attempting to get a job or an apartment.\u201d(7) Defaulting on a student loan goes on your credit report and can seriously hinder your ability to get a loan later in your life. Student Loan defaulters are restricted in their access to bankruptcy protection. The IRS can seize defaulters\u2019 income tax refunds, and students who default on an education are prohibited from participating in the student loan program thereafter.(8) Sadly, many students end up defaulting on their loans, ruining their credit scores. Last year one in 10 recent borrowers defaulted on their federal student loans within the first two years, the highest default rate since 1995, according to annual figures made public Monday by the Department of Education.(9) Alternatives My opponent will likely state that federal student loans are necessary for our education system. I will contend there are better alternatives. Tax Credits I support the expansion of the tax credit system for low-income students. Currently, there are various tax credits already available to students.(10) The American Opportunity Tax Credit those eligible qualify for the maximum annual credit of $2,500 per student. The Lifetime Learning may allow students and parents to claim up to $2,000 for qualified education expenses paid for all students enrolled in eligible educational institutions. Deductions are also available to student, The tuition and fees deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to $4,000. The benefits of the tax credit system is it decreases the cost burden on low-income workers without putting poor students into huge amounts of debt. Another benefit is it doesn't cost other taxpayers anything, it simply decreases taxes for the individuals it's intended to help. Work and Study Working while going to college is a viable alternative to students who need money to pay for tuition. Not only does the money you earn pay for the tuition, but there are also other benefits. One benefit of working while in college is that it can help build your resume, regardless if the job is in your field, according to a Scholarships.com article on balancing work and college.(11) There are also Vocational Programs, Grants, Direct Aid, Scholarships, and investment plans. As I've run out of time and characters, I will go into alternatives deeper next round.

            "conclusion": "The growth of the national debt, if not stopped, will bankrupt the nation.",
            "premise": "I will start this round by pointing out some misunderstandings. Con misunderstands when he says that PRO takes the \"when\" as \"irrelevant\" . The debate is \"if the growth continues\" not \"when does bankruptcy happen\" PRO is saying that if present trends continue, the USA will again go into bankruptcy, but PRO is not giving a year or saying what generation it will impact. Con believes that the debt could be paid down. History says no. The national debt has not been reduced since 1957 . http://www.batr.org... Con again misunderstands when he says \"It will not affect this generation as you have claimed. \" PRO never claimed this . Con then concedes by saying \"It will take another 30 to 50 years before it could really hurt us if what you said happens.\" Con cites data that supports PRO regarding the inability of SS to loan money after 2033. http://money.cnn.com... Con again misunderstands about \"New revenue sources will be unavailable\" He cites percentages of EXISTING sources. These are not new sources. Now on to items 4 to 6 #4 Debt service will consume a higher and higher percentage of the US budget. In 2016 the effective interest rate on the debt was 2%. The government paid $242,000,000,000 in debt service. What is little known is that the actual interest charge was $432, 000.000.000. In other words the feds kicked about one half of the debt service into the next year. Here is a table on the growing interest cost of the debt.https://www.treasurydirect.gov... 2017 $458,542,287,311.80 2016 $432,649,652,901.12 2015 $402,435,356,075.49 2014 $430,812,121,372.05 2013 $415,688,781,248.40 2012 $359,796,008,919.49 2011 $454,393,280,417.03 2010 $413,954,825,362.17 2000 $361,997,734,302.36 Thus it is apparent that the debt has grown over time. At the same time, the debt service has grown and grown. #5 Default Default is a state where the government fails to meet its financial obligations in the short term. Primarily this happens when the USA fails to pay debt service obligations. \"In October 2013\"..investors seriously wondered whether the U.S. would actually default on its debt.\" https://www.thebalance.com... \"There are... scenarios under which the United States would default on its debt. \"...Interest rates would rise...The dollar would drop, as foreign investors fled the \"safe-haven status\" of Treasuries. \". The dollar would lose its status as a global world currency\".The U.S. government would not be able to pay [obligations]. U.S. Government simply decided that its debt was too high, and simply stopped paying interest \" https://www.thebalance.com... #6 Bankruptcy A nation becomes bankrupt when its \"lifestyle\" exceeds its ability to support that lifestyle. Greece is a good example of this situation, as is Argentina, and to a lesser extent, so is Iceland. http://flatheadbeacon.com... Additionally there are 14 countries on the verge of bankruptcy http://www.totalbankruptcy.com..., and the USA is on that list. http://247wallst.com... \"Although not commonly known, the U.S. has declared bankruptcy five times, since its foundation. Once it could not pay its foreign debts, and four times could it not pay its internal debts. These bankruptcies had resulted from financial crises in the banking sector, the first of which was in 1790, and the last of which was in 1933.\"https://www.dailysabah.com...",

The debate is about PERSONAL bankruptcy (chapter 7) \"Bankruptcy will destroy your reputation. By law, bankruptcy is on the public record. People all around you will find out about it. Many of these people will not be kind, including people in your circle of friends, or even your family. You can bet it will be truly stressful.\"OK I'll admit my credit score went rock bottom after the first year after bankruptcy, but I didn't need any credit, so I didn't care. No stress at all. Friends and family didn't even know.,,,and so what if they did. It didn't hurt them. \"First off, your credit will be absolutely destroyed for some time. Credit companies will make life hell. Banks and the like won\"t give out mortgages, car loans, etc., so good luck buying things.\"I already had a new car (for free) so I didn't need a car loan. I put down $100 on a \"pre-paid\" credit card and kept that in good standing, which pretty much repaired my credit score in less than a year.In only 2 years after my bankruptcy, I got a Fannie May mortgage and got a house with only $10,000 down.After 7 years my bankruptcy was too old for anyone to care about and I refinanced my house from 8%to 3.5%. That's better than some people without a bankruptcy. \"It will become more difficult to get a good job, being that many employers nowadays check credit information before hiring.\" If you have a career and and a good work reputation, you'll get plenty of work. Companies care more about whether you can do the job or not. \"Future landlords will decline you, because they will check your credit.\"Who needs a landlord when you can own your own home!?\"Your insurance may very well take a leap into the heavens, and, if you discharged medical debts, your health is at risk, because hospitals and the like won\"t want to treat you.\"LOL...my insurance was just fine and every emergency room, by law, can't turn you away from treatment.\"If you discharge a mortgage or a car loan, you may lost them to the bank.\"With chapter 7 you can keep your home and your car.\"Aside from those reasons above, you must calculate how you will feel, as a person, who cheated the system, which is what you are doing. You are a failure and a liar in some respects.\"I didn't cheat anybody. I \"borrowed\" money that didn't even exist. The bank made the money out of thin air and lent it to me. I'm not the bad guy. Getting $50,000 for free is far from a failure.Summary: I spent $50,000 on trips, a new car, clothes, restaurants and electronic equipment. I had the time of my life and the worst thing that happened was that I had to use a pre-paid credit card for a year. I kept everything and got a mortgage 2 years later. It didn't hurt my job, my insurance or my friendships. I would do it again in a heartbeat and so should everybody else. It's legal and it's free money the bank created just for you. It stimulates the economy and gets new money circulated into the system, and doesn't hurt the banks.",

I believe both models have their place depending on the exact flavor of the current economic atmosphere of the time. I think that if you get control of the insanity of student loan debt, you make the usage of Supply Side Economics more viable. I am a Moderate minded person. I believe both models can work effectively if not handcuffed by other irresonsible practices. * Schools purposefully took advantage of the Federal Student Loan programs. They did not look at a student's credit history. They did not look at a student's income. They did not look at a student's ability to repay the debt. They did not look at anything. They just started giving out free loans and money to anyone and everyone. So guess what schools started doing. They started recruiting students in mass, signing them up for federal loans that these students couldn't even afford, but students with dreams of success signed the dotted line figuring they'd get a good job and pay it back. Later, many did not find good jobs, and these heavy loans that took advantage of this overly generous giving of loans of any amount(withinreason) to anyone killed the economy. Obama actually did a good thing on this one in my opinion by implementing student loan forgiveness. Once the balance becomes stable, I believe Supply Side economics can do fine. The problem was that everyone had such heavy debt that they couldn't get loans for houses, spend extra on clothes, food, trips, etc. This effected the entire infrastructure of the economy. The schools got greedy and the government was too slow to act. https://studentaid.ed.gov... Here are some testimonials in a video simply explaining what the student loan crisis did to people. http://youtu.be... They had went to school, tried to get an education and now are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and they can never pay it back. Can they buy a house? No. Can they take trips? No. Can they buy stuff? No. So guess what. That money is not going back into the economy. * So if people were not loading up on unsermountable student loan debt, Supply Side would have been fine. It works as long as the people are not handcuffed by other legislation and/or policies. * In my opinion, if all of these people were free from this crazy debt, Supply Side works fine. But any \"trickling down\" that happens is pointless if those recieving it cando nothing with it. Take for example, someone with $50,000 instudent loandebt. They are fighting to make it, they do their taxes, they get a tax return of $5,000. Guess what. It's taken and applied to the federal loan. What part of the sector made money? Some school made money that might go back into education, but the economy sees nothing. All that happened is the government trying to make up loan losses, and the civilian has $0 to spend.",

            "premise": "My opponent asks \" how long does this deficit have to go on before it actually starts to hit the economy. \" He then goes on to quote sources that say it already has impacted the economy where he cites \" A study by the World Bank found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77 percent for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7 percent in economic growth.\" (1) He then states \"Most of the experts think this deficit won't affect us too much just our kid's children, to their children and grandchildren.\" Note that PRO did not cite an exact year for the bankruptcy. The argument is that IF things do not change there will be bankruptcy.Whether it takes place during our lives or our children\"s lives is irrelevant in terms of this debate. He then cites this statement \"\"The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is 104 percent. But that's not a critical for a country which can issue debt in its own currency. The United States can simply print more dollars to pay off the debt. For this reason, the risk of default is very low\" but avoids the rest of the quote\".to wit\".\"On the other hand, the debt holders wind up with money that's worth less. This will eventually make them avoid U.S. debt.\" (2) Given in rough numbers, for 2017, federal income was $3.5 trillion. Mandatory spending was $3 trillion, so at that point there was a $500 billion surplus. Then Congress spent the $500 billion ( discretionary spending and debt service) and borrowed an additional $600 billion ( to spend on additional discretionaries) .Total spending amounted to $4.1 trillion. At this point the equation is $3.5 trillion (revenue) minus $4.1 trillion (spending) = a negative $600 billion (deficit). The $600 billion ( deficit) is borrowed. $400 billion is raised through the sale of bonds. $200 billion is borrowed from the Social Security Administration. The $600 billion ( deficit) is then added to the $19.4 trillion ( previous debt ) to arrive at the current debt of $20 trillion. The borrowed money must be repaid with interest, thus increasing the future deficits and future debt, and so on and so on. Here is where the problem lays. In 2017 the US will spend $242 billion on debt service. That number may reach $1 trillion by 2020. Several scenarios could disrupt this procedure and could eventually bankrupt the nation. Scenarios #1 Investors stop buying bonds. #2 Social security no longer has a surplus to loan #3 New revenue sources will be unavailable #4 Debt service will consume a higher and higher percentage of the US budget. #5 Default #6 Bankruptcy #1 Why would investors stop buying? \"Because\" T-Bills offer relatively low returns compared to other debt instruments. In fact, rates on T-Bills can be less than most money market funds or certificates of deposit (CDs). The returns from T-Bills are only realized when they mature, making them a somewhat less attractive income vehicle \" especially for investors seeking a steady cash flow.\" (3) #2 Social security will no longer have a surplus to loan after 2033 (4) #3 There are no new major revenue sources I will deal with 4, 5 and 6 in the next round. https://www.thebalance.com... https://www.thebalance.com... https://www.investopedia.com... https://www.inquisitr.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "Federal Student Loans Should Be Abolished.",
            "conclusion": "Federal Student Loans Should Be Abolished.",
            "premise": "Before I begin, a brief observation:Pro is making the claim, therefore he has the burden of proof. His burden is to prove that federal student loans should be abolished. As con, my burden is to negate his argument. That could mean that I argue that there is something wrong with the federal student loan system, and that such a problem needs to be addressed, but not addressed in the way PRO proposes OR it could mean that I defend the status quo. It could mean that I argue that the harms PRO seeks to address are not problems, or his solution is not sufficient to address them. All would negate the resolution. Now, I'll talk about PRO's case, and make some counter arguments in response.PRO's Case:PRO's first argument states that federal student loans have caused an education bubble. He reasons that tuition has \"skyrocketed\" because federal student loans, which he calls a subsidy, cause prices to rise. Indeed, there may be some correlation there, but the fact that students have access to federal student loans is not by itself enough to indicate that those loans specifically caused an increase in tuition prices because there could be any number of other factors. For example, colleges may have had to raise tuition prices because their operating costs increased and federal student loans offset that higher operating cost. It could be that public universities receive less public funding, and therefore universities must offset that shortfall by raising tuition. It could be that universities just do more for students now, and waste resources on things like unnecessarily extravagant dormitories and facilities. It could be that university endowments just aren't as big as they once were and students have to foot the bill in consequence.Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com...So, if tuition prices are something PRO wants to fix, he's ignoring the bigger picture. But, let's talk about the harm of abolishing student loans. Federal student loan interest rates range from about 3.86% - 5%, and their rates are fixed. Source: http://studentaid.ed.gov...Private student loans are usually considerably higher than that. Discover's fixed rate undergraduate student loan rates begin at 6.74% and can rise to 10.99%. Source: https://www.discover.com...Suntrust fixed rate student loans range from 4.751% APR to 10.415% APR. Source: http://www.suntrusteducation.com...Federal student loans more affordable for all students now because the interest rates are lower. If federal student loans were abolished, it is reasonable to infer as well that private student loan rates would increase because of both increased demand for them, and because private institutions would have the luxury to set their borrowing rates much higher. That would increase the overall cost of education much more for all students who must borrow to afford college, and amplify the long term harms that PRO is trying to remediate by abolishing student loans. PRO repeats himself with a second contention that \"federal student loans have caused a rise in tuition.\" PRO contends that tuition prices have been artificially inflated because of government intervention. Yet, the evidence he offers for that, from the Cato institute, suggests that the reason for increased prices is because of supply and demand imbalances, such that because \"more Americans have sought education\" tuition prices are \"higher.\" So, the cause of tuition increases has more to do with increased demand for higher education than the fact that the federal government makes college comparably more affordable than private lending institutions. PRO's other warrant offers another alternative cause: university greed. Pro cites Peter Wood, a professor at Boston University, who said that \"colleges and universities\" set tuition \"high enough to capture... funds\" wherever they \"can be extracted from parents.\" So, while it is the case that money to pay for college is easier to come by where federal student loans are an option, that does not mean that abolishing federal student loans is either going to reduce tuition rates or have any impact to lower the cost of higher education at all so long as colleges retain the incentive to charge higher prices and students have access to private loans. So, PRO's solution is not only insufficient to address the problem he's trying to solve, but it very likely could make the problem worse by increasing the overall cost of education -both tuition prices and interest paid on private student loans.PRO's final argument is that \"federal student loans\" have harmed students.\" PRO argues that because in 2012, 56% of bachelors degree holders under the age of 25 were jobless or underemployed and that student loans are directly responsible for unemployment among those with bachelors degrees. He offers no causal link between student loans student loans and unemployment, however. He fails to consider that the number of people who are under the age of 25 who are unemployed or under employed would be higher if those people did not have a bachelors degree, and ignores the possibility that the extant US economic situation is more directly to blame for aggregate high unemployment rates among all Americans and especially among people entering the labor force for the first time. He likewise offers no explanation for how abolishing federal student loans will lower unemployment or underemployment. PRO contends that students are negatively impacted by debt, and therefore student loans should be abolished. But, what PRO fails to consider, which I have addressed earlier, is that in the absence of federal student loans, students who need to borrow to afford college must seek other means. The only other option for the vast majority of those students would be private lenders, whose interest rates are already higher than federal student loan rates and whose interest rates would skyrocket if federal student loans were abolished. The impact of this would be to raise the cost of borrowing money, which would profoundly increase the cost of higher education, which would exacerbate the problem pro is seeking to address rather than remediating it. PRO argues that federal student loans harm student's credit scores, which is just false. Students build credit while they are in college, and their scores are only harmed if they default. If students default on payments, that is because they did not pay back money they borrowed, not because they were leant money in the first place. Pro fails to account for this. Irrelevant AlternativesPRO's alternatives are irrelevant to this debate because the resolution is only about whether or not student loans should be abolished. That there are other alternatives PRO thinks are better than student loans do not help his case because his alternatives (tax credits and work study programs) can coexist along with federal student loans and we know this because, based on the evidence he cited, similar programs already do.I'll look forward to the next round.",

The sad part is that suicide didn't end his student loan nightmare and student debt collectors were still phoning his mother about the money her son owed.( this story is all over the internet no source is needed) here are some more real tragic stories Toby Thorn from England, had \"8,000 in debt when he killed himself. a Temple University student named Roswell Friend committed committed suicide because she defaulted on her student loan., In 2008, 34-year-old science graduate Claire Ashing killed herself after being pursued over \"40,000 she owed, as did mechanical engineering student Marc Wadjas, who could not afford to buy food. In 2006 computer student Geraint Banks-Wilkinson ended his life after his bank called in his \"1,000 overdraft, and in 2005 26-year-old Lisa Taylor did the same because she felt she would never be able to pay back the \"14,000 debt accrued while studying for her degree. She left a note blaming her depression on debt.The number of students who took their own lives in England and Wales rose by 50% between 2007 and 2011 \"\" from 75 to 112. source(www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/23/student-suicide-depression-debt-recession) Cryn Johannsen of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project writes about the spectre of suicide in connection with student debt: Suicide is the dark side of the student lending crisis and, despite all the media attention to the issue of student loans, it\"s been severely under-reported. I can\"t ignore it though, because I\"m an advocate for people who are struggling to pay their student loans, and I\"ve been receiving suicidal comments for over two years and occasionally hearing reports of actual suicides.http://newworkplace.wordpress.com... In accordance with the World Health Organization, over one million people every year die from suicide. Suicidal tendencies are often associated with divorce, depression, ill-health, alcohol or drug problems; student loan debt being the most significant among them. A majority of the people who seek counseling advice are people who see suicide as a way out of private student loan debt problems. source:http://EzineArticles.com... here is a note from a suicidal student from America \"I plan to douse myself and light myself aflame on the Capitol steps, to draw attention to the dire situation of the millions of indentured educated citizens who, like me, have no options, plus a predatory banking system coming after us. There is no political solution to this problem . . . I will be setting myself on fire, and the student debt debacle will hopefully come to the forefront of public consciousness.\" source:http://www.huffingtonpost.com... that is not the end of the story, student loan has interest rate that get built up ,and if you cant pay them on time or default on them, you will be penalized which will be added to the actual debt over time, and you end up realizing the student loan debt is with you forever -- you can't discharge it in bankruptcy. In fact, \"Up to Our Eyeballs\" notes that about 9% of Americas aged 45-64 still have student loan debt! as the case happened with At 47, John Koch who is still living with his elderly parents in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Koch originally borrowed $69,000 in 1997.Koch struggled to find steady employment and eventually he defaulted on his loans. He was immediately slapped with $50,000 in penalties. For years, he had been filling out deferment forms every six months to buy himself more time but in 2009, Sallie Mae declared him in default. At the time of this writing, Koch owes over $320,000. That sounds staggering but it's hardly unusual. Once a person defaults on a student loan, the balance grows exponentially, with interest compounding on interest, penalties and fees. By the time he \"retires,\" in 23 years, Koch figures he will owe close to $1.9 million!. He can't get even subprime credit, he tells me, and it's not like there's any way out of his trap: student loan debt cannot be absolved through bankruptcy. That is why suicide is becoming a debt payment option. source:http://www.huffingtonpost.com... I could go on this topic................. ok, hopefully now you are convinced that student loan leads to suicide and is expected to increase hugely in the next few years. You should also be convinced to agree with my statement that says \"on the other hand, people who opted to stay away from college or dropped out , seems [sic] to have a higher rating of success.\" not having an ever increasing debt on your back for the rest of your life that deprives you of a lot of things like a house, car, marriage and most importantly \"peace of mind\", is a huge plus in ones life. and did you know that those\" successfully hired graduates\" some of those hired part time (16%), have to pay back a large amount of their salaries every month to student loan for up to 10, to 20 years or even in some aforementioned cases until they are like (47-68) years old? you also did say \"'uneducated people are more unemployed and earn less than their graduate counterparts\" in this sentence (the unemployment rate of those without a college degree is easily higher than that of a college graduate) also you said I quoted wrongly and, 40 percent of graduates are \"underemployed\" not \"unemployed\" I think your eyes have some serious problems. I post the title of the source for you and others again to see it properly it reads\"Today's students graduate from college with heavy debts, and many aren't reaping the benefits of that education \"\" a poll shows recent grads often find jobs that don't require a college degree. More than 40% are unemployed, and 16% are in part-time positions\" here is the source again :http://www.huffingtonpost.com... look back maybe your eyes work this time. and your funny question about why I didn't mention about non-degree jobs. Because there are thousands of them if not millions to list . and there isn't simply enough space for me to do that. but to give you and idea, check this source for the 40 highest job without a degree :http://www.businessinsider.com... interestingly the title of the source completely destroys your stance on education. it reads \"In today's uncertain economy, a college education no longer guarantees you a high-paying job. But on the flip side, if you don't want to go to college, you don't have to \"\" you can still get a high-paying job without a bachelor's degree\" with all those said, I know people in my community some of them with even master degree, selling vegetables and managing grocery shops. and by the way ,not all uneducated people got rich by inheritance. that is completely false. I personally worked for a man who owned a global shipment company who had over 400 transportation trucks in operation.by his own account, he used to sell potatoes on the street when he was young. I repeat again, what is the point of wasting (4-10) years of your life in college, building up a formidable debt on your shoulders that bogs you down ,hold you back in life , brings nightmare in your dreams every night. And takes every pleasure away from you. debts that takes a life time to clear if lucky. if not then suicide would be a last dark option. I really enjoyed the debate and want the readers to evaluate both side's arguments before making decisions. I also want to thank the opposite side for his or her participation and would like to know more about him or her (nationality ,age .major.....)",

            "premise": "Okay, so you think the When the part is irrelevant. But in fact, you are wrong on saying this. Why? Because the When part is very important on this subject. It like you are saying, the nation will go broke soon in a year to 5 years. But in fact, you don't have proof of When or Where it going to happen. The nation could very well continue to drive up the national debt. Or this could stable itself out or could actually decrease the national debt within time. With the economy going well, and could even see the economy doing better in the years to come. So, it has the potential to decrease the national debt. You only dismiss the When part because it would ruin your whole case on why the nation would go bankrupt. This bankruptcy of the nation will take a lot longer than what you have claimed. It will not affect this generation as you have claimed. This process, of continually overspending what the nation actually put out, will take a long time. Just like global warming, it not going to really affect this generation. It will take another 30 to 50 years before it could really hurt us if what you said happens. One more thing you thinking nothing can change over time, and it will continue to get worst. But in fact, you don't actually have proof it will continue negatively over time with the national debt. You said this\" Social security will no longer have a surplus to loan after 2033\" for your second part of your Scenarios. \"Social Security is fully funded until 2034, and after that it is about three-quarters financed. Considered alone, the DI Trust Fund is projected to become depleted sooner than the combined Social Security funds\". (5.) Social Security is \"the total cost is now about 5% of the national economy, or GDP. That will rise to about 6% when all of the baby boomers are retired. That increase, 1% of GDP, is less than the nation\"s increase in spending for public education when baby boomers were children\". (6.) There are two important factors in here, one is they the Government always have to renegotiate every 15 to 20 years to get the math right, because it always changing, not because it will help the nation go broke. the other thing is SSI is actually a small cost of the national economy. The third reason you list in your Scenarios is \" New revenue sources will be unavailable\" Why is this even true? The federal government collected revenues from all aspects, such as INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX, PAYROLL TAXES, CORPORATE INCOME TAX, FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES, \"The federal government also collects revenue from estate and gift taxes, customs duties, earnings from the Federal Reserve System, and various fees and charges\". (7.) \"In fiscal year (FY) 2016[1] the federal government collected revenues of $3.3 trillion\"about 17.8 percent of GDP. Over the past 50 years, federal revenue has averaged 17.4 percent of GDP, ranging from 20.0 percent (in 2000) to 14.6 percent (most recently in 2008 and 2009)\". (8.) The sixth Scenarios you haven't said yet until the next round. But I will jump ahead and give my input on it. You think the nation might one day become Bankrupt. Um, that not going to be true at all at least not what you going to say about it nor the timing of this bankruptcy. let me give you a quote on why it won't. \"The reason why it's not true is because we live in a fiat currency system, where the United States government can create an infinite number of dollars at no cost to meet its obligations. A Treasury bill is a promise that the government will give you US dollars--something that the United States government can produce infinitely and at no cost\".(9.)

            "premise": "Now that we near the debate\"s end, I present my summary. New revenue sources will be unavailable. I have already addressed this while my opponent was only able to show existing revenue sources. These sources have not been able to grow at a rate that has reduced the debt in the last 60 years.Thus the debt will grow at a rate that exceeds the growth of the economy. Existing zero cost funding sources will dry up The biggest source of zero cost funds is the excess funds from the Social Security Administration . Currently one third of the deficit is covered by these funds. This source will exhaust in 2033. The treasury will then have to sell 50% more bonds to compensate for the loss. Debt service will consume a higher and higher percentage of the US budget. An inspection of the table shown earlier will show that the US government is not even paying the full interest on the debt. In 2016 the US government paid $242 billion in debt service even while the interest charge alone was $432 billion. Thus nearly half the cost was charged to future budgets. This alone may make investing in government bonds less attractive. Investors stop buying bonds. As the funding situation becomes more apparent, investors will look elsewhere for investing. The government would have to pay a higher interest to attract sufficient dollars to pay the deficit. This increases the cost of debt service, even while we are not even paying full cost today. Thus the deficit becomes a growing problem. THe government could print more dollars, but that just reduces the value of the dollar, which will result in the bonds being even less attractive as an investment. Default As investors demand repayment on their bonds, the stress on the system will become unbearable. The government would be forced to reduce governmental services so money could be redirected to debt payments. This could be a short term \"reorganization\" known as a \"default\" Bankruptcy As the short term default bleeds the system further and further, the result is bankruptcy. When the government pays out more than it gets in, it has to borrow When it borrows, it first uses Social Security Administration excess funds When that excess disappears it must sell more and more bonds When it sells more and more bonds, the debt service increases When the debt service increases the government must borrow more money\" When it borrows more and more it becomes an endless spiral When it becomes an endless spiral, it leads to bankruptcy See \"The Bankruptcy of The United States United States Congressional Record, March 17, 1993 Vol. 33, page H-1303\" http://www.afn.org... My argument is that the only way to reduce the threat of bankruptcy is to reduce the debt. The debt is reduced by eliminating the deficit. THe deficit is eliminated by a fiscally responsible Congress. It was apparent that there were numerous misunderstandings by Con that clouded his reasoning. Con seems to think that if the bankruptcy doesn\"t happen in his lifetime, then it doesn\"t matter.That is exactly the kind of reasoning the government uses, and that is why it is a problem. Quote by Con.. \" It (sic) not happening right now nor anytime in the near future. So, why does it matter? \" It matters because bankruptcy will impact basic governmental functions. Quote by Con.\"You brought up the nation faults five different times. Okay that's true. And what happened to the United States since then? Oh they just grow to the most powerful nation on the planet. So tell me why does this matter? \" It matters because so much of the debt is now held by foreign entities. Quote by Con.\" China and japan the biggest dept ( Sic) we have is with them,\" Quote by Con.\"every time the market had a crash. ,,,it will always go back up.\" This faith based assertion has little basis in fact when dealing with bankruptcy.

            "conclusion": "This House would enact a one time policy that erases all student debt from private lenders.",
            "premise": "Good morning. I would first like to start off by defining some terms. For this debate, I will be defining This House as the United States Congress. I will be defining student debt from private companies as debt that is owed by students to non government lenders such as SallieMae, College Ave, Etc. I will now start by explaining what this one time policy would look like. This one time policy would be a proposed bill that would eliminate student debt from private lenders. Students who are currently studying in university will not benefit from this bill. If the one time bill if successful, It will then be re-written to be enacted every ten years or so. This bill will cover students who recently graduated from undergraduate studies and those who have been graduated for longer who still have a sufficient amount of debt to pay off. I would like to move on to my three points of positive matter. 1) This bill would help strengthen the economy. Currently, College graduates are working endlessly just to pay off their student loans. With interest rates being way too high, It's ridiculous how many people have to work to repay student loans instead of working for a house, Car, Family, Etc. According to a study conducted in 2018 by CNBC, 32% of Americans said college debt prevented or delayed them from buying a home, Including 36 percent of millenials, 26 percent of Gen Xers, And 26 percent of boomers. Once this bill were to pass, Citizens wouldn't really need to worry paying their debts. Instead, They could use the money to help our economy. The more flexibility that people have in their finances, The more bound they are to spend on items, Which in turn will help the economy. 2) This bill would encourage young students to go to school. Students in today's world don't want to go to college, Why? Because of the crazy high amounts of students who graduate with debt. I almost decided not to go to college, Because of the amount of money it took. If this bill were to pass, We would be able to encourage our younger students that college doesn't have to end with student debt. Many more students would be encouraged to go to school. This ties along with my third and final point of positive matter. 3) This bill would gain the trust of students. A vast majority of students according to NBC, When supporting a politician, One of the main issues that is examined is education. Students would want and support politicians that advocate for them and help them make the college process a whole lot easier. If this bill is passed, I can safely assume that we would get a higher rating of support from our student voters, As they see that government does care about the students. To summarize, This bill proposed by Congress would eliminate all student debt and benefit the students by strengthening the economy, Encouraging young students to go to college, And gaining the trust of the student vote in government. I believe that the Opposition will not have arguments that benefit the students. This is why I urge the Panel to vote in favor of the Government. Thank you.",

            "conclusion": "The growth of the national debt, if not stopped, will bankrupt the nation.",
            "premise": "Okay, let me be clear here. Because your are misrepresenting the SSI part. I had two parts in it. The first part is the US government have to renegotiate deals every 10 to 14 years. To modify it, you know to make it better. So, yes in 2034 they meaning the SSI will be out of money. But that's only if the government don't renegotiate a new deal before then. And they always renegotiate a new deal 4 to 5 years before the old deal end. The second part of this you didn't even mention. Why Because it would hurt your argument. I said this \"The total cost is now about 5% of the national economy, or GDP. That will rise to about 6% when all of the baby boomers are retired\". So do you know what this means? It means if ever SSI actually did run out of money which is highly unlikely. It only a small percentage of the country's GDP. SSI running out of money will not dramatic hurt the national debt like some people want to make you believe. It's a fairy tale of lies. You are correct on this part you never brought up the When part. That's because it would hurt your argument. So, i brought it up for my argument. It does matter rather you like to admit it or not. You said \"The growth of the national debt, if not stopped, will bankrupt the nation\" but when? It not happening right now nor anytime in the near future. So, why does it matter? It like global warming, we need to do something before it too late. But the too late part could take 50 years, a hundred years, or a thousand years. So, when you said the nation will go bankrupt, it doesn't make sense to me when you say this. It not happening immediately, nor no signs of this happening in the near future. You brought up the nation faults five different times. Okay that's true. And what happened to the United States since then? Oh they just grow to the most powerful nation on the planet. So tell me why does this matter? It kind of like the stock market it goes up and way up, and then it go down and even deeper down then it shy rocket again. This what happen every time the market had a crash. So, again even if its ever go down this far it will always go back up. \"Many world viewers state that the United States would not go bankrupt because the world economy would not let it as the world economy allegedly feels a US collapse means a world economy collapse, and only God, Goddess, Allah, or other \"creator\" knows what would result\". (10.) https://thelawdictionary.org... \"Usually, the inability to pay debt means one has no money. The United States prints its own money. Yet, money used to pay debt is worthwhile only in terms of the debt it pays. If money holds less worth, it pays less debt. This means that it takes more money to pay the same amount of debt. It is a spiral that reduces the worth of money over time. Eventually, the US might run out of trees \" to make paper\". (11.) https://thelawdictionary.org... This is also true the world economy would not let the US go down this far. Because it would cause chaos around the world. So, China and japan the biggest dept we have is with them, and they would not let the US go down this far as you mention. Its way to much money they would be losing not just the US or the world. So, this bankruptcy of the US WILL not happen in our life times. And that does matter. Why are we talking about something that may or may not happen in a very very long time...",

            "premise": "Almost every young adult today is expected to have a college degree. It is a social norm in todays society. Many people have a lot to consider when applying to colleges. Things such as location, size of the school, its reputaion and its majors are things that will decide whether you will attend or not. But the most important thing that people have to consider is the cost. Whether a community college, private college or state college, this educational expense can affect families and students. Even State colleges can cost up to about $30,000 a year. This leaves students coming out of college with extreme debt. This is causing a major issue in today's society. After college, young adults are expected to live on thier own and fend for themselves. After leaving school, students realize that they will not be able to afford the expensies of living on thier own and they soon find themselves moving back at home with their parents. College is supposed to teach young adults to be independent. This is not going to be happening if they are forced to move back home as soon as they are finished getting their degree. With an average cost of $30,000 per year for college tuition, a four year degree will cost the student $120,000. This is a tremdous debt for anyone to burden, much less a young adult who has just graduated college. Adults purchasing a house take on this level of debt and then arrange for it to be paid back over twenty to thirty years. Many of the loans afforded to students are required to be paid back in much less time. How, with little to no experience to speak of, can a new graduate get a job paying enough to both support themselves and pay back this enormous debt. They cannot. So, the student ends up living at home with their parents to speed up the process of paying back their loans. If the former student gets a job paying $40,000 per year, their take home pay will be about sixty percent or about $25,000. Now if you take all of these earnings and put them towards the outstanding college loans, it will take about five years to pay back the loans. However, this is not reality so it will take much longer. Most likely, the pay back of the loans will be more like $10,000 per year. With this pay schedule, the payback is now up to twelve years. I'm also assuming that these loans carry no interest. Not likely! How can you even think of going to a bank to obtain a credit rating or another loan with this much debt on you? Other countries don't put this burden on their young adults. If education is a priority to get our economy running again the way we need it to, then the education of our youth is a top priority. That being said, how can the education of youth be a priority if the cost prohibits so many students from attending and getting a college education. In this economy, a college education is not an option, it is a requirement. By making state colleges free for students living in that state, we will make college education available to anyone who wants this education.",

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, for the 2007-2008 year, the average student loan debt of graduating college seniors was about $23,000. This means that when a person graduates from college, instead of working to make money for their future, they are working to make money to pay back their past. True, an education allows for a better future, but so many students are stuck paying back loans for years after their graduation that they can\u2019t do things that, such as travel, that students in other countries, where education is free can do. It is unfair that if one does not come from a wealthy family, they are stuck paying back loans for x number of years. While their friends who had their education paid have the opportunity to go doing things such as traveling, those who owe money are forced to find a job right away that they may not necessarily love, because they have to pay back their loans.",

I'll keep this short since my opponent is both refuting and opening in her turn. Here is why college students should get free transportation:1) College students have very little moneyMost college students have taken student loans or had their parents take mortagages on their house to pay for college tuition, rent, food and textbooks. There is an enormous amount of money required for college and most students are in debt. They cannot afford to buy a car or pay extra for public transportation. 2) They have a huge requirement for transportationWhen college students go for a job interview, need to buy groceries or just need to go to class and back, they need transportation. Cars are expensive, as are parking permits for those who stay in the dorm. It is also difficult to find parking spots close to student's classes.3) College students would pay for it after graduationAfter college students graduate, most will get a job and pay taxes. A miniscule amount of these taxes would go to support public transport for the next generation of college students who would enjoy the benefits provided by their predecessors. This way, people who have money would be paying for public transport as opposed to people that don't. It is a great system of \"passing it forward\".4) The university owes themStudents pay universities an obscene amount of money for attending. The university owes it to them to make their life as easy as possible financially. In many counties, the local university makes a deal with the local public transport agency so that students can just swipe their university ID and ride for free.

            "conclusion": "Personal Bankruptcy is worth doing",
            "premise": "\"I should have NEVER allowed a 13 year old to debate me. Of course I get a forfeit!\" -The words of my opponent. In most eyes, these can be hurtful words, and in most eyes, these are rude words, not accepted in debate. So, I ask voters, just because I forfeited one round, not to award conduct points to my opponent because of his third round/comment. Before I begin, I would also like to apologize for my forfeit. I shouldn't have started this debate, because (1) my opponent obviously does not like me, and (2) finals are upcoming, and I was busy studying, so, naturally, time got away from me and it automatically forfeited. So, my opponent won't have any opportunity to present refutations to my arguments. I will not present refutations to his, therefore making it even. Also, before I begin, I would like to point out that my opponent utterly detests me only because of my young age (13), however he does not even state his age, and the one he states is indeed a lie (99). So now, with that aside, I would like to present my main arguments. My opponent has stated that there are only three negative consequences to bankruptcy, however I disagree, and I will prove this throughout my arguments. Argument 1: Personal bankruptcy is not worth doing because it ruins your credit for a minimum . Personal bankruptcy releases you from many debt obligations such as credit cards, however this is shown on the credit reports and drastically lowers your FICO credit score. Not to mention, when bankruptcy is filed, your credit cards are taken away. So, filing bankruptcy means that you're now on a strictly cash spending 'diet', and who uses cash anymore? The majority of people today in the modern world use credit cards. Therefore, personal bankruptcy harms your credit and your spending. Argument 2: Personal bankruptcy is not worth doing because it stigmatizes you as being irresponsible, unreliable, and immoral. When bankruptcy is declared, you have had debts on a number of things, such as a car, a house, a washing machine, dryer, etc. and essentially, you don't pay for it. This is like stealing. You know you can't afford to buy it, yet you purchase it on credit and you don't pay for it, so who then pays for it? The people who pay for it are everyday people like you and me, or the store owner, who has to pay for the person's debt. So when we go to buy it, it's that much more because of the person who declared bankruptcy. Therefore, personal bankruptcy is immoral because it makes other people suffer. Argument 3: Personal bankruptcy is not worth doing because you will become part of a public record. In many court documents, if personal bankruptcy is filed, and this can even extend to the newspaper, all because you stupidly filed personal bankruptcy because it was \"worth it\" as pro is suggesting. Therefore, you will not be able to keep your finances private if you file personal bankruptcy; your finances will go public, and most people like to keep them private. Voters, before this round is over, let me remind you, that if you file personal bankruptcy, you need a plan to pay it back when your bankruptcy is over. But how will you pay it back if you have bad credit and no credit cards? Can you pay thousands of dollars in cash? Probably not, because you're bankrupt. In conclusion, I believe that personal bankruptcy is not worth doing because it ruins your credit, it stigmatizes you as being irresponsible, immoral, and unreliable while other people suffer for your mistake, and lastly because your finances will go public. Thank you for reading, and please vote for the Con side of this debate. Good luck pro!",

Bankruptcy is good as it allows for the forgiveness of debts to those that have got themselves into unsustainable financial positions. Without this recourse, they and their families would become financial slaves to their creditors for the rest of their lives without any means of escape. Although it may seem unfair for their creditors, they too have this avenue open to them so are given the exact same advantage. In addition debtor control is a primary business function that should be managed effectively to limit the financial impacts of the bankruptcy of debtors to businesses.",

            "conclusion": "The use of credit scores should be tightly curtailed",
            "premise": "C1P1: I contest as ludicrous the notion that employees have any control over being laid off and that the companies are forced to lay off workers. Executives often significantly increase their own pay for dumping workers on the street -- this disproves their payroll was not too costly, they merely transferred payroll to increase their own wealth by completely eliminating the income of a large number of people. Further, no regard is given to productivity when laying off workers; workers in third-world countries have much lower standards with rampant quality problems, and measure as being far less productive. An employee has no control over being laid off to be replaced with foreign workers. Changed loan: The consumer has zero power to change the terms of the loan or negotiate to have this one-sided abuse out of the contract. To suggest there is an equal footing between lender and lendee is ludicrous. Medical: If one loses one's income and cannot make any payments, it still harms credit and a person whose sole debt is medical would be discriminated against in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Medical debt is inherently involuntary, unless you consider it acceptable for someone with immediate medical need to forgo medical treatment because they cannot afford the payments. C1P2: Student Loan - There is no \"cheap\" post-secondary education. The cost of tuition and books has increased in double-digit percentages every single year for many years now. Inflation and incomes have not risen anywhere close, especially for someone who has not yet had a degree to have a high-income position to afford persuing a degree. Further, many educational institutions give full control over a student's finances to a Financial Aid officer. There is no real recourse for a student against an incompent or fraudulent Financial Aid Officer or practices that cause a student to lose qualifying status, leaving the student with no means of completing their degree and a large loan they must find a way to repay without the wages students are impressioned to believe would result from having a degree. None of these situations are in the control of a consumer. C1P3: A person who has a high credit rating because they stole money which gave them no problem paying bills will get preferential treatment in getting hired, etc. Credit history is used by a lot of companies in the hiring process, which is one of my arguments for curtailing their use -- there is no valid use for a would-be employer to use one's credit history in the hiring process. I'm a bit disturbed that CON thinks someone who has a lot of money lying around because they stole it is a trustworthy business partner ... I surely hope CON mis-understood what he was saying. C2:1 - It is up to the voters in this debate, then, whether they accept those situations as warranting discriminatory hiring practices, housing and other private/corporate-controlled aspects of necessary life in the U.S.A. that are supposed to be protected from discrimination. C2:2 - A person chooses whether or not to commit a crime. A person has no choice for their employer reducing or eliminating their income or a lender raising their payments to an unaffordable level, or whether or not be stricken with injury or illness requiring treatment or operations they cannot afford, or whether an expensive postsecondary degree is a requirement to obtain a job. \"System of credit bureaus...\" 1.) Yes, they do. They have no requirement to operate differently. It doesn't matter whether its intentional on the part of the bureaus ... consider a person acquires debt, then get laid off. Its then very difficult -- and often completely impossible -- to pay debt. Since employers use credit history in a hiring decision, the person then has great difficulty in getting a decent-paying job to pay off those bills. It doesn't matter if it was the credit bureau's, employer's or loaner's intention to conspire against the person to trap them -- the conflux of the three entities is a conspiracy (intentional or unintentional) against the person. And since employers use credit history in a hiring decision, a \"bad\" credit history is effectively a blacklist from getting employment and for anything that uses credit scores to discriminate -- rent, car insurance, etc. 2.) Your claims were false. It is ludicrous to believe a consumer has an equal footing to set and alter terms with a debtor or has any influence in what their employer does. These are completely at the \"mercy\" of corporations to do the right thing instead of the profitable thing. The consumer has no choice and no negotiating power. The consumer's ability to pay bills hinges on their employer not laying them off. What power do you have against your employer to keep them from laying you off or cutting your wages versus your employer's power to cut your hours or lay you off? Its very one-sided, and it doesn't matter how \"good\" you are as an employee. In the end, if your employer has profit motivation to close your entire department and move operations overseas where workers are far less proficient but very cheap, they will. That is entirely out of a person's hands ... and how can you pay any bills if you have no income? In regards to bankruptcy, under President George W. Bush, the ability of consumers to go through a bankruptcy process was drastically reduced. A consumer who has lost the means to pay off their debt no longer has bankruptcy as a viable option thanks to the act. C3:1.) You have failed to indicate how they would create harm. C3:2.) I'm not sure which point I made you are claiming as baseless. C3:4.) Credit score is not a valid measure of trustworthiness nor their work ethic. Any assumptions based on the equation of credit score with trustworthiness or work ethic are false, regardless of how popular such notions are. C3:5.) I did not argue for the complete banishment of credit scores, merely for their over-use. Taking out a voluntary loan is one of the few valid uses of a credit score, though this too should be restricted against discriminating against someone for involuntary debt such as medical bills or student loan. Abusing credit scores causes unthinkable and immoral harm under any system that asserts equal, just and fair opportunity for all. AFF 1.) I need not prove credit scores are entirely wrong in all cases, merely they are over-used. I can win if a voter believes fairness and justice are important values and must take precedence over profitability and rule by the biggest purse. AFF 2.) CON has failed to understand this debate is about CURTAILING -- restricting -- the use of credit scores, not banning them altogether. I am not arguing for completely banning credit scores, merely pushing for the case that their use should be highly restricted to prevent infringements upon equal opportunity, justice and fairness. I urge CON to re-focus the debate on the topic of CURTAILING (restricting) the use of credit scores instead of banning them. CON has failed to justify using a credit scores to discriminate against people for employment, housing, etc. in circumvention of civil rights legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Someone who comes from a poor household will not have equal opportunity to make and pay loans to inflate their credit scores as someone from a wealthy household with significant un-earned capital. I put it to all that this violates the axiom \"all people are created equal\" and that the use of credit scores should be curtailed to help level the playing field in any situation where a person's ability to pay debt has no direct bearing or relevance.",

            "premise": "This incredulous vessel has not been able to compute the nonsensical rant posted by pro.Analysis of pro's rant shall be attempted later in this round. First of all, con's case shall be stated.First of all terms must be defined.National Debt: the total amount of money which a country\u2019s government has borrowed. http://oxforddictionaries.com...Repudiate: http://oxforddictionaries.com... refuse to accept; reject:she has repudiated policies associated with previous party leaders chiefly Law refuse to fulfil or discharge (an agreement, obligation, or debt):breach of a condition gives the other party the right to repudiate a contract 2deny the truth or validity of:the minister repudiated allegations of human rights abuses This is the full resolution that pro is in favour of: A government should refuse to fulfil or discharge the total amount of money which a country\u2019s government has borrowed.The absurdity of this resolution is that it is asking a government to simply ignore what it owes. So in essence the government just doesn't pay many other nations back what is owes them, probably in the billions, and hopes that this will die down over time? If people like pro led nations, we'd be seeing world war three very soon.There is simply no reason to refuse to fulfil a debt to another nation. This will not only lead to aggravation of that nation and possibly war but also ruin the country's reputation that hasn't paid the debt and thus result in a huge amount of governments elsewhere banning businesses to engage with them (essentially leaving the country isolated like a neo-North Korea.This is insane, risky and far too prone to lead to huge conflicts with other nations to be advisable in the slightest to any nation hoping to achieve global success in any sense of the word.Now onto rebuttals (brace your self for a series of stating the obvious for it seems this is what must be done to rebut the nonsensical rant of pro's).\"One common argument against repudiation is that it would result in a certain and devastating economic collapse.\"Nothing to rebut here, pro opens their speech speaking for con.\"Nothing could be further from the truth.\"A claim is either true or untrue. Since what pro stated before this was true, it is very possible many lies could be 'further' from the truth despite there being no scale of distance from it whatsoever.\"The sky will not fall if the government does not pay back all the money it has borrowed.\"But a nuclear bomb sure could fall from the sky onto its land if it doesn't pay back its debt to a country such as Russia or Pakistan (no racism intended, these nations are host to some of the biggest reserves of nuclear power in the world they are thus more dangerous to betray than a nation with less easy access to nuclear material for bombs). \"The hysteria to the contrary is simply the squawking of an economically illiterate media; the same fools who tell you that consumption is the key to prosperity\"Baseless, unjustified, false and ridiculous opinion stated as if it were fact. This is a fallacy of logic.In fact. Let me just list every single baseless, unjustified and false opinion stated as if it were fact in their speech.All of the following qualify: \"try consuming your way to prosperity with your own finances and tell me how well you do\" It is extremely likely one who consumes education, knowledge, skills, food, water and rest would end up very successful in life.\"the key to economic growth is savings.\" A nation that has yet to pay off debt, needn't save anything since it should be paying off its debt.\"savings are ravaged by inflation.\" No they are not.\"Who benefits from inflation? Leaving aside the Hayekian insight that inflation benefits those who get the new money first (the political class)\" No one in the nation benefits.\"Supply and demand. This is why you hear old timers talking about a weeks pay for $50 or whatever shockingly low figure is used to describe a price in a distant past because the government has been printing so much money.\" Nonsensical rant which is completely irrelevant to the debate.\"Printing money benefits debtors at the expense of creditors.\" IT DOES NOT BENEFIT ANYONE!\"since the money that pays back the loan is worth less than the money with which the loan was borrowed)\" This would just mean more amounts of the same currency now have to be paid anyway.\"This creates a disincentive towards savings.\" What has this got to do with ANYTHING in this debate?\"But savings are where real economic growth comes from\" Spending wisely is where it comes form, merely hoarding back money to save it is stupid and futile, causing no growth at all.\"those savings are then loaned to entrepreneurs\" Irrelevant.\"capital makes workers more productive and these more productive workers now earn a higher salary.\" BUT... The government still has a national debt to pay off that is increasing with a huge interest rate!\"Another big problem with paying back the debt is that in order to pay it back you need to tax people.\" How is this a problem?\" taxes are terrible for the economy\" Such nonsense.\"they kill jobs\" Taxes do not kill jobs.\"it's wrong to take someone else's property\" This is exactly what the government of that nation has done to another nation. This is why it is in NATiONAL DEBT!\" it's especially wrong to threaten to hurt them if they do not give you their property.\" What? This is seriously a nonsensical rant totally irrelevant to the debate.\"This is called extortion and it's against the law - except when the government does it, because the government can do anything they want, because they're the government and you're not.\" What the actual heck is pro going on about?\"why should some random plumber pay back all the money that was sent to foreign dictators via foreign aid\" Asking a why question usually is only valid if it is relevant to the debate. This is not relevant.\"given to rich agribusiness interests like subsidizing ethanol, or put into countless imperialist wars of aggression against poor people in little huts that could never have hurt anyone if they wanted to which they assuredly did not?\" Complete and utter nonsense.\"If you take out a loan you are morally obligated to pay back that loan.\" The word pro is looking for is 'legally'.\"How can I possibly be obligated to pay back a loan for money that I never agreed to spend in the first place?\" By taxing.\"Really it's the fault of whoever loaned the money in the first place.\" This is exactly why the government shouldn't ignore it for it is their fault.\"Why on earth would you loan money to an organization as cruel, as ruthless, with as brutal disregard for human life as the state?\" Is this a joke? The state are the heads of a nation, their sole job is caring for the welfare of its people and the economy.\"Why would you seek to finance this vicious and repressive empire for the sake of a few points in interest?\" Nonsensical rant begins again.\"Say proponents of stealing your money to pay back all the spending politicians have done in order to secure their own power, wealth and the wealth and power of the people who elected them, who would lend the government any more money if the debt was repudiated? And that's exactly the point. No one. Instead of these debt ceiling circuses there would be a very real debt ceiling. Bad credit. And how incredible would that be! If you knew that NO ONE could leverage your children's future. If the government learned a little fiscal restraint. I know I would spend like crazy with a trillion dollar credit card. Wouldn't you?\"Nonsensical rant... In conclusion, it seems extremely obvious that if a government owes debts to other nations it better get up off its lazy arse and worry about paying them than 'repudiating it' which means to completely refuse to pay it.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for this debate and look forward to it. My opponents central argument is that College ensures jobs and more jobs means more money in circulation. However, this is not the case as I will prove in my case. ========= Case ========= College ought not be required for two reasons: 1. It puts American citizen's into debt. 2. It is no longer the insurance for a job or future success that students were one guaranteed. 1. On the Wall Street Journal Blogs this week an alarming study by the Project on Student Debt was released. The nonprofit reports that average debt for college seniors who graduated with loans in 2008 rose to $23,200 in 2008, up from $18,650 in 2004. Roughly two-thirds of students graduate with student loans, government surveys show. Also it found that the highest debt levels were in the District of Columbia, where students graduated with average debts of $29,793, and Iowa, where students with loans carried $28,174 on average. And many economists worry that such financial challenges could hurt the earning potential of these college graduates long after the recession's end. There's also concern about whether and when these same grads will be able to save for retirement, start businesses or buy homes. However the report also doesn't calculate the impact on students (or, for that matter, parents) who use credit cards, home equity lines of credit or 401(k) loans to finance college. These tactics were likely to have been more common when many survey respondents entered college around 2004, as the housing and economic boom were gathering steam. So as we can see college voluntarily is becoming a burden to individuals, both during school and after. And in order to pay these ever increasing debts student have been forced to get more and more jobs, thus decreasing the value of education they can receive. But it is not just the Student Loans and future 401(k)s that are bogging down students, the city of Pittsburgh is proposing what appears to be a one-of-a-kind 1% tuition tax on local university and college students. Now this could be considered fair if it were not due to the fact that the money collected combined with the already more than $20 million in other taxes (on schools and students), would be used in order to pay for the city's goals and ambitions. All of this only further sinking the ignorant student into mounds of debt, ruining their lives. 2. \"Just like other investments, some people are realizing that past performance does not guarantee future returns,\". Lauren Asher, president of the Project on Student Debt and co-author of the paper, says. As many graduates have learned, a solid degree from an august institution doesn't necessarily guarantee a decent paying job, or any job at all. [http://blogs.wsj.com...] [http://online.wsj.com...] In short forcing college on individuals, expecially in these uncertain economic times, is a death sentence. We will plague our students with poor credit, an education that could not be wholly taken advantage of, and next to no possibilities for jobs. Therefore we must allow college to remain a choice to individuals as it has in the past.",

Student loan rates have only been increasing and putting more people into debt. Take this fact for example from ProCon.org: \"Student loan debt often forces college graduates to live with their parents and delay marriage, financial independence, and other adult milestones. According to a 2012 Federal Reserve Study, 30-year-olds who have never taken out a student loan are now more likely to own homes than those who have taken out loans. Auto loans are also trending down at faster rates for those with student debt history than for those without. [35] In 2013, student loan borrowers delayed retirement saving (41%), car purchases (40%), home purchases (29%), and marriage (15%). [38] Less than 50% of women and 30% of men had passed the \"transition to adulthood\" milestones by age 30 (finishing school, moving out of their parents' homes, being financially independent, marrying, and having children); in 1960, 77% of women and 65% of men had completed these milestones by age 30. [39\" Student loans hold people back. And free college is possible. It is very likely in the near future we can have free college. \"The Atlantic.com published an article in Jan 2014 that claimed the federal government would only have to spend \"a mere $62.6 billion dollars\" to make tuition at public colleges free for undergraduates in 2012.\" Sources used: http://college-education.procon.org... http://www.collegerank.net...",

As for your bizarre notion: \"It's legal and it's free money the bank created just for you. It stimulates the economy and gets new money circulated into the system, and doesn't hurt the banks.\" It is not \"free money\". You took money and exchanged it for goods and/or services. Do you honestly think that money just appears? It wasn\"t \"created\" any more than the digital number on your bank machine shows how much money you have in your account. Money isn\"t kept in bank vaults anymore, you\"re right. It\"s a digital notation, but when you click withdraw $60, you still get real money. I\"d appreciate it if you didn\"t insult my intelligence. \"With chapter 7 you can keep your home and your car.\" No, under C. 7, your assets are liquidated to repay a debt. That is the definition. However, under C. 7, in personal bankruptcy, you are allowed to keep certain things called \"Exempt Property\". This law is more lenient in some states. There is always a chance you could lose both your car and your house, depending on their value\"and your state. The bottom line is this: By declaring bankruptcy, you are damaging your chances at success. You are contributing to the debt; to the current state of American economics in a deeply negative way. Even if you emerge scott-free, which is very rare, you are screwing someone over to do it. There is no free lunch, as I like to say. Its capitalism, you work for what you have. You are not given it.

Now, this leads on to more homeless people, and people who rely on charities until they can pay back their loan (presuming they have one). People may say, 'Why don't they just work before going to University', but there is a lack of jobs available. The Government NEEDS to make getting a job ALOT easier. So what other benefits would abolishing tuition fees have? More people will go to University, which makes people get better jobs, wich means they can pay their taxes as they have a good job. Thank you.",

Since 2010 in the United Kingdom tuition fees rose to \u00a39,000 per academic year, equalling a grand total for your typical undergraduate degree \u00a327,000 for tuition alone. This is not counting accommodation and living expenses which should increase your overall borrowing up to \u00a340,000 or more. Those are some rough figures, which if you are applying for university make for some very difficult reading, however, there is a misunderstanding amongst the public and that in 30 years time, all the money you borrowed will be wiped clean. If you borrowed \u00a340,000 from your nearest bank, then they would certainly slap interest on it and it would not certainly be cleared after an extended period of time. You also only start paying the loan back in small instalments if you start earning \u00a321,000 per year, with monthly payments of about \u00a320. If you are lucky enough to be earning \u00a321,000 a year, even \u00a320 a week wouldn't be much loss considering you probably used your degree to get the high paying job in the first place. If you are not so fortunate and you are in a low paying job paying you under \u00a321,000 a year then you pay back nothing. That is right folks, you pay back nothing. Zero. The notion that you will be forever paying off your 'debt' is a weak argument once faced with the actual facts. This enables students to find say part time work during their three years of study to save up for a gap year of travelling, fun and adventures.

            "premise": "The arguments you just stated are wrong. Let me rebut each argument you just made one by one. You just stated that welfare is not the reason the nation is in a lot of debt. Well you're wrong. The government is spending over $400 billion on welfare. The amount of money being spent on welfare is part of the budget deficit. The larger the budget deficit is the more the debt is going to grow. So the amount of money being spent on welfare is part of the reason why the national debt is so high. You said welfare is not free money, that's also wrong. The people who are on welfare get money because they are poor not because they work hard. Giving money to people just to help them out is giving free money. Welfare is free government handouts to people. In regards to people getting dependent on welfare, People do get dependent on welfare because a lot of people on it either don't have a job or don't work a lot because they are already making money. In regards to the government making it easier for people to get a job, The government is definitely capable of doing that because they are capable of fixing the economy. If they fix the economy then it will be easier for people to get a job. Like I said cutting taxes and regulations on businesses will result in businesses having more money and hiring more employees. If a business makes more money then why wouldn't they hire more employees. In order for them to expand they have to hire more employees. You said that Unemployment benefits is not something everyone is entitled to. Well you're right about that but I never said that everyone is entitled to unemployment benefits. I said that unemployment benefits should be for people who are looking for a job. In regards to student loans from the government, The government should gives more loans to poor people who cannot afford to go to college and once they get out of college they should be required to pay back their loans when they get a descent paying job. I never said that it was hard for people to get a student loan or to obtain an education. You stated that some rich people get their wealth from their parents, Well that's true but the rich people that are self made lose a lot of the money they worked hard for in order for the government to fund welfare. In the argument about rich people you were being contradictory. First you said that a small percentage of rich people get their wealth from their parents, then you stated that a large percentage of self made millionaires inherited their wealth from their parents. Well then how are they self made millionaires if they inherited someone else's wealth? that doesn't make sense. Finally, you stated that welfare is short term. Well that is also wrong because there are a lot of people who have been on welfare for a long time. If people are on it for a long time than it's long term welfare, not short term. Welfare should be short term only. Once the person is educated enough to get a descent paying job and finds a job, that person should be off welfare.",

            "premise": "The only harm that you have mentioned is that taxes of the country go out to free universities. Response to that below: 1- If the argument is only about taxes being used to fund free university education then please note, this is not really a harm. Eventually, the purpose of taxes is to be spent for the welfare of the country. You have to show that in countries where university education is free, taxes could have been allocated in areas with greater benefit to the society at large than free university education. 2- My argument in favor of free university education is: It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that every citizen rich or poor is provided equal opportunities to be able to pursue a successful life. The benefits of university or higher education are immense.. Economic benefits to society of higher level education include increased tax revenues, faster economic growth, greater innovation and labour market flexibility, while individuals profit from higher earnings, lower unemployment and higher productivity. Costly university education becomes an impediment for the individual and the society at large to be able to reap these benefits. The cost of obtaining a U.S. degree is among the highest in the world and rising, which burdens local and international students with heavy student loans. The average amount of student loan debt again crept up for the Class of 2013, and is approaching $30,000, according to a new report from the Institute for College Access and Success. In its ninth annual report on student loan debt, TICAS found nearly 7 in 10 graduating seniors in 2013 \" 69 percent \" left school with an average of $28,400 in student loan debt, an increase of 2 percent from 2012. But the amount of student debt and the likelihood of graduating with debt varied greatly between both states and colleges. Some states had average debt amounts as low as $18,656, while others topped $30,000. Between different colleges, average debt amounts ranged from $2,500 to $71,000. Government has a responsibility that citizens are empowered with higher education through a free university education system to start giving back to the society. Students must not have the burden of costly debts over their shoulders for years and years after they graduate.",

However I believe the government and states are doing there best for what they got. Loans and other programs to get student to high end schools would just the nation in more debt. Again like before we as a nation are in debt and it would be a difficult task for the government to make it \"EASY\" for people to get the education they want. The government does have the lower class in their best interest seeing how the Pell grant program has not been cut, despite being one of the top contributors to our debt. The middle class are in a tough situation since it is hard for them to get the finical aid that the lower class gets. College tutition is too expensive but it is just a reflection upon the debt of the nation.",

The US government (US taxpayers) insures home loans to promote home ownership. When you receive a home loan, the federal government steps in and gives the bank the amount of your loan so the bank still has the equity to continue making other loans, but the federal government leaves the bank liable if the loan is not paid. The federal government makes the money to pay for the loans by selling bonds. China owns the largest percent of US bonds owned by any foreign entity. The US federal government owns the largest percent. Britain and Brazil are next in line after China, as far as foreign ownership goes. Owning US bonds actually means you own American debt. The American debt to China is directly linked to (most) American home loans. The American taxpayers are on the hook for that debt. People who've gotten home loans through the \"Finney Mea\", \"Fannie Mae\", and \"Freddie Mac\"programs have caused American debt to go up, and the taxpayers do not get that money back! So ya, people who get home loans are welfare babies!! I'd like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge by the way. Good luck!",

            "conclusion": "The U.S. Government Should Allow the Big Three Automakers to Go Bankrupt",
            "premise": "1. Definitions. For the purposes of this debate, the \"Big Three\" are General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. \"Bankrupt\" is a legal state of financial insolvency whereby (a) stockholders lose all of their equity investment, (b) future contract obligations of the corporation are voided, and (c) creditors are apportioned the corporate assets under court supervision. It is within the scope of the debate to permit modifications to the existing law, a \"special\" bankruptcy, so long as the three provisions of the definition are broadly maintained. Welfare assistance to unemployed workers may be provided by the Government, separate from any bankruptcy. What is at issue is the Government providing loans or grants, a \"bailout.\" to one or more of the Big Three solvent in order to avoid bankruptcy. 2. A bailout would at best postpone inevitable failure. Automobiles can be manufactured profitably in the United States. Foreign-owned automakers such as Toyota have many plants in the U.S., and those plants manufacture profitably. There are two reasons why the Detroit-based Big Three are failing: (a) their labor costs, in Michigan and other northern states, are approximately double that of the plants, mainly in the South, run by foreign manufacturers, and (b) the Big Three has many billions in legacy costs accrued from labor contracts that provide lavish pensions. A bailout will do nothing to remedy these basic problems because the contractual obligations for both will remain intact. Only bankruptcy can remove the continuing obligations. Thus a bailout will ultimately waste the taxpayer's money. \"G.M. has an unfunded liability of $85 billion in today's money to cover future health care costs for workers and retirees. That is seven to eight times the market value of the whole company. ... G.M.'s pension plan has also been a drain. Since 1992, G.M. has plowed $56 billion in stock and cash into it. ...\" http://www.nytimes.com... 3. A bailout will set a precedent whereby Congress will be obliged to bail out other companies that failed in the free market. There are currently 35 automakers in the category of making more than 200,000 vehicles per year, and all of the top 17 sell products in the United States. http://en.wikipedia.org... At a time when there was little international competition, unions demanded high wages and benefits and U.S. automakers granted them. These were extremely unwise decisions that led to failure of the companies. However, in a free market, the companies that cannot compete should fail and cede the market to successful competitors. Having the government subsidize non-competitive companies is a bottomless pit. Even if the bail out were to work, by some miracle, in the auto industry, there would be a very long line of other failing companies demanding equity by receiving a similar bailout. The precedent should be avoided. 4. The impact on U.S. jobs will be less than feared. One may ask why the auto companies in Japan and Germany have decided to build manufacturing plants in the United States. Clearly, the economics favors domestic production. It only favors it, however, when companies have a clean slate in formulating wage and benefit packages and selecting tax-favorable states for operations. Having the Big Three go bankrupt will not change the fundamental economics that favors domestic production. Industry analyst Rich Folts states, \"But because of the weak dollar versus the euro and some of the other currencies around the world, manufacturing may see a resurgence here -- perhaps not in Detroit because it's still high cost, but in other parts of the country such as the Deep South where unions aren't as prevalent. ... Working with global European suppliers, I see a greater emphasis on moving operations to the U.S -- particularly the South. They see the potential to expand because we're still the largest economy in the world. It provides them the opportunity to increase their capacity at a lower cost and be closer to their customers.\" http://www.manufacturing.net... 5. We should not fight the markets. It may be the case that ultimately auto manufacturing will become uneconomic in the United States. It isn't clear because the increased productivity from high tech automation helps compensate for increased labor costs. If that turns out to be the case, then attempting to forestall the inevitable would be a terrible mistake. In 1900, 92% of American jobs were in agriculture. Now it is about 4%, although substantially most food is produced. Suppose the government had, in 1900, decided to do everything possible to keep all of the jobs in agriculture? that isn't the path we should adopt now. We should let the market determine the best allocation of resources. 6. Easing dislocation is a proper government function. There is the potential for substantial economic dislocation during the realignment, however, the resolution allows the government to ease that dislocation. The methods for doing that including a phased selling of the auto company assets to new owners who can profitably keep the production lines running. Also, the government can provide for unemployment benefits and retraining of workers. 7. Industry transitioning can succeed. There is an excellent example of a similar situation. North Carolina was once heavily dependent upon textile manufacturing and tobacco growing. those industries became largely non-competitive. Rather than receiving bailouts, the state successfully transitioned to new industries, including finance, pharmaceuticals, and technology. 8. Conclusion. The government can help the Big Three transition to new ownership under a bankruptcy sale and redeployment of their assets. The union pensions already have billions in funding, and they would get more as creditors in the sale of the assets. The government can also provide aid in unemployment benefits, retraining, and relocation. What the government should not do is waste taxpayer money in a vain attempt to postpone the inevitable.",

            "premise": "Pro: \"The student loan problem just means that the poor and middle class owe more money to the government and are further being harmed.\" Exactly. So any \"trickle down\" just evaporates into an abyss of nothingness. Give a trickle down to someone who is financially bombed, and your trickle down is meaningless. As a matter of fact, it makes all models useless, unless that model includes paying their debt off or giving them enough money to make a difference. If they owe $150,000 in useless debt and we give them $500, the government intercepts their money to help pay the federal student loan debt. They intercept tax refunds, parts of paychecks, and any money owed to them. So...now they owe $149,500. All of these peoples' money is intercepted before they can even see it. People making say, $17 an hour , are living like people making minimum wage or less. Are they contributing to the economy? No. More than 25% of students who take on college debt are graduating with way too much of it, according to experts. And the repercussions could be lifelong. 25% of students are in the situation I described above. Fix this and you fix a giant heap of the economic unbalance in the U.S. today. Imagine if that 25% were not enslaved to the student loan system. How much money would then go directly into the economy? It would make a massive difference. time.com/money/4168510/why-student-loan-crisis-is-worse-than-people-think According to Sheila Bair, the chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis, \"There needs to be more accountability by schools who have been taking advantage of these kids, It makes me very angry.\u201d -The average student loan balance among people with bachelor's degrees has risen from $15,000 in the mid 1990s to about $27,000, according to the Fed. \"This is having a crippling effect on economic activity, says Barbara O'Neill, a specialist in financial resource management for Rutgers University.\" \"A lot of things are being postponed. You've got what you call a crowding out effect. People only have so much money,\" she said. \"There\u2019s a lot of business activity that isn\u2019t taking place ... It\u2019s a drag on everything.\" \"Fewer people are buying homes and cars, O'Neill says, because large portions of their income are being eaten up by student loans. They're also less likely to start the small businesses that provide jobs and services that drive the economy.\" www.businessinsider.com/3-charts-explain-the-effect-of-student-loans-on-the-economy-2015-5 http://www.forbes.com... * Students are having no luck finding jobs except in the service sector industry. For the first time in history, student loan debt now exceeds the total national credit card debt. One in every five young adults between the ages of 18 to 34 are in poverty. economyincrisis.org/content/the-root-cause-for-student-loan-debt * This has a horrible effect on the economy. If graduates are paying back student loans every month, they can\u2019t save up for retirement or a mortgage, or pay off credit cards, financing on vehicles and other debts. They\u2019re unable to spend money at stores, which has a devastating effect on the economy at all levels. \"Trickle down\" theory holds that tax cuts for the wealthy will benefit the whole economy because new wealth at the top will circulate throughout the market and find its way into the pockets of the middle class. It can't find its way to the middle class when it's intercepted to payoff student loan debt that can never be paid off in a lifetime anyway. It trickles down to...the government to try and recover their losses on irresponsible federal lending. The government caused a problem that no current economic model can overcome without the problem being removed or solved. * Supply Side Economics has worked and can work. In the 30 years from the 1980s through the first decade of the new century, supply side economics contributed to the biggest boom in U.S. history. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, \"1982-1999 was one continuous mega economic expansion.\" As it reached into 2007, this 25 Year Boom causef a tripling in the net wealth of U.S. families and businesses from $20 trillion in 1981 to $60 trillion in 2007. When an adjustment was made for inflation, more wealth was created in this 25 year stretch than in the previous 200 years combined. www.laffercenter.com/supply-side-economics",

            "conclusion": "federal tuition assistance should be restricted much more",
            "premise": "Hold on a minute, this argument is not over whether a university degree is a right; it\"s over whether or not it should be subsidized by the government. To answer the question over why college should be subsidized, it follows as such: as education becomes more necessary, the government subsidizes it to make it easier to attend. This precedence was set in the 1840s when the government started organizing and paying for school for students who attended, because an elementary education was necessary then (and those without the means to attend would only be able to if school was subsidized). As secondary education such as high school became necessary, the government funded this too. The argument for it is that schooling would improve citizenship and produce the leadership needed for modernization (Jurgen Herbst). As a post-secondary education becomes more necessary as the nation develops further (I\"ll get into that later), the government has (and will continue to) follow the precedent set. Students without the means to attend college through no fault of their own are able to attend by federal and state grant money. This allows them to both become better leaders and better citizens, as well as being able to get a decent paying job. Now to get to the issue over whether college is necessary, since you obviously want to debate that, I\"ll point to the brilliant Robert B. Reich. According to his article, \"Why College Is Necessary But Gets You Nowhere\", he notes that \"\"people with college degrees continue to earn far more than people without them.\" College not only allows people a higher paying job, but it gives higher job security and increases the chances that a person will have the tools necessary in today\"s world to succeed. I need only point to the Bureau of Labor Statistics graph on http://ygraph.com... to prove this is true. While it is true that it is not as easy as it once was to get a job with a college degree, it\"s still much easier to get employment with a degree than without. Classes in college are both more condensed and more efficient than a high school education. My son is an engineer at a university, all of his classes are relevant to engineering, and he cannot get an engineering education at a trade school. Trade school and college both have their merits, but they are vastly different from each other. Some people cut out for college are not for trade school, and vice versa. The reason college is able to combat poverty is only because of government subsidy. There is a cap on the amount of loans someone is able to take without a cosigner, and if one\"s parents are in poverty, there may not be a cosigner to be found. Loans are both problematic and inefficient for this purpose, as some institutions are greedy, sell a student\"s debt to a collector, or change the interest rates without warning. I noticed that you\"re arguing two arguments that are mutually exclusive. In the first round, you mentioned that you actually want to restrict the amount of LOANS given. This is counter to your argument in round two, where you state that college doesn\"t combat poverty. By restricting loans to people only in the top bracket in their high school, you exclude people who cannot excel in high school due to issues at home. Furthermore, some people mature after high school and benefit from education then when they didn\"t do so well in high school. In closing for this round, I\"d like to assert that college combats poverty and increases chances to be employed over just a high school education. I point to all my sources to make this assertion. Some people may go into debt after college, but subsidies such as grants help to alleviate this problem and reduce the scale of student debt. Welfare isn\"t always the most glorious option for people who are working hard to earn their money, but student welfare is very useful in making productive members of society, and this has been proven time and time again.

            "premise": "Thanks Con. DEFENSE1) Students have no moneyCon misrepresents her source's statistics. While her source[3] says that a typical student gets 23% of their college fee from loans, she misrepresents it and says that 23% of students take loans. There is a huge difference. 47% of all families reported borrowing to pay for college. So, we know free transport would benefit at least half the college students because they are in debt. The average college graudate has a debt of $19,000 [4]. The already high price of tuition continues to increase [5]. Con says the debt hasn't affected them yet but it will. Students cannot increase their debt by buying cars or paying full price for public transport every day because it will snowball once they graduate. They need every sort of free service they can get.Unemployed people might have low money as well but their requirement for transportation is lower than that of college student as I show in point 2. Lower income people are able to work full time so despite their hourly wage being lower, they can earn more cash than college students and also don't have a staggering amount of debt. Paying for a car or transportation necessitates that students work longer hours. College students working more than 20 hours a week on campus or off negatively affects students' academic performance [6]. College students should be allowed to focus on their academics by having transportation taken care of.2) RequirementPeople who have jobs will be able to afford cars or at least be able to afford public transport by paying the full price. College students have a large amount of debt and limited time to work and so have a higher need for free transportation. They also need to travel far more frequently to class and back than someone who is just unemployed. My opponent says her school provides free transportation. My school on the other hand just cancelled the service[1]. Instead they work with the county's public transport agency to provide free transport to students. The ability of a University to provide transport is unreliable but if they work with their state, it is far more reliable as it is funded by the government. 3) Pay after graduation Taxes are used for many purposes, not all of which benefit the person paying the taxes. For example, if part of your taxes are being used to construct freeways, but you don't have a car and never use the freeways, can you legitimately complain that it is an \"unfair financial transaction\" or that it is \"theft\"? Taxes are meant to benefit society as a whole and this is a great way to give benefits to people who need them.4) University owes themPart of the reason students pay such a large amount of money to Universities is not just for tuition but for the facilities the University offers. My school [1] works with the public transport agancy and makes a deal with them for students to be allowed to ride free at taxpayer's expense. Universities should be doing this in all counties because this is a facility that is really needed.REBUTTAL1) Other uses Con would rather use taxpayers money for Social Security and debt. Carpooling, she says, is good for the evironment. Public transport is actually better since more people will use a bus than can fit into a car. Public transportation also saves 1.4 billion gallons of gas a year [2]. This would actually help pay the US debt on oil. Walking may be good for health but people cannot realistically walk long distances to class.2) Increased useCon says free transportation would increase use to the point of being too expensive. Not the case if only college students are given free transportation. The same number of buses need to be run and they only need to accept enough people until they are full. In Riverside, California, college students ride for free [1] and there is no problem of overloading as the public transport is still running (though University operated transport closed for unrelated budget reasons).

            "premise": "Your argument doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me. I fail to see the connection between the student loan crisis and supply side economics working? Even if there were no more student loans owned to the government, the rich would still keep most of that extra money. The student loan problem just means that the poor and middle class owe more money to the government and are further being harmed. Reaganomics is not ineffective because of the student loan crisis. It is just an ineffective policy from the start. There really isn\u2019t a whole lot more to it. Like I\u2019ve said, Reaganomics is based on a flawed argument. Give more to the rich and they will spend it in a way that benefits the economy as a whole. That hasn\u2019t happened. We haven\u2019t seen noticeable job growth. We have seen wealth inequality and the national debt skyrocket. I feel like I can\u2019t hammer this point enough. \u201cTrickle down\u201d economics was just a big scam to enrich the already rich.Please explain to me how supply side economics working and the student loan crisis are connected. The supply side approach did not work in the 1920s and we didn't have a student loan problem back then. So, why would it work today even without a student loan crisis? Here are some more rebuttals: 1. \u201cBut not for them. Why? It's all politics. The Democratic Party is notorious for pushing slavery. Why? It humors the masses on the left. Pander to them and keep power.\u201dThe Republican Party may have been the party that fought for civil rights for African Americans in the mid 1800s. However, a century later, which party fought for civil rights for African Americans? The Democrat Party. Lyndon B. Johnson (a Democrat) signed legislation granting African Americans civil rights while many Republicans opposed the idea. Is it a surprise that African Americans have shifted their support from the Republican Party to the Democrat Party? Political parties evolve. The Democrat Party may have supported slavery at one point, but that\u2019s not how it is today. Although I\u2019m not a huge fan of either of our two major parties, look at how much the Republican Party does for the rich. \u201cTrickle down\u201d economics is basically socialism for the rich. The GOP has to sell \u201ctrickle down\u201d economics. So, the Republican Party still has to promote propaganda to get support. Look at all the right wing propaganda out there. Fox News is perhaps the most notable, but there are others out there. They try to sell a lot of the Republican beliefs that are there to keep the rich in power. Why does the GOP support Reaganomics? To keep the rich in power. Why does the GOP support cutting entitlement programs? Because it\u2019s a part of the interests of the wealthy. It\u2019s not because of fiscal responsibility. I find it funny how the Republicans blast the Democrats for spending too much on entitlement programs when they cut taxes on the rich and expand the military to the point where they too run colossal budget deficits. They are trying to appeal to the masses so that why they don\u2019t figure out that they are truly trying to keep the rich in power. Of course, I don\u2019t see the Democrat Party as the big hero either. They too have gone corporate as well. But, the Republican Party does it to a much larger extent. Why else is Reaganomics one of the core Republican beliefs? As Thom Hartmann would say, there are two types of Republicans, rich people and suckers. 2. \u201cI think that if you get control of the insanity of student loan debt, you make the usage of Supply Side Economics more viable.\"Supply side economics and the student loan crisis are two different problems. Even if nobody had student loan debt, supply side economics would not work. The rich would still get richer and the poor would still get poorer. I would say that the amount of debt that students are graduating college with is a problem. A lot of college graduates are sitting around looking for a job yet can\u2019t find one. But even if college was free, the middle class would still be getting pissed on by Reaganomics. 3. \u201cOnce the balance becomes stable, I believe Supply Side economics can do fine.\u201dBut how would supply side economics work if we didn\u2019t have the student loan crisis to deal with? I don\u2019t see the connection between the two. The rich would still have extra money and not much of that money would be put back into the economy. Income inequality would still be high without the student loan crisis. The nation would still be trillions of dollars in the hole (because we\u2019d still have tax breaks for the wealthy, unnecessary wars, and Wall Street bailouts to pay for). Student loans are not the primary reason why the poor and middle class are struggling these days. 4. \u201cThey had went to school, tried to get an education and now are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and they can never pay it back. Can they buy a house? No. Can they take trips? No. Can they buy stuff? No. So guess what. That money is not going back into the economy.\u201dNot all poor and middle class people have student loan debt. If those without student loan debt had that extra money, they most certainly would be able to put it back into the economy. Although we have a student loan problem, there are still a considerable number of students that have found jobs and are paying back their student loans. In fact, more students are in that position than are not. A lot of students are making progress on their student loans. If they had extra money, they would spend it. At least if a poor or middle class person has extra money, there is a very high chance it will be pumped back into the economy. Even paying back student loans could be considered \u201cpumping it back into the economy.\u201d Give extra money to a rich person and it will more likely than not just sit there. Look where the tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation have got us. Trillions of dollars on the national debt can be accounted for by giving the rich a tax break (because tax breaks for the rich can basically be seen as an expense). GDP growth is said to be slower when the wealthy have more money. We had a recession caused by the deregulation of Wall Street. The poor and middle class are being pissed on by this economic policy. I think that when you mention student loans, you are thinking of a separate issue. I would agree that the amount of loans that students need to take out for college is insane (being more liberal on the fiscal side of things) but I would not agree that this would allow supply side economics to work. How would it? I fail to see the connection. Tell me how this is related. The rich would still get richer regardless of if there was a student loan crisis or not. The student loan crisis only further hurts working class and middle class people. It is not the sole cause of the struggling poor and middle class we see today. 5. \u201cBut any \"trickling down\" that happens is pointless if those recieving it cando nothing with it.\u201dBut a lot of poor and middle class recipients of that extra money would put it back into the economy. Even if they did use it to pay off student loans, it would still be a benefit to them because they would have less debt to worry about. The poor and middle class have been forgotten in this day and age, and any little bit of money you give them will make their lives better, even if it\u2019s by a bit. I consider paying off student loans putting the money back into the economy. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s sitting there under one\u2019s mattress. A lot of people who are poor and middle class don\u2019t have any or much of any student loans. There are older adults out there who could use that extra money. They would probably spend it. They could use it. At least there\u2019s a good chance it will be pumped back into the economy if you give it to a poor or middle class person. It\u2019s a lot better than giving it to a rich person who will just let it sit there. Rich people already have a lot of the things they, so why do they need to spend more? There is no \u201ctrickling down\u201d if a rich person just keeps onto that money. 6. \u201cThey are fighting to make it, they do their taxes, they get a tax return of $5,000.\u201dWhat if they don\u2019t have student loan debt or are doing fine with their student loans? Then they could use that money to buy other things. This would create demand. If we create enough demand, a business owner would have to hire more people to keep up with the demand. Even if they did spend it on their student loan, it would be better than a rich person just keeping onto it. If they do pay off their student loan, good for them. This would further benefit the poor and middle class. If a rich person gets a large tax return, where does the money go? It typically just sits there. What part of the sector would\u2019ve made money then? What would the economy have seen? Where is the \u201ctrickle?\"More sources: 1) http://www.foreffectivegov.org... 2) http://www.pewresearch.org... 3) http://www.alternet.org...",

            "conclusion": "The costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting.BenefitsAs the majority of this debate will come down to weighing costs versus benefits, we first must know the benefits of a college education. \"Properly using the present value of the lifetime earnings, adjusted for the cost of going to college and the difference in the number of working years, and excluding those graduates with advanced degrees, calculated and the three percent discount rate used in the report produces a lifetime earnings differential of only $279,893 for a bachelors degree versus a high school degree.\" (http://www.insidehighered.com...) (his actual report can be downloaded here: http://chronicle.com...)Monetary Costs\"This year, according to the College Board, average published in-state tuition and fee plus room/board charges exceed $17,000 at four-year public institutions.\" (http://www.cnn.com...) At four year private institutions, this number is roughly $11,500 annually. (in the Charles Miller report). Students are forced finance these costs with large loans, resulting in a student loan debt of tens of thousands of dollars by graduation. \"Two-thirds of bachelor\u2019s degree recipients graduated with debt in 2008, compared with less than half in 1993. Last year, graduates who took out loans left college with an average of $24,000 in debt.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...) The effect of this debt goes far beyond decreasing the lifetime earnings of a college graduate. Collegeboard now reports that the average age by which student loan debt is paid back stands at 33. (http://www.soundmindinvesting.com...). This greatly limits what can be done by graduates within the first 11 years of their working life. \"College graduates and postgraduates, instead of buying cars, buying houses, getting married, having children\u2014in other words, becoming full-fledged consumers are, as Nance-Nash puts it, \u201crunning back home.\u201d That hurts us all.\" (http://chronicle.com...) Opportunity CostTo show that opportunity cost outweighs the monetary benefits of a college education, one must show that there is a better way to spend the money which can not be achieved by going to college. This can be done fairly easily with investing potential. Using the average savings rates, cost of college tuition, student loan interest rates, and investment returns, an individual who invests their college fund instead of spending it will earn $1.3 million by the age of 65. A typical four year college graduate \"will have less than a third of that.\" (http://www.nypost.com...) There are other, similar methods of investment, all of which will result in more money than a college education.Another form of opportunity cost is the 4-6 years of lost job experience while attending college. With more and more job opportunities opening for those without college degrees, the 4-6 years of additional training and chances for promotion may very well outweigh the $279,893 monetary benefit of college. This job experience can also be gained while investing in the previous scenario. Shrinking Benefits of a College EducationRecent graduates, which excludes graduates over the age of 25 who where able to find a job before the economic downturn, now have roughly the same unemployment rate as non-degree holders. \"Over the past year, for example, the unemployment rate for college grads under age 25 has averaged 9.2 percent, up from 8.8 percent a year earlier and 5.8 percent in the first year of the recession that began in December 2007. That means recent grads have about the same level of unemployment as the general population. It also suggests that many employed recent grads may be doing work that doesn\u2019t require a college degree.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...) The majority of college graduates that do find a job are often underemployed, working as waiters food-service helpers. \"More than half of America's recent college graduates are either unemployed or working in a job that doesn't require a bachelor's degree, the Associated Press reported this weekend... According to the Census, the number of Americans under the age of 25 with at least a bachelor's degree has grown 38 percent since 2000. Not nearly enough jobs have been created to accommodate them, which has resulted in falling wages for young college graduates in the past decade, as well as the employment problems we're now seeing.\" (http://www.theatlantic.com...) With food preparation and service receiving the largest job growth between 2000 and 2010, the job opportunities for non-degree holders are only increasing. In fact, \"among the top 10 with respect to actual job growth, 3 will require a postsecondary degree and only 1 will require a BA.\" (http://www.educationalpolicy.org...) The Risks of Attending CollegeThe risk one takes while attaining their college degree is the most important cost to be considered in this debate. These two risks, defaulting on student loan debt and dropping out, go hand in hand.In the United States, only 46% of all students who started college managed to complete it. \"The \"Pathways to Prosperity\" study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2011 shows that just 56 percent of college students complete four-year degrees within six years.\" (http://www.reuters.com...) College dropouts are forced to pay back their debt, but without the benefits of receiving a college degree. Dropouts gain a very minimal increase in wages, and spend years of their lives with nothing to show for it except debt.Default rates are also abysmally high. 19.2% of \"borrowers who graduated with a certificate from a for-profit, less-than-four-year institution\" defaulted on their student loans. (http://www.educationsector.org...) \"A recent study by the Institute for Higher Education Policy found that for every borrower who defaults, at least two more fall behind in payments. The study found that only 37 percent of borrowers who started repaying their student loans in 2005 were able to pay them back fully and on time.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...) Student debt overall has now reached over $1 trillion, more than credit card debt. (http://www.theatlantic.com...) With student loans unable to be forgiven through bankruptcy, and with defaulting resulting in tax refunds being offset and wages being garnished, a college education is a high-risk, low-benefit investment.",

Without the weight of student loan debt, more college graduates might buy houses rather than renting apartments. They might buy cars, spend more on healthy food, travel more: In essence, they could contribute more to the economy & by negating the large bill of a college education, we could see an increase in the amount of students able to attend college.

My point simply put is that loans and subsidies are inferior to other forms of government controlled health care, I have put forth the argument that subsidies and loans will in the end shift the burden of payment onto those that cannot afford it and this in turn will increase the income to debt ratio of the populace.

            "premise": "I feel like this has been a discussion about student loans more so than Reaganomics. Both of us seem to agree that student loan debt is a big problem. But, where we disagree is supply side economics. What I\u2019ve been trying to say is that more often than not, money given to poor and middle class people will be put back into the economy. Those who are defaulting on their student loans are a minority (although a noticeable one). Most of them would spend the money on something else since they are already paying off their student loans. If you give that money to a rich person, that money will just sit there and not be pumped back into the economy. The GOP claims that their platform will create jobs and opportunities for all. However, in reality, all it does is enrich the already rich. Look at all their corporate donors (I realize that Democrats have them too). Is it a surprise that they are trying to make them richer? You would expect them to serve those who are funding their campaigns first. If rich people are donating tons of money to their campaigns, then they are going to serve the interests of the rich. That\u2019s why the GOP continues Reaganomics. Do you seriously believe that they are going to look out for the average person before their campaign donors? The Republican Party is the party of the rich. A lot of what you see promoting Reaganomics is corporate propaganda. The myth that wealth \u201ctrickles down\u201d has been debunked so many times. Why doesn\u2019t it work? I feel like I can\u2019t say this enough, but it fails because the more wealth that goes to the top (and stays there), the less wealth that\u2019s available for the middle class so less demand is created. This actually harms job growth, and this makes sense given studies done on it. Please, tell me how fixing the student loan problem will enable supply side economics to work. I\u2019m still waiting for an answer. Wouldn\u2019t that wealth just stay at the top? Why would the rich spend it if the poor and middle class aren\u2019t burdened by student loans? I don\u2019t get it. So, when can we expect to see a \u201ctrickle?\u201d If the poor and middle class are supposed to benefit from supply side economics, then when will that happen? Why hasn\u2019t it happened now? You\u2019re telling me that supply side economics is supposed to benefit the economy as a whole. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. The rich just pocket that extra money and don\u2019t spend it because they don\u2019t need to. What creates jobs is demand, and that\u2019s how we benefit the economy as a whole. Cutting taxes on the rich decreases demand due to an increase in wealth inequality. Give it to people that would actually need it and you would see it pumped back into the economy. You\u2019ve been arguing that this won\u2019t happen because many are burdened by student loans. Although a noticeable minority is drowning in their student loan debt, many people would still be able to pump it back into the economy because they would need to spend it on other things. Most graduates do end up finding a job and paying off their student loans in a timely manner.I know that I intended this round to be a conclusion of our overall arguments, but I feel like I would just be repeating what I\u2019ve said before. So, I\u2019m going to do some more rebuttals. 1. \u201cExactly. So any \"trickle down\" just evaporates into an abyss of nothingness. Give a trickle down to someone who is financially bombed, and your trickle down is meaningless.\u201d But, as I\u2019ve told you, a lot of people are already paying off their student loans in a timely manner, so if they were given extra money they would probably spend it on something else. There are also quite a bit of poor and middle class people that don\u2019t even have student loans to pay back (either because they never got them or already paid them off). So, a lot of that money would actually be pumped back into the economy. Don\u2019t you think that student loans are a separate problem? If we elect someone like Bernie Sanders, maybe something will be done about the problem of sky high college costs. I would agree that college costs are out of control these days and that we must do something. High college costs further burden the poor and middle class. But, look at what Reaganomics has done to them. Wealth inequality and the national debt have exploded. GDP growth is said to have been slowed down. Like I\u2019ve been saying, if you give a rich person money, he or she won\u2019t have the urge to go out and spend it. Why? Because he or she will not need to. So, you won\u2019t see a trickle giving the money to the rich people, so why do it? At least giving money to poor and middle class people actually help them. They need it given the conditions of the economy today. 2. \u201cIf they owe $150,000 in useless debt and we give them $500, the government intercepts their money to help pay the federal student loan debt. They intercept tax refunds, parts of paychecks, and any money owed to them. So...now they owe $149,500.\u201d What if that person is working on paying off the student loan debt? The government doesn\u2019t just take any money they acquire to pay off the student loan if they are already paying on it. If one defaults on the loan, then that could happen. Although a considerable number of people are burdened by student loans and may never pay them off, a lot of people are successfully paying them off. Remember that most people who graduate college do end up getting jobs. Those that do get jobs and pay off student loans are pumping that money back into the economy. 3. \u201cHow much money would then go directly into the economy? It would make a massive difference.\u201d So, aren\u2019t you admitting that giving money to poor and middle class people does go back into the economy (assuming they aren\u2019t drowning in debt)? Then why not fix the student loan problem and give them more money? Or, at the very least, why not give them more money? It would help them and in many cases it would go back into the economy. More often than not it would be put back into the economy. It\u2019s better than giving it to a rich person as it will not be pumped back into the economy. This wasn\u2019t intended to be an argument about student loans. It was intended to be an argument about Reaganomics. What I\u2019m trying to say is that when you give more money to the rich, it doesn\u2019t get invested back into the economy, so what is the point? To make them even richer? Isn\u2019t wealth inequality high enough these days? 4. \u201cThis has a horrible effect on the economy. If graduates are paying back student loans every month, they can\u2019t save up for retirement or a mortgage, or pay off credit cards, financing on vehicles and other debts. They\u2019re unable to spend money at stores, which has a devastating effect on the economy at all levels.\u201d It does but remember we are debating Reaganomics, not student loans. If a graduate is paying off his or her student loans, don\u2019t you think that he or she could use some extra money? Don\u2019t you think that he or she would pump it back into the economy by saving up for a mortgage, car, or whatever? Wouldn\u2019t that money be pumped back into the economy? Remember that most graduates are paying off their student loans, so any money would be beneficial. 5. \"Trickle down\" theory holds that tax cuts for the wealthy will benefit the whole economy because new wealth at the top will circulate throughout the market and find its way into the pockets of the middle class. But that new wealth at the top doesn\u2019t circulate throughout the market. It just stays concentrated at the top. Look at the increase in wealth inequality since the 1980s. You will see that the rich just continue to get richer. All that money that they are keeping is not helping the economy as a whole. Why? Because the rich don\u2019t pump that money back into the economy. They have no need to. Do you see the connection? 6. \u201cIn the 30 years from the 1980s through the first decade of the new century, supply side economics contributed to the biggest boom in U.S. history.\u201d But that prosperity went to those at the top. Average Americans did not get a huge share of all the prosperity that was created. Look at how that economic boon ended. It ended in a crash caused by the deregulation of Wall Street. Millions lost their jobs and homes. So, was all the economic growth for those at the top worth it considering it ended up being a disaster for the poor and middle class in the end?

            "discussionTitle": "People who get home loans are welfare babies!",
            "conclusion": "People who get home loans are welfare babies!",
            "premise": "https://en. M. Wikipedia. Org/wiki/Mortgage_industry_of_the_United_States. The US \"mortgage industry\" is not a legitimate private business endeavor, It requires government assistance for it to work. Our commitment to promote home ownership is directly tied to our ever accumulating national debt. Home loans are not a risky investment, They're a BAD investment. It doesn't make sense for a private lender to tie up hundreds of thousands of dollars for thirty years, Only to get back chump change. Before the stock market crash in 1929, Banks were weary about home loans. Most home loans were 3 to 7 year loans, Which made it very difficult to fit the criteria to be qualified for a home loan. Back then, Homeowner loan recipients just paid the minimum balance in the hope that they could save up enough money to make the final payment which was a large sum because all the interest had accrued up till then. It was known as the \"bullet payment\". After the crash of '29 (which, One could argue was caused by a housing bubble), Privately owned banks ceased to lend for homeowners. In an effort to promote home ownership, The FDR administration created government programs to help private banks be competitive in the housing market (Finnie Mea, Fannie Mae, And Freddie Mac). This initiative was part of FDRs new deal, Or \"alphabet soup\" agenda. When you receive a home loan today, The federal government steps in and gives the bank the amount of your loan, So the bank will have the equity to continue making other loans, But they make the banks liable for delinquent loans. For the federal government to be able to raise the revenue to do that, They sell bonds. It's a common misconception to think that the US debt to China is caused by a trade deficit, But this is not true. Although we do have a trade deficit with China, This does not cause our ever accumulating national debt, It just means the US imports more goods than it exports. Our national debt to China, And any other foreign country, And our own federal government, Is in the form of bonds. Https://www. Thebalance. Com/u-s-debt-to-china-how-much-does-it-own-3306355. Our commitment to promote home ownership causes our national debt to increase. In 2007 the housing bubble burst and people with homeloans were \"under water\". This means that they were paying more for their monthly payments than what their house was worth. Jobs were lost all around the country which exacerbated the situation which in turn, Caused more people to become delinquent with their loans. It came to a point where the federal government had to begin to pardon people for not being able to make their payments. The housing crises was directly caused by our artificial housing market, And their is no garauntee that it won't happen again. It is my firm belief that their should be NO housing market. If privately owned banks don't want to make loans without government assistance, Than that's not my problem. If homeownership ceases to exist, Except for the those who can afford a home outright, Than so be it. I challenge my opponent to prove that the constitution guarantees homeloans for the middle class, Or middle class wanabees. The US is the only country on earth that subsidizes housing for the middle class. It has only proven to be a burden on taxpayers and has caused an economic meltdown (it's probably caused more than one economic meltdown). The homeloan initiatives started by the FDR administration actually causes housing prices to increase. The demand for homeownership goes up when more people are able to obtain a loan for a home. An increase in demand, Causes an increase in price. If the homeownership initiatives were cut from the budget and people were no longer able to get loans, The demand for homes would decrease, Which would cause a drastic drop in home prices. Cutting those programs would cause taxes to go down. It would also curb urban sprawl. As an American taxpayer, I consider the burden of homeloan subsidies to be even less ethical than welfare programs for the disabled because disabled citizens actually need government assistance, But nobody needs a house to survive, You can get by with an apartment like the rest of us! This is my opponents first debate on this site, And I thank him for accepting my debate as his first challenge. Good luck to you",

            "premise": "David Lat. \"In Defense of Going to Law School.\" Above the Law. July 13th, 2010: \"4. Not everyone graduates with debt (or with as much debt as some people think). I was lucky enough to graduate law school debt-free; my parents paid for my college and law school. And I\u2019m not alone. According to the Law School Survey of Student Engagement (figure 7), over 10 percent of law students will graduate with zero debt, and another 5 percent or so will graduate with less than $20,000 in student loans. So somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of law school graduates leave school with little to no debt \u2014 and a valuable professional degree to show for their efforts. There are several reasons why perhaps a fifth of law school graduates have little or no debt. Some have parents, grandparents or spouses who are willing to help out with educational costs. Some have savings from pre-law-school careers, in lucrative fields such as finance or consulting. And some attend reasonably priced state schools and/or receive very generous scholarship money. The dean of one top 25 law school told me earlier this year that about two-thirds of his school\u2019s students receive some form of scholarship aid from the school. [...] So the 'sticker price' of law school, in terms of the cost you see on the law school website or in brochures, can be misleading. Many students aren\u2019t paying full freight \u2014 and many of the students who are paying full freight can afford to.\"",

            "premise": "Okay round 2 you decided to go by key terms. Which is fine it just not what i really wanted to hear. Why because when your title says \"The growth of the national debt, if not stopped, will bankrupt the nation\". I want to know why, when and how it going to bankrupt up the nation. I know some of the key terms you mention are important such as Federal revenue, Mandatory spending, Debt service, Deficit, Discretionary spending. And yes they are important but failed to mention the WHEN part. The When the part is very important because you failed to mention how long does this deficit have to go on before it actually starts to hit the economy. Most of the experts think this deficit won't affect us too much just our kid's children, to their children and grandchildren. The debt-to-GDP ratio is important to understand as well... \"The debt-to-GDP ratio compares a country's sovereign debt to its total economic output for the year. Its output is measured by gross domestic product\". (1.) https://www.thebalance.com... This ratio is used as a tool for investors, leaders, and economists. \"It allows them to gauge a country's ability to pay off its debt. A high ratio means a country isn't producing enough to pay off its debt. A low ratio means there is plenty of economic output to make the payments\". (2.) https://www.thebalance.com... \" The estimations establish a threshold of 77 percent public debt-to-GDP ratio. If the debt is above this threshold, each additional percentage point of debt costs 0.017 percentage points of annual real growth. The effect is even more pronounced in emerging markets where the threshold is 64 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. In these countries, the loss in annual real growth with each additional percentage point in public debt amounts to 0.02 percentage points. The cumulative effect on real GDP could be substantial. Importantly, the estimations control for other variables that might impact growth, such as the initial level of per-capita-GDP\". (3.) https://elibrary.worldbank.org... The best element an investor has is the faith in a government's solvency is the yield on its debt. When yields are low, that means there is a lot of demand for its debt. It doesn't have to pay as high a return. The United States has been fortunate in this regard. During the Great Recession, investors fled to U.S. debt. It is considered ultra-safe. As the global economy continues to improve, investors will be comfortable with higher risk because they want higher returns. Yields on U.S. debt will rise asdemand falls. \"The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is 104 percent. But that's not a critical for a country which can issue debt in its own currency. The United States can simply print more dollars to pay off the debt. For this reason, the risk of default is very low\".(4.) https://www.thebalance.com... Debt service reserves are cash assets that are designated by a borrower to ensure full and timely payments to bondholders. Debt Service Reserve Funds (DSRF) have been used for many years by private businesses and public entities to support debt issues. Look at the economy is doing great. The job market doing well, the private sector is going well, the economy is building new business, and the housing market is going well. And not just here but globally. So, the national debt is over 20 and a half trillion dollar right now. That doesn't matter much it could go over 30 or 50 trillion and it won't matter too much. As long the economy is going well, and the federal reserves keep on printing money out. It will not affect this generation too negative. It just a number and that all it is. You say the National debt going to bankrupt up the nation. If that is true, When? and why does it matter to this generation?",

Seeing on the Debt.org website, an organization dedicated to aiding in college grads debt, that \"...college graduates are left with a diploma and an enormous financial burden of credit card and student loan debt \" and maybe no job in sight\". Especially focusing not just on these student's debt but also how they may not be able to even find jobs. In order for this economy to flourish we need a stable working class, but if the majority are jobless and in debt our country will plummet.

            "conclusion": "College students should have access to free public transportation at taxpayers expense.",
            "premise": "-- REBUTTAL -- 1. College students have very little money. Pro explains, \"Most college students have taken student loans or had their parents take mortgages on their house to pay for college tuition, rent, food and textbooks.\" This is factually inaccurate and misleading. First, 1/3 of college students have their costs completely covered by their parents' income and savings. An additional 45% cover costs via their own savings, assistance from relatives, grants, scholarships and with help from parent borrowing [1]. While 23% do take out loans, the student is not obligated to pay back those loans until they are finished with school. As such, it doesn't make sense to reference student debt (which is obsolete until graduation) as a reason for them being financially challenged, because it hasn't affected them yet. Moreover, college students are not the only demographic with \"very little money.\" People who work low-income jobs or who are unemployed have little to no money -- why should transportation not be free for them? This is especially true once you consider the following: people with low-income jobs ARE tax payers, therefore Pro is suggesting that these people (often far less well off than college students) pay for other people's rides despite being similarly or even more disadvantaged. Additionally, many college students in fact hold jobs, meaning they are not necessarily struggling more than others. In fact, almost 80% of college students work on average 30 hours per week - almost full time [2]! Therefore, it makes no sense to suggest that college students deserve this special privilege based on how much money they have in comparison with other demographics. 2. Students have a huge requirement for transportation. Many transportation services already provide discounts, but most importantly, it would be Pro's burden to explain why students have a higher need than anyone else, particularly others with or who are looking for jobs. Additionally, many colleges already provide methods of free transportation for students. My school provides buses that take students not only through the campuses to get to class, but even through the city where the school is located to various other convenient checkpoints. There are also free shuttles that essentially act as cabs in some instances [3]. 3. Students would pay for it after graduation.That is not a fair exchange; people will likely pay a disproportionate amount to what they \"owe\" based on use. A fair financial transaction is one based on a mutual agreement. It should be up to the person paying whether or not they accept a service or good in exchange for payment. Some students with cars will not need this \"free\" transportation, yet wind up paying for others to use the service through taxes. That is equivalent to theft. 4. The university owes them. This contention is irrelevant considering Pro wants the tax payers and not the school to fund the transportation. I also disagree with Pro's bare assertion that it is up to the university to alleviate financial burdens for the student as much as possible; they have their own agenda. -- ARGUMENTS -- In addition to what I've already argued above in my rebuttal, 1. There are more important or useful things we could put tax payer money toward than free transportation; i.e., our debt, social security or other flailing aspects of our economy. Additionally, many people would still find a way to get places such as carpooling or walking and biking places, which contributes toward good personal and environmental health. 2. Free transportation would increase use, thereby necessarily drastically increase the cost of providing the service (i.e., more buses, trains, drivers, gas, electricity, etc.) to alleviate demand. It would be FAR too expensive to maintain, and create another huge tax payer drain. -- SOURCES --http://www.debate.org...",

            "conclusion": "The United States National Debt is the Amount of Money the United States has Created not Borrowed",
            "premise": "Thanks for the solid debate... This is a very confusing subject and my wording may not always be perfect, but my opponent is taking this conversation to a place that I did not want it to go. The money supply, whatever you want to call it, Monetary Base, M1, M2, M3, should not be used in this debate. We are talking about Government created money, M2 uses all deposits in banks including loans. Loans are not created from Government spending, loans are created by banks. So anyone reading this debate should disregard any attempts by the opponent to correlate M2 money supply with the National Debt. ==Should we exclude intragovernmental debt from debt measurements?== My opponent is misinterpreting the accounting involved that represents our nations debt. Intragovernmental debt is simply a number that records how much surplus the Govt has taken from it's Govt programs + interest paid on the pieces of paper they give themselves. If one understands accounting they can see where I am coming from in saying that intragovernmental does not add to net spending, it adds to net debt by way of accounting. Here is a simple example of what is going on with intragovernmental debt. The Govt taxes $1000 for Social Security The Govt pays $800 for Social Security The Govt now has a surplus of $200. In accounting terms the Govt has debited $200 from the nonbank publics accounts. The Govt then invests that $200 in themselves. In return they give themselves a piece of paper that says we owe this $200 + interest back. Now those of you who can think outside the box, what is really going on here? The Govt is giving themselves the $200 to spend and replacing it with a piece of paper. There is no \"new\" money created in this process... only debt. Clinton used this process (which is mandated by law) to reduce the public portion of the debt. But all he did was replace public debt with intragovernmental debt, which is why the overall debt did not decrease. So the money is still backed by debt, just a new form of debt. And when the intragovernmental debt get's \"paid off\" it will simply be converted back to public debt. So I therefore maintain my assertion that the Government still creates money through deficit spending and that your tax dollars can not be used to pay off the National Debt. My opponent is using a situation in which debt was used to replace debt, but he is focusing on just one side of the equation. Let me go through some points my opponent made and go through my refutation. 1) My opponent says \"Say what you want about the money supply, but if you believe that all cash is created by debt, you CANNOT believe that there would ever be more money in circulation than debt.\" ---------------------------------------------- My opponent is simply missing a HUGE piece of the puzzle. Bank loans are created by banks. And banks can create a lot more loans then there is money created by the Govt. In accounting terms bank loans are a wash and they are not even relevant to this discussion on Govt debt. So if you understand fractional reserve banking, you can understand how there can be more money in the money supply then there is debt (which the reserves are included in). What I like to say is that banks leverage Government money... but the Govt has to spend more money in order for the banks to be able to leverage more. ---------------------------------------------- 2) This is very important for those reading this debate to make sure you understand. My opponent erroneously says \"First, how does $11 billion of gold at current value (what the Fed lists on their website) turn into $473 billion in value. I think my opponent changed $11 billion in gold to 11 billion ounces of gold, which is not what the source says. When a bank owns an asset (whether gold or a house), it lists the value of the assets under assets.\" ---------------------------------------------- The Federal Reserve does not count gold at it's current value, it counts it's value that it last represented which is $42.22 an ounce. I simply did simple math and said ($11 billion/$42.22 * $1600) just for an estimate on today's value. Here is the Fed's explanation for this number \"Gold stock is valued at $42.22 per fine troy ounce. \" Source: http://www.federalreserve.gov... ----------------------------------------------- 3) My opponent continues to focus on individuals like you and I, which is the most common mistake when trying to think about what is going on behind the scenes. My opponent says \"Remember, the resolution says that when the government issues debt, it creates money. My opponent's own source said that QE2 bought Treasuries but failed to increase liquidity, meaning banks did not lend out any more money, so this failed to \"create\" money.\" ----------------------------------------------- The resolution did not say that the National Debt is the amount of money the nonbank public has, I said it creates money. In the case of the Fed's QE2 policy, they purchased treasury's that were already purchased. The money in this instance is actually called a \"reserve\". Banks can not lend these reserves but they can exchange them like they are money, with each other or for more securities. However they can leverage these reserves to create new loans. But in order for the Fed to do QE or Open Market Operations the Government first must deficit spend and create the debt/money before these operations can take place. Everything stems from Government deficit spending. ---------- 4) My opponent continues to fail to grasp the concept of a bank being the intermediary between Government borrowing and Government spending. He says \"How does the government credit $1 trillion to the public\" ---------- Think about it. When the Treasury auctions off debt and a bank (Primary Dealer) purchases it with bank money. The Treasury gets this money in their account at the Fed, in return the Primary Dealer gets a treasury as an assets and has a TTL Note Account as a liability. The Treasury then uses this money to credit bank accounts. If they need to pay for the Iraq war, they go and borrow money from the banks, and then credit nonbank public military bank accounts. My opponent, like many in this subject is still caught up in the fact that the majority of money purchasing Govt debt does not exist just like when you go to get a mortgage from a house. That is a loan. Then, we the nonbank public, go out to Wal Mart or whatever, buy their products, they ship that money overseas to China and what do you know, China purchases $1 trillion in US debt. The fact is that the money has to be spent in to existence first (on a macro basis) before there can be money that exists to purchase the debt. -------------- I have given my opponent numerous articles detailing how Primary Dealers finance their security purchasing and how this creates money in the nonbank public before any debits have occurred from the nonbank public. Sources: http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com... http://research.stlouisfed.org... http://69.175.2.130/~finman/Orlando/Papers/Treasury_dealers_manage_positions.pdf My opponent is simply using the lack of knowledge on the subject and accusing me of red-herrings with out being able to explain factually what I am wrong about. What money do you think the banks are using Contender? My opponent continues to talk about Clinton surpluses. I have shown mathematically how this did not reduce the national debt. It replaced public debt with intragovernmental debt. Mathematically and account-wise you can not pay off intragovernmental debt with out incurring public debt. I do not have enough space to show the accounting, but I will in the next response. Readers, please be aware that my opponent is not using any accounting or math in his rebuttal on my claim.",

            "premise": "1)Germany is not going to collapse. This might be a minor problem, but Germany is not going to collapse. It is funny that you argue that Germany is going to have a problem not finding experts, considering that higher education is public and many of the universities are free \"Most colleges are state-funded. In 2010, five of the 16 states of Germany charged tuition fees at state-funded colleges, while in 11 states tuition was provided free of charge\" 2)\"Every hospital and medical centre (which are financed by state) have constant sum of money for medical research, and that money could not be used for paying workers. So surplus will not affect investing in technology etc. Also, nowhere in the world exist company which will employ more workers than it's needed and more workers than can be paid. So there is no dangerous for reduced investments.\" You're missing the point. There are two problems. First off a large supply of experts creates a low demand for them, thus lowering their wages. This causes experts to spend many years in school and gain very little in the end. Second, economics is all about allocating goods and services efficiently. There are three main sources (some consider creativity and entrepreneurship to be a fourth category) that those come from: labor, capital goods, and natural resources. These sources can be distributed in anyway; however some ways are better than others. In a capitalism society, businesses do this by figuring out which method is most profitable. It would be more profitable for a business to use labor instead of capital goods or natural resources, because labor is UNDERPRICED! So where is the hidden cost coming from? It is because education is free and taxpayers pay for the education, thus society loses in the end. This is analogous to everyone getting a cheaper iphone because the government subsidies iphones. Sure it might seem great for everyone, however since people are paying it through tax money, it does not work out that well. 3)If you're referring to how banks make sure that you will pay your debt. Well, interest rates are based on your credit score. If you have a low credit score, it is considered risky, and you will either not receive a loan or receive a loan at high interest rate. Sometimes, one's parents can use the house as collateral. Also, if one does not pay back money at the right, then he/she will have to pay more money later. If the person cannot pay for the loan, then he or she can declare bankruptcy by a court. In bankruptcy, assets are liquidated and/or part of one's debt is partially or completely relieved. Businesses do not expect the government to give them money to start up businesses. Instead they expect to get their money through investors. Why shouldn't the same logic apply to individuals who want a higher education? Both higher education and businesses help the economy, yet businesses do not receive help from the government yet higher education does. And the reason has to do with my original points. CON has not addressed many of my original issues (1, 3, and 4) and still hasn't explained or given details how universities make sure that \"bad students\" do not enter or are removed from higher education. I await CON's response.",

            "premise": "Tamar Lewin published an article \"Burdens of College Loans on Graduates Grows\" in the New York Times. It reflects on some of the statistics based from 2008 students taking out loans to pay for their education. The facts show that people that have to pay more money for school will be less likely to finish school and be able to provide for their families in the future. Since our economy is doing bad all the big institutions have to raise their tuition to survive in this harsh depression. Many believe that when it comes to education the price for it should not matter because, we live in a society that is education is very important. Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Finaid.org and fastweb.com compiled evidence from students taking private and federal loans to cover their education while in school. It came to the starling amount that two thirds of bachelor recipients were in debt about 24,000 dollars. For many people with low income it will take them about twenty to thirty years to pay off their school loans. Mr. Kantrowitz coming up with the statistics to show how from 1993 the tuition was less than half of 2008. Even though there are some ways to go to college without being in big debt, many people do not want to go to junior colleges then to a university. This is a long process and some people want to really get the college experience. As a student here I do have several friends that took that route and one of the main problems with that was having your courses transferred over to your major. In places like Georgia that do pay for your tuition if you have a 3.5 or higher is a great thing, but other states do not have it. Either way you look at it people are going to have to pay back some money. When you graduate you never really graduate with any money because college is a grind.",

            "conclusion": "The United States National Debt is the Amount of Money the United States has Created not Borrowed",
            "premise": "Alright, well my opponent is now relying on you guys not believing me rather than him factually explaining why I am wrong. Let me try to touch on all his points, to show that I am not avoiding any questions. == Can the Government simply Create Money? == My opponent is under the impression that our Govt is allowed to create money. One would think that a sovereign country with control of it's own fiat currency would be able to just simply print money when it wants. Well that is not the case in America, which is why we are having this debate. The Govt has to \"borrow\" to spend money in this country by law. My case is that the borrowing is a series of accounting that happens outside the nonbank public that allows for money creation. Basically our money is backed by debt. == Ability for the Government to pay down the debt if it wants to == My opponent believes the Government can simply pay down the debt when it wants to and it uses the $112 billion from Clinton surplus as his case. I have proven that even under a surplus that the national debt has not decreased. Clinton merely used new debt (intragovernmental) to replace old debt (public). My position states that the Government can not simply pay down the debt because accounting-wise it is impossible unless current legislation is changed. I think I have proven that money is created through debt whether through banks or the Govt and it all lies on some entities balance sheet. My position is that taxes can not pay the debt off because that would create dollars that were not backed by debt, therefore the Govt would have to issue new debt to back the floating dollar. They would be \"in float\". And since we can't have floating dollars, we must constantly issue new debt in order to create new money. == Greece == My opponent likens us to Greece in his closing paragraphs. This should prove to the voters that my opponent is unaware of how the United States economic system works. Greece is part of the Euro, they are constrained by how much Euro they have. They have no sovereignty over their currency... therefore they are \"revenue constrained\". The United States controls it's own currency and is not bound by any non-human constraint to pay off it's debts or spend more money. This should be a clear sign that my opponent is not a knowledgeable expert on the American economy. ==The government can OBVIOUSLY create money without issuing debt.== This is not true otherwise they would do it. Which is why all these shenanigans have to take place for them to create money. ==The government credits our bank accounts== My opponent is unaware that when a public employee spends the money the Government provides them, they no longer own that money, and it is now circling the private sector. Just like someone who found gold under the gold standard. ==Clinton== You continue to think that Clinton could have paid off the national debt. But he didn't, every year he added to it, even though he ran a surplus. I have shown you why this is the case but you still refuse to believe me. I still remain confident that the national debt can not be paid off with tax dollars unless current legislation is changed. There is no dollar in existence that is not backed by debt and I have shown that by providing balance sheets of the Federal Reserve and the banks in America. There is no such thing as USD \"Float\". It is all backed by debt, therefore paying off the debt would either have to create \"float\", or would have to create new debt. Basically what Clinton did. ==M2 Does Include Loans== M2 includes all accounts on the banks balance sheet, including loans. This is another reason voters should disregard my opponents attempts to prove my theory incorrect. This can simply be proven by a non-academic source http://en.wikipedia.org... This is a clear example of my opponent being uninformed on the details of this debate. ==S&P Downgrade== My opponent now seems to use politics to defend his position. S&P downgrading the nation does not change how the nation works. In fact Warren Buffet came out saying the United States should have a AAAA rating. Warren Buffet also understands that the country can pay off it's own debt whenever it wants since it is debt in it's own currency. Source: http://www.foxbusiness.com... ------------- Unfortunately my opponent did not go in to enough detail on how the accounting of America works. This is very important since that is how you can represent money and debt flowing throughout the system. If you don't know the checks and balances of the country, then you can not prove how money is created or how debt can be repaid. For voters out there the bottom line is understand what money is purchasing the Govt debt when it is auctioned off. The Federal Reserve says 70% is purchased through Primary Dealers, who are mandated to participate in every auction and create a market for securities. Now ask yourself, why do we need special dealers to create a market for treasury's? The answer is simple, the collaboration between the Fed's, Treasury, and the Primary Dealers finance Govt debt through bank money. This leaves the nonbank public money unaffected and essentially puts money in to the economy before any nonbank money is debited out. This relationship between the Fed, Treasury, and Primary Dealers is the key to the money creation through Government deficit spending. Ask yourself this simple question, why would a country that has it's own made up currency need to borrow it's own made up currency? And then once you realize we borrow by necessity and that borrowing essentially is spending, then it all makes sense what the national debt actually is. My opponent, although I appreciate the debate, has shown a lack of basic understanding of accounting, economics, and the United States economic system. Comparing the United States to Greece Saying M2 Money Supply does not include loans and is comparable to the National Debt Clinton surpluses reduced the national debt even though it didn't Saying banks loan deposits For a person to be able to debate what I am saying, the above 4 items would be common knowledge and the debate would be more focused on the actually balance sheets of the entities involved in each transaction. The opponent, like most others, is completely looking at this from the angle of the private sector. He is obviously of the train of thought that thinks the Govt uses our money to borrow to pay for deficits. There are 5 entities that all play a role in the financial balance sheets of America 1) The Country (represented by the Govt) 2) The Treasury (the Govt's accountant) 3) The Fed (The Country's bank) 4) The Banks 5) The Private Sector All money creation happens between 1-4. The way Government debt is financed is simply accounting tricks between 2,3,4. The key question you have to ask yourself is, do we the nonbank public receive a net increase in nonbank public money when the Government deficit spends before the Govt debits nonbank public money out of the system. This is the basis of money creation, does the Govt take money out of our accounts before they credit our accounts or does the Govt credit our accounts before they debit our accounts? My position is that the funding of Govt deficit spending happens behind the scenes and we, the nonbank public, receive Govt deficit spending, before we, the nonbank public, are asked to fund the Govt deficit spending. Therefore, the nonbank public uses money that increases the national debbt to pay our taxes and to purchase Govt debt from the secondary market. My opponent made a valiant effort, but I have not learned anything new from this debate and I still believe that the national debt can not be paid off by current accounting standards because that would leave dollars in the system that are not backed by debt.

I live in Pakistan, we are a LEDC and we are taking more and more money every day and becoming more and more corrupt every day, as a result to this we are in heavy debts and now we cannot pay back or rather don't want to pay them back, i know exactly how much problems those debts are causing to the people here. Now that we cannot pay back the debts, we have to take all the cruelty that is being done to our people such as the drones in which innocent people are getting killed for no reason at all. If today some how we are able to pay back the loans and then not allowed to take any more of it, using the current economy, we can develop but never with the free provision of money by others that later cost the lives of many.",

            "premise": "The Pro side is whining about the fact that I have chosen to debate the morality or lack thereof morality. Let it be known here and now the Con side has refuted all of the points the Pro side has provided so far about the morality of the National Join Capitalist Fund. 1. The pro side has insisted upon offering opinion and autobiographical content for the basis of his moral argument for the fund. Here are two examples from the last round only: \"Yes. He could. He shouldn't though, because everyone has an equal claim to that land.\" Again, he has not defined where his basis for this equality is from other than his own opinion. \"No one can have rights because we don't have a government handing those rights down? I disagree profusely. They are rights and the government has to respect them. If they're granted by the government then they're privileges, not rights.\" The concept of rights are relative whether the Pro side likes it or not. Therefore no one has an obligation to even acknowledge such a concept exists because it was created by another human being. 2. The effects of the list need to to be discussed thoroughly. I will address the behavioral, financial, and moral effects. -Crushing student loan debt. To lift student loan debt is an admirable idea for many. But let the readers not engage in the art of deception. If the fund payed student debt, it wouldn't be fair to those who didn't go to college. There are many who chose not to go to college and they are not receiving this benefit of having their mistake being paid for. Also to pay the student loan debt would enable students to take on degrees which have no benefits like BA's in Art History, Theater, or Psychology. Students may try to pursue post graduate degrees that will reap nothing but dust. In essence, we should burn the money instead rather than enable more incompetent behavior. - Poverty Poverty can't be eliminated because it is relative. For example, in the past the impoverished usually suffered from malnutrition. In the United States, it is common for the impoverished to be suffering from obesity. http://www.worldhunger.org... -Mortgages and other loans Demand is increasing so price would increase significantly as well. There is a limited supply in housing, so prices must rise. - The lack of small businesses. Most small businesses fail. It would be more beneficial to burn the money then waste a large sum of money. A minority of small businesses are successful. http://www.forbes.com... - Low wages Employers will not compete for inexperienced 18 year old employees. \"This would increase wages because many 18-year olds would choose to simply not work for someone else for a while.\" How could these 18 year olds be successful and manage their finances without experience?",

            "conclusion": "Student financial aid should not go to for-pofit colleges",
            "premise": "This is my first debate on this site so I apologize in advance for not being accustomed to how these are usually done. I would like to add that this debate will most likely be a short one from me (in other rounds) because of how busy I will be in the next week or two. (Also a lot of school work due soon myself) I will now start my side of the debate. 1. Student financial aid is most definitely necessary and a very helpful tool for people less privileged or unable to pay college financial fees and should most definitely be available for anyone from any college, including for-profit colleges. Student financial aid is, in whole, for the students themselves. Student financial aid does help for-profit colleges but overall is necessary for the students as they are always priority in any educational facility. Although for-profit colleges are definitely known to be expensive, (I won\"t deny it) it is one-hundred percent the students choice (if not subject to religious/family rules etc.) of where they get their degree. Once decided that they want to receive a degree at a for-profit college it is up to them to pay the fees that apply for that degree. Student financial aid helps the students themselves to overcome their own, personal financial difficulties. Here is a statement from a viable source. \"If you decide to take out a loan, you must already understand who is making the loan and the terms and conditions of the loan.\" [1] Students that do choose to go a for-profit college are always aware of the risks of accepting to go to a \"higher education educational facility\" [2] including the costs and possible need of student financial aid in that process. 2. That for-profit colleges are more suitable for students. \"For-profit schools are often attractive to non-traditional students. With their myriad of online, night and weekend offerings, for-profits provide a lot of flexibility. Many for-profit colleges are also interested in serving minority, low-income and first-generation college students. Students are typically there to acquire a specific set of skills, not engage in less tangible activities such as personal growth and academic exploration.\" [3] As my source stated \"for-profits provide a lot of flexibility\" [4] which is known as something all students want in their busy school life. \"Flexibility (in for profit colleges): Features like online classes and multiple campuses make for-profit schools more attractive to students with families and busy schedules.\" \"Convenience (in for profit colleges): For-profit colleges make it as easy as possible to enrol for classes and qualify for loans\" [4] There\"s countless amounts of good reasons to go to a for-profit college, and although the cost is undoubtedly higher than a non-for-profit college, which is a viable reason to get student financial aid, the overall body and structure of for-profit schools includes flexible ways to study and a ton more convenience in that. Conclusion: Although there certainly is a price to pay, for-profit colleges offer flexible, convenient ways to study that can bend to a student\"s wishes. Students that can\"t afford to go to a for-profit college should most definitely be worthy of financial aid as there are only positives of them receiving financial aid. With the attractive flexibility and convenience of a for-profit college, where can a student go wrong as students are already made aware of the risks and it is ultimately up to them to decide how they path their own lives. I look forward to round 3. :D [1] https://studentaid.ed.gov... [2] https://en.wikipedia.org... [3] https://www.mycollegeoptions.org... [4] https://consumerist.com...",

            "conclusion": "Romney's Work at Bain Capital Helped Companies",
            "premise": "Bain Capital is company that focuses on leveraged buyouts, not venture capital investments.Venture Capitalism Good, Leveraged Buyouts BadVenture capitalism is a method by which money holders purchase an interest in a startup company by investing seed money in the company. It is a high risk investment with potentially high rewards. Since the majority of failures of new startups is caused by undercapitalization, this is a very important part of growing the economy. Without it we may never have seen the technological booms of the 1980's and 1990's.[1]Bain Capital was brilliant in that it moved away from startups before the tech bust and focused on leveraged buyouts rather than capital investments.[2] Leveraged buyouts, on the other hand, are not for the good of the company. Leveraged buyouts look for companies that are stable, have a low existing debt load, have generated a steady supply of revenue, have hard assets, and have the potential for short term increases in the bottom line through things like workforce layoffs or job eliminations[3]. The money that is used to gain a controlling interest in the company is often borrowed, and secured by the hard assets of the very company that is being invaded.[3] Worse yet, the debt is non-recourse, meaning that the company being raided is responsible for paying off the debt. It is not unheard of for the companies debt to also be used to pay dividends to the raiders [4] Raided Companies Left in Weakened StateShackled with this debt, many companies find themselves in a weakened position. According to the Washington Post, 22% of the companies in which Bain invested fell into bankruptcy[5] within eight years of being raided. Because of the way Bain would restructure the companies finance (to benefit Bain, not the company), the company could not fulfill its obligations. The company raided Armco Steel in my hometown in 1993. Armco Steel had been operating since 1888 and at its peak employed 4,500 people. Bain took a dividend payout of $36.1 million dollars, at the same time their pension plan was under funded by $44 million. Armco Steel went bankrupt less than a decade after Bain arrived and because of the way leveraged buyouts are funded, Bain did not have to pay for the union pensions to which they helped themselves. Instead, the union had to be bailed out by the government, but only at a fraction of the original pension payout to the members.Just Because Something Survives Does Not Mean It Was HelpedMany years ago leeching was an acceptable form of therapy for most illnesses. Though some patients inevitably survived this bloodletting, many others died. We know now that it was not 'bad blood' that was being drained, just blood; blood that the patient needed to survive. Though my esteemed opponent can certainly point to companies which survived long enough to thrive after being taken over by Bain, there are many other companies besides Armco Steel that had the opposite result.From the New York Post[6]: Bain in 1988 put $5 million down to buy Stage Stores, and in the mid-'90s took it public, collecting $100 million from stock offerings. Stage filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Bain in 1992 bought American Pad & Paper (AMPAD), investing $5 million, and collected $100 million from dividends. The business filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Bain in 1993 invested $60 million when buying GS Industries, and received $65 million from dividends. GS filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Bain in 1997 invested $46 million when buying Details, and made $93 million from stock offerings. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2003. The only positive net effect resulting from Bain involvement is their profit margin. The lives and jobs of the thousands of people that have been negatively affected by the liquidation of 'assets' in order to turn a quick profit were added to the rolls of the unemployed and the empty factories stand as a testamant to the cruelty of the bloodletting.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...[2] http://en.wikipedia.org...[3] http://en.wikipedia.org...[4] http://news.nationalpost.com...[5] http://online.wsj.com...[6] http://www.nypost.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "The Obama Care bill should NOT have been passed",
            "conclusion": "The Obama Care bill should NOT have been passed",
            "premise": "1) While voting along party lines is nothing new, it is still concerning in this case that these closed and locked door meetings resulted in special deals for states, special groups and unions. Those special deals are a problem in this bill. This bill is forcing the American public to pay into a system regardless of their desire to do so and then exempts specific groups of people. (http://www.mofopolitics.com...) That is not fair legislation and creates questions as to why these deals were put in place to begin with? Was it to get extra votes? Yes (and my opponent admits this in point #5). 2) It is true that this bill does not cover those who do not choose to pay, but let me point out that the only choice people have is to pay a private company to be covered or not to pay a private company. They still have to pay either way. This is the first time in American history that to be a citizen in good standing, one must pay money to a private industry or be held in penalty by the government. This bill may not cover those who do not wish to pay the private entities, but those people will still be paying money for others to receive care. This is wrong and some states and attorney generals would argue violates the constitution, though that will be something for the courts to decide and is unclear at the moment. 3) The addition of a totally unrelated piece of legislation being added to the most controversial law passed in recent memory should not be overlooked at all. In fact, the reason the initial Congressional Budget Office numbers came out favorable to Obama Care was because of the interest they expected to be made from student loans and had nothing at all to do with the debt Obama Care itself would create. Additionally, the 'doctor fix' was left out of this particular bill even though it is fully related, though this too costs a lot of money. The student loan take over is not only a problem in terms of the government taking over and regulating more of the private sector but also in the dishonest way it attempted to frame this bill as to decrease the debt. This health care bill will increase the debt (http://www.cnsnews.com...) in a time when our focus should be on decreasing the debt and job creation. 4) If the universal coverage in Massachusetts is any indication, my opponent is correct, we will not see the number of primary care doctors staying the same. We will actually see that number decrease. There is a chance the government takeover of the student loan industry can be used as an aid to direct medical students into primary care with some sort of student loan decrease or things of that sort, but that gets into a very sticky situation. (http://online.wsj.com...) If no special deals are made for primary care doctors, there is no indication that their numbers will increase. Most medical students avoid primary care because they have very busy days filled with patient and poor hours and because of the poor payments they get in return to not only live their lives but also pay off huge student loan debts. This bill will cause a problem to both main areas. It will increase the number of patients being cared for by these doctors and will cut Medicare and Medicaid payments. This is a growing problem and not passed in this very costly Obama care bill. 5) Back to the special deals, see #1 and remember this is not just a 'side affect' but rather a major problem because it 'bought votes'. This is a crime in our legal system when it is found in any place other than our government. These special deals were added to 'buy votes'. My opponent even admits \"These exemptions we(r)e necessary for the bill to pass...\" This is bribery and it is happening in such a way as to pass controversial legislation that forces the American people to pay private entities money, regardless of the use of their product, or the IRS will implement a fine. It is no wonder the American people are outraged at the government getting bigger, such as taking over the student loan industry, and that they are passing such legislation which may or may not violate the constitution. 6a) It is not the job of the individuals to provide for the rest of the country. I understand this legislation is forcing everyone to do so, but using this enforcement as part of your argument as to why it should have been passed does not hold water. I agree the government is forcing healthy people who don't want insurance to pay into the system. They are forcing insurances to cover people who are at high risk. And to make both work the government must force payments from those who have more money than others. To answer my opponent, yes, I understand the government is forcing many people against their will. This bill has countless flaws and should not have been passed. I reached my character limit. Thanks for the debate JBlake.",

            "conclusion": "studying is not the only way to get rich",
            "premise": "Thanks for a great debate, Eric. I'm going to try to do the exact same thing you just did - dismantle your arguments one by one. I fear this round will be quite a bit tougher than the last one, but here goes. I'm just reminding the voters that again, I believe his spelling and grammar are not up to par. This is part of the voting system, and it is important to keep this in mind. Your first argument paragraph is a direct response to my rebuttal of your suicide point. You state that only some students commit suicide and not all of them. I never said that all students in debt kill themselves as a way to escape financial debt. You didn't cite a source in round 2, because apparently it is a \"general fact.\" I have never noticed a correlation here, and I have definitely never heard of a distinct and certain one being reported in the news. Some examples are then stated showing that student loans can affect one's opinions on suicide. These are mostly valid examples, but I would just like to point out something. The only reason you hear about suicides due to student loans is because someone died. No news story is written about a graduate who found a solid job out of college and is now starting a family. I'm sure this happens more often than suicide, but because it is not shocking or interesting, nobody writes a story about it. The paragraph about Jason Yoder is partly plagiarised, but not sourced. I don\"t know if this falls under conduct or sources in the voting process, but it is a big issue. I found the article that you copied from, too (strangely enough, you cite it as a source 3 times later, although one of them is incorrect). More stories follow, such as Toby Thorn's tragic death. At least one of the sources I have found (1) seem to be shocked or confused because the debt was only 8,000 pounds, or roughly the equivalent of $13,000USD. Also, Thorn had only about $8,000 in student loans - the rest was debt from overdrawing his account. Roswell Friend, who is male and not female, may have committed suicide, and for an unknown reason at best. He had received a job offer from Comcast and would have been able to help his mom pay off her debt (2), so I don't think it was because of his own student loans. Claire Ashing's case is sound, yet people are blaming the bank for allowing her loans to run up this high from just ten thousand pounds. However, like your next piece of evidence in Marc Wadjas, this is still a good example. Next is Geraint Banks-Wilkinson, a student who had suffered from depression repeatedly (3) and was only one thousand pounds in debt, as you said yourself. Lisa Taylor was a poorly documented case (or just a common name) and I could not find any evidence other than the source you posted. I realize now, as I am typing this, that most of the previous paragraph was plagiarised yet again from your Guardian source. I think you intended to have quotes in the paragraph, but I don't know where they were supposed to go. Next paragraph. Your two quotes from C. Cryn Johannsen are valid points and I don't have the evidence nor the time to disprove or even argue her. Also, the note is very true and moving, but I doubt the accuracy of his words. Continue on to the next paragraph. You talk about how student loans will accumulate over time and the debtor will be penalized for not repaying their debts. Isn't this obvious? This is not a new idea about debt only relating to student debts. This is how all debt works. \"In fact, 'Up to Our Eyeballs' notes that about 9% of Americans aged 45-64 still have student loan debt!\" I don't necessarily disagree with this evidence, but I don't know where \"Up to Our Eyeballs\" comes from. Then, you plagiarise/don't have quotes on the section about John Koch. I want to get on with this debate, so I'm going to move on. You state that I should agree with the fact that dropouts are more successful than college graduates. I don't even know how you can logically say this. I'm not going to be able to find a source for this, because nobody keeps track of the college graduates that are doing perfectly fine and have a job, a car, a solid marriage, and a house. Just a semantic argument here because I am getting a little aggravated. You keep putting numbers in parentheses, such as \"(47-68) years old?\" This is not relevant to the argument at all, but I was just getting a little annoyed with this. You then try to defend your quote even after admitting that I never directly said the quote. You can't use quotation marks when I never really said it word for word. In round 2, I said you misquoted the source because the title in the source was incorrect. If you had read through the whole article, you would notice that it does say \"underemployed\" as opposed to \"unemployed\" (4). Ad hominem attacks like telling me that my eyes aren't working most definitely fall under conduct in the debate ruling. I don't know what you mean by my \"funny question\" about jobs. Is this relating to your previous China statement? If so, I still don't understand what you meant; if not, I don't know what you are referring to. The Business Insider list is a great source, but it is about jobs that don't require a bachelor's degree, not a degree in general. Granted, many of the jobs listed don't require a college degree, but most of them have requirements that are not easy to fulfill. The majority of the jobs either require an associate's degree, are hard labor, or require previous experience in the field. So yes, these jobs are available, but not to just anyone who wants them. In the next section, you talk about people selling vegetables and becoming rich. You go on to imply that I said all uneducated rich people gained money through inheritance. I never said nor implied this in Round 2. I said that they \"most likely\" got money through inheritance or other income, but because I didn't have details, I was not sure about it. Another point you have is that one of your previous employers sold potatoes at a young age and came to manage over 400 trucks. Cool! I used to sell lemonade on the streets most summers, and I also used to mow lawns and shovel driveways for people. This doesn't mean anything. For all I know, the man that used to sell potatoes could have gone to Oxford or Harvard or some prestigious college and had a masters degree. Your round ends with saying that college is not worth it because debt weighs you down and suicide is an option. This argument is a far cry from the original debate that studying is not the only way to have a good salary. You have the burden of proof as you are making the claim that there are other ways to obtain a good salary, but you have not provided any alternative methods of getting a solid job. And as a side note, these debts do not take \"a life time [sic] to clear if lucky.\" College debts can be paid off in most situations rather easily. My parents both paid off their debts within 8 years of graduating and getting their degrees. To conclude, I believe that I have refuted your points and, because the BOP is on you, I have no need to explicitly state my own points. This has been an enjoyable debate, and as my opponent said, I hope the voters are not distracted by anything and keep themselves unbiased in this argument. I think I have won on grammar and spelling, and also conduct due to Pro's personal attacks. Please take the time to read through both sides though. Sources: (1)http://www.dailymail.co.uk...

[1,2] No teacher would pursue a career in teaching if they were forced to do it in the first place. It is a choice to become a teacher. People who pay tax don't get a say in where their money goes. In saying that, by proper planning from the Federal Reserve, money can be put towards the maintenance and salaries instead of millions of dollars being spent of unnecessary expenses. [3] If students save thousands of dollars on tuition, that same money can go towards books and supplies and their living costs thereby making college more affordable. [4] The top most popular careers require an extensive knowledge of the work they are doing. Experience does play an important role in getting a job however, between choosing someone with a degree and experience and someone with only experience, most companies would go for the former because having extensive theoretical knowledge of the work you are doing puts you at a distinctive advantage. [5,6] No company would choose someone in any Financial, IT, Medical or Engineering field if they only have work experience. By eradicating the concept of \"loan\" students will feel they can focus more on their studies than on their debt. There are many European countries that have extremely low student debt, more college attendance and a higher graduation rate. [4] [7] But to back myself up, the government increases the price of tuition because they profit from student loans thereby increasing student debt. [8] Con stated that you don't have to go to a college to receive an education thanks to the internet, no job will employ a person on the basis of a Google education. Online courses however, are available but at a cost. Although cheaper, you need to look at the availability and affordability of unlimited internet access and the cost of equipment such as computers, webcams etc as well as application fees. Traditional education however, provides more career options, environments that allow for experimentation, interaction and practical work. [9,10] [1] http://www.ohchr.org...

            "conclusion": "Taxes are the best way to lower the national debt",
            "premise": "Observations Taxes- a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc. Debt- something that is owed or that one is bound to pay to or perform for another Credit Rating- a classification of credit risk based on investigation of a customer's or potential customer's financial resources, prior payment pattern, and personal history or degree of personal responsibility for debts incurred. From Dictionary.com Observation 1 - The only way for the government to gain money besides taxes right now would be to take out more loans, which will put them into deeper debt. Contentions 1.The debt will lower the united states credit rating, making getting money in the future from other countries/people more expensive in the future, making taxes higher in the future 2.The government has no other form of income besides taxes Contention 1- The debt will lower the United States credit rating, making taking out more loans more expensive in the future, which makes future taxes higher. A credit rating is based on many things, such as \"customer's or potential customer's financial resources, prior payment pattern, and personal history or degree of personal responsibility for debts incurred.\" If your credit rating is bad, you need to pay more interest on your loans, because the lender is less sure you will pay the loan back. The United States, according to treasurydirect.gov, paid $8,702,166,816.21 in October alone, and that was a good month. The united states paid $430,812,121,372.05 last year. That's $35,901,010,114.3375 a month! Granted, 430 billion a year isn\"t much compared to 17 trillion, but if we multiply $430,812,121,372.05 by 4, without adjusting for the increasing debt, we get $1,723,248,485,488.2 as our interest debt from 2014 to 2018. That means we produce nearly a trillion dollars in interest debt every two years, and soon, it will be even more. 1 trillion dollars onto a 17 trillion dollar debt matters. Now, this all leads back to credit rating. Soon, the United States will not be able to take out more loans without its credit rating dropping, making it more expensive to take out more loans, getting them into deeper debt that lowers their credit rating again. Lets look back and see what makes up a credit rating. A \"customer's or potential customer's financial resources, prior payment pattern, and personal history or degree of personal responsibility for debts incurred.\" The United States literally has no money. They do have gold and oil, but the only way for the government to make revenue off of that would be to tax to companies who mine/dig for it. The United States cannot maintain their great prior payment pattern in such great debt, as they cannot pay off old loans without taking out new ones. Finally, similar to prior payment patterns, the united states will not be able to keep up it\"s amazing history of always paying back loans when it has so many. Now that we have shown why the debt matters, lets look at why taxes are the best way to stop or slow it down. Contention 2- The government has no income besides taxes and loans This argument is very straight forwards. The government makes consistent money in two ways, taxes and loans. The previous contention explains why the government cannot take out so many loans, so taxes are the only way they can make money. Corrections/ factual misconceptions in my opponents case 1.The only way for the government to make money off of oil/gold/other resources would be to tax the companies that mine them. 2.My opponent stated Japan\"s economy is the 25th best in the world. According to the website he sited, http://www.heritage.org..., Japan\"s economy is 25th freest, in the world, not best. According to BBC, http://www.bbc.com..., \"The country (Japan) has been struggling economically for around 20 years\"",

You cannot expect people to take lessons of financial management seriously when they come at the behest of a government that is this deeply in debt. You want to lower debt rates? Stop having the government subsidize loans. The market will clear out those who offer loans to those unlikely to repay them. Every time you force a new course on all students, the students who already know what they would learn in it are forced to waste time on learning nothing and drop courses they would learn something from. So who is the beneficiary? Idiots who won't take the courses they need without prodding? At the cost of slavery, robbery, and the waste of intelligent people's time? What's next, force people who aren't racist to sit through diversity training that teaches them that people's value is determined by the color of the skin,in the hopes of sending those who are racist in a less offensive racist direction?

            "discussionTitle": "The use of credit scores should be tightly curtailed",
            "conclusion": "The use of credit scores should be tightly curtailed",
            "premise": "First, as none of my definitions were argued, they stand as they are for the rest of the round. Second, because my analysis of the resolution was also left untouched, the burdens applied in said analysis also apply for the duration of the round. Finally, my value and criterion analysis were not disputed. Because of this, we will use this ethical analysis for the rest of the round. Neg: C1: I feel the best way to address these arguments in by separating each paragraph and answering them accordingly. P1: First, my opponent makes \"the corporations\" out to be some kind of boogyman who is conspiring to get the poor defenseless consumers. The truth is, in EVERY SINGLE situation where my opponent claims consumers have no control, it is almost solely up to the consumer. Laid off: Although this will sound harsh, when a company is \"forced\" to lay off workers, they start at the bottom, the workers who, well, worked worse. By being the best worker, you're chances of being laid off are reduced to almost zero. Rent Increase: This is between the landlord and the person renting. There is no reason why one wouldn't have some kind of warning required in the contract. Furthermore, one can, if the rent is too high move to a cheaper place. Changed Loan: This is also simple consumer failure. Just like when one gets a credit card, one should ALWAYS read the contract. When a contract allows the lender to arbitrarily change the loan on a whim, one should realize that this is probably not someone who they want to get a loan from. Medical: In such instances, one can, unless their credit score is already shot, usually consult with a bank to change their loan repayment plan to something more do-able. Banks aren't out to bankrupt consumers, they don't make profit that way. However, As the neg, as long as I can prove that banning the use of these scores is a bad idea, none of these arguments even matter. P2 Student Loan: First of all, one could choose a cheaper education. Second, one can get a number of subsidized student loans from various government organizations which do not accrue interest until the student is done with their education. Third, one can, as I am, pay the accruing interest on loans quarterly while they are in school. This way, the loans do not become exponentially larger and are payable once schooling is finished. Finally, Pres. Obama has created a program that will remove student loans after 10 years as long as one is working for the government or for a not-for-profit organization such as a school. P3 Flipside: I actually don't know what my opponent is trying to say here. Corporations usually do not have credit scores, and if they do, these scores are not likely used in hiring or the such\u2026 If my opponent is referring the people who run these companies, he is wrong. These people are very likely to do what they say they will do and when. If that's not the definition of trust I'm not sure what is. Furthermore, when one is working with one of these people, it is much more likely that they will make their payments on time if they have lots of extra money lying around, which in turn makes they more trustworthy business partners\u2026 Therefore, because it is important to be able to trust the people you work for, credit scores are deeply important to the function of business and should not be curtailed. C2: \"If one can accept there is a significant portion of cases in which a person's credit score is not within their own control, then it is false to liken it to a criminal record.\" 1.) I don't accept that. See Contention 1. 2.) Criminal record is also not in one's own hands. Even if we do accept that credit scores are not always in our control, neither are criminal records. If one is caught in the wrong place at the wrong time one can get penalties for crimes they did not commit. To put it simply, The aff is saying: \"because people can sometimes be in the wrong place at the wrong time, nobody should be able to use a criminal record to judge people\". A credit score is a judgment of how likely someone will, at any given time, pay back a loan on time. The aff is arguing that the use of such a score should be banned because some people are a victim of unfortunate circumstances. This may be a reason to change such a system, but not to ban it outright. \"The system of credit bureaus and businesses that use them conspire to form a \"guilty until proven innocent\" system that undermines peoples' ability to pay their bills and locks them into a nearly-impossible-to-escape trap\" 1.) NO, they don't. they aren't the boogyman. (it'd also be kinda cool to see some evidence that all these bad things even happen\u2026) 2.) If you look to my arguments on contention 1 you can see that such things are due to a lack of effort on the part of the consumer, not the evilness of the lender. Furthermore, if people cannot pay their bills, they go bankrupt. Bankruptcy DOES NOT HELP BANKS. When people go bankrupt the bank usually ends up never getting paid back in full. C3: \"Given the secretive conspiratorial blacklisting nature of credit bureaus and susceptibility to fraud and abuse\" 1.) None of the arguments actually touch on the fact that the banning of the use of these could create harm. Because of this, these arguments are irrelevant and fall. 2.) Evidence. You make baseless accusations against companies without evidence. I can't assume they're evil, and because I'm of the \"innocent until proven guilty\" nature, because you provide no evidence, all of your arguments against this contention fall. 3.) The claim that making it harder for someone with a low credit score is bad because is exacerbates their problem is flawed logic. If someone has proven that they are untrustworthy enough times to make it that hard for them to get a job, it is likely they would also not be able to hold up their side of the employment contract as well. Furthermore, there are always companies willing to hire people with bad reputation, they just pay less. Through these jobs the person could eventually better their score and thus prove trustworthy enough for a superior job. 4.) Landlady: Without signing a new contract, if your contract has static terms, it cannot be changed. This is, again, a consumer not expending the effort to actually read the documents they are signing. Furthermore, apply all the other arguments from Contention 1 here as well. 5.) More Harms: By banning the use of credit scores, banks would either stop giving out loans altogether or go out of business. Without loans or banks our world would crumble into chaos. Because unthinkable harm would come of banning the use of credit scores, if you look back to utilitarianism you can see that such a ban would, be immoral. AFF CASE: 1.) Affirmative has failed to uphold burden. Even if the affirmative wins every single argument, they still lose. If you look to my Resolutional Analysis in my first post, you can see that the pro must provide an ethical reason why credit scores are wrong. The pro has provided arguments as to why it could be \"unfair\" but has failed to explain why fairness is important, or why unfairness is bad. Because of this, the pro has failed to uphold their burdens and cannot win. 2.) Ban V change the entire aff case is based on the harms created by people being metaphorically in the wrong place at the wrong time(or not knowing the rules). Just as this is no reason to ban the use of other \"scores\" this is not a reason to ban the use of credit scores. It is much more reasonable to argue that these could be a reason to change how it measures, but not ban it. all the corruption and fraud in the world do not provide a reason to ban the use of credit scores. At best, they show that there might be a reason to change measurements. In conclusion because of the reasons in my opening post. And because my opponent has failed to uphold their burdens as the aff (or provide any evidence of",

            "conclusion": "Austerity Measures Are the Proper Response to a Debt Crisis",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his opening case. Like him I'll keep it short and to the point.Austerity measures mean that the government spends less money. At the very moment when the people are suffering the most because their homes have been foreclosed, because their savings are lost and their jobs are gone, my opponent would advocate that the government should help them the least. The wonderful thing is that you can help them AND reduce the deficit. It's such an amazingly simple policy that I'm surprised my opponent missed it. Rather than spending less, governments should tax more.1. Will Austerity Reduce Debt?Asserting that this is true because it's \"common knowledge\" isn't enough. The fact is that no government has ever come out of debt by adopting austerity measures. If a government spends less, that has two effects on production. First, the cost of production is increased, reducing production in the private sector. Second, work available in the public sector is decreased. Both effects can be seen wherever it's introduced, with Greece being a good recent example (http://en.wikipedia.org...). That means that GDP is reduced, like my opponent correctly predicts (nice Keynesian model by the way), far beyond the level of government spending reductions. Less output translates to less income, including less income for the government through taxation. Less income for the government means a reduced ability to pay back loans. Not paying back loans means that governments need to take out even bigger loans to keep up with their repayments, usually from unscrupulous lenders such as the IMF who attach ridiclious political conditions to their loans, such as implementing even more austerity measures. Eventually the combination of high debt and high austerity causes the country's economy to collapse in a sea of debt and the currency to become worthless, as we saw in places like Indonesia during the South-East Asian crisis. Before the IMF existed, Germany ran into a similar chain of events during the German hyperinflation, caused, again, by austerity.2. Will More Taxes Reduce Debt?The common objection to more taxation is that money is taken away from private sector investments, which reduces the efficiency of the market and thus also hurts production and economic growth. The problem is that this presupposes the money will be used in private sector investments. During a debt crisis, it is much more rational to keep the money until the debt crisis is over, tucked away in a vault where it will be safe. Taxation is thus a form of enforced investment. I accept that this investment will be less than during economic boom-times, but it is far better than the alternative, and in practice the effect on production of higher taxation has always been minimal.In countries with a relatively flat tax, more taxes tends to hurt the poor quite significantly during the debt crisis. The simple solution to this is to unflatten the tax brackets in the economy.3. Standard of LivingI'm glad my opponent agrees that this is reduced via austerity measures; it saves me a whole lot of typing. His ideas of long-term standard of living increasing are predicated on austerity measures actually working, which they don't. There is, beyond doubt, a significant connection between whether a policy works and the standard of living of the people. But I'm going to go one step further. Even if austerity works (which it doesn't), the end still doesn't justify the means.Allow me to explain. Austerity creates poverty - it creates unemployment, reduces wages, and devalues the currency. These are also exactly the same things that a debt crisis causes, and is often the very reason why countries try to escape a debt crisis in the first place. Even if these things solutions worked in the end, the means is so abhorrent and so immoral that austerity shouldn't be considered. We're talking about forcing people to live a life of misery and despair because the government ordained it. They have to live through watching their lives crash to ruins - their grandparents dying because they can't afford food without a pension, their children suffering because without a job they can't provide for their family, their former neighbours now reduced to begging on the street because they've been thrown out of their home. It's not worthwhile, because that damage is not undone by any later prosperity. It doesn't matter if I can eat 100 cheeseburgers in 40 years if I'm starving right now for just one cheeseburger. And that's another reason why austerity is not the best solution, if it is a solution at all.ConclusionThis debate is about two things. First, it's about whose model of how to get out of debt will work best (though I contest austerity won't work at all). Second, it's about whether the means of austerity is justified in light of the moral consequences thereof (I think it isn't). I look forward to reading my opponent's response.",

            "conclusion": "A Full Time College Education is Not Worth It",
            "premise": "One of your arguments are the factors of underemployment and unemployment rates when in fact it does rely and depend on the major or career. Many jobs today are being replaced by machines therefore people in society and undergraduates need to focus on being a full time student to get a four year education or higher to acquire skills and knowledge that can not be replaced by a machine. Whether a full time education is truly worth the time and money, one person may argue that with loans and being in debt may seem like a stressful situation, it pays off drastically with time. With a four year education, a loan can be paid off in a couple of years while still having a comfortable lifestyle. For instance, a family practice (doctor) goes to school for a total of twelve year (four years at a university, four years at medical school, and three years at residency) the tuition may seem high but he/she would be making around 325,000 annually so in numbers, it seems worth the time and energy to put force into a full time education, if the loans/debt will not be as a big deal to pay off. The conversation of underemployment and unemployment justifies the fact that the competition between a full time student and part time student is existing but the job or position will most likely go to the more committed student with more experience and education. Without being said, the rates of unemployment and underemployment are higher in California due to it having the highest population in the U.S with more people seeking classes in specific majors and jobs. This is why programs like the Regional Admission Counselors of California (RACC) is composed of college admission professionals who represent colleges and universities outside the state of California. They help students go out of state into universities with the same system and potentially find jobs and positions out in other states where the unemployment is not as high as California. With all this being said, myself as a high school and college student I would be lying if I said money was not a concern for me. However, according to Nerd Wallet, a website helping people save money had Devon Delfino, someone who personally invested in student loans wrote an article on December 16, 2016 called \"Advice From 3 People Who Paid off Student Loan Debt\" states that small adjustments make a difference into paying off student loans like \"tracking your credit score, using the avalanche method, and taking holistic approach to your finances\". All in all, this is something that will help students be young responsible adults and the rewards of a full time education will help take them to that next level.",

            "premise": "At the first part of my agreement, I would like to ask if sports gambling legalized in all states of U.S.A, what people have the right to gamble? Adult, or teenagers? I assume Adult and teenagers, who above 16 , have the right to gamble. I am against the statement .From my point of view, the legality of the gambling could have a serious consequences for the future of the economies and the moral standard. It is a bad policy that it is a blow to the whole economic growth, and an even bigger blow to the banking system. Since consider the issue of bad debt, the compulsive gambler always have debts loaned from the bank or shark loan. .Because of their loan are huge and they are the compulsive gambler, their repaid ability is so low that cause the issue of uncollected debts. Compulsive gamblers is defined as a type of people can't control the impulse to gamble, even when they know their gambling is hurting themselves or their loved ones. Furthermore, most of the compulsive gambler will then turn to crime when he bankrupt. Embezzlement, theft, and involvement in organized crime is a common cases , we can see in the reality. Another basic argument of sports gambling legalized opposite site is that how sports gambling has affected the integrity of the game. Illegal sports gambling has already affect the justice of the game. If we legalize the sports gambling, it is predicted that the matters will deteriorate rapidly in the future. Past scandals at Boston College or Tulane illustrate this will surely affect the integrity of athletes and coaches. From my point of view, I really don't want to see \"matching fixing\" is in the headlines everyday. The social cost of gambling legalized like what Boydon Cole and Sidney Margolius said in their book, When You Gamble--You Risk More Than Your Money, conclude: \"There is no doubt of the destructive effect of gambling on the family life. The corrosive effects of gambling attack both the white-collar and blue-collar families with equal vigor.\" All in all, it can be said that the cost of sports gambling legalized is so large for the society to bear.And why should we legalize the sports gambling in disregard of other people's opinion?",

Opponents of Chapter 11-style provisions often argue that they do not provide sufficient protection to creditors, who provide important risk capital to businesses. However, this ignores the reality that creditors are often well able to protect their own interests and so do not need much if any additional protection through the bankruptcy regime. They are often sophisticated financial institutions or trade creditors, who have deep pockets and an ability to diversify their portfolio of loans easily and so reduce or hedge their risk. By contrast, other stakeholders are less sophisticated and cannot control their risk as easily through diversification.

            "premise": "Many thanks to my opponent for engaging with me in this debate. Before I get into my defense, I'd like to suggest that this structure NOT be used again in the future. Most debates that utilize Round 1 for acceptance-only consist of four rounds. I didn't notice that this debate was only three. As such, the fact that I cannot respond to Pro's rebuttal of the first group of arguments is highly frustrating. It essentially becomes a 1-round debate considering we are not able to engage in a back and forth, but merely try and predict what our opponent's arguments would be and address them before they are even made. Hopefully the audience is capable of assessing which points of mine were not adequately refuted or completely dropped without me having to point them out...Though I will respect the rules and not respond to the arguments, I would like to point out Pro's mistake in saying I have misrepresented my statistics. I do not trust the audience to check the link, so for their convenience I will post exactly what I said and what the link says in order to prove that it is Pro who is in fact mistaken. I'll copy and paste exactly what I said and exactly what the source says verbatim to demonstrate that my numbers were correct. In R1, I wrote \"While 23% do take out loans...\" and Pro says that this is not true. He writes, \"While her source says that a typical student gets 23% of their college fee from loans, she misrepresents it and says that 23% of students take loans.\" Of course I did not misrepresent anything considering the source says, \"On average, the money to pay for the typical student's college costs came from the following sources: parents' income and savings (32 percent), student borrowing (23 percent)...\" As you can see, I did not misrepresent anything -- student borrowing refers to student loans. That said, I'll address the final 2 arguments that I am allowed to defend. 1. I've argued that tax payer money can be put towards better use, including (but not limited to) our massive debt. Pro completely dropped this argument and instead talked about how public transportation can save us money on oil specifically. While overall less gas might be consumed, that doesn't mean that the money will belong to the government who can therefore put it toward other things (like social security, etc.), therefore this point was not actually refuted. Furthermore, while it's true that people cannot walk or bike everywhere necessary, it's also true that public transportation is not always convenient. Therefore there are pros and cons to both means of transport, but this doesn't explain why college students in particular should get \"free\" rides at tax payer's expense. 2. The more important argument is this: I've contended that free transportation services would increase use. This is seemingly obvious. Consider when Oprah partnered with KFC to give away free grilled chicken. Obviously a LOT of people capitalized on that offer, though when it's not free, there is nowhere near the same demand for the product when people have to pay for it themselves. However, Pro writes that this is \"Not the case if only college students are given free transportation.\" I don't see how that makes any sense; obviously if something is free it's going to be more appealing and thus have more demand (so you'd need more supply to meet it) - even if it's just college students. Over 18 million people are in college [4], which means you'd have to accommodate a lot more people seeking \"free\" rides. Pro also writes, \"The same number of buses need to be run and they only need to accept enough people until they are full.\" In that case, I don't even see the point of implementing this considering most would not even be able to utilize the free ride if it's a first-come, first-serve basis and supply stays the same.

            "discussionTitle": "The use of credit scores should be tightly curtailed",
            "conclusion": "The use of credit scores should be tightly curtailed",
            "premise": "The rampant abuse of credit scores is a long-overlooked blacklist conspiracy in our society that follows in the footsteps of grave injustices in the name of capitalism: plantation slavery, child labor, segregation and deadly work environments. There's no justice nor fairness, and frequently things such as medical problems supposedly protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act have their protections completely stripped by these blacklists. Even if we ignored all the fraud, abuse, inaccuracy and injustice, if we get to the supposed principle of a credit rating as a person's ability to pay off debt, then it should not be used in any circumstances except in determining a person's suitability to obtain a loan. A person's ability to pay loans and their work ethic are very different meters. A person's ability to pay loans is much less in their control than their punctuality and effort in doing a job well, therefore I say there is no link and denying a person employment based on their credit score is unfair, unjust and in opposition to liberty in that it oppresses them and prevents good people from being able to pay off their debts. Worse, a significant portion of debt is medical bills, and using a credit score lowered by medical debt to deny or charge someone a higher rate for rent or other services should be considered a violation of the Americans with Disability Act. Why should businesses be allowed to violate the ADA through a conspiratorial blacklist of private citizens who have trouble paying medical bills? On the flipside, why should a person who got away with embezzlement or profited from overseas slave labor get rewarded for their high credit rating? === COUNTER TO CON'S CONTENTION 1: CREDIT SCORE IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR Credit score is NOT a reliable measure of trustworthiness nor foresight. Corporations set both income from employment and expenses in the price of services, private persons have little control over either. It is not justified to punish a person because they were laid off, their rent increased or their lender changed their loan by denying themy opportunity to earn income or get fair prices for products or services they are not taking loans out to purchse. The use of medical debt to deny a person access to anything should be completely forbidden as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Student loans are another abuse; tuition has skyrocketted and educational instutions rake in obscene money from persons just starting out, making it less and less likely a person will be able to pay that debt off. How much bargaining leeway do students have in tuition? How fair is it the burdens of student loan increase while income does not? Why should students get blacklisted from employment to pay back their loans they have trouble paying when the increases in risk of the debts not getting paid are not the students' fault at all? On the flipside, there is no assurance whatsoever that a person of wealth and good credit rating is trustworthy. A lot of corporations have evaded environmental, safety and labor/human rights by shifting operations to nations with little or no such regulations. Mutual funds and stocks (and by extension, those who have ample amounts or at least access to ample amounts of them) benefit greatly by these ill-gotten gains that come at the expense of environmental sustainability, human rights and the economic sustainability of the majority of the members of our society. Why should businesses be allowed to conspire to reward violating laws by punishing the already unfortunate? --- COUNTER TO CON'S CONTENTION 2: CURTAILING CREDIT SCORES IS HYPOCRITICAL If one can accept there is a significant portion of cases in which a person's credit score is not within their own control, then it is false to liken it to a criminal record. Further, the criminal justice system operates on the principle that it is worse to unjustly harm the innocent than to punish the guilty; the credit score system does not. Only those who commit a crime under their own free will may be found guilty; someone unduly influenced by, say, insanity cannot be found guilty and punished for the crime. A child rapist gets civil protections under criminal justice laws; a person laid off and unable to make payments does not. How is this justified? The system of credit bureaus and businesses that use them conspire to form a a \"guilty until proven innocent\" system that undermines peoples' ability to pay their bills and locks them into a nearly-impossible-to-escape trap. A convicted criminal, by contrast, can pay their debt to society. --- COUNTER TO CON'S CONTENTION 3: CURTAILING CREDIT SCORES IS IMMORAL Given the secretive conspiratorial blacklisting nature of credit bureaus and susceptibility to fraud and abuse, it is unfair and unjust to allow employers to use a credit score as an employability factor. Even for a person who did \"bite off more than they could chew\" and deserve low credit scores, their use in determining employment as a determinant of not holding up their side of deals constitutes fraud and conspiracy to prevent the person from being able to repay loans. How many bills can you pay if you are blacklisted from working? Even outside of student and medical debts, most troubles paying debt are from a combination of layoffs and contract terms being changed by corporations with no control by an individual. My landlady's house payments were doubled over just a short time as her loan was sold and re-sold from institution to institution; she was able to keep up with the original payment and terms, but the terms were changed on her without notice and as her minimum payments were doubled, she had more and more difficulty making payments until she finally started falling behind and her home was put in foreclosure. What justification is there for punishing her by making her pay more for things and denying her an opportunity for better employment to pay her bills? This oppresses people and blocks them from equal opportunity and thus must not be allowed to continue. The status quo to continue is an attack on freedom, liberty, equality and justice. Companies will not change this behavior on their own, therefore regulations must be brought to bear on this abusive blacklisting conspiracy. Credit scores are corrupt, wraught with fraud, full of errors and even when they are accurate (far too infrequently), they are still unjust to conspire against people by blacklisting them from employment, housing or other services. Contention 3: Curtailing these scores is IMMORAL A.) Curtailing the use of credit scores has the potential of causing much harm. When companies hire employees, give someone a lease or any similar action, they must, in order to stay in business be assured that the other party will uphold their side of the bargain. People with bad credit ratings have a history of NOT upholding their side of these deals. If these companies were forced to work with these people, they would go out of business, and all the people they were currently helping would be left out to dry. In conclusion, because credit scores are important as an indicator of trustworthiness and because stopping the use of credit score is hypocritical and immoral and unjust, I urge you to vote NEG. (CON) === CLARIFICATIONS: \"If you look to the resolution...\" You points I have refuted. You will need to disprove my rebuttals or make new ones that have some reliable justification to them and establish that the status quo is free from corruption and abuse, fair and just in contrast to the points I have made. \"I'm just not sure what this means\u2026\" By that I meant I was not making an argument in round 1, merely attempting to define the argument. This -- round 2 -- is my opening argument.",

            "conclusion": "Plan is a huge setback in human rights",
            "premise": "The Proposition was quick and honest to acknowledge that their \"proposal would restrict the freedom of newly-graduated medical personnel to cut and run without compensating the home nation for the costs of their training\", and then they \"If the employee changes their mind and wants to change careers they simply buy themselves out of the contract by reimbursing their employer. If they do so after a year or two, they repay a proportion pro rata. Once they have 'worked off' the cost of the investment they become free agents\". It is in their second turn or speech that the troubling view of the Proposition on how to enforce their scheme came to light and so its tragic implications. What they are basically advocating is that medical education should not be provided for free anymore -and instead generate some sort of debt or obligation- in developing and even in developed nations (from the Philippines to England). It would no longer be free if it comes with strings attached, medical staff are supposed to pay for their education by working their debt off or else pay for the remaining of their contract. Their system is an perverse and degenerate implementation of only allowing student loans for students of medical professions, since at least under a student loan scheme students know how much debt they are acquiring, and interest rates are regulated, these debts are even subject to bankruptcy law in some jurisdictions, the state acts as a guarantor of citizens rights against banks, but the efficiency of government funding is lost due to the cut the banks take for themselves, students however are free to emigrate or switch professions and jobs, provided they pay their loans with their new job or from their new location. There is a reason states choose to provide free education and it's that charging tuition fees, as a Scottish Education Minister once said, \"[prevents] young people from poor backgrounds going on to university for fear of getting into debt\"[[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1554455/Scotland-to-abolish-student-fees-despite-debts.html]]. On the other hand under the Prop. scheme the burden of the contract would be placed upon the students, who are much more vulnerable than the state, the universities and the employers, since they have fewer monetary resources and thus access to legal counsel. The medical professionals will be \"[subjugated] to a controlling person or force\"[[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bondage]] in this case their government, so that they are \"obliged by contract to work for a stated number of years\"[[http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/refserv/html/servant.html]], and are somewhat \"bound to the land\" as if they were owned by the state (not too many feudal lords left)[[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=serf]]. In colonial times people became indentured servants in exchange for a trade and a passage to the Americas or other colonies, and nowadays they propose to rescue this unfree labor practice, adapting it so people would be doing it for a career in medicine and an air ticket to the West instead. Just as people in debt bondage, indentured servants and slaves, they could be sold to new masters (in this case either countries or employers). The only way out of this brutal oppression is for the medical personnel to buy themselves out of the contract, a right they could hardly have been denied since even slaves were allowed to buy their own freedom. They finally deigned to clarify whether the compensation was paid to the home country before or after the personnel left the country by saying \"his new employers must reimburse the cost of this training in advance\". The thing is, enforcing these contracts means that the home and host countries have to be able to restrict the medical staff from leaving. Else they have no guarantee of compensation once they leave since sanctioning, embargoing or invading a richer nation seldom makes sense, and a medicine professional running off to a poorer country would be free -as a slave who escaped from the US South to a Northern state- because there would be no compensation to work off any more (since the Prop. plan is not a general migration compensation scheme, but rather a richer country compensates poorer country scheme). If no such measures are implemented then workers would just migrate as they do in the SQ and the plan would not make any significant difference whatsoever, except for driving immigration to a black market where the rule of law would be non-existent and migrants would be have to turn to smugglers and human traffickers to reach their dreamed destinations, and then suffer the hardships of being illegal aliens, and they would also be able to send less money back home, because of their immigration status. No root causes of Brain Drain solved, worst conditions for migrants, less remittance money (that does reach the population, unlike the corruption-vulnerable compensation): All pain and no gain without ensuring enforcement. However, these draconian measures go against the Declaration of Human Rights[[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml]], Article 4. No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms. Article 13.2 \"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country\", Article 23.1 \"Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment\". The Proposition scheme amounts to servitude, and so it is a violation of human rights no matter if the contracts are enforced or not. Putting a price tag on the right to leave the country that currently holds the contract, switching jobs, careers or just quitting equals the suspension of these human rights, and thus of human dignity. Ensuring enforcement of this plan is a way to try to solve \"unfairness\" by suspending human rights, an oxymoron and harm like no other.",

            "premise": "Yes there are complex equation to find out how much a person will have to pay back, but still the money to pay back keeps increasing with time. Its kind of more like a trade, where the banks buys what the person wants and sells it back to him for s little higher price,which the person can return as intallments over a period of time. So nothing to do with interest.Small buisness can recieve loans the rsk factor is mostly 50:50, same goes for the benefit.Yes the islamic banking system can exist in mixed banking system, but what i am trying to prove is that the method of banking used in an Islamic banking are better then the normal banking system.Two disadvantages of present banking system1) A person who takes loan from the bank and is unable to return it due to some reason like losing his job will fall in huge dept as the amount to be repaid keeps increasing,2) The present banking system promises to give certain amount of interest back to its depositers, When many people are unable to return the money back to the bank, the bank finds it difficult to pay the interest to its depositers. Which could in some cases lead the bank to get bankrupted https://www.fdic.gov... whereas in Islamic banking this does not happen1)when people are unable to pay back the money due to some reason , the amount of money to be payed back does not increase with time. Therefore the person does not fall into huge debts.2) The bank does not promise any interest to its depositers, so when people are unable to pay back due to some reason,and if the bank does not make enough profits it does not have to pay to the depositers. So the bank has lesser chances of getting bankrupted",
