My position was that human activity is an addition to climate change just like other species. You can say human activity contributed more global warming than other species, but no more than the sun. So why aim the gun at us only? If we want to save humanity or other life on earth in the long run, we should not focus our effort in fighting over something insignificant as our demise is inevitable due to the sun. Maybe we should consider decreasing the sun activity to receive a greater impact. The statement \" human activity is an addition to increased Global Warming/ Climate Change\" is only partially true, and therefore is not the truth, and could be considered to be false if it is not the entire truth. With technological advancement, we might just be able to put on an extremely large sun glass to protect our earth from the sun's harmful activity. You may see human advancement or human activities to be harmful, but it could be the necessary ingredient to save the day.",

            "premise": "The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term \"climate change\" as- a significant change in the usual climatic conditions especially that thought to be caused by global warming. This 'climate change' can be caused by natural or human induced impacts. The global average temperature has risen by nearly a degree in the past 50 years. Scientists around the world have been recording temperature increases, raised ocean levels and melting of ice caps. All this is evidence that the earth is experiencing a \"climate change\". Many people believe that this change is primarily due to the fact that our CO2 emissions have created more greenhouse gases. They believe that there is a relationship between the rise in temperatures and the rise in CO2 emissions. Data shows an \"association\" between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of today\"s climate change. For something complex like the weather system, many scientists are needed to unravel the story behind climate change. While most scientists believe climate change occurs, not all agree on the extent and relevance of human activity as an influence on climate change. While major international climate agencies all emphasise the critical role of CO2 emissions in climate change, others are not so sure. For example, some scientists have conducted research that suggests that temperatures were higher than they are today, during the Roman and Medieval periods. These ancient civilisations would not have emitted CO2 emissions as we do today, so why did their temperatures rise? Temperatures have risen and fallen for a long time. The National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) states that climate change over the longer term is mainly due to the amount of sun energy hitting the Earth. Slight changes in the Earth\"s orbit and changes in sun ray intensity, can alter the temperatures here on Earth. Even so, most scientists still emphasise the role of CO2 emissions in unprecedented, rapid global warming. The frank fact is that climate change cannot be stopped. It is completely natural.",

Humans have increased Climate Change because of Increased C02 emissions Source: Climate Change Causes: A Blanket around the Earth.\" Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet. NASA, 11 Feb. 2016. Web. 12 Feb. 2016. Carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by a third since the Industrial Revolution began. According to the EPA Carbon Dioxide, which includes fossil fuels and industrial processes, contributes 65% of Global greenhouse gases. The Electricity and Heat production industry emits 25% of Carbon Dioxide. This shows how much Co2 contributes to pollution. Emissions released now will continue to warm the climate in the future. The EPA predicts that climate change will cause the demand for water to increase while the supply of water shrinks. Water is not only essential to human health but also to manufacturing processes and the production of energy and food. Climate change is expected to increase rainfall, thereby causing an increase sediments and in the pollutants washed into drinking water Rising sea levels will cause saltwater to infiltrate some freshwater systems, increasing the need for desalination and drinking water treatment.",

            "premise": "R3 Rebuttals\"Studies Contradict Man Made WarmingAnthropogenic climate change is not real. Yes, the climate changes, but humans aren't the cause of it.\" RepconThere are some scholarly peer reviewed studies that claim man made global climate change doesn't exist but they are in the vast minority. \"The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.\" [1]The 800 year lag is a misunderstanding of the Milankovitch cycle. \"The outgassing of CO2 from the ocean has several effects. The increased CO2 in the atmosphere amplifies the original warming. The relatively weak forcing from Milankovitch cycles is insufficient to cause the dramatic temperature change taking our climate out of an ice age (this period is called a deglaciation). However, the amplifying effect of CO2 is consistent with the observed warming.\" [13]\"Manipulation by Scientists and Bribing by the GovernmentOne of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. \" Repcon\"Though some of the CRU emails can sound damning when quoted out of context, several inquiries have cleared the scientists. The Independent Climate Change Email Review put the emails into context by investigating the main allegations. It found the scientists' rigour and honesty are not in doubt, and their behaviour did not prejudice the IPCC's conclusions, though they did fail to display the proper degree of openness. The CRU emails do not negate the mountain of evidence for AGW.\" [14]The scientists were honest, the quotes were out of context. As for your quote from nationalreview, nationalreview is very bias.\"These media sources are highly biased toward conservative causes. They utilize strong loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes), publish misleading reports and omit reporting of information that may damage conservative causes. Sources in this category may be untrustworthy.\" [15]\"This bias completely destroys the point of researching issues like climate change. Research isn't supposed to be \"Let's try to prove our political agenda.\". It's supposed to be a non partisan look into an issue affecting our lives. How can we accept something as a fact if the people researching the issue are lying to us.\" RepconClimate scientists aren't lying to us. There are multiple safeguards in place to prevent this from happening. Just for starters the peer review system.As for Mars we understand so little about Mars atmosphere that this is weak evidence at best. Furthermore, the tempature increase on Mars can be explained by dust storms. \"ConclusionThe empirical evidence isn't conclusive on whether global warming is happening on Mars. However, to answer the question on whether the sun is causing Earth's global warming, there is plentiful data on solar activity and Earth's climate. Many papers have examined this data, concluding the correlation between sun and climate ended in the 70's when the modern global warming trend began.So the argument that Martian warming disproves anthropogenic global warming fails on two points - there is little empirical evidence that Mars is warming and Mars' climate is primarily driven by dust and albedo, not solar variations.\"[16]Solar activity from the Sun is at a low. \"Many papers have examined this data, concluding the correlation between sun and climate ended in the 70's when the modern global warming trend began.\" [16]Thanks for debating.

            "premise": "Thank you for that last round. 1. While a rise in global temperature is undeniable, I disagree that the greenhouse effect is the cause. I repeat my original point that the recent warming of the Earth has to do with solar cycles and that a 2013 study proved that the rising global temperatures that have been observed in the 20th century are similar to those observed around the 11th century [2], and the recent rise in global temperature are within the borders of the natural temperature variations that have been recorded within the past 3,000 years [2]. Additionally, to address your point concerning the declining Arctic sea, it's true that it was slowly descending, but since 2012, Arctic ice has gone up by 50% [4]. Even the increase between 2012 and 2013 was visibly significant [5]. This increase is equally as important as the decrease. I again repeat my original point concerning receding glaciers. They have been growing and receding for thousands of years due to natural causes [2], and the recently receding glaciers in Antarctica were due to atmospheric circulation changes, which is the \u201clarge scale movement of air\u201d [3]. 2. My opponent has argued that 97% of scientists believe that global warming is due to human activities.However this is not entirely true. David Henderson went through everything that Cook et all claimed and found that only 64 out of the 11,944 scientists that were examined claimed explicitly that global warming was a cause of humans. This number brings the 97% down to 1.6% [1, 2]. Here is Henderson\u2019s list providing all the numbers: While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes that human activities have caused global warming, there are still many scientists who disagree.In 2010, a report by Climate Depot claimed that over 1,000 scientists (many of which were form UN IPCC scientists) disagreed that humans are \u201cprimarily responsible for global climate change\u201d [2].Again, in 2014, 15 scientists declared that the US National Climate Assessment\u2019s declaration of human caused climate change to be \u201cNOT true\u201d [2]. Conclusion:It remains that many scientists agree that global warming exists only as a solar cycle and is not caused by human activities. Thank you for reading!

            "conclusion": "That Humans Are Causing Climate Change",
            "premise": "Main point - Every major science academy in the west supports it, 97%-98% of scientist support it. 1. 75% of the 20th century increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2 is directly caused by human actions like burning fossil fuels. CO2 levels were 389ppm (parts per million) as of Apr. 2010 - the highest they have been in the past 650,000 years. This increase in CO2 was a substantial contributor to the 1\"F to 1.4\"F warming over the 20th century. 2. Human-produced CO2 is warming the earth, not natural CO2 released from the ocean and other \"carbon sinks.\" CO2 from fossil fuel combustion has a specific isotopic ratio that is different from CO2 released by natural \"carbon sinks.\" 20th century measurements of CO2 isotope ratios in the atmosphere confirm that the rise results from human activities, not natural processes. 3. Human produced greenhouse gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere causing climate change because the earth's forests, oceans, and other \"carbon sinks\" cannot adequately absorb them all. As of 2009, these carbon sinks were only absorbing about 50% of human-produced CO2. The other 50% is accumulating in the atmosphere. 4. Human greenhouse gas emissions, not changes in the sun's radiation, are causing global climate change. Measurements in the upper atmosphere from 1979 - 2009, show the sun's energy has gone up and down in cycles, with no net increase. While warming is occurring in the troposphere (lower atmosphere), the stratosphere (upper atmosphere) is cooling. If the sun was driving the temperature change there would be warming in the stratosphere also, not cooling. 5. Computer models show that increased levels of human produced greenhouse gases will cause global warming and other climate changes. Although these climate models are uncertain about how much future warming will occur and how it will affect the climate, they all agree that, to some degree, these changes will happen. The reality of climate change is not contradicted by this uncertainty. 6. Although the amount of human-produced greenhouse gases may seem small to some people, their warming potential is amplified by the water vapor positive feedback loop , allowing them to cause significant warming and climate change. As greenhouse gases heat the planet, increased humidity (water vapor in the atmosphere) results. Since water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, it can double the warming effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. 7. Human greenhouse gas emissions are heating the planet, and climate models consistently show that this warming causes an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. The fact that 1975-1989 had 171 category 4 and 5 hurricanes while 1990-2004 had 269 [51] of them (a 57% increase) validates these climate models and the reality of human-induced climate change. 8. Human-produced CO2 is changing the climate of the world's oceans. As excess CO2 is absorbed, oceanic acidity levels increase. Oceans have absorbed 48% of the total CO2 released by human activities and acidity levels are 25-30% higher than prior to human fossil fuel use. 9. An 8\" rise in the ocean level has occured (1961-2003) due to human-induced global warming. Global sea levels rose an average of 1.8 mm (.07 in) per year between 1961 and 2003 and at an average rate of about 3.1 mm (.1 in) per year from 1993 to 2003. [3] This sea level rise is the result of warming waters and the melting of glaciers, ice caps, and polar ice sheets. From 1870-2004, a \"significant acceleration\" of sea-level rise occured, an important confirmation of climate change models. 10. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the earth's hydrologic climate. Rainfall is increasing in many areas due to increased evaporation stemming from global warming. Higher temperatures are also causing some mountainous areas to receive rain rather than snow. According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, up to 60% of the changes in river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack in the western US (1950-1999) were human-induced. 11. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the rate of glacial melt and altering the local climate of many regions. Since 1850, records show a \"strong increase\" in the rate of glacial retreat. From 1961-2004 glaciers retreated about .5mm per year in sea level equivalent. According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, since 1980, glaciers worldwide have lost nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in average thickness (measured in average mass balance in water equivalent). 12. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases and soot (black carbon) produced from burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, is reducing the size of the Arctic ice cap. A smaller ice cap reflects less of the sun's energy away from the earth. This energy is absorbed instead, causing air and water temperatures to rise. From 1953\"2006, Arctic sea ice declined 7.8% per decade. Between 1979 and 2006, the decline was 9.1% each decade. Climate models predict that Arctic sea ice will continue to retreat through the 21st century further disrupting the global climate. [15] 13. Many organizations believe that human activity is a substantial cause of global climate change. These groups include: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the InterAcademy Council, the Network of African Science Academies, the European Science Foundation (ESF), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Royal Society (UK national academy of science), the US National Academies of Science, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 14. Nearly all climate change studies show humans as the main cause, and studies which contradict this claim are often funded by petroleum companies, making their conclusions suspect given the obvious conflict of interest. From 2004-2005, ExxonMobil gave $2.2 million in grants for climate change research to organizations that deny human caused climate change. In 2006 US Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) chastised ExxonMobil for providing more than $19 million in funding to over 29 \"climate change denial front groups.\"",

            "premise": "Just for clarification when I say human activity I mean the activity to the addition of climate change, as you could see by the evidence I used. What level of change contributes to climate change would be the rising temperatures. Since that humans release so much C02 and pollute the air it contributes to warming the planet. The EPA predicts in the next 100 years global temperatures will rise by 2 degrees. Now you may say that isn't much but that will cause the melting of the ice caps which will cause rising sea levels which will sink cities, as National Geographic reports. As you said that not all human activities cause Global warming, I acknowledged that in my evidence but as I will state again NASA reports that humans have increased atmospheric C02 emissions by a third since the industrial revolution, and the largest known contribution is fossil fuels, WHICH IS DONE BY HUMANS. My evidence shows more than that humans expel more C02 than any other species, in my evidence you can clearly see that these levels are detrimental. As I said Water shortages, food shortages, Ocean Acidification, the evidence is all there. Also to say I would not have to define detrimental that word is of common knowledge and if you can't accept that I'm sorry you're too incompetent. So I have won this debate because you have not even stated one piece of evidence that goes against my case, and your entire argument is on not defining common knowledge terms so for these reasons this is why Pro as won this debate.",

            "premise": "Thank you for your reminder that I have not given a single evidence that goes against your case. To fight against a popular belief, the odds have been against me from the beginning. You have certainly won if this was a popularity contest. What I want to say in my previous argument was that you have not put matters into perspective. Here are my facts which I hope can put matters into perspective: A)Dinosaurs that roamed the Earth 250 million years ago knew a world with five times more carbon dioxide than is present on Earth today, researchers say, and new techniques for estimating the amount of carbon dioxide on prehistoric Earth may help scientists predict how Earth's climate may change in the future B) CO2 is not the only driver to climate change; atmospheric CO2 levels have reached spectacular values in the deep past, possibly topping over 5000 ppm in the late Ordovician around 440 million years ago. C) The global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \" the primary driver of recent climate change \" has reached 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time in recorded history, according to data from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. D) Solar activity also falls as you go further back. In the early Phanerozoic, solar output was about 4% less than current levels. The combined effect of sun and CO2 matches well with climate. E) I hope you can agree that the Sun is an independent system of the Earth. Therefore, whatever we do on earth do not affect the sun's activities. My Analysis of the situation: [A] means that the earth is capable of sustaining life and handling CO2 level that is 5 times more than what we have today. [B] & [C] support the CO2 level is 10 times more than now prior to the dinosaurs, which roughly supports [A] [D] supports that it is the combined effect of sun and CO2 that contributes to the climate change. You can see that even if we increase our current output, it would take a long time to create CO2 level that is 5 times more than what we have now. Even at that level, earth can sustain life like dinosaurs. Therefore, human activity does contribute to climate change in the time scale of a 100 year, but to put in into perspective, over the time scale that date back to the beginning of life, human contributed CO2 level doesn\"t affect life all that much. The sun would probably be a greater contributing factor than us human. Of course, with that said, even if we are not the major contributing factor, it is always our responsibilities to do less harm to others and to the nature\" even though the sun would have killed us anyway in the end.",

            "premise": "Firstly. I have not quantified anything in the heading of the debate. I've said 'main cause'. Not 'more than fifty percent' or somethinglike that. Main means a major portion. Since when did 'substantially' get used for a small portion? And it is also not my possible (to my knowledge) to quantify the impact of natural causes on climate change as it is unpredictable and can change any time. Con has also left out my point that human activities can alter the natural conditions of the earth, therefore any change in temperature due to natural causes could have a human factor behind it. As explained in the following. http://co2now.org... Secondly, I never said natural causes play an insignificant role. I said they play an important role but not as important as human causes. In con's reference chart, the temperature has been constantly oscillating between hot and cold, but if you check recent years there have been almost two constant hot periods and the cold period is almost invisible ( in the graph I mean) meaning it is very short. And then in the graph itself it clear that the hot periods have been on the rise since the Age of Induatrialization. And after 2015, the cold period is based on assumptions and predictions, and as I have already made clear that nature cannot always be predicted. Thirdly Global Warming is a reality. Just because there have hotter periods before, doesn't mean it is not happening. The following site also explains that the global warming hiatus in recent times is not true. And that climate only causes short term changes in the climate of the earth, but human activity causes long term changes. http://www.bbc.com... Fourthly scientists will not quanitfy and agree that mankind is responsible for global warming, as it is their community that are primary responsible (in humans). But I will not defame them as some ARE trying their best to prove it. Fifthly , again I refer to the chart provided by Con, the hot periods have gradually developed over a period of time, but in recent years its almost at a right angle. Which means there have been sharp and quick increase in the heat all over the globe.",

            "premise": "Greetings. The arguments you are presenting are common among the left side of the political spectrum over the issue of Global Warming/Climate Change. The negation of this debate will now provide eight points as to why the public has been mislead over the complexities of this issue: 1. The 20th century warming of 1-1.4\"F is within the +/- 5\"F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990. 2. Rising CO2 levels are a result of global warming, not a cause of it. As temperatures increase, CO2 is released from \"carbon sinks\" such as the oceans or the Arctic tundra. Measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years) periods of global warming preceded global increases in CO2. 3. Human releases of CO2 cannot cause climate change as any increases in CO2 are eventually balanced by nature. CO2 gets absorbed by oceans, forests, and other \"carbon sinks\" that increase their biological activity to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. 50% of the CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, has already been absorbed. 4. Global warming and cooling are caused by fluctuations in the sun's heat (solar forcing), not by the minor greenhouse effect of human-produced gases such as CO2 and methane. Between 1900 and 2000 solar irradiance increased .19%. This increase correlates with the rise in surface temperatures in the US. 5. Due to the inherent unpredictability of climate systems it is impossible to accurately use models to determine future weather. Climate models have been unable to simulate major known features of past climate such as the ice ages or the very warm climates of the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods. If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes. 6. Rising temperatures are caused primarily by water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, not by CO2. Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere are driven by natural storm systems and ocean currents. According to a Mar. 5, 2010 study by researchers at NOAA, water vapor in the stratosphere was responsible for increasing the rate of warming during the 1990s by 30%. 7. The increased hurricane activity over the past decade (1995-2005), including hurricane Katrina, is not the result of human-induced climate change; it is the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) testimony in the US Senate on Sep. 20, 2005. 8. Deep ocean currents cause climate warming and cooling in long term cycles. The minor greenhouse effect of human produced CO2 pales in comparison. Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns.",

            "premise": "Global Warming (or climate change in the hot way) is the thing. It is a win or lose election debate topic. It is also very contested in the public field (media). The IPCC states that it exists and that it is human induced. State intervention is often motivated by climate change concerns. However there are many scientists, people and companies that contest climate change or human induced climate change. They have interesting arguments. I believe that they are mistaken. I define human global warming as the abnormal and significant increase of mean global temperatures caused (in part) by human activity. I expect to win if i can show that 1 climate change (in the sense of global warming) exists 2 it is caused in a significant degree by human activity I consider that my opponent wins if he/she is able to negate either of the above. I will affirm 3 arguments to sustain my position: science cvasi-consensus, observable events in the world around us, mental experiment. At this moment there is near consensus between scientists that global warming exists and is human induced[1]. The scientific model is quite simple to understand and makes sense. It is clear that the weather is influenced by many factors, and some are more powerful than others. The greenhouse effect is a powerful factor as shown by the super greenhouse effect on Venus. [2] Green house gases have increased at the highest level in the last 650 000 years after the industrial revolution. [3] To bring the scientific argument down to the human level and to avoid an authority argument i will point out that ice caps are already melting, the first drowned polar bears were found, more violent weather is happening etc. What is more, the arctic ice shows an increase in carbon concentration and temperature.[4] The mental experiment part is more complex in the sense that it involves the concept of positive feed-back. The oceans trap carbon while they are cold, when they heat up they release carbon. This a positive feed-back loop and it means that things will only get worse.[5] . Humans have reached a level where they can affect the climate. Acid rains and other city related weather are examples of humans influencing weather. In conclusion, from the scientific, factual and mental experiment arguments I conclude that global warming exists and it is human induced. Looking forward for a good debate.

            "premise": "In ROUND 3 I will continue my ROUND 2 response, where I will show the link between carbon dioxide emitted by human activity and the increase in global surface temperatures. In the final ROUND I will go over the effects of climate change caused by global warming.Carbon Dioxide (and Other Green House Gases) are Causing Global Warming and Climate ChangeWith the advent of the industrial revolution, human-induced global warming--through such actions as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation--has led to an unprecendented increase in CO2 concentrations and other green house gases [1][2]. However, climate scientists overwhelmingly pin the blame of global warming on carbon dioxide because it is the most widely and most abundantly emitted green house gas of human activity [3]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), carbon dioxide and methane are responsible for more than 84% of the warming being inflicted on our planet because of green house gases [3]. The remaining percent of warming can be attributed to green house gases like nitrous oxide and flourinated gases [3]. By itself, the IPCC has affirmed that carbon dioxide is reponsible for 54.7% of the global warming caused by green house gases; that's because it is the most abundantly produced green house gas of human activity and because it has an enormous radiative impact compared to other green house gases when accounting for its abundance in the atmosphere, its indirect heating effects, and because of the CO2 molecule's long lifetime in the atmosphere [3][4]. In fact, only water vapor has a stronger green house gas effect than carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, but unlike CO2 water vapor isn't being emitted naturally by any known source at a large enough scale to be blamed for global warming [4]; water vapor does contribute to global warming, but this is because of a feedback loop caused as other green house gasses in our atmosphere increase in concentration and heat up the Earth's lower atmosphere [5].As the Earth's atmosphere and surface become warmer because of green house gas emissions, this drive's more water vapor to be absorbed into the air, further heating our planet; this water vapor loop is well-understood and contributes to anthropogenic (human induced) global warming [5].However, other green house gases emitted by human activity drive this loop and are primarily responsible for global warming. As the statistic above shows, carbon dioxide is responsible for 54.7% of the warming being inflicted on our planet because of human activity. As I demonstrated with the graph on carbon dioxide concentration in our atmosphere in ROUND 2 (and as I reported in ROUND 1), never in the last 400,000 years has the CO2 concentration been quite so high as it is today! Ice core analysis shows that in the last half-million years the peak concentration (the highest concentration) of CO2 was almost 300 parts per million--and that was 300,000 years ago [1]. Today the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is 398 parts per million! Nearly 33% higher than it has ever been in the last half-million years [1]!This unprecedented increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can be attributed almost entirely to human activity, such as through large-scale deforestation, land use changes (such as methane emission from ammonia-based fertilizers), and the burning fossil fuels (which include coal and gasoline) [2]. The IPCC reports that in the last 150 years, human activity has increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 398 parts per million today [2]! According to the United States Environment Protection Agency (EPA), humans largely emit carbon dioxide and other green house gases from the production of electricity and from transportation; in the U.S. these two behaviors contribute to 60.8% of all the nation's emitted green house gases in a single year [3]. Other behaviors, such as those of industry, businesses, of agricultural, and of energy use in homes, contribute to the remaining 39% of the nation's green house gas emissions [3].Global warming is produced when green house gases in the atmosphere--water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide--accumulate in the atmosphere and act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing the sun's radiative heat and warming the Earth's surface [2]. Nature uses green house gases to facilitate heat trapping from the sun's rays to warm the Earth and make biological life on the planet possible. But if the concentrations of green house gases in the atmosphere become excessive, this can overheat the planet, alter the Earth's climate system, injure natural ecosystems, and make it harder for biological processes to take place and be maintained. This is exactly what's happening now and generating planet-altering climate change (these effects will be explicated in the final ROUND).Volcanes and Changes in the Sun's Solar Output are Not Contributing to Global WarmingSome skeptics claim that erupting land and submarine volcanoes are causing global warming. But reports by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) shows that volcanoes primarily emit gases, like sulfur dioxide, at high enough concentrations so as to encourage global cooling [6]. In fact, the USGS takes the position that erupting volcanoes typically emit gases that are more likely to lead to global cooling[6]! The USGS asserts that CO2 emission by human activity dwarfs the output of CO2 by all volcanoes worldwide [6].Some opponents of manmade global warming claim that the Sun's solar output is responsible for the current rise in atmospheric temperatures--that humans are not responsible for the modern warming trend. But this is a view that the scientists firmly dispute, based on a variety of evidence (2):--Scientists point out that, since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased only slightly.--If the warming were caused by increased radiation coming from the sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead what they observe is a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. Scientists say that this is a strong indication that green house gases are responsible for global warming, because they trap heat in the lower atmosphere.--Computer climate models that include solar irradiance changes can't reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in green house gases.All of these bits evidence demonstrate that solar irradiance is not responsible for the rise in Earth's surface temperatures over the last century or more.Elevations in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations have been responsible for Prehistoric Rises in Global Surface TemperaturesScientists that study prehistoric ice ages and warming ages point out that carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by geologic activity or other natural events has consistently led to warming trends in Earth's history. For example, the Ice Age that stretched during most of the Cryogenian Period (840 - 635 million years ago) had the potential to cover the entire globe and would have been a major setback for biological life and evolution in general had it been this severe. Scientists that study the period point out that this extreme condition never occured because, as the Earth froze, atmospheric oxygen was forced into the oceans, which oxidized organic matter and released CO2 into the atmosphere, preventing temperatures from falling any lower [7]. Presently scientists have no other plausible model to explain how the atmosphere was able to maintain warmth while the Earth froze [7]. Scientists also point out that a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to prehistoric Warming Ages. 55 million years ago, the Earth entered a sudden and rapid global warming event, which scientists call the the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Analysis firmly demonstrates that the quantity of carbon and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose significantly at the beginning of this period [8] [9]. The increasing concentration of CO2 is considered the chief reason why the atmosphere warmed so rapidly during PETM [8] [9]. Ice core analysis also attributes the end of the last ice age to an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels[10].That carbon dioxide is a heat-trapping greenhouse gas is sound; its heat-trapping effects have been studied in laboratories throughout the world. Its contribution to prehistoric global warming has long been understood, even before the concept of man-made global warming entered the imagination [11].

            "premise": "I thank my opponent Mr. Adams for Offering up a hopefully exciting and fun debate! I am assuming that I will be arguing that humans are a major cause to global warming increases with C02 emissions.My first point, is that C02 emissions are scientifically proven to be a mjor leading cause in the rise of global climate changes, IE Global warming.\"Global warming is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases . 72% of the totally emitted greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), 18% Methane and 9% Nitrous oxide (NOx). Carbon dioxide emissions therefore are the most important cause of global warming. CO2 is inevitably created by burning fuels like e.g. oil, natural gas, diesel, organic-diesel, petrol, organic-petrol, ethanol.\" http://timeforchange.org...From the year 1991 to the year 2005, There has been a significant increase in harm done to the atmosphere, mainly due to C02 emissions. See picture. \"This graph best represents what is taking place world wide. Recent investigations have shown that inconceivable catastrophic changes in the environment will take place if the global temperatures increase by more than 2\u00b0 C (3.6\u00b0 F). A warming of 2\u00b0 C (3.6\u00b0 F) corresponds to a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of about 450 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere. As of beginning of 2007, the CO2 concentration is already at 380 ppm and it raises on average 2 - 3 ppm each year, so that the critical value will be reached in approximately 20 to 30 years from now.\"The point here, is that C02 emissions DO harm the atmosphere. My opponent cannot prove that it doesn't because statistically, scientifically, and factually, the evidence stacks up. What has happened recently? \"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. In 2010, CO2 accounted for about 84% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's carbon cycle (the natural circulation of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals). Human activities are altering the carbon cycle--both by adding more CO2 to the atmosphere and by influencing the ability of natural sinks, like forests, to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While CO2 emissions come from a variety of natural sources, human-related emissions are responsible for the increase that has occurred in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.\" The carbon Dioxide emitted is MAN MADE. The things we use everyday, emit vasts amounts of carbon dioxide. Coal, natural gas, and oil are prime examples of things that we humans use daily that attribute to harsh environmental conditions.To be more specific, here is a graph that shows details on what things most commonly used to emit human made Carbon Dioxide. The information cited above is from the Environmental Protection agency, and backed from a government based site.http://www.epa.gov... Without tryin to sounds to repetive, I don't really know how else to argue this point. It is man made. There are tons of statistics, data, analytics, etc, that I could continue citing that prove the point here.Also, I am not entirely sure what my opponent is going to attempt to argue. In his first round, he says: \"CON argues that global warming is primarily controlled by human emissions\" What exactly do you mean by human emissions? For example I am arguing what you said to argue, however I am also arguing that C02 emissions are man made. I ask this because I don't want to have any confusions.None-the-less I have uphelp the BOP in this debate so far, as asked in round 1.I ask that any further clarifications on the topic be made in the following rebuttal, and I will respond in the like.Good luck to you Mr. Adams in this debate, and I look forward to a fun and thought provoking debating process!",

            "premise": "RebuttalsFirst my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist. Opponent's arguments.1. Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidThis is overtly false, since science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases. This is also stage 3c of climate change denial. [3]\"The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation\" [2]From the above statement you can clearly see that burning oil causes green house gases. Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertain. Yet, from your own graph, you can see that CO2 levels are increasing dramatically. Argument 2 Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordArgument two is cherry picking. El nino was responsible for the height of the graph. This is 1b stage of climate change denial and a logical fallacy. [3][4] s://grist.files.wordpress.com...; alt=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com...; />Argument 3 Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryAntarctica ice is 1b stage of climate change denial. [3]\"First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.\"\"Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees \" say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C \" would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn\"t melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.\"As you can see your Antarctica ice argument provides supporting evidence global climate change is happening. [5]4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesThis is stage 3c of climate change denial. [3]\"\"When viewed coarsely, historical CO2 levels and temperature show a tight correlation. However, a closer examination of the CH4, CO2, and temperature fluctuations recorded in the Antarctic ice core records reveals that, yes, temperature moved first.Nevertheless, it is misleading to say that temperature rose and then, hundreds of years later, CO2 rose. These warming periods lasted for 5,000 to 10,000 years (the cooling periods lasted more like 100,000 years!), so for the majority of that time (90% and more), temperature and CO2 rose together. \"show picture of graph if possible.\" [6][7]Antartica ice provides supporting evidence due to increase snow fall in sub freezing tempatures. Phew, made me work for the victory. Was fun defeating all your points. You put up the best fight thus far. Thanks for having the courage to speak out against the majority.

            "conclusion": "global climate change is human caused",
            "premise": "\"It is also true that it has recently gone up more in the 20th century then it has before.\" -According to the EPA: \"Records from land stations and ships indicate that the global mean surface temperature warmed by between 1.0 and 1.7\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF since 1850 (see Figure 1). These records indicate a near level trend in temperatures from 1880 to about 1910, a rise to 1945, a slight decline to about 1975, and a rise to present (NRC, 2006).\" Now, the problem with this is that there was not a decline, rather a rise, in CO2 emissions between 1945-1975, so it is nearly impossible to pin the blame on any one factor, particularly humans. The EPA also states that: \"Between roughly 900 and 1300 AD, evidence suggests Europe, Greenland and Asia experienced relative warmth. While historical accounts and other evidence document the warmth that occurred in some regions, the geographical extent, magnitude and timing of the warmth during this period is uncertain (NRC, 2006). The American West experienced very dry conditions around this time.\" This all occured BEFORE the industrial revolution, and before humans could possibly have any significant effect on global greenhouse gases. According to the EPA, though there is confidence within the scientific communit, there is not enough evidence to assign human fault in recent climate change: \"Present evidence suggests that temperatures at many, but not all, individual locations were higher during the past 25 years than any period of comparable length since A.D. 900. However, uncertainties associated with this statement increase substantially backward in time.\" That's just referring to the last 25 years, and discounting the drop in climate between 1945-1975. \"Why do you think that is if not because of the constant burning of fossil fuels humans burn daily.\" -Well, thanks for asking what I think. I think the Earth has a natural cycle of warming and cooling. I believe the Eearth has natural elements which control the percentages of greenhouse gases in it's atmosphere which regulate the temperatures between cooling periods (ice ages), warming periods (like now), and stable periods. There is enough evidence to suggest that humans are a contributing factor in a significant rise in the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, but the sharp rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere does not coincide with the slight rise in global mean temperature. \"This lets off too many gases into the atmosphere which causes the green house effect which results in Global Warming.\" -The \"greenhouse effect\" is a GOOD thing. Any planet with an atmosphere has a \"greenhouse effect\"... otherwise the Earth would be like the moon. Global warming is also a GOOD thing. Can you imagine what the Earth would be like if it wasn't naturally insulated??? \"Notice the part where it says \"human activities\". As you can clearly see, humans are a huge factor in Global Warming.\" -You didn't prove this, you simply stated this. Even if you were right, you are now contradicting your original statement. A \"huge factor\" is not en exclusive cause as you suggested in your statement: \"Humans are causing the rise in global temperature\". It also is contradictory to the entire statement: \" Humans are causing the rise in clobal temperature, which if not stopped will result in global warming.\" Here are a few points you have failed to prove: -Humans are causing the rise in global temperature (Not true. The natural warming and cooling cycles of the planet, our current place in the warming/cooling timeline, and other natural anomalies are at least mostly responsible for any significant rise in global temperature- even by the estimates of the most staunch global warming scientists) -Humans are causing global warming. (Not true. This is completely false and impossible. Humans are not greenhouse gases, nor are we a part of the atmosphere. We are not the Sun that shines on the earth, we are not the ocean that traps and releases CO2 according to mean global temperatures, and we are not a part of hundreds of other natural factors that create the beneficial process of global warming) Now, for those of you who are too liberal and hardheaded to read a debate before voting on your own opinion- I am not saying greenhouse gas emissions should not be regulated. I am not saying that the global temperatures WON'T rise to higher levels, and I am not saying that humans do not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. What I am saying is that the environmentalist position is misunderstood by many, and thus causes conservatives to disagree with and dismiss the issue of global warming. We must address the issues that are facts- greenhouse gases are required to promote the natural occurence of global warming. Greenhouse gases have risen by more than 38% in the past 100 years. Even if we cannot personally account for that 38% increase, we have the power to regulate further increases so that we may better aide in the stabilization of the presence of greenhouse gases so as to prevent the POSSIBILITY of an alarming increase in global temperatures. Stop the fearmongering and deal with the issues according to the facts (that applies to conservatives and liberals alike).",

            "premise": "A study by the biology cabinet shows no relationship between CO2 and temperature [1]. \"On this assessment, the evidence points to a current natural climate change which happens sequentially in two main climate periods, icehouse and warmhouse.\" Another study was found on the Vostok ice cores, which show temperature records going back over 400,000 years. Data from the ice cores reveal an 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature [2], meaning CO2 changes came AFTER temperature. If climate change was man made, then temperature would lag behind CO2, but the opposite happens, which proves that CO2 cannot influence temperature. The ice cores also show that the temperature rose to about the same level whenever it rose significantly, which shows that it is a constant cycle and not affected by human activities. The same can be said about the CO2 levels. Manipulation and False Activism Pollutes the Climate Change Debate One of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. [3]. \"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't... Our observing system is inadequate\" [4]. \"I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.\" [4]. The government as well as a variety of foundations donate billions of dollars to scientists to prove global warming is man made and to groups that put a megaphone to the global warming agenda. [5] \"the U.S. Government spent more than $32.5 billion on climate studies between 1989 and 2009. This doesn't count about $79 billion more spent for related climate change technology research, foreign aid and tax breaks for green energy.\"- Forbes A report by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works shows a \"billionaire's club\" that directs funding to leftist environmental activism groups and policy makers, while also getting grants from the government. [5] \"Under President Obama, EPA has given more than $27 million in taxpayer-funded grants to major environmental groups. Notably, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund \" two key activists groups with significant ties to senior EPA officials \" have collected more than $1 million in funding each.\" Finally, Former Vice President Al Gore made a famous movie called \"An Inconvenient Truth\" about the theory of man made global warming and its effects. However, there were eleven significant errors in his movie, coming from Gore trying to exaggerate in attempt to scare people into believing his political agenda. So what could be the cause of the global warming? I believe the sun is the one responsible, as correlations between the sun and the Earth's temperature have been found when studying temperature and sun levels from 1880-1980 [11], and 1980-2006 [12]. This could also explain why other planets in our solar system are warming, as all the planets rely on the Sun. But at the end of the day, the warming is NOT caused by CO2.

            "conclusion": "Man-Made Global Warming Isn't Real",
            "premise": "The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010. = 1. The 0.7 - 0.9\"C increase in the average global temperature over the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term, natural climate trends. 2. The slight increase in temperature which has been observed since 1900 is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term natural climate cycles 3. It is claimed the average global temperature increased at a dangerously fast rate in the 20th century but the recent rate of average global temperature rise has been between 1 and 2 degrees C per century - within natural rates The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost and average of 281 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 119 billion tons during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade./Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \" including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa. 1. It is myth that receding glaciers are proof of global warming as glaciers have been receding and growing cyclically for many centuries. 2. It is a falsehood that the earth\"s poles are warming because that is natural variation and while the western Arctic may be getting somewhat warmer we also see that the Eastern Arctic and Greenland are getting colder. 3. Research goes strongly against claims that CO2-induced global warming would cause catastrophic disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. 4. It is a falsehood that the earth\"s poles are warming because that is natural variation and while the western Arctic may be getting somewhat warmer we also see that the Eastern Arctic and Greenland are getting colder Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier. 1. There is strong evidence from solar studies which suggests that the Earth\"s current temperature stasis will be followed by climatic cooling over the next few decades Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century. 1. Politicians and activists claim rising sea levels are a direct cause of global warming but sea levels rates have been increasing steadily since the last ice age 10,000 ago. The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. 1. Warmer periods of the Earth\"s history came around 800 years before rises in CO2 levels. 2. Throughout the Earth\"s history, temperatures have often been warmer than now and CO2 levels have often been higher - more than ten times as high. 3. Significant changes in climate have continually occurred throughout geologic time. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost and average of 281 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 119 billion tons during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade. 1. I already refuted this before. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth\"s surface than any preceding decade since 1850 1. Already refuted this 2. After World War II, there was a huge surge in recorded CO2 emissions but global temperatures fell for four decades after 1940. \"It is 'extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature' from 1951 to 2010 was caused by human activity. By 'extremely likely', it meant that there was between a 95% and 100% probability that more than half of modern warming was due to humans. - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\"s (IPCC) fifth assessment report. 1. There is \"no real scientific proof\" that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from man\"s activity. 2. Man-made carbon dioxide emissions throughout human history constitute less than 0.00022 percent of the total naturally emitted from the mantle of the earth during geological history. 3. Most of global warming is completely natural. 4. A large body of scientific research suggests that the sun is responsible for the greater share of climate change during the past hundred years. \"Between 93% to 123% of observed 1951-2010 warming was due to human activities.\" - US Fourth National Climate Assessment 1. A large body of scientific research suggests that the sun is responsible for the greater share of climate change during the past hundred years. \"Scientists Agree: Global Warming is Happening and Humans are the Primary Cause\" - UCSUSA 1. The IPCC theory is driven by just 60 scientists and favorable reviewers not the 4,000 usually cited. 2. Leaked e-mails from British climate scientists - in a scandal known as \"Climate-gate\" - suggest that that has been manipulated to exaggerate global warming 3. A petition by scientists trying to tell the world that the political and media portrayal of global warming is false was put forward in the Heidelberg Appeal in 1992. Today, more than 4,000 signatories, including 72 Nobel Prize winners, from 106 countries have signed it. 4.

In addition, there is much more methane (a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term) in the atmosphere than at any time in the past 800,000 years\"two and a half times as much as before the Industrial Revolution. While some methane is emitted naturally from wetlands, sediments, volcanoes and wildfires, the majority of methane emissions come from oil and gas production, livestock farming and landfills.\" - Earth Institute, Columbia University 1.

We don\"t see this. We see instead warming at the surface, cooling in the stratosphere, cooling in the mesosphere. And that\"s a signature of greenhouse gas forcing, it\"s not a signature of solar forcing.

            "conclusion": "CO2 emissions are directly responsible for climate change.",
            "premise": "To conclude my case I would like to point out the obvious flaws in the opposition's previous case. They stated: \"Before I make my points, I would like to address the mistaken Negative. I do know that the topic is \"CO2 is the largest factor in global warming\", and that is what I am arguing. I'm sorry if that wasn't made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that it's out of the way, let's begin.\" Once again I correct the affirmative on the correct wording of the topic. The topic of this debate is that CO2 emissions are directly responsible for climate change. Throughout their entire case the affirmative seems to be referring to their fictional topic of: CO2 is the largest factor in global warming. The affirmative also stated that my evidence was backing this fictional topic. Whilst this may be true, proving that CO2 emissions are not the largest factor of global warming only adds to the overall proof that they are not directly responsible for the effects. To clear confusion, the definition of directly responsible is: without anyone or anything intervening. Whilst the affirmative continued to provide arguments proving the existence of CO2 emissions as the largest factor, they did not provide any points stating the absence of an intervention. There are many examples of other processes in our natural world that are speeding up the global warming. Some of these include methane emissions from cattle, deforestation and chemical fertilisers on crop lands. Although the affirmative believes that CO2 emissions play the largest role in heating the planet, they are not the sole reason behind the issue. If the impossible event of a CO2 emission cease occurred, the Earth would still be heating up. Slowly but surely, the effects of the Earth's orbit and the causes mentioned above will continue to heat the planet that we live on today. The affirmative also stated: \"the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing.\" In theory, this phrase mentions the effects on sun rays on Earth. Incredulously, even these sun rays play a role in global warming and further diminish the affirmatives picture of CO2 emissions being directly responsible. In a surprising twist to the debate, the affirmative suddenly seems to understand the topic of the debate towards the end of their case and produces the statement below. Unfortunately, it is also flawed. \"CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it.\" Cold hard evidence against the point brought up by the affirmative can be found in my first argument. Global warming is simply defined as increasing temperatures on our planet. Carbon dating and a myriad of other scientific tests show the heating and cooling of the planet well before the involvement of the Industrial Revolution. If the planet was heating up during Medieval periods, how can the affirmative say that CO2 is the cause of global warming when the people of the past had not even heard of the word carbon? In finality, I am not denying the fact that global warming exists. I am not denying that CO2 emissions play a considerable role in the heating of our planet. However, I do deny the views of the affirmative in thinking the CO2 emissions play a sole role in global warming. There are many other factors that are also contributing to the heating of our planet. In further expansion, I deny the politicians and organisational leaders within our world. The planet is heating up and it is effecting ecosystems and environments alike. Whilst we sit here and debate whether CO2 emissions are directly responsible, politicians all over the globe are doing the same. It is time to stop the debate and face the fact that although CO2 emissions have played a big role in global warming, the gradual heating of our planet is totally inevitable. As an international force we need to combat global warming and thus climate change by investigating new methods of adapting to a changing climate. Cooling down the Earth by reducing CO2 emissions is a false statement because the Earth will continue to heat via its natural cycles which we as humans would be wrong to alter. As the negative side, I strongly believe that CO2 emissions are not directly responsible for climate change. Thank you.",

            "premise": "This such a broad topic it will be difficult to debate, but we'll have a go at it. It is certainly an issue that deserves attention, so it's a good topic. I agree with the contention that global warming exists. The earth has been warming at the rate of about 0.19 deg/decade since the end of the Little Ice Age in the early 1800s, well before human-produced CO2 could have been the cause. Climate change is the norm. The prior Medieval Warm Period, when Greenland was declared green, was about as warm as the present. Before that, the Holocene Optimum, about 3-5000 years ago was not only warmer than now, it was warmer than the dire global warming predictions forecast. [2a] Polar bears survived. I deny the contention that human-produced CO2 is a significant factor, although I allow that it may be a marginal contributor. The alleged scientific consensus is not meaningful, because the the consensus is largely determined by non-scientists and by scientists whose expertise is outside of fields relevant to climatology. The IPCC conclusions are determined by a dozen or so political zealots who write the conclusions and then force the scientists in charge of individual chapters to rewrite to support the conclusion the elite has reached. Only about 30% of the IPCC are scientists, the rest are government bureaucrats. The IPCC report is not subject to peer review and the scientists who contribute are not allowed to vote on whether it is reflects the consensus view or not. http://nzclimatescience.net... http://thewashingtonpest.blogspot.com... The professional societies operate in much the same fashion. The AAAS has only a few climate scientists, and the endorsement of climate change is done by the political elite, not by the climate scientists. Not too many years ago, the consensus of relevant mental health professionals was that homosexuality was a form of mental illness, and the learned societies officially endorsed that view. It was wrong. Similarly, the Steady State Theory of the universe was once the strong consensus view; that consensus didn't last. Recently, DOE Secretary Stephen Chu was asked by a Democrat if it was possible if global warming could possibly be \"a hoax.\" Of course it isn't a hoax, because the people who believe in it are sincere. Chu himself endorses CO2 theory. Nonetheless, Chu was properly circumspect. He said (paraphrasing), \"In science we most honor the dissenters who disprove the consensus.\" The highly publicized consensus in 1970 was that the earth was on the brink of a new ice age. The best estimates of the level of consensus I've seen are from Patrick Michaels, who worked on the IPCC reports, which can be combined with limited polling data. it's probably about 40% pro-CO2, 30% anti, and the rest \"maybe.\" CO2 is a greenhouse gas, as Pro supposes. So if CO2 increases, say, 10%, then we ought to get something like 10% warming, right? No, that is not the way it works. A little bit of the CO2 in the atmosphere causes a relatively large amount of global warming, but as more is added the relative effect decreases dramatically. A straightforward physical model of the CO2 in the atmosphere shows that the increases in CO2 in the twentieth century would have a negligible direct effect on climate. To make the increases in CO2 have a significant effect, there has to be a multiplier that somehow magnifies the effect. There are many candidates for such a multiplier. For example, if somehow average cloud cover where reduced by a mere 2%, we would expect as much global warming as has been observed. It's no problem for guys with computers and hundreds of variables to tweak them to make the answer come out any way they want it to. The test as to whether they have it right is whether the models accurately predict what is observed. They do not. http://www.drroyspencer.com... There was a spike in temperatures in the mid to late 1990's. The models predicted a continual exponential rise in temperature. El Nino went away and temperatures subsided. Temperatures for the past decade have been about stable. If anything, they have decreased. http://www.drroyspencer.com... Atmospheric particulates were modeled to cause temperatures to decrease from 1930 to 1970, but that is no longer available to explain why temperatures are not increasing. Perhaps most telling, CO2 theory makes a strong prediction about the relative temperature rise in the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere and from pole to pole. The observations show the predictions to be wrong. [1a] Past climate change was probably due to solar activity, because there was insignificant human-produced CO2. Observations of the last few hundred years show solar effects correlate well with climate change. Unfortunately, solar activity turns out to need a multiplier just like CO2 theory. One explanation is that cosmic rays cause increased cloud formation, and the small changes in cloud formation produce the climate effects. This theory is not established, but there is a major test being conducted by CERN. Pro points to a feedback effect from CO2 being released from the ocean as the ocean is heated. This puts more CO2 in the air, which in turn causes more heating. The regenerative effect is such that once global warming starts, the world is guaranteed to end. But actually, there have been many instances of warming greater than the present, and the world did not end. The climate reversed and became colder despite the high CO2 levels. That means that whatever the contribution of CO2 to warming, there was something far greater that controlled climate, driving temperatures down despite CO2's best efforts to keep them up. The likely culprit is the Sun dominating climate. CO2 levels lag the rise and fall of temperatures by about 800 years. That implies that if multiplying effects of CO2 were significant, the earth could not have had temperature significant temperature changes in less than 800 years. Think in terms of an auto that has a 80 second lag in the accelerator. You floor the accelerator, and 80 seconds later you are up to 25 mph. With that kind of car, it isn't possible to get to 50 in just a few seconds. However, there are instances of dramatic climate change in around 50 years. The theory is therefore wrong. The Arctic Ice cap appears and disappears in roughly 60 year cycles. http://www.drroyspencer.com... The 60 year cycles track solar activity. Ships sailed across the Arctic Ocean in 1939, the last time the ice disappeared. Last winter was one of the coldest Arctic winters on record, with about a third of the ice refreezing. It appears the cycle has peaked and it heading colder. There is no sound evidence that weather is getting more violent due to global warming. [1c] In the last IPCC report, the executive committee demanded that the scientist in charge of the section on hurricanes attribute increase in hurricane activity to global warming. He refused and resigned in protest. http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu... The scientific evidence now points to solar activity as the cause of present global warming as well as past global warming. There are multiple solar effects, including direct solar irradiance, cosmic ray effect induced by changes in the Sun's magnetosphere, and long term variations in the earth tilt and orbit. There are seven or more solar cycles that correlate well with past and present climate change. CO2 theory claims that CO2 now dominates climate, but in fact temperatures have been stable for a decade despite CO2 rise. 1. Michaels, P. J., Shattered Consensus (a) p246-51 2.

            "discussionTitle": "Humans cause climate changing",
            "conclusion": "Humans cause climate changing",
            "premise": "First, my opponent wrote about the climate DURING the Mesozoic Era in his first round. My response in the second round was that this Era STARTED 248 million years ago, as I thought that the time when it started is more important than the time when it ended, because he wrote about DURING the Mesozoic Era. (I wrote it to explain my response). Second, no matter whether it was 248 million years ago or 65 million years ago, the fact is that it was million years ago and climate changed during these long period of time. My opponent wrote \"during the last 2 BILLION YEARS the climate in the Earth has been fluctuating between...\" It shows that climate was changing not in short time such as 2000 years, it was changing during 2 BILLION YEARS, which is very long period. The fact is without humans affect, climate changes slowly, during billions of years. However, humans' affect changes the climate quickly. Look to the cite http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov... especially to the subtopic \"Climate Model Indications and the Observed Climate\". There is a chart where it is appeared how climate changes with and without humans affect. It proves that with humans affect climate changes quickly. There are more evidences of quickly climate changing: 1. Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last CENTURY. The rate in the last decade, however, is nearly double that of the last century. It is changing during 100 years not billions of years. 2. All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880. Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years. Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase. 3. The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969. 4. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005. 5. Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades. 6. The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. Has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events. 7. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year. All these facts proves that during last century climate was changing a lot. The last century is about 100 years and it is really quickly. Before humans' industry climate was changing slowly during millions or even billions of year. That means people's affect is really big and dangerous. What will happen in the next centuries if such situation will continue? Next, my opponent wrote that climate and weather are different, also he gave the definition of the climate. \"Climate is defined as: the composite or generally prevailing weather conditions of a region, as temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, sunshine, cloudiness, and winds, throughout the year, averaged over a series of years\". It means that WEATHER conditions in the certain period of time IS CLIMATE. It proves that humans' affect to the weather can change the climate, as weather influences to the climate and they are not so different. That means my argument in the second round about how people change the weather is RELEVANT to the topic. I wrote that China attacked to the bank of cloud to transform clear blue sky for the National Day parade, that has caused the big storm in the next days. It is not happened once, there are several other examples of it in America, too. I would like to say that all these transformations of the weather influenced to climate changing. Once weather was changed it affects to the weather in the next periods of time. The last Con's argument is that there are other things such as volcano, which produce CO2 more than humans. So, as he claimed a big amount of CO2 is not humans' fault. My response is that in the nature everything was balanced before industry. The certain amount of the CO2, which produces by volcanoes or other things, was removed by trees and by algae. However, since the industry appeared, a lot of factories, manufactures and a lot of vehicles were invented and amount of CO2 increases. Moreover, trees and algae that removes the CO2 were destroyed, burned and cut by humans. That means human increases the amount of CO2 and decrease the trees that removes CO2, so humans damaged the natural balance, as a result an amount of CO2 increased and it influences to climate's changing. Look to the cite http://climate.nasa.gov... There is a chart, which proves that for 650,000 years, atmospheric CO2 has never been above the certain line until 1950 year. It shows that amount of CO2 was once small, then was big, but the fact is that it was in balance in the certain amount, while since humans start to use factories and vehicles, CO2's amount increased a lot. That proves that humans affect to climate changing. In conclusion, I have clearly proved that attack to transform the weather can influence to the climate changing; that increasing of the amount of the CO2 during last years is a big problem that is caused by humans. Also, that the climate changing affected by humans is quicklier than the natural climate changing can be. So, humans are the main creature that influences to the climate and changes it. So, I am writing to everyone, think a bit about climate changing and its consequences. What will happen in the future if CO2 increase, sea level and global temperature rise, ocean acidification continues? Humans affects to these problems and, I believe, humans can stop them. Think about your future and the future of the next generation and stop damaging to the nature and to the climate. Thank you for attention.)) Also, thank you, my opponent. I had excellent experiences by debating with you. It was really interesting. http://climate.nasa.gov... http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov... http://www.enchantedlearning.com...",

            "premise": "It is the sun that is the driving force of our climate and so it makes sense that it has the biggest impact on our climate rather than anything that humans might be doing. The sun is therefore the most likely cause of global warming. Professor Henrik Svensmark, a physicist at the Danish National Space Center in Copenhagen argues that climate change is caused by solar activity.[[Louise Gray, 'Copenhagen climate summit: global warming 'caused by sun's radiation'', The Telegraph, 8/12/09, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/copenhagen-climate-change-confe/6762640/Copenhagen-climate-summit-global-warming-caused-by-suns-radiation.html%5D%5D Solar activity, as determined by sunspot activity, is historically high being at its highest over the last 60-70 years for over 8000 years. Solar activity could affect climate by variation in the Sun's output or potentially through having an effect on cloud formation. Solanski et al. Sunspot numbers and cosmic ray fluxes... show correlations and anti-correlations with a number of reconstructions of the terrestrial Northern Hemisphere temperature, which cover a time span of up to 1800 years. This indicates that periods of higher solar activity and lower cosmic ray flux tend to be associated with warmer climate, and vice versa... This suggests that effects induced by cosmic rays may affect the long-term terrestrial climate. The positive correlation between the geomagnetic dipole moment and the temperature reconstructions provides further evidence favoring the cosmic ray influence on the terrestrial climate. [[I.G.

            "premise": "I will now respond to my opponent's claims 1) We wouldn't know that based on the incomplete climate record of planet earth. This changes in temperature could actually be based on long cycles in the earth's climate. Cliamte is not made over a couple of years, a couple of decades, or a couple of centuries, to truly capture the scope and understand climate one needs to look at the history of climate over tens-of-thousands of years. Starting at the end of the 18th Century isn't adaquete. This graph shows that the Earth's climate has been to voliatle over the last couple of decades to form any sort of trend, in fact after global temperature reached a high in 1998, it seem to be on the decline. (http://wattsupwiththat.com...) 2) It is true that our climate data goes back further than the existence of man, but this still doesn't mean that cliamte change is worthy of human action. We need to know and take into account how the climate was before we got here for several reasons. One being so that we can assess the current climate situation and see if anything similar to it has occured in the past. If we only go back 200,000 years, then seeing a spike in global temperatures post 1700 isn't really put into context; it needs to compared with other warming spasms in earth's history. The data right know doesn't not link human activity to global climate change, meaning that it would be foolish for humans to try to stop climate change as their is no actual evidence to suggest that the problem is man-made. If we don't than we would waste resources on a problem that couldn't be adverted. 3) I'm just saying that people should be skeptical of any global warming \"evidence\" they hear because global warming is a controversial issue and some evidence and statistics might have hidden bias. Therefore, we should remain skeptical of the evidence of global warming and hence global warming itself. 4) I'm just saying that we should remain skeptical of global warming because not doing so might mean that the human race dump huge amounts of resources into preventing a disaster that is destined to happen (rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic). Therefore, we should remain skeptical of global warming: as it might send us on a fool's errand while more pressing issues, like hunger and poverty, are ignored. === Conclusion === My arguments made in round one, after clarification, stand without tarnish.",

            "premise": "Before I begin I would like to initially reinforce the topic of the debate: CO2 emissions are DIRECTLY responsible for climate change. As the negative, I will rebut the affirmative as to why CO2 emissions (whilst adding to the heat of the planet) are not directly responsible for the changes we are experiencing on our Earth today. The affirmative stated statistics such as- 'CO2 is the largest factor of global warming', '97% of scientists agree global warming is man-made', 'CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat'. Whilst these points may be tried and tested, they do not favour the topic when the phrase 'directly responsible' is included. From what I gather, the affirmative believes that CO2 is speeding up the process of global warming. Whilst this may be true, in between the lines of this statement we can discover that another factor is actually CAUSING the process of global warming. As the negative, I believe that the cause is the fluctuation of the Earth's orbit (which the affirmative incorrectly stated as 'stable') and the consistent rise and fall of the planet's historical temperatures. I stand by the points I raised in the first round and have now refuted the rebuttal put forward by the affirmative and regarded it as invalid. Does the affirmative have anything within it's case to state why my reason for global warming is incorrect? Do they believe that CO2 emissions are the initial cause of the Earth heating world-wide? By now, they should surely agree that CO2 emission are not directly responsible for climate change.",

            "premise": "Studies Contradict Man Made Warming Anthropogenic climate change is not real. Yes, the climate changes, but humans aren't the cause of it. A study by the biology cabinet shows no relationship between CO2 and temperature [1]. \"On this assessment, the evidence points to a current natural climate change which happens sequentially in two main climate periods, icehouse and warmhouse.\" Another study was found on the Vostok ice cores, which show temperature records going back over 400,000 years. Data from the ice cores reveal an 800 year lag of CO2 behind temperature [2], meaning CO2 changes came AFTER temperature. If climate change was man made, then temperature would lag behind CO2, but the opposite happens, which proves that CO2 cannot influence temperature. The ice cores also show that the temperature rose to about the same level whenever it rose significantly, which shows that it is a constant cycle and not affected by human activities. The same can be said about the CO2 levels. Manipulation by Scientists and Bribing by the Government One of the biggest science scandals, Climategate, occurred in 2009. Hackers stole emails from scientists at the East Angelia Climatic Research Unit, and statements from the emails contradict anthropogenic climate change. [3]. \"The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't... Our observing system is inadequate\" [4]. \"I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.\" [4]. The government as well as a variety of foundations donate billions of dollars to scientists to prove global warming is man made and to groups that put a megaphone to the global warming agenda. [5] This bias completely destroys the point of researching issues like climate change. Research isn't supposed to be \"Let's try to prove our political agenda.\". It's supposed to be a non partisan look into an issue affecting our lives. How can we accept something as a fact if the people researching the issue are lying to us. The Evidence Outside our Planet One interesting thing about the warming is that it doesn't just affect Earth. Mars, Triton (Neptune's moon), Pluto, and Jupiter are all experiencing warming. But I want to focus more on Mars, since in our solar system, Mars is the most similar planet to Earth. Both have roughly the same length of day and rotation axis [6]. Its atmosphere consists of 95% CO2 [7], and is seen to be warming. In fact, Mars warmed .65 degrees Celsius in 20 years (1975-1995) [8], whereas Earth took 32 years to warm .65 degrees Celsius (from 1975 to 2007) [9]. Even though Mars' atmosphere is 95% CO2, it is still less than the amount on Earth. Environment scientist at Wright State University Jim Milks showed how the math plays out [10]. \"The total mass of CO2 in the Martian atmosphere is 95.32% volume x (44.0095/43.34) = 96.79% by mass CO2 96.79% mass x 2.5 x 1016 kg = 2.383 x 10^16 kg CO2 The equivalent calculation for Earth is Earth: Total atmosphere mass: 5.1 x 1018 kg Mean molecular mass of atmosphere: 28.97 g/mole % volume CO2: 0.04% 0.04% volume x (44.0095/28.97) = 0.0608% mass CO2 0.0608% mass x 5.1 x 1018 kg = 3.101 x 10^17 kg CO2 Last time I checked, 3.101 x 1017 kg is larger than 2.383 x 1016 kg by over 13x.\" So what could be the cause of the global warming? I believe the sun is the one responsible, as correlations between the sun and the Earth's temperature have been found when studying temperature and sun levels from 1880-1980 [11], and 1980-2006 [12]. This could also explain why other planets in our solar system are warming, as all the planets rely on the Sun. But at the end of the day, the warming is NOT caused by CO2.

            "premise": "I disagree with my opponent's assertion. The following information will prove that global warming is a false theory. 1. The 20th century warming of 1-1.4\"F is within the +/- 5\"F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990. 2. Rising CO2 levels are a result of global warming, not a cause of it. As temperatures increase, CO2 is released from \"carbon sinks\" such as the oceans or the Arctic tundra. Measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years) periods of global warming preceded global increases in CO2. 3. The increased hurricane activity over the past decade (1995-2005), including hurricane Katrina, is not the result of human-induced climate change; it is the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) testimony in the US Senate on Sep. 20, 2005. 4. The general consensus that the earth has warmed during the 20th century is based upon flawed temperature measurements. These measurements, taken from surface monitoring stations set up by the National Weather Service (NWS), are often contaminated by the \"heat island effect.\" According to a Mar. 2009 study published by the Heartland Institute, 89% of NWS monitoring stations are too close to artificial heat sources such as large asphalt parking lots, air conditioners, heaters and other sources of artificial heat. 5. Theories of naturally caused climate change are often ignored by \"mainstream\" scientists and organizations because many research scientists are more interested in maintainining the flow of federal grant money for climate change research than in questioning the basic theory of human causation. From 1998-2009, nearly $25 billion in federal funds was allocated for climate science research. Researchers who question human-induced climate change often do not receive grant money for research projects. Your turn. Sources: 1. Arthur B.

            "premise": "There is no doubt the temperature of the earth is rising. The temperature figures prove this. However, what is more open to discussion, is whether the changing climate is due to human influence or if it some natural phenomenon. My opponent has based her case around the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. Again, while atmospheric CO2 levels are high, it is not a certainty that this is caused by humans.In fact, the globe has, at periods in it's past, been hotter than it is now. In the Mesozoic era. better know as the reign of the dinosaurs, the climate was much hotter and dryer than it is now and there was certainly no industry back then to emit greenhouse gases. There was also little or no ice at the poles for extended periods of time. My point is, if there is proof that it happened once, then why can't the climate rise without human interference yet again. (http://www.enchantedlearning.com...)My next point is in regards to my opponents link between deforestation and climate change. While it is a problem that deforestation has such a negative impact on the ecosystem and is threatening the lives of many species, it is not a climate change issue. Tree's are not actually the best organisms for removing C02 from the air. This title belongs to algae. A colony of algae has the ability to photosynthesise more carbon dioxide in a year than a tree will in it's entire life. Add to this the fact that algae can reproduce rapidly, take up less space, and are now being farmed for their sustainable properties and biomass promises and the loss of a few CO2 reducing trees does not have such a devastating affect on the atmosphere. (http://www.ecogreenglobe.com...) (http://allaboutalgae.com...) Also, humans are not the only things emitting greenhouse gases. Methane a gas that has stronger greenhouse affect than CO2 has been rising off wetlands for ages. While humans do contribute to methane in the atmosphere, wetlands have long been responsible for methane emmisions due to methane producing bacteria. Termites, Hydrates, Wild Fires and Animals also all produce methane. My point here is that, while humans are producing chemicals like methane and CO2, so to is the environment, meaning that humans are not he only source and hence not the ultimate cause of the greenhouse affect. (http://www.epa.gov...)24hrs is rather short time to research and formulate arguments to I'll leave it at that for now and await my opponents response.",

The SunThe sun is the main driver of the global climate. The level of activity from the sun correlates with the average global temperature. The sun is currently decreasing in activity, meaning that the warming of the 1970s-1990s will soon be erased. \"Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming.\"[1] The sun can account for most of the warming experienced over the past century, and correlates well with the rising and falling of temperatures when compared to 20th century temperatures: [2]I.A.1. Solar Flux PredictionsSolar activity has been declining for a little over a decade and will continue to do so for at least the foreseeable future. \"'Normally, the conveyor belt moves about 1 meter per second\u2014walking pace,' says Hathaway, 'That's how it has been since the late 19th century.' In recent years, however, the belt has decelerated to 0.75 m/s in the north and 0.35 m/s in the south. 'We've never seen speeds so low.'\"[19] This means that solar activity has been declining recently. The next solar cycle, number 25, is projected to be one of the lowest in centuries.[19] \"Storms from the sun are expected to build to a peak in 2013 or so, but after that, the long-range indicators are pointing to an extended period of low activity \u2014 or even hibernation.\"[3] In fact, we are already beginning to experience this lowered solar activity.[5][6]This graph illustrates the recent decline in solar activity. Note the downward trend in solar activity overtime: [4]With solar activity leveling off, temperatures will go back down to normal. In addition, there will be fewer hazardous rays coming from the sun and fewer solar storms, meaning fewer disruptions to the satellite systems we rely on so heavily. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray FluxWith decreased solar activity, there is increased cosmic ray penetration of the Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays are inversely proportional to solar activity and proportional to cloud cover; and greater cloud cover means cooler temperatures.[19][10][11] I.A.3. Ocean Currents Ocean currents are the main internal drivers of the global climate. They have an R-squared correlation of 0.83, which is pretty significant (the highest score is 1).[7] Here is a chart showing ocean current's correlation to temperatures: [7] The sun is the main driver of ocean current temperatures, \"This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.\"[20] When plotted together, solar activity and ocean current activity correlate well (notice the decline in solar activity after WWII, and the subsequent fall in ocean current activity around the same time).[2][7][8]Ocean currents, because of the sun's cooling and because of its natural three-decade cycles of warm and cool, ocean currents are projected to cool down further than today and to continue that pattern for at least another few decades. \"Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.\"[9] Here is a graph showing ocean current's temperatures since 1900: [8]Note how all three currents are experiencing decreasing temperature trends, which, due to their current short duration, should continue for at least two more decades, and then another few decades to get back (possibly) to a peak. With decreased solar activity causing lower ocean current temperatures, the Earth will cool somewhat over at least the next few decades, albeit it shouldn't be that much. The climate will stay around normal. I.B. The 1500-Year CycleThere exists a 1500-year climatic cycle of peak-trough-peak (or vice versa) temperature cycles. \"Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.\"[12]Here is an illustration of this cycle: [13] This warm trend is projected to continue for around a few more centuries, and then the cycle will flip into a cold pattern.[12] This warm period will help counterbalance some of the effects of a diminishing sun. As solar activity does its ups and downs, the counterbalance between the Earth and the Sun will help keep Earth's climate systems in check. The various natural factors contributed by solar activity and the Earth's 1500-year cycle point to an insignificant change in the Earth's climate. Temperatures should not be much higher or lower than they usually are on average over the next few centuries. While the sun is cooling, the Earth will continue to heat the planet somewhat until solar activity returns and we have another temperature rise. It's a rise-and-fall situation.II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm PeriodA moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. II.A. Health EffectsIn moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up].[14][12] In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths.[15][12] In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[12]In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. II.B. Economic BenefitsSome of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. \"The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.\"[16][17]CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([12]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. \"For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.\"[18][21]This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. Conclusion There should be an insignificant change in the climate over the next couple of centuries as the sun continues its cycles and the Earth is in a moderately warm period. In the short term, the major factors in the climate show a decrease in temperature, but the long term shows a stabilization of temperatures to a reasonably warm level. This increases humans' life expectancies and increases crop yields, reducing the incidence of hunger, thereby further aiding in the increases in life expectancies. There is no rational reason to worry about the climate going off the deep end in the near future. On the contrary, our current climatic state seems to be helping us. Sourceshttp://tny.cz...",

            "premise": "But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen\" -Stupidape This argument that a consensus proves anything is preposterous, for a multitude of reasons. Number one, the consensus cited. This consensus reviewed 928 abstracts published in scientific journals. 928 is a somewhat large number, but not large enough to make a point off of, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of scientists in this field in the U.S alone [1]. Number two, consensuses are not reliable arguments, especially in the world of science. Scientists had consensuses on many things that turned out to be wrong, such as that saccharin led to cancer, and that the Sun's energy was a requirement for life. This consensus on climate change could be wrong as well. \"Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so.\" - Stupidape Yes, weather related deaths are happening. And they are declining. According to an article by a Department of the Interior Science and Technology policy analyst Indur M. Goklany, global death rates from weather-related disasters are declining [2]. \"Death rates for the different categories of extreme events were generally lower in the 1990s and early to mid-2000s than in previous decades.\". \"The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered the transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures.\"- Stupidape In the report I just showed about death rates from weather-related disasters, Indur M. Goklany goes into that exact study, and debunks it, saying that, \"Notably, the contribution of extreme events to the mortality burden for accidental causes of death is also small (at 0.4 percent).\" Saying that we need to double down on climate change because it is .4% of the reason for accidental deaths (Not even a full percentage) is quite ridiculous. Goklany also says that, \"Although the review paper\"s estimates for non-flood related deaths are problematic, if one accepts them as valid, that means that climate change currently accounts for less than 0.3 percent of all global deaths. Accordingly, based on current contributions to the global mortality burden, other public health issues outrank climate change.\" This furthers the point that cracking down on global warming for something so small is preposterous. But even putting the argument aside, it doesn't even fit in with what is supposed to be debated. \"I will contend that anthropogenic climate change exists. The contender will contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent.\"-Stupidape Arguing that \"anthropogenic climate change\" is to blame for weather-related deaths doesn't prove it exists; it is simply an effect. An effect that wasn't supposed to be debated in the first place. \"The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%\"100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al.\"- Stupidape The consensus cited is one example of how scientists manipulate data to push an agenda. Cook reviewed 11,914 abstracts, but only used 4,014 in his sample size because they expressed an opinion on global warming [3]. And from there, he got his 97% consensus, which is cherry picking, since he excluded the papers that did not give an opinion. But even THIS subset can't be relied on, as Former Director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Georgia and professor at the university Dr. David Legates and his colleagues reviewed Cook's consensus. Legates and his team found that, \"Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate papers Cook examined explicitly stated that Man caused most of the warming since 1950. Cook himself had flagged just 64 papers as explicitly supporting that consensus, but 23 of the 64 had not, in fact, supported it.\" [4]. Popular Technology reached out to scientists whose articles were in Cook's consensus. They said their papers were falsely classified or not included if they didn't endorse man-made climate change. \"[Interviewer] Dr. Carlin, your paper A Multidisciplinary, Science-Based Approach to the Economics of Climate Change is categorized by Cook et al. (2013) as; 'Explicitly endorses AGW but does not quantify or minimize'. Is this an accurate representation of your paper? Carlin: No, if Cook et al's paper classifies my paper, A Multidisciplinary, Science-Based Approach to the Economics of Climate Change' as \"explicitly endorses AGW but does not quantify or minimize,\" nothing could be further from either my intent or the contents of my paper. [5]. Is this an accurate representation of your paper? Morner: \"Certainly not correct and certainly misleading. The paper is strongly against AGW, and documents its absence in the sea level observational facts. Also, it invalidates the mode of sea level handling by the IPCC.\" \"The fossil fuel industry risks losing $33 trillion in revenue over the next 25 years as global warming may drive companies to leave oil, natural gas and coal in the ground, according to a Barclays Plc energy analyst.\"- Stupidape Yes, because of the regulations being put on the fossil fuel industry by the government in an attempt to stop something that is naturally occurring. So this isn't a fault of the industry- it's the government that's implementing the regulations that would drive the industry to the ground. Like the article itself said, \"Government regulations and other efforts to cut carbon emissions will inevitably slash demand for fossil fuels, jeopardizing traditional energy producers, Mark Lewis, Barclays\"s head of European utilities equity research, said Monday during a panel discussion in New York on financial risks from climate change.\" Again, this has NOTHING to do with what is supposed to be discussed. It doesn't prove that global warming is man made, so it shouldn't have been brought up in the first place. \"The Koch Brothers have sent at least $88,810,770 directly to 80 groups denying climate change science since 1997. One of the world\"s most prominent climate researchers publishing scientific papers that doubt humanity\"s role in climate change has received at least $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry to fund his research and salary, according to documents revealed this weekend.\"- Stupidape. First off, it is unknown if the Koch Brothers' donations led to any biases in research. As for the scientist who is claimed to be biased, his research is supported by data looking at the sun activity and temperature over the last 100 years [6], like I presented in my Round 2 argument. And if you're bringing up funding biases, you might as well bring up the fact that the government participates in the same thing. \"The US government has provided over $79 billion since 1989 on policies related to climate change, including science and technology research, foreign aid, and tax breaks.\" [7]. \"Right now, we have an energy policy that is rigged to boost the profits of big oil companies like Exxon, BP, and Shell at the expense of average Americans. CEO\"s are raking in record profits while climate change ravages our planet and our people \" all because the wealthiest industry in the history of our planet has bribed politicians into complacency in the face of climate change.\" - Stupidape Our energy policy is not rigged to help the oil industries. If anything, it's rigged AGAINST the fossil fuel industry. We have regulations that, as stated before, will destroy the fossil fuel industry, {continued on http://pastebin.com...}",

            "conclusion": "Climate change is real and caused by humans",
            "premise": "First of all, let me apologize for not making it clear what I meant by \"climate change.\" Global warming is actually an outdated term when it comes to climate change, and most scientists and climate activists prefer to now call it \"climate change.\" Although overall temperatures are gradually getting higher, many people try to argue against the existence of climate change by referencing years when temperatures have been lower than normal. This winter has been a perfect example of this. Therefore, when I speak of \"climate change\" I am talking about the overall shift in global temperature, weather patterns, and other climate factors that we are already seeing today. Sorry for not making that clear. Because the evidence for actual climate change is unequivocal, with 97% of global scientists supporting it, I will not take most of this argument to show the evidence. The big thing we're debating is whether or not it is caused by humans. To start with evidence that climate change is happening, let me just list a few. First of all, ocean levels have been rising for the past century, with a total rise of about 6.7 inches (which may not sound like much, but globally has large implications, especially if it continues.) In addition, the rate of rising has doubled in the last decade compared with the last century, showing that temperatures are rising, and rising fast. Second, temperatures have been rising since 1880, and the most warming has happened since the 1970s, with the twenty hottest years having been since then. Third, the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has been declining rapidly over the past several decades. Fourth, since 1950, the number of record high temperatures has been increasing, while the number of record low temperatures has been decreasing. Fifth, since the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of the oceans has increased by about 30 percent! I will stop listing evidence here, so I can move on to why climate change is caused by humans, but I would end by reminding Con, as I said before, the 97 PERCENT OF ALL SCIENTISTS AGREE WITH THIS THEORY. Does that not mean anything? Now for some rebuttals against why Con said before. First of all to respond to what you said about how much CO2 humans release into the atmosphere compared to the amount released by the rest of the planet. It sounds like your saying that we have released 0.00022 percent of all CO2 ever released by the earth's mantle. This number doesn't have much relevance, and I will use a different one to respond. Humans currently release about 30 GT (giga-tons) of carbon each year, while the earth emits about 780 GT a year. While this may seem to show that humans aren't the problem, it actually shows that we are. Before we began emitting so much CO2, the system was in balance, with the earth and ocean absorbing the 780 GT that it emitted. This kept the CO2 level in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 parts per million for 800,000 years. With the added human carbon emission, the CO2 level is at 400 parts per million and still rising. For another rebuttal, I would respond to what you say about how significant climactic changes have happened throughout geologic time. This is true, but this does not make the climate change happening right now any less relevant. These changes in climate you speak of are called \"Milankovitch cycles\", which have to do with the periodic oscillation of the earth's tilt, the precession of the tilt, and changes in earth's elliptical orbit. During each of these warming cycles, CO2 and temperature levels have risen and fallen TOGETHER. Also, the whole sun theory you mention at the end of your argument was supported not by \"a large body of scientific research\", but by one man, Wei-Hock Soon, who got $1.2 million funding from fossil-fuel companies. I will end with this: climate change is an extremely important and urgent topic that needs to be addressed by the world. People like you (and I mean no offense) need to stop arguing, using the tiniest facts to try and disprove something that is so unanimously agreed upon by scientists worldwide. If you don't believe in science, then that is a whole different matter, but if you do, I cannot fathom why you don't understand this. If we don't have a habitable world to live and be healthy on, how can we solve all our other problems?",

            "premise": "Acknowledgement of opposing evidenceI shall first bring up some evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change. One may wonder why I would do this when I am arguing against anthropogenic climate change, but it\u2019s really simple: I do this in order to provide the opposing side some representation and then I will present my side to refute that side\u2019s argument. That is the most logical way of debating, and if you ignore evidence when it is available to you, that is a cherry-picking fallacy. The main evidence of anthropogenic climate change, is the increased levels of CO2 emissions within the past couple of centuries. It is believed that irreversible effects are occurring now and into the future due to increased CO2 emissions, and that this CO2 emission increase is due to primarily human activity [1]. In fact, in this study, it is shown that if humans were to cut all CO2 emissions the CO2 in the atmosphere would linger still and still cause more warming even if it were all put to an end. [1] There are of course plenty of other studies that show this as well. Refuting the scientific consensusThere is often stated that 97% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is real[2]. However, it is a fallacy to trust the words of authorities on the matter without considering the evidence. In a study conducted by John Cook et al, the same source that my opponent has cited, it was found that majority(66.7%) of studies in relation to anthropogenic climate change were either neutral or inconclusive.[3] One must wonder why 97% of climate scientists are of the opinion anthropogenic climate change is real when the majority of evidence out there is inconclusive and there is some scientific evidence(.7% of studies out there) that anthropogenic climate change is not real, which I shall point out later. In science, something needs to be tested over and over again and achieve the same results in order to conclude something off of it. The fact that U32; of anthropogenic climate change studies come up with inconclusive or neutral results indicates that we actually don\u2019t understand the effects humans have on climate change, and the scientists are assuming we do by taking the 32% of times that it proved anthropogenic climate change as fact, when majority of the time there is no conclusion to be made. Therefore, 97% of climate scientists, are, in fact, acting unscientifically in this case. Reiterating previous debate pointsIn a previous debate with the same user, it was established that 3.225% of all CO2 emissions are caused from humans by unnatural causes. [4] In addition, the global temperature for over the past 136 years has only gone up by about 1 degree fahrenheit[1]. These two facts suggest that if humans have had impact on the climate, it is hardly anything to be worried about at all. Problems with CO2 emissions claimsSince there may be an increase in natural CO2 emissions, it is hard to conclude that the CO2 emissions by humans is what is causing the warming specifically. All variables need to be taken into account, which the study in my second paragraph under \u201cAcknowledging opposing evidence\u201d that claims anthropogenic climate change happens from CO2 emissions by humans, doesn\u2019t take into account the natural CO2 emissions, the activity of the sun, or anything else that could be leading to warming of the earth. In addition, it has been found in one study by Willie Soon et al, that CO2 emissions rising often follows temperature rise, and not always the other way around [5]. If it was as simple as CO2 rises, and therefore temperature rises due to it, then the reverse should not be happening where temperature rises and then CO2 rises. It was also found that CO2 forcing effects on seasonal temperature to be inconclusive, particularly since CO2 emissions cause warming at first, but the warming causes more evaporation of water and thus more clouds and humidity, which lead to a cooling effect, the net effect is not much change in the overall temperature [5] Next, another study performed by G. V Chilingar et al found that \u201cEven significant releases of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere do not change average parameters of the Earth\u2019s heat regime and the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Moreover, CO2 concentration increase in the atmosphere results in rising agricultural productivity and improves the conditions for reforestation. Thus, accumulation of small additional amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere as a result of anthropogenic activities has practically no effect on the Earth\u2019s climate.\u201d In another comprehensive study on global temperature rises by Patrick J. Michaels et al, it was concluded from \u201cobservations of atmospheric CO2 buildup and global CO2 emissions... that lead to exponential warming... is not based upon the reality of recent decades.\u201d Many of the models scientists have come out with to show that CO2 rises cause exponential warming, are not reflective of what has actually been happening in the world, and the warming in the world is much more linear. Problems in general with anthropogenic climate changeWhile I could continue to talk about all of the evidence against anthropogenic climate change, I shall instead provide a link to over 90 peer-reviewed scientific articles that show problems with anthropogenic climate change; there are many and various problems with it ranging from how CO2 doesn\u2019t actually affect temperature in the long-term since it balances out when water is evaporated by the initial warming, to problems with climate models, to what should have been expected to result from anthropogenic climate change not actually happening. [7]Due to all of these issues listed above in this category and the previous 3, it is difficult to believe the climate scientists who claim anthropogenic climate change is a reality, when, as far as I\u2019m aware, they have not addressed the above issues outlined. Inconclusive results and the default positionBecause as mentioned before, that majority of the studies done into anthropogenic climate change resulted in inconclusive or neutral results, the default position should be that anthropogenic climate change does not exist. Just as believing a god doesn\u2019t exist is the default position when there is not conclusive evidence for or against a god, or majority of the evidence is inconclusive or neutral, so would then the position on anthropogenic climate change have the default position of not believing in it.

            "premise": "Climate temperatures have risen faster than over thousands of years in the past as Nd2400 would like you to believe readers. Let me give you a little bit of history which Nd2400 refuses to acknowledge my dear readers/voters. The Roman Warm Period, Or Roman Climatic Optimum, Has been proposed as a period of unusually warm weather in Europe and the North Atlantic that ran from approximately 250 BC to AD 400, That's only 650 years. Aegean mean summer temperatures in the 4th and 5th centuries BC were within a degree of modern temperatures. That and other literary fragments from the time confirm that the Greek climate then was basically the same as it was around AD 2000. Dendrochronological evidence from wood found at the Parthenon shows variability of climate in the 5th century BC that resembles the modern pattern of variation. Tree rings from Italy in the late 3rd century BC indicate a period of mild conditions in the area at the time that Hannibal crossed the Alps with elephants. Cooling at the end of the period in southwestern Florida may have been due to a reduction in solar radiation reaching the Earth, Which may have triggered a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. A 1999 reconstruction of ocean current patterns, Based on the granularity of deep ocean sediment, Concluded that there was a Roman Warm Period, Which peaked around AD 150 The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) also known as the Medieval Climate Optimum, Or Medieval Climatic Anomaly was a time of warm climate in the North Atlantic region that may have been related to other warming events in other regions during that time, Including China and other areas, Lasting from c. R01;950 to c. R01;1250, That's only 300 years, And now you are comparing your data with just 200 years of scientist studies. Causes of the Medieval Warm Period include increased solar activity, Decreased volcanic activity, And changes to ocean circulation. The period was followed by a cooler period in the North Atlantic and elsewhere termed the Little Ice Age. Some refer to the event as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly as this term emphasizes that climatic effects. Lloyd D. Keigwin's 1996 study of radiocarbon-dated box core data from marine sediments in the Sargasso Sea found that its sea surface temperature was approximately 1 \"C warmer 1000 years ago, Compared to today. (the Medieval Warm Period). The 2009 Mann study found warmth exceeding 1961\"1990 levels in Southern Greenland and parts of North America during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, With warmth in some regions exceeding temperatures of the 1990\"2010 period. Apology accepted. Norse colonization of the Americas has been associated with warmer periods. The common theory is that Norsemen took advantage of ice-free seas to colonize areas in Greenland and other outlying lands of the far north. Thermohaline circulation (THC) is a part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The oldest waters (with a transit time of around 1000 years) upwell in the North Pacific. Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins, Reducing differences between them and making the Earth's oceans a global system. On their journey, The water masses transport both energy (in the form of heat) and matter (solids, Dissolved substances and gases) around the globe. As such, The state of the circulation has a large impact on the climate of the Earth. The reason we have global warming is for these reasons : changes in the composition of the atmosphere, Solar luminosity, Volcanic eruptions, And variations in Earth's orbit around the Sun. This has nothing to do with man making global warming. With all of the hysteria, All of the fear, All of the phony science, Could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? In 2012, Our President, Donald Trump said that \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. Manufacturing non-competitive. The whole point of this human causing global warming is to focus on raising money, Principally by scaring potential contributors with bogus scientific claims and predictions of a global apocalypse. The main reason we have had global warming in the past on earth is because of the following solar activity increased volcanic activity changes to ocean circulation NOT man made up pandemic inducing and money raising for scientist and institutions FAKE NEWS of human global warming. Nd2400, Case closed Fellow readers and voters, Don't be swayed by the paranoia filled rants from my opponent about humans causing global warming. The earth has been warming and cooling for 4. 5 billion years, My opponent would like to raise alarms by stating that the temperatures are rising at alarming rates, Yet he is only providing you with scientific data for the last 200 years. My fellow readers/voters do the right thing and vote for me as human global warming is FAKE NEWS",

            "premise": "I'm arguing that global climate change is not impacted by humans. My reasons for believing this are as follows: 1. Earth's climate has often warmed and cooled, and the recent rise in global temperature is within the borders of the natural temperature variations that have been recorded within the past 3,000 years. A study from 2013 claimed that the rising global temperatures that have been observed in the 20th century are similar to those observed around the 11th century. 2. Changes in global temperature are generally due to variations in the sun's heat, not by human activity. The majority of the observed climate changes between the 20th and 21st centuries has corresponded with multiple solar cycles. In 2012 it was discovered that there was a strong correlation between solar radiation and temperatures in the Arctic, not by human activity.3. The receding glaciers are not a result of human activity, but rather have been growing and receding for thousands of years due to natural causes. A 2014 study of over 2,000 glaciers in the Himalayas proved that 86.6% of the glaciers were not receding. Another study claimed that receding glaciers in Antarctica were due to \"atmospheric circulation changes\" that caused West Antarctica to warm rapidly. 4. CO2 is not the cause. In 2003, a study showed that over the past four climactic cycles (which have occurred during the past 240,000 years) warming has not followed, but rather preceded, a rise of CO2.Of the CO2 that humans have produced between 2002-2011, about 50% has been re-absorbed by earth's \"carbon sinks.\"Within the past 16 years there has been an 8% increase in atmospheric CO2, and still the earth has not warmed significantly. http://climatechange.procon.org...",

            "premise": "Timothy Ball has himself convinced that global warming is not real. Perhaps it's a matter of pride... it's human nature to want to be right, and I don't hold it against him. However, his opinions as stated in the article, are not supported by scientific data, and in some cases he's just plain wrong. According to Mr. Ball's article: \"No sensible person seeks conflict, especially with governments, but if we don't pursue the truth, we are lost as individuals and as a society. That is why I insist on saying that there is no evidence that we are, or could ever cause global climate change. And, recently, Yuri A. Izrael, Vice President of the United Nations sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed this statement. So how has the world come to believe that something is wrong?\" Mr. Ball's writing in this paragraph is poorly structured... Which statement did Yuri A. Izrael actually confirm? That \"there is no evidence that we are, or could ever cause global climate change\"? I highly doubt that. I seem to recall that the IPCC was created to investigate global warming and determine if there was any evidence supporting the human caused global warming theory. The thing of it is that the IPCC just recently came back with results supporting the idea that human (anthropomorphic) sources are a primary cause of the warming trend. An exact quote from the IPCC's 2007 report: \"Most of the observed increase in globally-averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations. It is likely there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent (except Antarctica).\" (this report is available at http://www.ipcc.ch...) Does the vice president of an organization that has confirmed climate change to be real actually dispute his own organization's opinion on the matter? Or could it be that Mr. Ball is cleverly attempting to dupe his readers into believing that his opinion is supported by the vice president of an international scientific research agency? Again, Mr. Ball's article: \"Since I obtained my doctorate in climatology from the University of London, Queen Mary College, England my career has spanned two climate cycles. Temperatures declined from 1940 to 1980 and in the early 1970's global cooling became the consensus. This proves that consensus is not a scientific fact. By the 1990's temperatures appeared to have reversed and Global Warming became the consensus. It appears I'll witness another cycle before retiring, as the major mechanisms and the global temperature trends now indicate a cooling.\" Global temperature did indeed dip between 1945 and 1976, but that dip was merely a hiccup in a larger trend. (a graph of average surface temperature change on earth over the past century is available here http://en.wikipedia.org...). In addition, Mr. Ball's assertion that \"the global temperature trends now indicate a cooling\" is patently ridiculous. Global temperature has consistently increased over the past 31 years, and shows no signs of stopping. In addition, Mr. Ball would like his readers to believe that the scientific community has not yet reached a general consensus supporting global warming. He is wrong (http://www.logicalscience.com...). Further on in his article, Mr. Ball makes reference to Richard Lindzen, a professor at MIT who is well known for claiming there isn't a consensus on global warming. An analysis of Lindzen's claims can be found here: http://www.logicalscience.com... In this debate I have provided evidence that releases of Carbon Dioxide from industrial sources have been responsible for an increase in atmospheric carbon. I have made the connection between Carbon Dioxide and the greenhouse effect, and I have shown that the greenhouse effect is primarily responsible for regulating earth's global temperature. Therefore, I have shown that industrial releases of Carbon Dioxide are primarily responsible for Earth's current warming trend. I commend my opponent for her bravery in taking a difficult position on this subject, and await her concluding remarks.",

About 10,000 years ago, the last Ice Age had come to an end with carbon dioxide levels at an all time low. As the temperature had some drastic changes, rising from about negative 8 degress celcius to about one degree celcius, the carbon dioxide levels continued on its downward slope before slowly rising until recent years when it sky-rocketed. Also, during the last era of warming about 115,000 years ago, the temperature had risen well above what we are experiencing now, yet the carbon dioxide levels were well below the average level ever recorded. Over the past century, the temperature has risen less than half of a degree even though the carbon dioxide levels are nearly twice the highest amount that have been recorded. b.) \"Within the 90,000-year Ice Age cycles, the Earth also experiences 1,500-year warming-cooling cycles. The current warming began about 1850 and will possibly continue for another 500 years. Their findings are drawn from physical evidence of past climate cycles that have been documented by researchers around the world.\" (Warming Caused by Natural Cycle, Not Humans.) This is the side of global warming according to Avery and Singer, two scientists studying climate change. Their research was compiled from years of research on tree rings, ice cores, prehistoric villages, fossils, titanium profiles and numerous other sources. 2.) burning fossil fuels only accounts for a small percent of greenhouse gases a.) The burning of fossil fuels by humans is most often the culprit of global warming but in Avery and Singers research they go on to say that the burning of fossil fuels has little effect on global warming and does not speed up the process. In fact, studies show that humans burning fossil fuels actually account for aprox. 18% of greenhouse gases. Other sources are main contributors. These sources are volcanoes, trees, and even cosmic rays from space can greatly increase greenhouse gases. b.) New research involving ice core results allow us to distinguish which came first, temperature change or change in CO2 levels. Scientists from an organization called icecap concluded that temperature change actually preceded change in CO2 levels by over 800 years. So in fact, temperature change actually causes CO2 levels to rise and NOT HUMANS.",

            "premise": "I am certain that the emission of green house gases produced through human activity has affected climates and temperatures world wide. There is no question about this in my mind. It is not even a matter of mere correlation really. Greenhouse gases trap heat and human beings are pumping out excessive amounts of ghg's into the Earth's atmosphere. I am not certain that human caused global warming is as big of a threat as the scientific community and popular media purport. Specifically, I am not convinced that the following claims are true: 1. Human caused global warming will accelerate the arrival of the next ice age (in less than 100 years). 2. Human caused global warming will result in large areas of land (such as the majority of Bangladesh) to become submerged in water (in less than 100 years). 3. Human caused global warming has lead to an increase in the frequency of hurricanes and other storms around the globe. I believe that BOP is on con to prove that the above statements are true. alternatively, Con can also argue that no one actually makes such statements about human caused global warming, and/or that there are other more serious effects that merit even greater media attention. My position is that human caused global warming is 'overhyped' because statements like 1,2, and 3 are regularly made but all of these predictions are difficult to back up with science because our current understanding and knowledge of climate patterns is very limited. Admittedly, there is a lot I need to learn about global warming and my primary aim here is to find out what I am missing.",

            "conclusion": "The American government should take an active role in stopping climate change",
            "premise": "\"I then further read under the category of \"What's Not Certain\" the EPA states it is not certain about \"Determining the relative contribution to climate change of human activities and natural causes.\"\" But in the section about what they do know, they say that they know that it's happening, and they know that it's caused by humans. They're just not certain about how much humans contribute, percentagewise. \"Furthermore, the EPA's research is under suspicion anyway. There are two EPA workers who are highly critical of the EPA's memo on carbon gas. The are critical of both the substances of and the process behind the agency's proposed findings\" The fact is, there is scientific evidence supporting climate change and the fact that it is caused at least significantly by humans. If you want to take a memo that may or may not have been slightly unsupportive towards the climate change plight and construe it so it looks like it is destroying years of scientific conjecture, well, I'm sorry, but that's not how it works. Do I wish that climate change wasn't happening, you bet I do. But unfortunately that's not the case. \"Additionally, in November of 2009, over 1,000 emails and more than 2,000 documents from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia were posted on the internet.\" Oy gevalt! You went there... To answer your argument, yes, I am aware of the scandal, but no, I do not believe that it means anything, other than the fact that deniers are going to be that much more difficult to deal with. As I said, it would be really nice if you were right, but the sad fact is that years of scientific conjecture are not going to change because of a few emails. These emails are just a red herring of sorts. But to claim that they overturn years of science and research is ludicrous at best. \"We are talking about an average over a long period of time to determine warming. Everyone would agree that one hour or one day of higher than normal temperatures does not constitute as a long enough time to establish global warming.\" You are correct, but the increased incidence of unusual occurrences and records make it clear that something is happening. For example, we have always had El Nino events, but they have become much more common and much stronger in recent years. If we didn't have that trend, an El Nino year would just mean that the south Pacific was warm at that particular point. Now, it means that the south Pacific is getting warmer, and it might not go back. \"The EPA report you continue to quote says that it is uncertain in \"Projecting future greenhouse emissions and how the climate system will respond within a narrow range.\" If your coveted EPA cannot project future climate changes, how can you?\" Greenhouse emissions are from people, my friend. We don't know how society will be in the future, and so we can't know how the climate will change if we don't know what we're going to be putting into the system. \"They continue to explain they aren't certain about \"Improving understanding of natural climatic variations, changes in the sun's energy, land-use changes, the warming or cooling effects of pollutant aerosols, and the impacts of changing humidity and cloud cover.\"\" I'm sorry, but Merlin does not run the EPA. You can try to tell Lisa Jackson that she needs to take psychic lessons. My point is, there is a fine line between following scientific trends and predicting the future. We can't study things that haven't happened yet, or are so new that we can't have seen the results. That is why they invented CFC's in the first place; because they didn't know that CFC's eat up the ozone layer. \"There are major scandals around covering up and hiding evidence that global warming does not exist.\" I agree with that whole statement except all of it. There are minor red herrings around scientific secrecy, most likely so other scientists won't discover what they're trying to discover before they discover it. Yes, I know that that's unfortunate, but it by no means disproves or even hurts the case for climate change. \"The EPA even admits that it is unclear as to how the human race effects climate change.\" I believe that to be a gross misinterpretation on your part. They are certain that humans, in some way or another, affect climate change. They just don't quite know exactly how or how much. \"I must defer back to you yet again after you read all this compelling evidence and explain that the burden or proof is yours to prove and without it, American Only regulations cannot be expected.\" You have shown me your \"evidence,\" but the burden of proof is, in fact, upon yourself to show how that \"evidence\" can be applied as anything other than a mildly interesting piece of information. I'm sorry, but a memo and some emails can't just negate every single piece of information I gave you. If that was how life worked, we wouldn't get anywhere. It is really irresponsible to interpret facts like that, because you are completely ignoring the vast majority of facts. (Can you tell how much I enjoy the argument that it is a scandal/hoax?) \"This 'hand picking' of evidence to prove climate stability and then a large spike in change raised many questions across the scientific community.\" Once again, how is this anything but a slightly interesting piece of trivia. You can analyze and scrutinize all of the more controversial aspects to the world's end, but you really need to look for the big picture. Basically, what I'm saying is that I really could care less about these so-called \"scandals\" because they do absolutely nothing to my argument, which you seem to have completely lost track of. \"very continent for someone who's data is the reason we have this global warming debate today.\" So, what you're saying is that, whether or not this was a hoax, this graph made us realize and study something which is very real. If you think that this is the only research that has been done, I don't see how you can be qualified to debate this. The fact is, the vast majority of the evidence that we have is absolutely real, peer reviewed data from independent labs. So, I don't want to hear about your scandals or conspiracy theories, because you are completely missing the point. The fact is, any data or theories opposing the idea of climate change absolutely pale in comparison to all of the evidence and conclusions that climate change is a very real problem with very real consequences and very real ways to prevent it. It is ignorant and irresponsible to deny that. As I said earlier, if there is any reasonable evidence that climate change is caused by humans, there is absolutely no reason to not be more responsible in what we do, just in case. Every single other country is leaps and bounds more responsible than the US in terms of environmental issues. Obviously it would be virtually impossible to spontaneously get 300 million people to be more responsible, so that's why the government needs to step in. There is nothing that says that the US has special rights to spew greenhouse gases into the environment at our own expense as well as the expense of the rest of the world. That is irresponsible. That is selfish. That is just incredibly, astoundingly, disgustingly stupid. It is an incredibly easy fix, and there is nothing more important. What kid doesn't grow up without wanting to save the world? Well, my friend, environmental protections very literally save the world. I would like to thank my opponent for making excellent arguments and, admittedly, being much friendlier than I. While my opponent has done a wonderful job, his arguments were completely unsupported by no fault of his own, but because there is nothing to support them with. It is a fact that humans cause climate change, and the government can very easily alleviate our impact. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to not vote PRO. Thank you.",

But human activities are now causing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases \" including carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, and nitrous oxide \" to rise well above pre-industrial levels. Carbon dioxide levels have increased from 280 ppm in 1750 to over 375 ppm today \" higher than any previous levels that can be reliably measured (i.e. in the last 420,000 years). Increasing greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise; the Earth\"s surface warmed by approximately 0.6 centigrade degrees over the twentieth century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that the average global surface temperatures will continue to increase to between 1.4 centigrade degrees and 5.8 centigrade degrees above 1990 levels, by 2100. What this means to humanity is that, unless some serious changes are made, the global climate will continue to shift so drastically that the world will not be the same as we know it in a century, or less. http://nationalacademies.org... The Natural Resources Defense Counsel, the primary community authority on global climate change clearly states that climate change is the single biggest environmental and humanitarian crisis of our time. The Earth's atmosphere is overloaded with heat-trapping carbon dioxide, which threatens large-scale disruptions in climate with disastrous consequences. What this means is that humans must act now to spur the adoption of cleaner energy sources at home and abroad, rather than trying to convince ourselves that global climate change is a hoax and letting the problem get worse before we address it. http://www.nrdc.org...",

Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.\" [1]Man-made climate change has already claimed human lives and continues to do so.\"in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke.\" [2]\"The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established. \" [3]\"The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30\u2009years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures.\" [4]\"The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%\u2013100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al \" [5]My argument is succinct and should prove that man-made climate change is extremely likely to exist. I will go a step further and explain why if there is so much scientific certainty,yet there is so much political uncertainty. This blame can be placed on the climate change denial movement funded by the fossil fuel industry.\"These organizations play a key role in the fossil fuel industry's \"disinformation playbook,\" a strategy designed to confuse the public about global warming and delay action on climate change. Why? Because the fossil fuel industry wants to sell more coal, oil, and gas\u2014 even though the science clearly shows that the resulting carbon emissions threaten our planet.\" [6] \"The fossil fuel industry risks losing $33 trillion in revenue over the next 25 years as global warming may drive companies to leave oil, natural gas and coal in the ground, according to a Barclays Plc energy analyst.Government regulations and other efforts to cut carbon emissions will inevitably slash demand for fossil fuels, jeopardizing traditional energy producers, Mark Lewis, Barclays\u2019s head of European utilities equity research, said Monday during a panel discussion in New York on financial risks from climate change.His comments are part of a growing chorus calling for more transparency from oil and gas companies about how their balance sheets may be affected by the global shift away from fossil fuels. As governments adopt stricter environmental policies, there\u2019s increasing risk that companies\u2019 untapped deposits of oil, gas and coal may go unused, turning valuable reserves into stranded assets of questionable value.\u201cThere will be lower demand for fossil fuels in the future, and by definition that means lower prices\u201d Lewis said.\" [7]\"The Koch Brothers have sent at least $88,810,770 directly to 80 groups denying climate change science since 1997.\" [8]\"Fossil fuel firms are still bankrolling climate denial lobby groups \" [9]\"One of the world\u2019s most prominent climate researchers publishing scientific papers that doubt humanity\u2019s role in climate change has received at least $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry to fund his research and salary, according to documents revealed this weekend.Wei-Hock Soon (known mainly as \u201cWillie\u201d) is aerospace engineer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and has written papers on how the sun\u2019s role in the Earth\u2019s climate outshines the warming impact of humans burning fossil fuels.\" [10]\"Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, represents Rhode Island in the Senate.Fossil fuel companies and their allies are funding a massive and sophisticated campaign to mislead the American people about the environmental harm caused by carbon pollution.Their activities are often compared to those of Big Tobacco denying the health dangers of smoking. Big Tobacco\u2019s denial scheme was ultimately found by a federal judge to have amounted to a racketeering enterprise.\" [11]\"Right now, we have an energy policy that is rigged to boost the profits of big oil companies like Exxon, BP, and Shell at the expense of average Americans. CEO\u2019s are raking in record profits while climate change ravages our planet and our people \u2014 all because the wealthiest industry in the history of our planet has bribed politicians into complacency in the face of climate change. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time for a political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires, accelerates our transition to clean energy, and finally puts people before the profits of polluters. \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders\" [12]The fossil fuel industry is a racketeering enterprise and must answer for their crimes.

            "premise": "The majority of your previous post was a continuation of the arguments that I pointed out were incorrect in my previous posts. Plausibility does not mean reality. Yes, I agree that one can prove and have proven that co2 can act as a green house gas and can theoretically warm the planet. Where I disagree is that co2 has been proven to be the cause of global warming. Yes, I will agree that in miniscule amounts it probably does warm the planet. I do not think though that it has been proven that it raises temperatures significantly. Even in your 'runaway' co2 warming hypothesis, there is not evidence that co2 causes additional warming. The co2 is the effect, not the cause of warming. But I will take this further and argue that the entire field of climate science is too uncertain for any to be able to prove that man made global warming is fact. Consider http://www.sciencedaily.com... \"The researchers estimate that this effect could cut by two-thirds the projected increase in global temperatures initiated by a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\" How do you know that increasing co2 didn't 'cause' this vent to work? Or any other natural self regulation? It's the same with co2 acting as a fertizer for more plant growth. Not to mention our minimal knowledge of cloud formation. And I do not agree with your contention that solar variability is irrelevent: http://www.theminorityreportblog.com... Variations in solar energy as a driver for global climate change have been wholly discounted by the IPCC and climate modellers on the basis that something they call Total Solar Irradiance has not changed enough between 1975 and 1998 to make a significant contribution to the climate warming observed during that period. It is because solar influences have been discounted that the IPCC and climate modellers have been determined to attribute most of the observed warming during that period to an enhanced greenhouse effect caused by CO2 produced by human activity. Consequently the climate models currently in use contain no solar effects as a component. This article shows that they are wrong and that, in fact, solar energy is and always has been the overwhelming primary driver for global temperature with CO2 such a minor component that it should be ignored. Due to the differences in scale between the solar effect and the effect of CO2 the latter is only ever going to have a marginal effect at and around the peak of any natural warming trend and is unlikely to activate any tipping point that would not have been activated by natural cause. Indeed, during natural cooling spells CO2 will be a wholly beneficial mitigating factor. This article will then go on to identify the additional parameters apart from solar activity that will need to be measured to give us a workable if approximate predictor of global temperature movements. Showing that solar energy has been the predominant driver throughout history prior to the industrial revolution is not difficult.\" There is so much unknown and so much complexity that at this point it is impossible to categorically say that man is causing global warming.",

            "premise": "Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. My partner and I stand in firm negation of the resolution. We feel it necessary to define the following terms: Developed Country- is a sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations. Moral Obligation- an obligation arising out of considerations of right and wrong. Morals are assessed based on the cost and benefits of a situation. Climate Change- Climate change, is a change in the typical or average weather of a region or city. Climate change is also a change in Earth's overall climate. This could be a change in Earth's average temperature. -NASA Contention 1: Humans have little effect on climate change and yet take on much of the blame for the situation. Subpoint A:Contrary to popular belief, humans have very little effect on Earth\"s changing climate. Most changes to climate are a result of geological or natural events, which we have ZERO control over. These include Solar output, Volcanism, Earth\"s orbital changes, and Plate tectonics. These might seem like they make minor differences, but these are responsible for short and long term climate fluctuations, including ice ages; and it can be agreed on that a massive cooling of the Earth for ten thousand years is a major change in climate. The earth has been going through cycles of cooling and warming for the last ten thousand years, and we have evidence which shows we are actually in a global cooling, which is part of Earth\"s natural patterns. Why would us humans have any sort of obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate change is a natural process which we have no control over. Trying to change a natural cycle that has been going on for million of years is completely impossible, and we have no moral obligation to do something impossible. Subpoint B:Humans are incorrectly accused of the recent warming of the climate. However, this cycle of heating has been happening since humans weren\"t even fully evolved. A quote from an article of Climate Physics states \"About 450 million years ago the temperature dropped significantly even though the CO2 concentration was about 12 times higher than today. This disproves the hypothesis that CO2 causes global warming.\" This is also backed up scientifically. A graph titled \"As carbon dioxide increases it has less warming effect\" shows and explains how we can DOUBLE the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere with an almost unnoticeable increase in temperature. Increasing carbon dioxide levels also does not affect the atmosphere. This is because as the concentration of Co2 increases, so does the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in equal amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Contention 2: Climate change won\"t have a major impact on human lives Climate change as a result of human activities doesn\"t have a major impact on human lives. Conclusion: Why we aren\"t obliged Because humans are such a minor influence in climate change, we have no obligation to mitigate climate change. Why would we spend money to change the weather, and a lot of money at that. A book on globalizing renewable energy by 2030 states the cost to do so \"might be on the order of $100 trillion worldwide, over 20 years, not including transmission.\" Alternate forms of energy also have major drawbacks, besides being very cost heavy, and these drawbacks do developed countries more harm than good. we have no control over climate change, and even if we did there is no need to worry, as the climate is just following natural patterns.",

            "conclusion": "Anthropogenic Climate Change Exists",
            "premise": "Since 2000, CO2 has risen by 54% with no increase in global temperatures. Why? Pro cannot provide a good answer to that question, and neither can the IPCC. The theory that CO2 dominates climate is therefore wrong. It may be that CO2 is contributing to warming at some level, but that a greater cooling factor is swamping the CO2 effect. If that's the case, there is no basis for supposing that CO2 will dominate climate in the future, because whatever cooling dominated the past 17 years may be the same or greater in the future. The IPCC cannot explain why a 54% increase in CO2 produced no increase in temperature. As described in [8], Von Storch systematically ran all the IPCC computer models of the climate, and found that the actual temperatures for the last 17 years fell outside the model predictions. That's after the models had been tweaked using knowledge of the lack of global warming. The models still could not describe the past, so clearly they cannot be counted on to predict the future. Pro only offers at base the fallacious logic that correlation means causation. But when CO2 increases by 54% in the past 17 years, and there is no increase in global temperature, then even the correlation claim fails. Solar activity correlates well with global temperature for the past 17 years, for the entire 20the century and for as long as records of sunspot activity have been kept, which is back through the Middle Ages. Solar activity is discounted by CO2 theorists on the grounds that the measured irradiance of the sun, i.e.. the heat output, has not changed enough in recent decades to account for the temperature changes. However, solar activity produces changes in cosmic ray levels, and there is a theory that cosmic rays have an effect that changes cloud cover. The solar cosmic ray theory is also one of correlation, and cannot be considered causation until the mechanism is proved. However, unlike CO2 theory, the correlation actually holds over long and short periods. There is a close correlation of solar sunspot activity and global temperature for the past century. [10. http://www.tmgnow.com...] The past 17 years has been at the leveling off and start of a downward trend in sunspots after a period of increase during the 1980s and 1990s. [11. http://notrickszone.com...] Historical reconstruction shows CO2 does not dominate climate I pointed to reconstructions of climate for the distant past and the for the past 2000 years to show that climate has varied more than in recent years, and without any apparent relation to atmospheric CO2 levels. Pro argues that past climate doesn't count because we are only discussing the past century and the next century. Past climate counts because the laws of physics do not change at all over time. Consequently, if factors other than CO2 have always dominated climate, then it's unreasonable to suppose that a new CO2-only physics began recently. Pro's principle argument is that correlation proves causation. If there was no such correlation in the past, that is not sustained. Since the chance correlation only applies for a short time, it's important to Pro's case that we not look at the hundreds, thousands, and millions of years when there was no such correlation.Here are the two climate reconstructions referenced in the previous round: The climate of the past 2000 years shows there is nothing special about the past century. Climate has always been changing by about as much as in the past century, and often more. Global warming hockey stick discredited The global warming hockey stick was presented in the 2000 IPCC report. It purported to show that the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were local to Europe and that climate had not changed substantially in the past 1000 years, until the warming from 1983-1997. The statistical error used in the calculation yielding the hockey stick was discovered by McKitrick. [12. \"The Mann et al Northern Hemisphere 'Hockey Stick': A Tale of Due Diligence.\" published in \"Shattered Consensus\" edited by Patrick Michaels]. A good summary by a scientist who believes in human-caused global warming is from the MIT magazine Technology Review. [13. http://www.technologyreview.com...] The Wikipedia article, heavily biased towards CO2 theory claims that the hockey stick has since been proved because a recent analysis shows that recent temperatures were higher than the Medieval Warm Period [14. http://en.wikipedia.org...] However, the accompanying graph shows that the MWP and the Little Ice Age existed as worldwide climate change, which is what the hockey stick was mainly supposed to disprove. The most recent reconstruction [3] clearly disproves the hockey stick. CO2 follows temperature increase That CO2 lags temperature in past climate is well known, but I apologize for giving the wrong link in the previous round. A journal article published in 2012 gives the result: \u201cOur analyses of ice cores from the ice sheet in Antarctica shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere follows the rise in Antarctic temperatures very closely and is staggered by a few hundred years at most,\u201d - Sune Olander Rasmussen [15. Watt provides graphs and links the Rasmussen paper http://wattsupwiththat.com...] Another set of graphs showing the lag is given at [16. http://joannenova.com.au...]Total sea ice is at a highPro argued that shrinking Arctic ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. I pointed out that Antarctic ice is expanding, contradicting CO2 theory, and in keeping with the historically observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Pro responded that the ice doesn't melt until above the freezing point. Sure, but how was melting Arctic ice supposed to prove CO2 theory? The Antarctic ice has rapidly expanded since 2010, when Al Gore predicted it would be all gone by 2013. What this proves is that CO2 is not dominating climate. The natural PDO, not in the CO2 climate models is dominating the ice levels. The PDO seems to be linked to the second of three overlapping solar cycles, but the causation is unproved. Future CO2 levels are unknown I noted that even if CO2 dominates climate, there is no confident prediction of future CO2 levels. Nearly everyone agrees that the world is running out of fossil fuels, so there is an aggressive search for alternatives. A technological breakthrough, or a simple substantial rise in the price of oil could substantially lower the rate of CO2 increase. Pro did not respond.",

            "premise": "While a healthy sense of skepticism is always recommended, it is unfortunately the case that the issue of Global Climate Change has become politicized and that the small amount of skepticism on GCC has been over-hyped by the various well-funded industries that don't want the government to take action with pollution and efficiency controls. When surveyed, the vast majority of climate scientists (from organizations such as the National Academies of Science) believe that human activity is to blame for the recent climate changes, though some may disagree on the severity. First, it's inaccurate to characterize the position of the pro-Global Warming/Global Climate Change crowd as believing that the earth is \"melting.\" It is their contention that human activity has finally reached the capacity (through our advanced industrial state) of being able to influence the planet's climate by throwing off-kilter the self-regulating mechanisms that keep our climate stable. Second, the sentence beginning with \"According to Accu-Weather\" is an unattributed secondhand quote from the anti-Global Warming website globalwarming.org (maintained by the \"Cooler Heads Coalition\" which is an anti-global warming front group backed by a variety of conservative think tanks and carbon industry proponents). Further, the quote does not come from AccuWeather (as it is attributed), which does not take a position on the issue of Global Climate Change; rather they provide a forum for various persons on either side of the aisle to present their cases. It's likely that the quote should be attributed to one or another of those individuals. Ignoring the source of the AccuWeather quote, measuring temperature and carbon output over the past few decades is insufficient as a much larger sample size is required to draw accurate conclusions about the nature of the climate changes we're currently experiencing. When one expands the record over millions of years (with the data we have available from ice cores and other data collection forms), it becomes apparent that we are experiencing an unprecedented warming trend, and that carbon output levels are at an all-time high. When combining instrumental temperature records for the past 150 years with \"proxy indicators\" like ice cores and tree rings, we can construct a picture of the global temperature that shows a marked increase in temperature beginning in the 19th century (Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1999; Crowley and Lowery, 2000). These findings are verified by nearly a dozen other model- and proxy-based reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere. The quote \"about 80% of the CO2 from human activities was added to the air after 1940\" is also an unattributed secondhand quote pulled from a source I can't identify. The simplest refutation of it is the fact that the rise of industrialism pre-dates 1940. It's not as though 1940 was the first year a coal-fired power plant went into operation; quite the contrary \u2013 coal, for example, has been mined and burned for industrial operations since the end of the 18th century. Assuming the statistic is true; it should stand as an alarming example of how rapidly CO2 output has increased in recent decades. The period of cooling between the 40s and the 70s is attributed by many to sulphate aerosols. Not only that, but it's important not to focus too closely on CO2 given that it is estimated to be responsible for only about 25 percent of the greenhouse effect at most \u2013 there are plenty of other influential greenhouse gases and other factors that weigh in. Ironically, the period of cooling is a superb example of how much human activity can affect the climate: when chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were banned virtually worldwide in the 1980s \u2013 it had a striking observable effect on the phenomenon of ozone depletion. The claim about Antarctica warming is patently false. Quoting from NASA's article \"Two Decades of Temperature Change in Antarctica\" on its Earth Observatory site: \"Across most of the continent and the surrounding Southern Ocean, temperatures climbed.\" The British Antarctic Survey concluded likewise, saying that the Antarctic Peninsula is \"one of the fastest warming parts of the planet\" in its article \"Climate Change.\" It's possible (given the other unattributed statistics and quotes) that the claim about Antarctica was taken from fiction author Michael Crichton's shoddily-researched book \"State of Fear\" in which Crichton (a global warming skeptic) misappropriated research by Peter Doran to make a similar claim. Doran publicly rebuffed Crichton (and all other Global Warming skeptics misusing his data) by saying \"...our results have been misused as \"evidence\" against global warming by Crichton in his novel 'State of Fear'...\". With respect to the final claim, I can find zero evidence that the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Project has found that Antarctica has cooled. Quite the contrary \u2013 instead of being Global Climate Change skeptics, the NRS's LTER recognizes the significant consequences of Global Warming, stating on its website: \"The study of Global Change is particularly important as it is now clear that human social and economic activities around the world are having an impact that can be measured at the level of the entire Earth and its atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Human activities are probably the most rapidly changing component among the major regulators of the Earth system, and may\u2014in the future\u2014play a dominant role in the regulation of global climate, global biogeochemistry, and the diversity and stability of global ecosystems.\"",

            "premise": "Hello Muslimnomore! \"I am certain that the emission of green house gases produced through human activity has affected climates and temperatures world wide. There is no question about this in my mind. It is not even a matter of mere correlation really.\" Great! This we can agree on. \"1. Human caused global warming will accelerate the arrival of the next ice age (in less than 100 years).\" They used to say this during the \"global warming\" days, but since the model has shifted to \"climate change\" most scientists agree that co2 actually does the opposite. It heats up our planet in certain areas, but this causes polar caps and icebergs to melt, sending cold waters towards the equator and causing certain areas to actually cool rather than warm. It was 73 F in New York on Dec. 24th, 2013. Then again: http://www.usatoday.com... It is 52 here in Va, highly unusual. And very miserable, might I add. \"The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human-induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years.\" Some of the dangers we face are extreme climates, heightened sea levels (flooding), and much greater ocean acidity (already up about 30% since the industrial revolution). http://climate.nasa.gov... So no, it won't accelerate our ice age, but that doesn't mean it isn't bad. \"2. Human caused global warming will result in large areas of land (such as the majority of Bangladesh) to become submerged in water (in less than 100 years).\" \"Rising sea level is a threat to people who live near the ocean. Some low-lying areas will have more frequent flooding, and very low-lying land could be submerged completely. Rising sea level can also harm important coastal ecosystems like mangrove forests and coral reefs.\" -- http://epa.gov... \"climate change is expected to substantially increase these already high relative rates by increasing the global rate of sea-level rise. Although the response of ice sheets to warmer temperatures can not be predicted, there is a consensus that sea level rise will accelerate as ocean waters expand and glaciers retreat.\" -- http://www.epa.gov... \"3. Human caused global warming has lead to an increase in the frequency of hurricanes and other storms around the globe.\" \"The latest science connecting hurricanes and global warming suggests more is yet to come. Tropical storms are likely to bring: higher wind speeds; more precipitation; and bigger storm surge in the coming decades. Over the course of this century, maximum wind speeds could increase 2-11 percent and rainfall could increase 3-31 percent.\" -- http://www.nwf.org... Also, \"Warming-driven sea level rise makes storm surges more destructive; increased water vapor in the atmosphere leads to 5 to 10% more rainfall and increases the risk of flooding; because water vapor and higher ocean temperatures help fuel the storm, it is likely to be more intense and bigger as well; and the unusual path of the storm...caused by a very strong blocking high pressure system that recent studies have linked to warming. \" -- http://thinkprogress.org... I hope I have answered all of your questions regarding climate change!",

            "conclusion": "Climate change is real and caused by humans",
            "premise": "Okay first off, you keep saying climate change is real. IT IS! the climate changes constantly according to the season. We are arguing that that GLOBAL WARMING isn't real. All you are doing is rebutting my arguments saying that they are not caused by humans, so in saying, your saying I'm correct. You have made no arguments suggesting that humans cause global warming, because there is none. All you have said is that most Scientist agree with global warming and that they believe that humans are a main cause of it, but yet where is the evidence. I can't find anything to rebut so let me make more arguments. Some of the cause is in the arctic; the polar ice caps are melting faster than it can be evaporated .This process may be reversed in 10-20 years. Humans are only responsible for less than 3 % of all the carbon dioxide (greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere. Geologists Nicholas Chackleton and Neil Opdyke both from Cambridge University wrote in a quaternary research journal. Estimating the average world temperature has been slowly increasing over the last one million years, long before the human industries started releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. People think Carbon dioxide sent in to the atmosphere today will affect people hundreds of years later. But the truth is Carbon Dioxide has a life span of 20 years. After 20 years, it disappears from the atmosphere all together. The sun actually has little to do with actually heating the atmosphere with its high frequency radiation. Something as hot as the sun can\"t give off low frequency radiation called infrared. Instead, the sun\"s rays heats the Earth\"s surface, this weakens the radiation to infrared. From there it moves in to the earth\"s atmosphere by any means necessary (Conduction, convection, evaporation). Then the inferred radiation is absorbed by the CO2. Ninety seven percent of the heat in the atmosphere gets there either through convection or evaporation, and not greenhouse gasses. The climate now days have made minimal changes compared to the dinosaur ages. Water evaporation is a bigger cause of global warming than carbon dioxide by at least 100 times. The earth has been here for more than 4 billion years. The human industry has only been around for around 200 years. The earth has been warming since the dinosaur ages. Without a doubt, humans have caused minimal changes to our environment as it is already warming itself. Nature is sending Carbon dioxide in to out atmosphere by natural disasters. For example, the eruption of Mt. St Helens has sent more carbon dioxide in to the atmosphere than humans have for over decades. In fact, that eruption actually caused global cooling of 1 degree. According to scientific researcher Tim Ball, who has received a PhD from Cambridge University, the earth goes through a natural Climate cycle. In 1940-1980, the earth was actually facing global cooling. In 1980-2020, the earth\"s temperature should be reversing, and gradually start warming naturally. This is my opinion, the earth used to have frozen rivers, and frozen mountains, but since humans came to live, more and more carbon dioxide has been inserted in to the atmosphere. It is not because of Burning fossil fuels, but because humans breathe. It\"s not our fault we breathe, it\"s completely natural. Humans must breathe to survive. For example, more and more babies are born everyday; they all breathe and release Carbon Dioxide in to the atmosphere. Human input to the greenhouse gasses are as much as 1% more per year more than last year\"s average. If 1% is that great of a difference, then all like on earth would have been destroyed long ago. So how could humans cause global warming if global warming was around before humans even existed? Sources: http://scienceray.com...",

Yes, humans give off heat, but unless you can prove that our collective body temperatures are somehow raising global temperatures, then this statement cannot be true. \" Humans are causing the rise in clobal temperature, which if not stopped will result in global warming.\" -The natural cycle of global warming cannot be stopped. For thousands of years the Earth has had a warming period in which the ice caps melt, the sea levels rise, and weather patterns are drastically affected which in result cause global cooling- the Earth's natural protection mechanism which brings about periodic ice ages. Because of the dynamic between our atmospherical makeup, our proximity to the sun, and other factors like the moon's effect on tides- global warming cannot be stopped.",

            "premise": "The task at hand is to \"...contend that anthropogenic climate change is non-existent.\" From a common definition anthropogenic means relating to, or resulting from the influence of human beings on nature. Then, from common usage \"climate change\" means a harmful rise in global temperature. This could be a difficult task. The earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% trace gases including CO2.[1] Assume (for this paragraph only) that the small trace gas of CO2 (.04%) is the cause of global warming. The focus here will be upon sources of CO2 emissions both natural and manmade. The source emissions of CO2 would by a most rational people would be the cause of global warming. According to the IPCC 800 gigatons of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from nature and man, annually.[2] Most rational people would consider a source that is most than 51% to be the cause of a problem. Some irrational people might try to argue that 33% would be a threshold for cause. Only, crazy people would state that something that is less than 5% could be consider the cause. That brings us to the percent of total CO2 emissions from mankind. That percent of CO2 emissions is 3.62% (29 from man of 800 total gigatons)! [2] This 3.62% can not be the cause of global warming. Now, questioning if CO2 is the cause of global warming. The alarmist side uses thresholds in parts per million (PPM). 400 PPM sounds scary and 0.04% is at an insanely small amount, both numbers are the same. Imagine, how quick the alarmists arguments would be dismissed if they said that 0.04% of atmospheric gases drove global climate. Then if combined with only 3.6% of annual CO2 emissions is from man, this is an incredibly small number that man is responsible for. Using just common sense methods, it becomes very hard to believe claims made by alarmists. Anyone attempting to say 3.6% is the cause of a problem would be laughed at. Especially, when the gas in question is exhaled by each one of us. The real reasons for climate change to be anthropogenic is political and financial. Just federal grants for climate change related projects is greater than $10 billion.[3] Scientists are just as financially motivated as anyone else. A climate scientist that is outside of the mainstream will not be funded. This creates incentives to stay in agreement with those in political power. Anthropogenic climate change as a political is prefect for oppressive progressive politicians. The solutions to this false issue are more governmental control over the daily lives of harmless people. The politicians have scientist by the purse strings, this ensures compliance. This debate is about causes not effects, thus positive and negative impacts will not be addressed. 1. http://climate.ncsu.edu... 2. http://www.climatechange2013.org... 3. http://www.gao.gov...",

            "premise": "I will restate, than in order to establish that the primary cause of global warming is human activity, it is necessary to quantify the amount and effect (not qualify). No scientist or scientific body to date, to my knowledge, has been able to do so. Specifically, anyone making the assertion that humans are the primary cause of global warming must scientifically establish/prove what percentage is human as compare to natural variability and natural causes. It is not good enough to use terms such as \"significant\" and \"substantially\" as they are extremely vague inconclusive terms. An even worse approach is to take the line of reasoning presented on the timeforchange.org site referenced by my opponent, which virtually ignores the question/possibility of natural factors. I will reference the following chart by Climatologist Cliff Harris and Meteorologist Randy Mann to illustrate my position: http://www.longrangeweather.com... Note that on this chart there have been two periods with higher and more prolonged global warming periods in 1100 BC and 1300 AD (up to two-fold greater). My opponent also dismissed the importance of the naturally occurring little ice-age, yet its effect was over three-fold greater than our so called current \"human\" caused warming period. Being that natural causes are scientifically established to have created global temperature swings 3 times larger, and hundreds of years longer in duration than our current warming period (as recent as 1600 - 1800 AD), it is complete pseudo-science to claim that natural cycles play an insignificant role in global temperature change. In fact, being that we are presently in a period where we would naturally expect to see a warming period in the natural global temperature cycle, one would expect that human activity would have created the largest warming event in the last 5000 years. The chart/link I presented establishes that this kind of warming simply hasn't happened. The evidence I presented could even be used as an argument that Mankind's impact on global warming is negligible as compared to natural variability. Lastly, I acknowledge that my sources attribute a portion of climate change to human activity, but again, \"significant\" and \"substantially\" is not a quantification as I asserted earlier. I would ask that my opponent reference scholarly material that definitively establishes that human activity outweighs all other possible natural elements and variables in global climate change.",

Scientific consensus.Claim: A scientific consensus exists for anthropogenic climate change existence. Warrant:\"Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals1 show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.\" [0]Impact: A scientific consensus is an agreement upon experts in the field. Think of one hundred heart surgeons agreeing upon a heart surgery technique. Heart surgeons would have more credibility than brain surgeons, dentists, and dermatologist. Even though all four are doctors, only the heart surgeons are most qualified on the subject of heart surgery. The same is true for climate scientists. A geologist, a physicist, and a biologist are all scientists. Yet, only climate scientists are the top notch for qualifications. These are the experts of experts in the field of climate science. There is nobody more qualified then this group of people. The fact that they came to a consensus based upon multiple lines of empirical evidence, used social calibration to determine what qualified as evidence, and social diversity, from many different parts of the world gives an enormous impact. The reason why social diversity is important is to avoid groupthink which can taint the consensus. \"What Is Groupthink?Groupthink occurs when a group values harmony and coherance over accurate analysis and critical evaluation. It causes individual members of the group to unquestioningly follow the word of the leader and it strongly discourages any disagreement with the concensus. \" [1]Here is the peer reviewed sources that confirm the scientific consensus. \"J. Cook, et al, \"Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature,\" Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (15 May 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024Quotation from page 3: \"Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus.

Co2 is the main driver.Claim: Co2 matter because the gas absorbs infrared radiation. Warrant:\"Molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) can absorb energy from infrared (IR) radiation. This animation shows a molecule of CO2 absorbing an incoming infrared photon (yellow arrows). The energy from the photon causes the CO2 molecule to vibrate. Shortly thereafter, the molecule gives up this extra energy by emitting another infrared photon. Once the extra energy has been removed by the emitted photon, the carbon dioxide stops vibrating.\" [2]Impact: Co2 absorbing infrared radiation plays a crucial part in the greenhouse gas rising of Earth's temperature. Claim: Co2 makes up 81% of the greenhouse gases.Warrant: [3] Pie graph should display here. Impact: This shows that Co2 is the main driver of climate change. III. The Co2 is from humans in lieu of natural. Claim: We know the Co2 is from humans due to human finger prints. Warrant: [4] Impact: These show that the Co2 is human caused as opposed to natural. IV. Other supporting evidenceThere is other supporting evidence, the over 400 ppm of Co2, sea level rise, global temperature rise which is now at 1.7 degree Fahrenheit, warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, and many more. These all reinforce that anthropogenic climate change is happening. [5]V.

            "premise": "I thank 101 for accepting!ARGUMENTSC1. Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksCarbon dioxide has a significant influence on global land-sea mean temperature. All scientists agree that CO2 has some direct effect, increasing temperature by 1.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. David Evans argues, \"Most serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with government climate scientists about the effect of CO2. The argument is about the feedbacks.\" [1]Climate sensitivity is the key point in all of climate science. It refers to, in this context, the rise in equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature per doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A 2005 study by Nir Joseph Shaviv confirms that the climate sensitivity, without any amplification, is 1.1 degrees Celsius. [2] The debate is about the feedbacks. What is a feedback? A feedback is a climate process that amplifies or dampens the effect of a climate forcing. A climate forcing is any factor that influences temperature increase, in this case referring to CO2. So, a feedback is anything that amplifies or dampens the effect of CO2 on climate. Feedbacks that amplify it are called positive feedbacks, while those that dampen it are negative ones. [3] I argue that positive feedbacks dominate climate, and therefore, increase the overall effect of CO2 on temperature. Various studies report positive feedbacks as more likely. Soden and Held report a 2 degree celsius climate sensitivity due to positive feedbacks. The study reports very few negative feedbacks. \"Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.\" [4] A 2003 study by Colman reports a feedback of nearly 3 degrees celsius, and the paper is cited by Soden and Held. In the study, a \"comparison is performed for water vapour, cloud, albedo and lapse rate feedbacks taken from published results of 'offline' feedback calculations for general circulation models (GCMs) with mixed layer oceans performing 2 x CO2 and solar perturbation experiments.\" [5] There is much evidence outside climate models as well. Wigley, et al. report a possible sensitivity of greater than 4.5 degrees celsius due to volcanic forcings, and supports an average sensitivity of 3.5 degrees. The study says, \"After the maximum cooling for low-latitude eruptions, the temperature relaxes back toward the initial state with an e-folding time of 29\u201343 months for sensitivities of 1\u20134 degrees C equilibrium warming for CO2 doubling.\" [6] A 2005 study by Forster and Gregory also uses volcanic forcings and feedbacks, and finds a climate sensitivity range of 1 - 4.1 degrees Celsius. [7] Even in a hypothetical scenario where negative feedbacks cancel out positive feedbacks to a climate sensitivity of 1 degree C, research by Ziskin and Shaviv (2011) has predicted that \"the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources.\" [8] They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming. Nonetheless, climate sensitivity is likely much higher than that. Research by Patrick Michaels, a CATO scholar, found that the amplifier was 1.6 degrees C. [9] This means that human activity causing global warming is much greater than 57%, even under these low estimates. I still maintain that sensitivity is somewhere around 2 - 3 degrees C. A study by leading climatologist JD Annan -- using the Bayesian statistical approach -- found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees Celsius. [10] The following graph displays the literature on carbon dioxide sensitivity. The following picture portrays the evidence regarding climate sensitivity. As such, I conclude that the effect of the rise in CO2 on climate is huge.C2. Paleoclimate The paleoclimatological record is clear that CO2 has become the chief climate forcing in the Cenozoic Era (which began after the Cretaceous mass-extinction event 65.5 million years ago). Overall, solar activity has increased by 40% in this period. James E. Hansen and Makiko Sato argue, \"The sun\u2019s brightness increased steadily through the Cenozoic, by about 0.4 percent according to solar physics models (Sackmann et al., 1993). Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2 . This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era...CO2 [has been] the dominant forcing in the Cenozoic.\" [11] The below graph depicts the correlations between CO2 and temperatures over the past 200,000 years. The temperature changes correspond to the changes in CO2 levels. Take the example of the Vostok ice cores. A study by French and Russian institutes says, \"There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.\" [12] There is proof that it is warmer now than since the Medieval Warm Period. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400. Thus, paleoclimatology confirms that CO2 influences climate at huge levels.C3. Human ActivityI have now established that CO2 is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 65%. Now, I must establish that humans are responsible for much of CO2 generation. First, a simple correlation -- CO2 levels rose with the beginning of industrial activity. [13] If the ratio between C-14 and C-12 decline, the observation would virtually confirm that human activity is responsible for increase in CO2 concentration. This is because the CO2 emissions humans make come from fossil fuels. This has been observed. [14, 15] UNDERVIEWI have shown the following:a. Climate sensitivity is likely high, and positive feedbacks dominate climate, suggesting that carbon dioxide can significantly influence global land-sea mean and atmopsheric temperatures. b. The paleoclimatological record demonstrates that carbon dioxide has been the most major climate forcing in the Cenozoic Era, which began 65.5 million years ago. c. Human activity is the main driving force behind rise in CO2 concentrations, and there is (1) a documented rise in CO2 concentrations, and (2) a correlation between carbon dioxide and temperature records.

Now for my reliance on NASA for my source, well I used it specifically because it is more well known than than the other sources I found and if you want them then tell if so in your statement and I will happily send you some of them. A scholarly article written by Thomas R. Karl (a climatologist that is the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\"s National Climatic Data Center.) states, \"The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition.\" Now another source I used which granted is from the EPA (but I didn't want to use NASA for my only source) states that the temperature is rose at 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit last century, however it also states small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather.

I have to clarify some things, because I don\"t think we have a debate here. First, the title is plain wrong. Climate change happens regardless of human activity. It \"can be explained by natural causes, such as changes in solar energy, volcanic eruptions, and natural changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations.\" (the same EPA source as my opponent). The last time CO2 levels were as high as today, it was around 15 million years ago. During that time, species still thrived. Second, burning fossil fuels is the most cost-effective, and the least damaging. Yes, I said least damaging. I won\"t get into how because that is not the subject of our debate. Here are just a few: [2] http://news.nationalgeographic.com... [3] http://www.newscientist.com... Long gone is the time when most scientists scratched their heads about ice caps melting. Yes, 2014 is the hottest year. Yes, climate change is happening. But at the same time, we are putting planks for a global cooling, in a sense. As of right now, I can safely say we are utilizing more renewable energy than at any other time in our existence. As for my opponents sources, I don\"t see any of them mentioning that. I\"m sorry, but the subject of your sources (yubanet, epa, time, scientific american) either state what global warming is, or are in redundant in stating \"2014 is the hottest year\". None of them are the subject of human activity causing global warming. If you still insist of debating the topic, I would be glad to, although as I\"ve mentioned, there really is no debate.",

            "premise": "Round four defense\"This argument that a consensus proves anything is preposterous, for a multitude of reasons. Number one, the consensus cited. This consensus reviewed 928 abstracts published in scientific journals. 928 is a somewhat large number, but not large enough to make a point off of, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of scientists in this field in the U.S alone [1]. Number two, consensuses are not reliable arguments, especially in the world of science. Scientists had consensuses on many things that turned out to be wrong, such as that saccharin led to cancer, and that the Sun's energy was a requirement for life. This consensus on climate change could be wrong as well.\" RepconFirst my opponent states there are hundreds of thousands of scientists within this field. That may be true, but considering each journal interviews has multiple scientist opinions changes the numbers. Furthermore, science magazine was not the only source I used. Finally, my opponent links to a long article in his/her source #1. My opponent has not met his/her burden of proof by quoting the relevant information. Having me proof a negative, that the information is not within the source would put an unfair burden on me.\"he consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%\u2013100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers\" [5]As seen here there are 11,944 abstracts reviewed in this article. As for the consensus changing, my opponent is correct, that science does come to incorrect conclusions and theories are changed to meet the new information. Despite this, this not a coin flip situation. The probability is very high that the scientists are correct in their current assessment. That man-made global climate change is real. \"In the report I just showed about death rates from weather-related disasters, Indur M. Goklany goes into that exact study, and debunks it, saying that,\"Notably, the contribution of extreme events to the mortality burden for accidental causes of death is also small (at 0.4 percent).\"Saying that we need to double down on climate change because it is .4% of the reason for accidental deaths (Not even a full percentage) is quite ridiculous.Goklany also says that,\"Although the review paper\"s estimates for non-flood related deaths are problematic, if one accepts them as valid, that means that climate change currently accounts for less than 0.3 percent of all global deaths. Accordingly, based on current contributions to the global mortality burden, other public health issues outrank climate change.\"This furthers the point that cracking down on global warming for something so small is preposterous. But even putting the argument aside, it doesn't even fit in with what is supposed to be debated.\" RepconEven .2% of all global deaths would be a lot. Considering \"5.9 million children under age five died in 2015,16 000 every day \" [17].2% of 5.9 million might not seem like a lot percentage wise, yet the absolute number of 11, 800 children under five annually is still high. An analogy would be that homicides involving guns don't make up even the top ten list of all cause mortality. Still, people tend to get upset about these deaths. Furthermore, showing people died from a cause is a good way to show that cause exists. Humans care about each other.My opponent then delves into whether not a scientific consensus occurred. I find this part of the argument confusing and difficult to follow. The fact that my opponent used pastebin only further complicates the matter. My opponent claims that the true consensus number is .3% as opposed to 97.1%. I doubt science magazine missed up by such a large error or any of the other scholarly peer reviewed articles. \"Yes, because of the regulations being put on the fossil fuel industry by the government in an attempt to stop something that is naturally occurring. So this isn't a fault of the industry- it's the government that's implementing the regulations that would drive the industry to the ground. Like the article itself said,\" RepconI can understand the fossil fuel industries objections, but the fossil fuel industry appears to spreading misinformation. Most likely you are in denial about man-made global climate change is due to this misinformation campaign.\"Again, this has NOTHING to do with what is supposed to be discussed. It doesn't prove that global warming is man made, so it shouldn't have been brought up in the first place.\" RepconI've already proven global climate change exists, I'm only showing why there are still deniers. \"First off, it is unknown if the Koch Brothers' donations led to any biases in research. As for the scientist who is claimed to be biased, his research is supported by data looking at the sun activity and temperature over the last 100 years [6], like I presented in my Round 2 argument. And if you're bringing up funding biases, you might as well bring up the fact that the government participates in the same thing.\" RepconYes, but independent studies have also verified government research. \"An independent study of global temperature records has reaffirmed previous conclusions by climate scientists that global warming is real.\" [19]\"Our energy policy is not rigged to help the oil industries. If anything, it's rigged AGAINST the fossil fuel industry. We have regulations that, as stated before, will destroy the fossil fuel industry,\" RepconThe oil industry seems to be just fine. Just the fact that they could lose 33 trililon dollars shows their wealth and influence.\"First off, there are no crimes committed, and you haven't provided a source to back it up. Second off, jailing climate deniers is unconstitutional. One reason is known as the first amendment, which grants freedom of speech [8]. Another reason is that the U.S. isn't a facist government, and pretty much goes against facism, so good luck trying to get deniers arrested. Nice try, though.\" RepconThe climate change deniers are selling false information. They are committing fraud just for starters. \"Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: (1) a false statement of a material fact,(2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.\" [20]Number five, injury to the alleged victim as a result, many people die annually from anthropogenic climate change. This is fraud that results in the death of the victim. This is immoral. The first amendment does not protect criminals from commiting fraud. If anyone is the fascist here it is the fossil fuel industry. The poor get hit the hardest, minorities tend to be poorer. This could be seen as the mass murder of minorities on the fossil fuel industries part.

            "premise": "Observations Ob1: Under \u201cFull Resolution\u201d, it clearly says the existence of GW is assumed, and Con must show that it is not man-made. This is violated by Con, but I shall rebut it nonetheless. Ob2: Once more, Con\u2019s entire case is C/P\u2019d from his source (albeit the source is presented this time), thus there are no original arguments presented by Con. Ob3: Con violates the debate structure by dropping ALL my arguments. I extend all my arguments to this round. Rebuttals R1) Global Warming Exists According to NASA\u2019s GISS surface temperature analysis, the global mean land-sea temperature rose from 1980 to 2014 by 0.8 degrees Celsius, and the corresponding graph shows a constant increase in temperature throughout the years from 1980 to 2014 [1]. The alleged 17-year pause is incorrect, as there has been a 0.8 degrees C increase in temperature. The global land-sea average temperature in December 2014 was the highest monthly land-sea average in 135 years [2]. There have been major temperature anomalies throughout December 2014 itself [3]. R2) Scientific Consensus A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [4]. \u201c[T]he National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: \u201cGreenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.\u201d [4-5] A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated \u201c[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases \u2026\u201d [6] According to NASA, \u201c[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.\u201d [7] Above is a graph presented by 4 major institutes that have taken a study on the temperature anomaly, and the results from NASA, MOHC/CRU, NOAA Climatic Data Center, and the Japanese Meteorological Agency have almost identical results [7]. R3) Arctic Ice Con concedes that this is irrelevant to the issue, and this is merely a prediction made by some supporters of global warming, thus I need not address this. Nonetheless, I wish to point out that \u201c[t]he European Space Agency\u2019s CryoSat mission has returned its latest map of Arctic sea ice volumes, recording a slight decrease in thickness over previous measurements.\u201d [8] R4) Climate Models While climate models may have been wrong, they were only predictions of the increase. A certain level of increase happened nonetheless, and that is relevant to the resolution, while this is completely irrelevant to the resolution. R5) Predictions This is a repeat of \u201cClimate Models\u201d and \u201cArctic Ice\u201d. The current data is not faulty unless proven otherwise, thus this argument is useless and irrelevant. I sincerely request Con to frame his own argument for the next round instead of C/Ping it. Arguments ALL my arguments are dropped. I extend all my arguments.

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting my debate.Pros CasePoint A: Man-Made Global Warming existsSub point 1: Scientific consensus\"Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. Scientists say that unless we curb the emissions that cause climate change, average U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century.\" Scientists are undoubtedly sure that Man-Made Global warming is indeed a real threat. As is corroborated by a collection of scholarly articles. 97% of climate scientists are in agreement.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)Point B: man-made global warming is the primary cause of Global WarmingSub point 1: Scientific Consensus\"The United States Global Change Research Program (which includes the Department of Defense, NASA, National Science Foundation and other government agencies) has said that 'global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced' and that 'climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow.'\"(3)\"The climate change denial machine has been working hard to discredit the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which confirms that climate change is occurring and that human activity is primarily responsible.\"(5)\"Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities,and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.\"(6)Again this is a case of overwhelming scientific consensus. Scientific research has been done by a countless number of experts, and they have all come to a similar agreement. Humanity is the primary cause of global warming. To challenge this claim is to challenge the authority of research giants such as NASA. Environmental scientists are the authority on this subject, and they agree with the Pro.Sub point 2: Carbon Emissions are a major cause, and a product of humanity\"The only way to explain the pattern [global warming] is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.\"(2)\"Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\" -- warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases, remaining semi-permanently in the atmosphere, which do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as \"forcing\" climate change\"(7)Scientists agree that humanity has altered the balance of greenhouse gases on the earth, which is a direct major cause of global warming.Point C: The effects of global warming are extreme.Global climate change leads to:-Increased temperatures-Changing landscapes-A higher number of droughts, fires, and floods-Endangered wildlife habitats-Rising sea levels-Greater damage from extreme storms-More heat-related illness and disease-Economic problems(4)Sub point 1: man-made global warming encourages natural disaster\"Hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger.\"(2)\"Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes globally to be more intense on average (by 2 to 11% according to model projections for an IPCC A1B scenario). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size.\"(8)With storms like sandy become more common and much stronger, Humans living in coastal regions face a very serious threat. Already hurricanes such as sandy and the recent Typhoon in the Philippines are costing billions of dollars in damages, and thousands of human lives. (9)(10)Man-made global warming is likely to cause these storms to become even more intense, therefore threatening to cost even more lives and money. These death counts and damage costs are not small, by any stretch of the imagination; with global warming left unchecked, these counts will grow.Sub point 2: Rising sea levels/flooding\"Sea levels are expected to rise between 7 and 23 inches (18 and 59 centimeters) by the end of the century, and continued melting at the poles could add between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters).\"(2)\"Floods and droughts will become more common. Rainfall in Ethiopia, where droughts are already common, could decline by 10 percent over the next 50 years.\"(2)As polar caps warm, ice caps are likely to melt and release water into the oceans and seas, causing the levels to rise. this could result in flooding in coastal cities, such as New Orleans, that are close to, at, or below sea level.Furthermore, man-made global warming could result in more intense cycles of flooding and drought in other areas of the world, such as Ethiopia. These are real threats to human lives. Flooding, like storms, has a very high cost of both money and, more importantly, human life. Sub point 3: Future effects of man-made global warming could significantly increase the hostility of the Earth environment.There are a myriad of effects that man-made global warming will have that will make the Earth environment, generally, more hostile. \"Some diseases will spread, such as malaria carried by mosquitoes.\" (2)\"Less fresh water will be available. If the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru continues to melt at its current rate, it will be gone by 2100, leaving thousands of people who rely on it for drinking water and electricity without a source of either.\" (2)\"Below are some of the regional impacts of global change forecast by the IPCC:-North America: Decreasing snowpack in the western mountains; 5-20 percent increase in yields of rain-fed agriculture in some regions; increased frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves in cities that currently experience them.-Latin America: Gradual replacement of tropical forest by savannah in eastern Amazonia; risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many tropical areas; significant changes in water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.-Europe: Increased risk of inland flash floods; more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion from storms and sea level rise; glacial retreat in mountainous areas; reduced snow cover and winter tourism; extensive species losses; reductions of crop productivity in southern Europe.-Africa: By 2020, between 75 and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress; yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent in some regions by 2020; agricultural production, including access to food, may be severely compromised.-Asia: Freshwater availability projected to decrease in Central, South, East and Southeast Asia by the 2050s; coastal areas will be at risk due to increased flooding; death rate from disease associated with floods and droughts expected to rise in some regions.\"(11)Here are some charts to illustrate further effects. (11)Current Effects Future Effects Human lives are at stake, and even the economies of the world are at stake.SummaryThere is overwhelming evidence to prove that man-made global warming is indeed real. Furthermore, the effects of man-made global warming are so massively detrimental that those who are concerned over the future of humanity ought to care greatly about the massive loss of life, cost of damage, and other miscellaneous undesirables that are consequences of man-made global warming.Sources1. http://www.sciencemag.org...2. http://environment.nationalgeographic.com...3. http://www.nrdc.org...4. http://www.mfpp.org...5. http://www.edf.org...6. http://climate.nasa.gov...7. http://climate.nasa.gov...8. http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov...9. http://www.usatoday.com...10. http://www.nbcnews.com...11. http://climate.nasa.gov...;",

            "premise": "Models show that both nature and human activity contribute to the warming of this century, however, when humans are taken out of the mix, the warming trend that would occur does not match the warming that is currently happening. http://www.koshland-science-museum.org... \"the main reason for warming is greenhouse gases. These are naturally occurring however in the past 200 years since the industrial revolution greenhouse gases have increased \u2013 especially CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide, which come from the burning of fossil fuels, vehicles, agriculture & mining\" http://www.wnrmag.com... As mentioned \u2013 nature and human activity work hand in hand in global warming. For example, water vapour is the most prevalent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and is natures way of keeping the earth at a stable temperature, however other greenhouse gases are rising and do contribute to the greenhouse effect. As the planet increases in temperature, more water can be held therefore also increasing the temperature \u2013 so nature and human activity work together to raise temperatures one step at a time. http://www.slate.com... As an example of how CO2 and temperature seem to go hand and hand a website is provided http://www.whrc.org... I like how you mention that it is the political argument that climate change is real and science proves that it is false \u2013 then why is it that it seems that scientists agree that climate change is real and it is the corporations, lobbyists and politicians who is altering reports from their own \"climate scientists\". http://www.csmonitor.com... http://www.sciencemag.org... \"To gain an understanding of the level of scientific consensus on climate change, a recent study examined every article on climate change published in peer-reviewed scientific journals over a 10-year period. Of the 928 articles on climate change the authors found, not one of them disagreed with the consensus position that climate change is happening or is human-induced. These findings contrast dramatically with the popular media's reporting on climate change. One recent study analyzed coverage of climate change in four influential American newspapers (New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, and Wall Street Journal) over a 14-year period. It found that more than half of the articles discussing climate change gave equal weight to the scientifically discredited views of the skeptics.\" -from the David Suzuki website. In case you didn't know, David Suzuki is the Rick Nash/Wayne Gretzky/Bruce Lee/Muhammed Ali of environmental science and causes. It shows that companies such as Exxon Mobil are working with top public relations firms and using many of the same tactics and personnel as those employed by Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds to dispute the cigarette-cancer link in the 1990s. It shows said personnel admitting the science is bunk. http://www.cbc.ca... The trend of China and India and their increase in manufacturing and gas powered vehicles will exasperate the problems of air pollution. Despite progressive efforts, the global affect of a rapidly heating, changing environment, toxins affected the food chain, the oceans rising. The incomes and economics so many of rely on will change rapidly. The ecosystem we rely on is under threat and I provide the evidence to prove the conspiracy to deny the science. Quite simply there is no peer reviewed science that states human activity does not cause global warming. My opponent show the signs of a Republican fanatic who allows his thinking to be ruled by the economics and politics that is threatened by the science.",

            "premise": "First, as Con have said, \"in the Mesozoic era the climate was much hotter and dryer\". It is true, but the important thing is that it was 248 million years ago. The climate had been changing slowly during millions of years, before the industry. While, after people invented factories, vehicles and different weapons, such as nuclear weapons, Atom Bomb, rockets and etc. the climate have been changing quickly and humans caused it. For example, when rockets launches, Atom Bomb and nuclear weapons are used, irreparable damage to the climate is caused immediately. Humans even change the weather as they wish. For example, China attacked to the bank of cloud to transform clear blue skies for the National Day parade. It happens in other countries, too. They try to change weather and get the desire result. But it has consequences, as on the next days there happened a storm. These examples, show that humans changed the weather, as they desire and damaged to the climate a lot. Second, it is true that \"humans are not the only things emitting greenhouse gases\", while humans cause the biggest amount of gases. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world claimed: \"The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 379 parts per million in the last 150 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 90 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years.\" It proves that humans cause climate changing and they influences to it quickly than it can be naturally. To conclude, humans are the main creature that caused a big problems in climate changing and damage it during a short period of time. http://climate.nasa.gov... http://www.guardian.co.uk...",

            "conclusion": "Humanity is the main cause of global warming.",
            "premise": "The word 'main' as used in the debate heading presents the position that humanity's contribution to global warming is greater in magnitude than any other factor. The definition of 'main' could be explained as: chief or principal in rank, importance, size, etc. Therefore, Pro must prove that the human portion is in fact the largest of factors. Of course, the human portion needn't be greater than 50% of the total effect if there are multiple elements/factors at play. I also agree that it is more than possible that human activities could affect, change or initiate natural processes, but again, that would have to be quantified (what portion of a natural system has been altered by human elements versus natural change). Natural and human effect can be intertwined and extremely complicated, if not impossible to differentiate and separate. This is referred to as the \"attribution of recent climate change\". I will reference the following scholarly article: https://gfdl.noaa.gov... \"Detection and Attribution of Recent Climate Change: A Status Report\". The authors make several important conclusions in this comprehensive study: \"Greenhouse warming alone is insufficient to explain the observed pattern of climate change.\" and \"The most probable cause of the observed warming is a combination of internally and externally forced natural variability and anthropogenic sources (see also Tett et al. 1999). But given the large model uncertainties and limited data, a reliable weighting of the different factors contributing to the observed climate change cannot currently be given. In short, we cannot attribute, at this time, with a high level of statistical significance, the observed changes in global and large-scale regional climate to anthropogenic forcing alone.\". This research contradicts Pro's assertion that human causes are definitively more important than natural ones. In addition, to say that our current warming trend was caused solely by the industrial age based on the chart I presented (in round 3) would be to dismiss the fact that the sharp rebound from the Little Ice Age and commencement of our current warming trend (1600-) was initiated and occurred well before human activity was a relevant factor. I agree with much of the content contained within the two sites referenced by pro, but none of them contains information that establishes that human activity plays a greater role than natural variability. The CO2 now website asserts that \"The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.\" and lists several of the unique contributions and circumstances associated with human activity and greenhouse gasses. It also states that \"the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes.\" These are grand statements, but there is no attempt to quantify them unlike the formal research document I presented above (which contradicts these sites). There is also no mention on Pro's sites of the fact that our current warming period was initiated well before the industrial age and human influence by natural forces. Even the IPCC continues to protect its reputation by using vague terms such as \"...likely\" regarding the position of humanity's \"...dominant role in global warming\". I acknowledge that we currently are experiencing global warming. For those who lived in 1100 BC and 1300 AD, they also experienced global warming on a larger scale than we do today, even though human activity had little correlation to that warming. Thus, to say that Global Warming is unique to the industrial age is false. It is also very likely that scientists will one day be able to prove/quantify what portion of Human Activity is attributable to global warming. Presently, it is not possible as my opponent acknowledges. This is why no scientist(s) or scientific body has declared a victory on this issue (A quantified attribution of recent climate change). In fact, a very large amount of money and large amount of research continues to be spent on this very issue because it has yet to be proved or resolved. I also agree that the current warming period presented on the on the chart I referenced is abrupt and is likely a reflection of the influence of human activity. Being that this warming period has yet to exceed several recent warming periods in effect and duration, we need more time in order to be able to place our current warming period into the context of other prior larger warming periods. It is simply premature to state definitively that human activity is the main factor in global warming. My statement is reflected in the current feverish rate of research being performed into the Attribution of Recent Climate Change. If a definitive conclusion had been reached, this research would not be needed to such a degree. Keep in mind, that I am not advocating that humanity should not take responsibility towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; quite the contrary.",

            "premise": "I would like to thank Kryptic for presenting his argument.I agree with the alternate definition he provided. Looking back to the definition I cited in round 1, I defined global warming as \"...the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century, and its projected continuation.\" This means that any arguments regarding natural factors' effects on the climate before the late 19th century and long term climate projection of there being another ice age are irrelevant. I'm not contending that natural factors have no effect on the climate, or even that they are not usually the only cause of climate change. All I'm arguing is that the global warming since the late 19th century has been driven mostly by anthropogenic forcings.[1]Since my opponent provided no other arguments, all I will do in this round is show how comparing natural factors and anthropogenic factors shows that humans are the main cause of global warming.The most important of the natural climate forcings is the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below: Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below: Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). \"Although Wang, Lean, and Sheeley's reconstructionputs the change in TSIsince 1900 at about 0.5 W-m-2, previous studies have shown a larger change, so we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.\" This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. \"Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5\u00b0C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2\u00b0C/(W-m-2) for \u03bb.\" This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C.[2]Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[2]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. \"Therefore, the solar forcing combined with theanthropogenicCO2forcing and other minor forcings (such as decreased volcanic activity) can account for the 0.4\u00b0C warming in the early 20th century, with the solar forcing accounting for about 40% of the total warming. Over the past century, this increase inTSIis responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But sinceTSIhasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based onreconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.\" Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[2]This can be shown in the image below: [3]CO2 correlates with CO2 more than solar activity, especially after 1975.There are other natural forcings, ozone concentrations and volcanic activity being the other major ones. The ozone layer of the atmosphere blocks the sun's UV radiation from reaching the Earth. Lowering levels of ozone may cause warming then by allowing more solar radiation to reach the Earth. However, while ozone levels were decreasing before 1995, they are now increasing (regardless, the declining ozone levels were also caused by humans). And the volcanic activity forcing has actually had a cooling effect on the climate. \"Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used a multiple linear regression approach to filter out the effects of volcanic andsolar activity, and the El Ni\u00f1oSouthern Oscillation(ENSO). They found that volcanic activity, as measured by aerosol optical thickness data (AOD) has only caused between 0.02 and 0.04\u00b0C per decade warming from 1979 through 2010 (Table 1, Figure 2), or about 0.06 to 0.12\u00b0C warming of the surface and lowertroposphere, repsectively, since 1979 (out of approximately 0.5\u00b0C observed surface warming).\"[4]In total, all the forcings, both natural and anthropogenic, can be shown below: [3]Greenhouse gases are far more important than solar activity (note that sulfate levels mostly correlate with volcanic activity).ConclusionI don't have anything more to say, since this is all my opponent talks about. Anthropogenic forcings were more important for global warming than natural forcings.Sources[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org...[2]: https://www.skepticalscience.com...[3]: http://solar-center.stanford.edu...[4]: https://www.skepticalscience.com...",

            "premise": "\"one can prove and have proven that co2 can act as a green house gas and can theoretically warm the planet.\" Not theoretically. It does. Basic physics as outlined in R2 and R2. \"Where I disagree is that co2 has been proven to be the cause of global warming\" No one climate scientist states that it is. It would be great if you actually read my rounds. It is one part of many.This goes back to my R1 statement of merely saying it is not true, is not good enough. \"I do not think though that it has been proven that it raises temperatures significantly.\" Again, it is in conjunction with the other climate change factors. \"Even in your 'runaway' co2 warming hypothesis, there is not evidence that co2 causes additional warming. The co2 is the effect, not the cause of warming.\" Firstly, my \"runaway warming hypothesis\" was in reference to ice age warming (the previous paragraphs) secondly and this refers to you reading again, I have stated several times that CO2 and temperature have been shown to act on each other. CO2 causes temperature rises; temperature rises in turn increase CO2. \"The researchers estimate that this effect could cut by two-thirds the projected increase in global temperatures initiated by a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. How do you know that increasing co2 didn't 'cause' this vent to work?\" How do you know it did? What is inherent in CO2 that it can create a seabed vent? Merely postulating it as such does not give the notion any more validity. To actually make your point (the article is 2001) you have 7 years of data to show (1) correlatory evidence (2) Physical evidence i.e CO2 increase caused by said vent. You have not. \"Not to mention our minimal knowledge of cloud formation.\" Yours maybe, less so those that dedicate their careers to such things. \"And I do not agree with your contention that solar variability is irrelevent:\" And I do not take my evidence from a blogger. The articles author that the blog uses is a self informed i.e. non professional climate modeller. Now for evidence i.e. scientific as opposed to the, I can surf the internet, sort of your blogger. There is no evidence of a link between cosmic rays and warming temperatures on Earth. \"A decrease in the globally averaged low level cloud cover, deduced from the ISCCP infrared data, as the cosmic ray intensity decreased during the solar cycle 22 was observed by two groups. The groups went on to hypothesize that the decrease in ionization due to cosmic rays causes the decrease in cloud cover, thereby explaining a large part of the currently observed global warming. We have examined this hypothesis to look for evidence to corroborate it. None has been found and so our conclusions are to doubt it.\" http://www.iop.org... Cosmic rays are energetic particles from space that travel at near the speeds of light when they hit the atmosphere. They are redirected toward the Earth by the Sun and some have claimed that changes in solar activity deflect varying amounts of cosmic rays towards us. A favourite theory among climate sceptics is that the rays are responsible for boosting the formation of clouds, which in turn could be warming the planet. \"finding no evidence of a link between the ionizing cosmic rays and the production of low cloud cover\" http://domino.lancs.ac.uk... So no, it is not solar, or cloud formation as you propose. \"not wholly discounted by the IPCC and climate modellers\" So I think we can safely say that said climate modellers are sceptics and not actual climate modellers in the scientific sense it is used. I think we can also safely say the name drop IPCC is there purely because I gave you a link to their site. Actually showing where they say so would be great, unless, clearly, they do not say such things. :) Which brings us to the end of your arguments, and the rather glaring fact that you have done absolutely nothing to show that my proof is wrong in any real scientific evidential sense. \"Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years. The global increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to fossil fuel use and land-use change, while those of methane and nitrous oxide are primarily due to agriculture.\" (IPCC Report on Climate Change: 2007) Feel free to read the report summary http://media.newscientist.com...",

            "conclusion": "Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.",
            "premise": "Aff Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton & co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University) For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosphers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, \"there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.\" To the topic, this means that mitigting the effects of climate change is neccessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people. Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. \"When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that \u2022The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; \u2022Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; \u2022The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.\"(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions. Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all. Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions. Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together. In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries.",

            "premise": "(Paraphrased from http://www.debate.org...) I'm not sure how well I worded the debate resolution, so I will explain further. This is a scientific debate about whether humans are driving global warming and whether it is a problem. Not all evidence has to be inherently scientific, but all evidence should give reasons to believe that the human effect on global warming is significant (PRO) or insignificant (CON). Definitions Human effect: Effect caused by unnatural human actions; this includes sources such as factories and power plants but excludes sources such as natural respiration. Global warming: an increase in the earth's average atmospheric and oceanic temperature that causes corresponding changes in climate and that may result from the greenhouse effect. (dictionary.com) CO2: Carbon dioxide. AGW: Anthropogenic global warming; global warming caused by human activities. ======================== Contention 1: Basic Scientific Argument ======================== (I have purposely left out some information; I cannot fill all the holes in 8000 characters, and will therefore only fill the holes that my opponent pokes at.) The sun radiates electromagnetic waves onto the earth. They pass through the atmosphere, but are absorbed by the ground. When molecules on the ground absorb the electromagnetic radiation, they then re-emit it as infrared radiation. Infrared has a longer wavelength, so some atmospheric gases, called greenhouse gases \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\" namely water vapor, CO2, and methane (CH4) \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u20ac\" absorb it and turn it into thermal energy (a.k.a. heat). This traps heat, causing the earth's temperature to increase. Because of the greenhouse effect, the more greenhouse gases there are, the hotter it gets. This effect isn't much like a greenhouse, but I will nonetheless use the term. For hundreds of thousands of years, CO2 levels remained in the 180 to 300 ppm (parts per million) range [1]. But as of 2007, CO2 levels were at 390 ppm [2]. The environment was relatively stable for hundreds of thousands of years, so why the sudden change? Human emissions can only be responsible. Humans have been emitting CO2 in vast quantities since the mid-70's: our cars emit it, our factories emit it, even our homes emit it. ======================== Contention 2: Scientific Consensus ======================== It is important to remember that science is not a democracy. But if nearly all scientists agree on something, it is probably correct. And nearly all scientists support AGW. I: Scientific Societies Many scientific societies have advocated for AGW. At this time, it is important to remember that scientific societies are not advocacy groups. But these societies found AGW so important that they felt they had to endorse it. The national scientific societies of 21 countries have endorsed AGW: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Caribbean, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South, Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States [3]. The following societies have also endorsed AGW: Network of African Science Academies, National Research Council, European Science Foundation, World Meteorological Organization, Federation of American Scientists, American Meteorological Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science [4]. This is far from a complete list, but is meant to give an idea of how many scientists support AGW. This list represents hundreds of thousands of scientists. II: Peer-Reviewed Papers Perhaps more important than the endorsement of scientific societies is peer-reviewed papers. In 2004, Science magazine conducted a search for scientific papers on the topic of global warming [5]. They searched through all papers with the keywords \"climate change\", for a total of 928 scientific articles. Here is a quote from [5]: {quote} The 928 papers were divided into six categories... Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position. Admittedly, authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point. This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies. Politicians, economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord among climate scientists, but that impression is incorrect. The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it. Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics. The question of what to do about climate change is also still open. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of AGW. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen. {/quote} *** I thank my soon-to-be opponent and look forward to a fun debate. *** References [1] http://www.newscientist.com......

            "premise": "Hello and thanks to my opponent, I wish him luck and I hope that this debate will be a satisfying and enlightening one for both of us. Despite the fact that my opponent is the instigator and Pro for the resolution, he has requested that I start the debate. I have no problem with this as long as he acknowledges his burden of proof and presents some arguments of his own, rather than merely rebutting mine. _________ Definitions. My opponent has not provided us with any definitions and I feel that it is imperative that we at least define the key terms in the resolution if we are to have a meaningful debate. 1. Global warming. The issue of global warming can be interpreted many ways as discussed on the DDO fans Wiki page. http://ddofans.com... Wikipedia describes global warming as \"the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation.\" When most people speak of global warming however they are generally referring to the well accepted theory \"that most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the 20th century was caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation.\" http://en.wikipedia.org... I can't be sure if my opponent wishes to limit the discussion strictly to global warming or include wider examples of climate change. http://en.wikipedia.org... Similarly I can't be sure if he's referring to the existence of global warming/climate change or the assertion that its effects are exacerbated or caused by human actions. I will assume that my opponent wishes to discuss human contribution to climate change but whichever of these ideas of global warming he refers to, I believe the word 'hoax' is an inaccurate description. 2. Hoax. There is much less room for misinterpretation with this term. Although some hoaxes may be playful and others more malicious, implicit within every reliable definition of the word is the notion of intentional deceit. http://www.google.co.uk... ________ I do believe that the planet is getting warmer and that the climate is changing. I also believe it is quite probable that the primary cause of this is human and that human actions are affecting it. However these beliefs are quite irrelevant to the debate at hand. My opponent is claiming that the scientists who believe this (and they are very much in the majority) are not merely mistaken, not merely incorrect and not even merely deluded but that they are wilfully misleading the public and the government with this information. I see no basis, suggestion or motive for the level of conspiracy that this would entail. According to the 2007 UN report \"Evidence is now \u2018unequivocal' that humans are causing global warming\" http://www.un.org... Even the US government has accepted the truth back in 2002 http://news.bbc.co.uk... and it is also acknowledged by NASA. http://www.nasa.gov... The denial of climate change and its human causes is essentially the propaganda of big businesses who don't want to risk compromising their profits for the sake of something as insignificant as sustaining the planet for future generations. It is no secret that major political parties are funded by these companies, yet according to my opponent, it is the mainstream scientists rather than the skeptics with a political agenda that represent the conspiracy. The scientific consensus on global warming is clear. \"the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities\" http://www.sciencemag.org... \"a list of quotes from scientific organizations, academies, scientists, industry spokesmen, etc supporting the existence of man made climate change and the need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\" http://logicalscience.com... I have no idea what my opponent means by \"believ[ing] in carbon footprints\" but it doesn't seem to affect the resolution. A carbon footprint is simply a term for the amount of carbon pollution caused by an individual, a company or a nation. It is an abstract concept rather than a tangible object but I don't see how one could \"disbelieve\" it without also disbelieving in the existence of carbon itself. I will now hand over to Pro for his arguments on how and why \"global warming is a hoax\". Thanks. Con.",

            "premise": "Basically my opponent's rebuttal is, \"You think that global warming is false because humans are not the only factors of climate change. Climate change is just the climate changing, it could be warming or cooling, and it will still count as climate change. You are basically saying that \"ham sandwich\" is not a correct name because there are many other kinds of sandwiches.\" and \"Plus, on my first round I stated \"Global warming: The rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation.\" Where did you see it has to be man made in there?\" My opponent is committing an informal fallacy called Onus probandi. \"Onus probandi \" from Latin \"onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat\" the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions the claim). It is a particular case of the \"argumentum ad ignorantiam\" fallacy, here the burden is shifted on the person defending against the assertion.\" -http://en.wikipedia.org... \"The theory of Global Warming assumes that CO2 is an atmospheric greenhouse gas and as it increases temperatures rise. It was then theorized that since humans were producing more CO2 than before, the temperature would inevitably rise. The theory was accepted before testing had started, and effectively became a law.\"-Tim Ball The controversy surrounding the existence of global warming is denoted from the effects of human induced climate change, such as the green house effect in my opponent's evidence from Wikipedia, \"... Strengthening of the greenhouse effect through human activities is known as the enhanced (or anthropogenic) greenhouse effect.[20] This increase in radiation forcing from human activity is attributable mainly to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels...\" In addition my opponent is deliberately ignoring the other green house gases of ozone, methane, and water vapor. This deliberate omission of the other gases would imply that the existence of global warming would be man made as CO2 is a byproduct of consuming fossil fuels in cars, and . Also when these gases are ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect, Water vapor is ranked first contributing 36-76% to the green house effect whereas CO2 is ranked second contributing 9-26% to the green house effect. My opponent is also misinterpreting the data of the final stages of the Little Ice Age, though that is expected because the extreme drop occurred in a span of approximately 200 years and the graph does not go to a smaller set. Therefore my opponent's rebuttals are false, and connote the existence of human induced climate change instead of the existence of a natural climate change that may or may not be accelerated by human activity.",

            "premise": "== Re: Burden of Proof == Con states that I automatically have the burden of proof in this debate because I am Pro. That is false. The instigator always has the burden of proof in a debate, because they are the ones making a declaration or assertion. Con took it upon himself to debate the fact that global warming does NOT exist. To choose a resolution of which he is Con to make the other debater go first is a huge cop out. Con could have easily made the resolution \"Global warming does not exist\" and choose the PRO side, so that he could man up and post an argument first. Any non-noob to DDO will attest to the fact that \"allowing your opponent to go first\" is nothing short of a punk move that often loses conduct points in the voting period. Additionally there are hundreds of debates in which Con instigates the debate and goes first, such as these examples [1], [2], [3], etc. Ergo that sad attempt at ad hominem was actually just evidence of his own ignorance regarding debate etiquette and procedure. == Re: Temperature Increase == Con writes \"It is not scientifically proven that average temperatures have climbed up around the world. There are plenty of scientists that support and have documented the opposite. Here's an example, and others can and will be provided if necessary.\" Let the records show that Con's source [4] actually says \"THE CAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE REMAINS UNKNOWN...\" In other words, the source doesn't deny climate change (in fact it admits it) but rather only questions whether or not man is responsible. As I said in the last round, global warming is undeniable even if whether or not man is the cause is debatable. Fortunately for me the resolution has nothing to do with proving that global warming is man-made - only that it exists. == Re: Cold Weather; Harsh Winters == Con notes that people continue to die from frost bite and low temperatures, and then presents a bunch of irrelevant statistics and sources regarding hypothermia and cold temperatures all over the world. This hilarious \"argument\" only demonstrates Con's ignorance about the science of global warming. My opponent is confusing weather with climate; cold weather is NOT an indication of a cooling climate. For my opponent's viewing pleasure (and hopefully a source of knowledge and information) I will provide several links which explain exactly why weather and climate are not synonymous such as these [5], [6], [7], etc. In short, my opponent has proven that he knows absolutely nothing (and is completely incompetent on the science regarding) global warming. Just because the globe has experienced bouts of cold in no way disproves the reality that the earth on average is warming. Again, Con's own source [4] confirmed this fact. == Rebuttal to my Arguments == 1. Con states that there is not a unanimous agreement global warming exists, and I admit that this is obviously true. However, the most respected scientific bodies have stated unequivocally that global warming is occurring, and people are causing it. \"This conclusion is shared by the national science academies of developed and developing countries plus many other organizations, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization to provide the world with 'a clear scientific view' on climate change. The only real debate is about how fast warming will occur, and how much damage will be done, as a result of human activities that produce heat-trapping CO2 and other greenhouse-gas emissions\" [8]. 2. Next I said that humans are pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere much faster than plants and oceans can absorb it. Con responded, \"Even if this is true, this does not mean that it is necessary for the average temperature of the globe to increase overall.\" Once again, this only proves his scientific ignorance. It is a FACT that excess carbon dioxide alters the process by which naturally occurring greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat before it can be released back into space. Excess carbon dioxide (which we output into the atmosphere) creates a warming effect on the planet. For proof and a picture demonstration, check here [9]. == More Arguments for Pro == 1. Between 1961 and 1997 the world's glaciers lost 890 cubic miles of ice. Melting sea ice can accelerate global warming. The overwhelming majority of glaciers are still losing ice at an alarming rate. The IPCC estimates that melting ice caps and glaciers accounted for about 25% of sea level rise from 1993 to 2003 [10]. 2. \"The mountain of climate data assembled over decades by the scientific community as a whole is irrefutable. The records collected and analyzed by independent scientists from many disciplines and thousands of locations, paint a consistent, verifiable picture of a rapidly warming world\" [11]. Records from scientific organizations such as NOAA, HADCRU, JMA and even NASA show that the earth's temperature on average (globally) has showed a warming trend since 1850. Atmospheric temperature measurements taken from orbiting satellites also show warming. During the 20th century, sea level rose an average of 7 inches after 2,000 years of relatively little change. At low latitudes, 20th century climate was unusually warm compared to the previous 2,000 years. Records of tree rings show that 20th century warming was unusual compared to at least the past 500 years. Coral proxy records indicate sea surface warming in most tropical locations over the past century [12]. These are all indisputable facts; I would love to see Con try. == Conclusion == Con finishes his round by saying that global warming is a hoax; however, this is only after his own source agrees that global warming exists, and just disputes the cause (whether or not humans are responsible). Again, whether or not humans are responsible is still up for debate (though I think it's quite obvious that humans are, as demonstrated by my sources) though it's undeniable that the temperature of the earth is increasing and thus global warming exists. My opponent's sources were irrelevant and his arguments had absolutely nothing to do with climate change. Any person with any knowledge of this would understand that colder weather or harsh winters that Con described have nothing to do with global warming and do not prove that global warming does not exist. So far, however, I have presented a plethora of evidence in favor of global warming's existence. == References == [1] http://www.debate.org... [2] http://www.debate.org...

            "conclusion": "The American government should take an active role in stopping climate change",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for a wonderful debate. There has been wonderful information and opinion shared by both sides and it has been enjoyable. That said, in all three of the rounds, I fail to see a direct connection between humans and global warming proven by my opponent. Without a direct connection, and surely without a direct cause, regulations are only going to funnel money from one big organization to another and not fix the problem. We cannot be expected to blindly throw money at a guess and hope things change. In addition to the lack of evidence directly linking global warming to humans, there is also no proof as to how these regulations will actually change anything in terms of climate. There have been numerous scare tactic comments followed by minimal solutions which may or may not fix a problem that may or may not exist. It has also not been shown to what extend regulations on the American people will have on the globe as a whole. In fact, the EPA have stated that if there is a 60% reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions by 2050, the global temperature will be reduced by 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2095. (http://www.heritage.org...) I can understand that any change in the right direction is a good thing but at what cost and for what result? This is nearly 100 years later and since the EPA has already admitted that they do not know how much of a role the environment plays on climate change, how many other factors could go in to altering these numbers. Also, the American economy is in a troubling time at the moment and a further burden on businesses will only increase the problem; all because there is a chance that the temperatures may reduce by .2 degrees in 85 years. This is simply too far fetched of a plan to cause enforcement of regulations. I continue to talk about these loose connections between global warming and humans because, even if my opponent may not personally agree, there are many well respected scientists who have not been involved in scandals stating that there is no link. In December of 2008, the US Senate Minority leader released a report which included 650 dissenting scientist refuting the EPA's Claims. As of April 2009, that number increased to over 700 scientist. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which the EPA relied heavily on in their conclusions only had 52 scientists; less than 1/13th of those opposed. (http://www.heritage.org...) While some try to sweep this decent under the rug in yet another scandalous act, there are some things which cannot be disputed. If the EPA has their way and is able to regulate CO2 output by the American people, it would be the most expansive and most expensive environmental regulation in history. In addition, it will let the EPA bypass the legislative process complete. In essence, the decisions of a few will drastically alter the lives of many; all for a change in the Earth's temperature too small to ever notice. (http://www.heritage.org...) The non profit group from the home state of my opponent, the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine have started a petition against the adoption of regulations on the American businesses and public in the name of global warming. They have had over 31,000 American scientists sign this petition stating they have reviewed the research literature and found no link between humans and global weather changes. (http://www.oism.org...) In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which was discussed earlier having a direct link on the EPA's conclusions have failed to prove a link between humans and global warming. The IPCC actually states, \"The Earth's atmosphere-ocean dynamics is chaotic: its evolution is sensitive to small perturbations in initial conditions. The sensitivity limits our ability to predict the detailed evolution of weather; inevitable errors and uncertainties in the starting conditions of a weather forecast amplify through the forecast. As well as uncertainty in initial conditions, such predictions are also degraded by errors and uncertainties in our ability to represent accurately the significant climate process.\" (http://www.aproundtable.org...) So by their own admission, their researched is filled with errors and speculation. Over and over again, my opponent continually denies the the overwhelming data which shows there has yet to be a direct link proven between humans and global warming. If there was a direct link out there to be proven, why hasn't anyone done it yet; not just in America but across the world? A huge scandal took place involving the Climate Research Unit and it is simply dismissed by my opponent as he states, \"I do not believe that it means anything\". The EPA has explained they are uncertain as to the cause of global warming and how human involvement relates to climate change. My opponent responds by saying, \"They're just not certain about how much humans contribute\", as if that somehow makes it okay to impose regulations on Americans. If the EPA is uncertain as to what the human contributions are and if the EPA reports are under suspicion anyway, why would we put them in charge of regulating American businesses and lives? My opponent's defense to all this uncertainty around global warming and human cases of climate change is that, he wishes global warming did not exist, but it does. He continues to claim that, \"The fact is, there is scientific evidence supporting climate change and the fact that it is caused at least significantly by humans\". But he has failed to show this overwhelming evidence and has moved from the EPA's 'unknown' significance of human involvement to his new statement claiming human involvement actually being 'significant'; an unsubstantiated leap to say the least. While I give my opponent credit for commenting on most of the scandals and scientific reports disproving his case, I simply cannot agree that global warming exists because he says so. Those who blindly support global warming caused by humans continually write off these problems in their data as 'minor red herrings' but fail to show the actual connection. This debate, as many others, has tried to turn the table on who has the burden of proof. The side believing global warming is caused by humans still needs to prove and show a direct link between the human involvement and in what capacity. But what we have here is my opponent claiming, personally, that it not only exists and is caused by humans but any data which disproves this claim should be dismissed as minor speed bumps. My opponent makes a remarkably embellishment of the facts as he claims, \"The fact is, any data or theories opposing the idea of climate change absolutely pale in comparison to all of the evidence and conclusions that climate change is a very real problem with very real consequences and very real ways to prevent it. It is ignorant and irresponsible to deny that.\" Does my opponent really expect us to believe that he has reviewed all the information offered on both sides of this debate to such an extent that he can numerically calculate which side has more evidence? It is scary, to me, that people make such vast generalizations. It is also scary, to all of us, when those such as my opponent talk about human habits equating to death. These general speculations and scare tactics do not translate into fact as shown above. Without absolute proof that human change will alter climate, there is absolutely no need for government to step in and alter our economic strength and way of life. I thank my opponent for starting this topic and for a great debate!",

            "premise": "Hello Woojin05. I accept your challenge and look forward to our debate and the rounds that will follow! Here we go... Global Warming is a reality, a problem and our fault. According to the Inquisitition of Climate Science, since 1800, 330 billion tons of Carbon Dioxide have been pumped into the atmosphere due to factories burning fossil fuels creating a \"greenhouse effect,\" trapping sunlight, raising temperatures. This is also the cause for the largest global temperature increase mankind has ever encountered. According to the National Climatic Data Center, in the last century the average temperature has increased 1.33 degrees, and is projected to increase another 2.5-10.4 degrees by 21-hundred. The Institute for Demographic Research predicts that this temperature increase would raise ocean levels to the point where 634 million people living on the coast would be forced to re-locate. It is for this reason, that I support the resolution that Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of Climate Change. As my first contention, I would like to raise the issue about who is in fact responsible for global warming. According to the World Resources Institue, \"industrialized countries account for roughly 80% of the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere to date\". Industrialized countries. Not underdeveloped countries. There is additional evidence to support this. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide tend to stay in the atmosphere for decades. Old injuries dealt to the enviorment from now developed countries\" haven\"t healed yet. A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the countries with the top annual carbon pollution per capita, are all industrialized and developed. Therefore it is developed countries that are responsible for global warming, and from the moral standpoint that this preposition wishes for us to take, it is developed countries who are responsible for mitigating the effects of climate change. It is essential to understand that climate change can be fixed. According to Royters, we have until 2040 to stop global warming before it becomes irreversible. There is a way to save our planet. However this solution is so obvious that it is often overlooked. Cutting pollution emissions by 80%, and replacing them with natural energy would literally halt the growth of climate change, which would end all effects of climate change. Admittedly, this solution comes with a high price tag. It could cost 1.9 trillion dollars annually to cut our carbon emissions by 80%. However this price tag is nothing compared to the cost of letting global warming continue. According to the Natural Resource Defense Council it is estimated that dealing with the effects of global warming would cost 20 trillion dollars a year by the end of the century, costing 10x more money than it would to just stop global warming. Each of the top 30 developed countries, have the budget to pay for approximently 4 % of the emissions decrease. This money could be funded by tax increases, charities, or budget cuts. In contrast there is mathematically no possible way of dealing with the effects of global warming without bankrupting the world\"s economy. Now the logical question is: Why can\"t developing countries assist in the costs of mitigating climate change? The answer is because they do not have the money. The average annual salary of a person living in a third world country is 730 dollars, or about 2 dollars a day. On top of this between 60-80% of this money is spent on food. There is no conceivable way a government could make money from taxing these people. As proof of this, the U.S.\"s national budget is around 2.1 trillion dollars per year, whereas Zimbobwae\"s national budget is only 2.7 million dollars per year. Their budget is mathematically practically a millionth of the United States\"s budget, and Zimbobwae is an average third world country. These countries need every penny they can make, therefore they cannot be obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change. It\"s that simple. It is time to accept a reality and a responsibility. Therefore developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.",

            "premise": "Yes I did read your link (http://www.epa.gov...). I read the way the EPA stated \"As with any field of scientific study, there are uncertainties associated with the science of climate change.\" I then further read under the category of \"What's Not Certain\" the EPA states it is not certain about \"Determining the relative contribution to climate change of human activities and natural causes.\" I surely do not want to go back and forth on this point, but the EPA article that you continue referring to specifically states that it is unknown what contributions the human activity has to climate change. Furthermore, the EPA's research is under suspicion anyway. There are two EPA workers who are highly critical of the EPA's memo on carbon gas. The are critical of both the substances of and the process behind the agency's proposed findings. (http://www.washingtontimes.com...) Additionally, in November of 2009, over 1,000 emails and more than 2,000 documents from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia were posted on the internet. The emails show how scientists have been altering climate date and hiding information which proves global warming caused by man to be false. These emails included some from American Scientist John Holdren, a top adviser to the president and he wrote that scientists who opposed the theories of climate change were \"amateurs.\" He referred to using a \"trick\" that could be used to \"hide and decline\" temperature figures. Yet another mentioned how he was bothered to release date that could challenge climate change. (http://climategateemail.com...) (http://www.eastangliaemails.com...) In Terms of the NASA link you posted, yes I agree they said there was record melting in 2008. This is a major point that needs to be discussed. We are talking about an average over a long period of time to determine warming. Everyone would agree that one hour or one day of higher than normal temperatures does not constitute as a long enough time to establish global warming. For some reason, global warming supporters find a year or two or three to be sufficient enough to produce a trend of warmth. The EPA report you continue to quote says that it is uncertain in \"Projecting future greenhouse emissions and how the climate system will respond within a narrow range.\" If your coveted EPA cannot project future climate changes, how can you? They continue to explain they aren't certain about \"Improving understanding of natural climatic variations, changes in the sun's energy, land-use changes, the warming or cooling effects of pollutant aerosols, and the impacts of changing humidity and cloud cover.\" There are major scandals around covering up and hiding evidence that global warming does not exist. There are questions of the EPA suppressing evidence of their finding. The EPA even admits that it is unclear as to how the human race effects climate change. I must defer back to you yet again after you read all this compelling evidence and explain that the burden or proof is yours to prove and without it, American Only regulations cannot be expected. I didn't expect to have to continue showing all this information on how global warming is yet to be proven and how your EPA records are more under question and uncertain than your statements represent. As we all know, the earth has been warming and cooling since its existence. There was an Ice Age about 22,000 years ago, then the earth warmed for a bit and started to cool again for the Little Ice Age which began warming again around 1680. There was no proof or even reason to believe the earth was cooling and heating for all those years due to carbon gases from humans. (http://canadafreepress.com...) This is where the \"Hockey Stick\" graph makes its entrance, around 1998. For those who are not familiar with this, it is a climate graph which is one of the initial pieces of information to start the global warming hysteria. This graph mapped out a zero increase in temperature over the past 1,000 years with a sudden spike starting in the 20th century. The research which produced this used tree ring data for the first 1,000 years of its study and then added modern temperature date for the 20th century. These tree rings were hand picked and often discarded if they did not conform to the uniformity as the others did. A dendroclimatologist (one who studies climate using tree rings) told the US Congressional Committee that, \"...this does not mean that one could not improve a chronology by reducing the number of series used if the purpose of removing samples is to enhance a desired signal. The ability to pick and choose which samples to use is an advantage unique to dendroclimatology.\" This 'hand picking' of evidence to prove climate stability and then a large spike in change raised many questions across the scientific community. (http://canadafreepress.com...) The hockey stick was eventually unmasked by one of the most basic forms of scientific testing we know today; the reproducibility test. Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick attempted to reproduce this hockey stick and were unable to do so. They even requested date and formulas from Mann (the person who came up with the hockey stick in 1998) and he would not disclose the codes and formulas he used to achieve his results. This raised even more suspicion since the hockey stick was published work and the methods as to how the results were found were not being disclosed. (http://canadafreepress.com...) The US National Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to investigate this matter between McIntyre/McKitrick and Mann. Ultimately, they found in favor of McIntyre and McKitrick. They explained that they tried to reproduce the date themselves and while they could not reproduce the hockey stick Mann has suggested, they were able to reproduce the findings of McIntyre and McKitrick. (http://canadafreepress.com...) To date, Mann still refuses to disclose his formula and codes; very continent for someone who's data is the reason we have this global warming debate today.",

            "discussionTitle": "Mankind Is the Main Cause of Global Warming",
            "conclusion": "Mankind Is the Main Cause of Global Warming",
            "premise": "Numerous alternate causes to global warming prove that humans are not the primary source. Adopt a mindset of innocent until proven guilty, the affirmative must prove beyond correlation and doubt that human cause warming. The Pro must win that mankind is the \"principal [and] leading\" meaning that if I win that there is an alternative cause that is more responsible for warming than humans, or at least humans are not a major cause, then I win the debate. (First Pro speech)As the Con, I may contradict myself as my sole purpose is to disprove the Pro's statement. The Pro must remain consistent to prove their position.First, 1,500 year climate cycles. Fred Singer, an atmospheric and space physicist with a PhD from Princeton who founded the the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), and Dennis Avery, a agricultural analyst who was awarded the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, agree that there is substantial evidence around the world that climate cycles easily explain the warming we currently see. There is already a scientific consensus that cooling cycles (Ice Ages) exist, so it already not unreasonable to assume that warming cycles also exist. From 1300 to 1850, the Little Ice Age caused the earth to be about 2.5 degrees Celsius cooler than average. The Modern Warming portion of the cycle began in 1850, and \"warming will continue for some time in the future, perhaps 200 years or more, regardless of human activity.\" Thus, today's warming can be explained by these climate cycles. These scientists gathered data from North America to Asia, and they use the ice caps in Greenland to further prove that by the way the ice formed, there must have been 1,500 year warming cycles. Sea sediment core in Ireland also shows the 1,500 year cycle. Fossilized pollen, boreholes, tree rings, and mountain tree lines all provide evidence to this theory because scientists can find how they were created or observe differing distances of tree rings to find the amount of warming that these objects underwent while being created. It's important to realize that completely dismissing 1,500 year cycles dismisses \"human histories from the past 2,000 years...and a variety of physical evidence found by a huge body of serious researchers.\" (1) The Vostok ice sample that the rise and fall of CO2 correlate with natural cycles. Temperatures correlate with Ice Age minimus and maximus. There is a 420,000 thousand year cycle of carbon emissions. Given that humans release very little of the total carbon ouput, the correlation is between the carbon cycle and temperature cycle. (5)Secondly, human emissions of carbon dioxide are specifically not to blame. Patrick Moore, a former member of Greenpeace and an ecologist said the following while testifying in front of Congress: \"There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth's atmosphere over the past 100 years.\" In fact, carbon dioxide levels were 10x higher during the Ice Ages than they are now. This was also true 500 million years ago before evolution had created humans. Not only does this empiric disprove that humans are a major cause of increased carbon dioxide, but it also disproves that CO2 causing warming. Regardless of the theoretical examples the Pro provides, empirics trump. Third, the industrial revolution began in 1750, yet only from 1910 to 1940, there was an increase in .5 degrees Celsius of the global temperature. There was more than enough time for factories to produce enough carbon dioxide to have resulted in warming before those 200 years. This delay in increase prove that humans are not the main cause and is evidence of the climate cycles. (2) During this time, temperatures were much higher than today, but CO2 levels were lower. This places doubt in the significance of anthropogenic CO2 release. (7)Fourth, the climate rapidly changes to different stimuli. Anthony Lupo, assistant professor of atmospheric science at the University of Missouri at Columbia and an expert reviewer for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang, discusses the fact that regional climates tend to experience much more change than globally. However, climates change rapidly, so if human emissions of CO2 really are responsible for warming, then 1) there should already be a much larger change in global temperature given the huge increase of CO2 emissions and 2) even when there were smaller amounts of CO2, this should have been enough to trigger an environmental change (3).Fifth, climate models fail. There was an increase in global temperature of 0.57C during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature. This clearly disproves the numerous computer models that the Pro cites as CO2 had increased after 2000 (2). Many believe that there will be an increase of anywhere from 2-11 degrees Fahrenheit due to info from computer models. Misinterpretation of results and models lacking the complexities of the fundamental global processes mean that these cannot be trusted. Consistently, politicians like Al Gore have predicted that the world would have literally ended by now. Prefer direct facts and empirical examples rather than theoretical results of greenhouse gases. Thus, do not automatically trust that greenhouse gases cause warming without direct evidence from changes in temperature \u00e2\u20ac\" the facts don't support this conclusion. (3) Though the Earth is warming, it's cooler than expected. There should have already been a two degree Celsius increase 100,000 years ago. (5) [Insert pie graph from this source]Sixth, fossil fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 levels according to the most accurate NASA data. From 1940 to 1950, CO2 levels flatlined. The only change was roughly .8 ppm downwards. World War II caused a massive increase in fossil fuel levels, yet this did not change CO2 levels. Prefer empirics. (4) Also, the Vostok ice core sample proves. CO2 increases did not increase temperature for 800 years. This sample also explains why a fall in temperature and a fall in CO2 correlate \u2014 cold water can hold more CO2 than warm water. Even more, temperature falls around 800-1,000 years before CO2 levels rise or fall giving water time to absorb the CO2. (5)Seventh, even if humans do increase CO2 levels, they're only responsible for a 3% increase. Even that released CO2 is not all directly released into the atmosphere given that the oceans absorb so much of it. Limestone, chalk, and other rocks have 100x as much CO2 as the atmosphere. This 3% is responsible for .27% of the greenhouse effect. \"If we were to cease all transport and industry right now, it is very unrealistic to assume that it would have any impact on global warming.\" (5) Eighth, solar radiation is the single largest cause of warming. NASA repeatedly releases articles explaining the importance of the sun and sun cycles on the Earth. The near infrared and visible light waves are absorbed by the lower atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. Thus, these areas heat resulting in a higher global average temperature. Even more, absorption of UV rays heats the stratosphere. There's a general scientific consensus that this increases temperatures in the troposphere. Additionally, sun spots serve to reduce or increase warming. These can sway warming either way considering that these are 11 year cycles. This can explain why times of higher CO2 did not increase temperature. Scientists believe that the sun is responsible for at least half of all the climate change seen in the past 110 years. Even the IPCC, an organization devoted to creating response to globa warming, agrees. (6)The 100,000 year cycle of radiation resulting from the elliptical orbit of the Earth is at a peak and will be for the next several thousand years. This radiation is consistent with spikes in CO2 methane. The melting of ice caps has happened with each of these cycles. The huge volume of these gases is too high to be anthropogenic but is consistent with previous cycles. Mars is also increasing in temperature due to the recent increase in solar radiation. Dr. H. Abdussamatov, head of the St. Petersburg Pulkova Astronomical Observatory, believes that the Earth has hit a temperature ceiling and will enter a cooling period despite fossil fuel use. This explanation accounts for the lack of increased greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. (7) [Insert Figure III]ConclusionSolar radiation, solar cycles, and multiple terrestrial temperature cycles are greater and more probable causes of warming. Humans produce very little emissions given the oceans' absorption and solar radiation cycles. The Earth has consistently changed temperatures before humans populated the planet. Even more, multiple empirics and evidence from around the world disprove the importance of humans on warming. 3% is a ridiculously small number when compared to multiple other emittors. CO2 levels were higher in the Ice Age when the Earth was substantially cooler. By placing some amount of doubt in the significance of mankind's importance on warming while promoting several other causes, humans are at least not the main factor of warming.(1) http://www.ncpa.org...(2) http://www.dailymail.co.uk...(3) http://www.napsnet.com...(4)http://www.americanthinker.com...(5) http://www.collective-evolution.com...(6) http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov...(7) http://www.americanthinker.com...**I'm going to advertise my surveillance debate here: comment on that page if interested! :)",

            "premise": "Plants like carbon- it's true. But there is a limit- there's too much which could be bad. Too little is also bad. And the deforestation and increasing temperatures are certainly not good for plant life. Most plants have somewhat strict requirements for shade, and more. Since I agree that currently it is probably good for plants (but following current trends it will not be within 8 years), I will not refute any more claims regarding that. It does not lead to more food- what about floods, rainforest destruction, and too hot temperatures such as in coral reefs. Hot weather is relatively new and won't really kill much. But this doesn't matter. We would not have fewer deaths. In 140 years the levels have risen 200 mm. This is almost irreversible and needs to soon be stopped. Facts Evidence Causes Effects Scientific Consensus Vital Signs Questions (FAQ) The consequences of climate change The potential future effects of global climate change include more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought in some regions and an increase in the number, duration and intensity of tropical storms. Credit: Left - Mellimage/Shutterstock.com, center - Montree Hanlue/Shutterstock.com. Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner. Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves. Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time. - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change. The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others. Net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase. \"Taken as a whole,\" the IPCC states, \"the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.\" Future effects Some of the long-term effects of global climate change in the United States are as follows, according to the Third National Climate Assessment Report: Change will continue through this century and beyond Global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. Global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of heat-trapping gases emitted globally, and how sensitive the Earth\"s climate is to those emissions. Temperatures will continue to rise Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time. Frost-free season (and growing season) will lengthen The length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture The length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen. In a future in which heat-trapping gas emissions continue to grow, increases of a month or more in the lengths of the frost-free and growing seasons are projected across most of the U.S. by the end of the century, with slightly smaller increases in the northern Great Plains. The largest increases in the frost-free season (more than eight weeks) are projected for the western U.S., particularly in high elevation and coastal areas. The increases will be considerably smaller if heat-trapping gas emissions are reduced. Changes in precipitation patterns Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Projections of future climate over the U.S. suggest that the recent trend towards increased heavy precipitation events will continue. This trend is projected to occur even in regions where total precipitation is expected to decrease, such as the Southwest. More droughts and heat waves Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere. Summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a reduction of soil moisture, which exacerbates heat waves, is projected for much of the western and central U.S. in summer. By the end of this century, what have been once-in-20-year extreme heat days (one-day events) are projected to occur every two or three years over most of the nation. Hurricanes will become stronger and more intense The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm. Sea level will rise 1-4 feet by 2100 Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100 Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100. This is the result of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. In the next several decades, storm surges and high tides could combine with sea level rise and land subsidence to further increase flooding in many of these regions. Sea level rise will not stop in 2100 because the oceans take a very long time to respond to warmer conditions at the Earth\"s surface. Ocean waters will therefore continue to warm and sea level will continue to rise for many centuries at rates equal to or higher than that of the current century.",

DiscussionOf note is the large proportion of abstracts that state noposition on AGW. This result is expected in consensus situ-ations where scientists \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc. . . generally focus their discussionson questions that are still disputed or unanswered ratherthan on matters about which everyone agrees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Oreskes 2007, p 72).\" [6]-stupidapeHowever, not about everyone does agree with this. Several problems were found with each of the studies that declared 97% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change occurs. For example, one such study was found to have only included 5% of respondents as climate scientists[11]. Then the very same study we are looking at above, used only the evidence that takes a position on anthropogenic climate change(for or against) and declared that 97% of climate scientists agree on it, when actually, that's only 97% of climate scientists who take a position, and doesn't take into account that some may believe it is inconclusive. It was found, in fact, that about 15% of climate scientists, when asked to rank 1-7 where 1 is not convinced at all, and 7 is very much convinced that anthropogenic climate change is occuring, ranked from 1-4. Which is a significant amount of scientists who doubt it or are unsure(where 4 would be unsure).[12] Just because majority of climate scientists agree, doesn't mean we can just immediately dismiss the evidence and opinions that suggest climate change is not real.\"False, as shown above, the 97% censuses is true. \" -stupidapeWell, as shown above, it's actually 85% who believe somewhat or more in anthropogenic climate change, and only 34.59% are absolutely sure[12] which means, technically, a majority have some doubts lingering in their minds otherwise they would have ranked it as 7. .6 degrees Celsius to be exact. That is significant considering the rate of change. Ego systems do not have the ability to adjust to such rapid change. Also, the majority of the temperature change is happening in the last few decades. [7] As for the Co2, being a small amount this is another red herring. Due to positive feedback cycles the amount is increased dramatically. You can see that in the previous debate. Finally, natural Co2 is cycled naturally, unnatural Co2 accumulates as a greenhouse gas. [12]-StupidapeThere are a number of problems with global climate models(GCM's) though, which is what this claim that the earth is warming is based off of. There is the general coldness problem, which indicates that the real temperature is actually colder than what the GCM's indicate. [13] Since we don't have a completely reliable way of measuring the global temperature, it can't be concluded that there even is warming. \"Natural Co2 emissions counterbalance themselves, [12] sun activity is at a low. [13] Other variables have been accounted for. [10]\"-StupidapeHowever, it's been proven that the Earth's position in orbit and rotational axis is changing, to the point where it's getting slightly closer to the sun. This also would result in warming, which is not mentioned at all in the tenth article you linked, so it hasn't been accounted for. [13] \"Compared to the thousands of peer reviewed scientific articles that do support climate change.\"-stupidapeThere are likely more studies than just those 90, I doubt skeptical science put up every single study that goes against anthropogenic climate change. Also, just because there is a smaller amount of studies, doesn't mean they can somehow be dismissed as easily as you have. You need to analyze them and compare them to the studies claiming anthropogenic climate change is real. Then you determine which ones have the more valid claims. Since you have not done this, most likely, it is too soon to claim anthropogenic climate change is real, thus there is room for doubt. \"As for the incorect climate models, only one model can be correct. Therefore the majority will be incorrect. It would be a waste to make redunant correct models.\"-stupidapeThis doesn't provide anything substantive since you didn't claim to know which one is correct, so again, how do we know the entire globe is even warming if we aren't sure we have the correct climage model?Sources:[11] http://www.nationalreview.com...;[12] file:///C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/The_Bray_and_von_Storch-survey_of_the_pe.pdf[13] http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu...",

            "conclusion": "Climate Change is driven by human CO2 emissions",
            "premise": "Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome once again to our debate! I deeply apologize (as said in the comments section of this debate) for posting my opening arguments when Mr. Adams clearly said that first round is for acceptance. I hope the audience doesn't vote against me for this, as I am hoping to offer a fruit debating, and learning experience with Mr. Adams here today. I would also like to thank Mr. Adams for acknowledging this in his last round and wish him luck in further rounds of this debate! :DREBUTTALS To begin, I would like to clarify a few definitions in order to make a lot of the previous round make sense.Correlations: Statistics-the degree to which two or more attributes or measurements on the same group of elements show a tendency to vary together.http://dictionary.reference.com... In this specifically we are talking about how much influence C02 Emissions have an effect on our global climate change.\" So, what is the CO2 correlation? Not surprisingly, it is under the .5 marks. But if CO2 was the main driver of climate, it should have a fairly high correlation, shouldn't\u2019t it? It\u2019s impossible for something to have a causation effect if it has no correlation.\"I am going to argue, to the full effect, that any correlation found in C02 emissions is harmful. My job as the Pro stated in the opening round, is to prove that CO2 emissions cause global warming. Period. My opponent admits in his own arguments that some correlation between climate change and C02 emissions does occur. Technically, this is all I need to win the debate. It seems that we can't deny that climate change is effected directly by C02 emissions. \"data from respected scientists that point to a correlation between CO2 levels and temperature rises over the past 800,000 years. Similarly, advocates for the contrary argument of solar variation causing climate change rely on data that points to correlations between solar activity and changes in temperature. In both cases, correlations exist;\" http://www.nowpublic.com...\"Correlations for other factors, though, seem a lot more promising. The correlation with the solar irradiance shows a much better correlation then CO2. Its correlation to surface temperatures is relatively strong, .57 (r = 0.57). This means the correlation is rated between \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d \"The problem I have with this is that this argument stems global warming from natural causes, where as clearly you are advocating warming is caused by human emissions. Again, my goal here is to prove that C02 in correlation to human emissions of C02, adversely effect the climate in some way. Even then, all I have to prove is the C02 emissions provide global harms. \"The scientific paper then examines data within the last ten years, the results? A CO2 correlation is no match at all. The correlation is only 0.02. (r = 0.02). IF CO2 was the main driver of climate, then why isn\u2019t the correlation higher in the past century, and so low within the last decade?\" I do have a problem with this information as it seems to be un backed by any source of logical entity. In fact I looked up the source my opponent cited, and found this on C02 emissions effecting global climate changes. The result is striking to say the least. This information is cited in the source by the carbon dioxide information analysis center. http://cdiac.ornl.gov...No matter how much my opponent would like to deny the information presented, the stats speak for themselves. Global warming IS a problem, and C02 Emissions, whether man made or natural made, are contributing. The entire point to this rebuttal is no matter how much C02 emissions effect the climate, my job is to prove that they do in fact, effect the climate. My opponent provides plenty of information from a source that seems to have a questionable logical entity. I have conflicting results to his r2= .44 theory from Government sites. It seems Mr. Adams entire argument here prays on the validity of the source. But even then, the source strictly contradicts his goal in this debate! I thus ask the readers to deem this argument irrelevant. OTHER FACTORSAgain we are seeing another completely irrelevant argument. The entire point of this argument from my opponent is to prove that their are other causes to global warming, and that the position of the galaxy is a leading cause. I agree that there are other causes for global warming. In fact, if my opponent were to clarify in the opening round that I would be arguing purely that C02 emissions were the ONLY cause for global warming, I myself would not have accepted this debate. Thus I ask my opponent and the audience what the point to this argument is. I have no rebuttals to it, because I agree with it! But absolutely NOTHING in this argument, argues anything to do with lack of C02 being a prime factor in global warming. Moving on. ConclusionI am concerned as to my opponents motives in this debate. I offer him the utmost respect when I say this: pretty much the entire case is just a bunch of thrown around sources and graphs, mixed in with irrelevant arguments. I honestly have no clue where he was planning on going with his previous arguments. None the less, feel I have upheld my burden in this debate. My burden is to prove that C02 has an effect on climate change.I have the burden of proof, and have fulfilled that burden of proof several times throughout the debate.I can find hundreds more sources that go to prove my point, and so can anyone else by simply Google searching the subject. But in order to get the most accurate information, I have cited 2 government cites, just to be sure that the information presented isn't faulty. On the other hand, my opponent has won this debate for me! His sources, his arguments, they all say that C02 has an effect on climate change. While we have dis-parraging results from each other, nonetheless, my opponent cannot admit that even C02 alone wouldn't cause an adverse effect on the climate, say 100 years ago. Even with his arguments being taken for face value, we can assume that in thousands of years, global warming can and will occur simply from C02 effects on the atmosphere. I thank my opponent for responding, and look forward to the next arguments. Thankyou for reading audience!",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.",
            "premise": "For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton & co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University) For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosphers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, \"there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.\" To the topic, this means that mitigting the effects of climate change is neccessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people. Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. \"When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that \"The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; \"Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; \"The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.\"(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions. Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all. Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions. Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together. In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries. Vote con",

            "premise": "In this round I will be refuting my opponent's arguments and I will be resupporting my own arguments My opponent stated\"First my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist.\"But what my opponent fails to realize is that quoting the pope is not an argument, an argument needs evidence, the quote from the Pope is not evidence of climate change, rather it is only a claim followed by my opponent's warrant. You can't just quote the pope and call it an argument, thus you have no first argument. The Pope's statement does not further your case (unless he was a climate scientist, then it would)So, because the pope is not a climate researcher I really don't even need to refute his statement but I have done so by showing that the Pope is not a climate scientist. In his first rebuttal my opponent stated that\"science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases\", but he shows no specific evidence of this occurring. Then my opponent quotes the EPA \"The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels\" However, if this were true then how come the decade long decrease in CO2 was seen, even as fossil fuel combustion increased (In the US alone 3 billion more barrels were used per year). In fact, my opponent conceded that point when he said \"Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertain\", so my opponent has conceded my first point. My opponent stated in rebuttal 2\"Argument two is cherry picking.\"But he shows no evidence of how it is cherry picking... Thus, this statement ought not to be considered, however I will prove how my second argument was not cherry picking... The definition of cherry picking is \"When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.\" [1]However, I have not cherry picked evidence because of the fact that I offered the statistical analysis of two major climate research satellites which have had their results peer reviewed by the scientific community and been found to be accurate. In fact, if I had cherry picked this evidence it would not show the .2 degree warming trend that it did...What is even more ironic is that my opponent goes on to say \"El Nino was responsible for the height of the graph.\" But even I conceded that the warming trend was there, in fact my opponent just contradicted his entire case by calling the warming trend that was apparent on the graph; El Nino, a regional, natural phenomena, that has nothing to do with Global Climate Change. So, if El Nino caused the warming trend on the graph, then Global Warming is a hoax because all warming trends over the period of the graph can be explained by El Nino (He said it, I didn't). My opponent in rebuttal 3 stated \"First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.\"By definition if the phenomena is not experienced GLOBALLY, then GLOBAL Climate Change is not occurring [1] (simple definition 1)\"Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees \" say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C \" would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't\"t melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.\"If this is true then how come one of the biggest proponents of Global Warming said that the poles would be ice free by 2013 [2], Leon Penetta once said [while talking about Global Climate Change] \"The melting of the Polar Ice Caps\" [3]. There seems to be a consensus among scientists and Global Warming Theorists that the Ice caps will melt when Global Warming occurs. Then How did my opponent find contradictory evidence? He found such evidence because he quoted a man with 0 climate science experience. His sources 4,5, and 6 are written by Coby Beck \"Former musician, turned tree planter, turned software engineer.\" [4] So, any quote by him ought to be ignored because it offers no expert value or value of any sort. In fact, my opponent is not even quoting the credible science in some of Beck's blogs, my opponent is quoting Beck's opinions which hold no value. My opponent in his 4th rebuttal quotes the same man again... and his statement ought to be ignored but in another one of my opponent's contradictory statements, he says \"temperature moved first [in relation to CO2]\", but if this is true, then how come the IPCC said that CO2 caused temperature to move? Which one is it? Either way my opponent has contradicted Global Warming theory as we are debating it and has negated his own refutation. My opponent's graph is quite interesting. The graph appears to show a correlation between CO2 and Temperature, however there are several occasions of temperature and CO2 acting independently, one major example is 400k years before present when the temperature increased dramatically for a (relatively) short period while CO2 decreased, and then again around 380k years ago where temperature decreased dramatically while CO2 increased. So, my opponent's chart, however intriguing, shows once again, that temperature and CO2 act independently from one another. Now I will Strengthen my original cases1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has conceded this point (see above for more details)2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordI have shown my opponent's rebuttal of this claim to be false, and his claim of a logical fallacy to be false, however I'd like to strengthen this point more. USCRN the largest and most advanced climate research network in the US has shown a decade long cooling trend. While the trend is statistically 0, it still shows no evidence of global warming. If the entire world is warming, (definition of Global Warming, see above) then how come the United States isn't? [5] s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt=\"\" width=\"1005\" height=\"551\" />Furthering my point, A large integrated network of Argo ocean buoys operated by the British Oceanographic Data Center in combination with satellite-enhanced data reveal no statistical warming. Again I posit the question, If the world is warming, then how come the US AND Britain (and the surrounding ocean) are not. [6] 3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theorySeeing as my opponent's refutation of this point was insufficient, I do not feel the need to strengthen this point. 4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesAs I have refuted my opponent's statements about this point I'd like to point out that my opponent has neglected to mention both of my charts for this point, both of which show an obvious independence between CO2 and Temperature, even over the time span of millions of years of data. Judges, seeing as my opponent has not fulfilled his BoP at this point in the debate you would be required to vote in favor of the Con. I look forward to reading my opponent's next argument, and I'd like to say that I'm enjoying this debate.

            "premise": "I will begin round two by defining a few additional terms: Isotope: One of two or more atoms with the same atomic number that contain different numbers of neutronsInfrared radiation: Electromagnetic radiation which we humans perceive as heatTroposphere: The lowest portion of Earth\u2019s atmosphereClimate forcing: An externally imposed perturbation in the radiative energy budget of Earth\u2019s climate system Now, on with the debate! Carbon dioxide emissions are increasing rapidly. In 1870, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 290 parts per million (ppm). As of April 2011, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to approximately 390 ppm (1). Very carefully calibrated measurements have confirmed that human activities are the primary cause of this increase, as I will demonstrate below. There are two primary carbon isotopes: carbon-12 and carbon-13. Carbon dioxide produced from burring fossil fuels and clearing forests has a unique isotopic composition. This is because plants prefer lighter isotopes, that is they prefer carbon-12 over carbon-13. Fossil fuels like coal or oil are derived from ancient plants. Thus, when we burn fossil fuels, we\u2019re releasing more of the lighter Carbon-12 into the atmosphere. If human activities are the primary cause of the observed increase in carbon dioxide concentrations, we would expect to see the ratio of Carbon-13 to carbon-12 fall. Indeed, this is just what we observe. Measurements from the atmosphere (2), corals (3), and sea sponges (4) indicate that this ratio has declined greatly over the past 100 years. Without a doubt, the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide is almost entirely anthropogenic. As I will demonstrate, several lines of evidence indicate that the current warming trend is caused by this increase in carbon dioxide. 1) More Infrared radiation is returning to the Earth: If carbon dioxide is responsible for global warming, more infrared radiation should be returning to the surface. Before presenting further evidence which affirms the resolution, I will provide a simple explanation of why this is so. The Earth emits a large amount of infrared radiation into the atmosphere. Some of this heat is absorbed by carbon dioxide molecules, which then reemit infrared radiation in all directions. Some radiation spreads downward and ultimately comes back into contact with the Earth\u2019s surface, where it\u2019s absorbed. However, some of the radiation spreads upward. In the upper layers of the troposphere, carbon dioxide molecules are sparse, and this heat energy can eventually escape to space. When additional carbon dioxide molecules are added to these layers, significantly more thermal infrared radiation from lower levels will be absorbed. Therefore, the place from which heat energy finally leaves the Earth will shift to higher layers. These layers are very cold, since temperatures decline greatly with altitude in the troposphere. Notably, the amount of energy emitted by an object is proportional to its temperature. Thus, these high altitude layers will emit significantly less radiation than the layers below, thereby retaining a large amount of heat energy. As these layers accumulate heat, they will warm and emit an increasing amount of infrared radiation. Thus, more radiation will spread downward and reach the surface, causing the surface to warm as well. Measurements from ground stations indicate that more infrared radiation is indeed returning to the Earth (5-6). When we take a close look at the spectrum of this radiation, we can determine how much each greenhouse gas is contributing to the warming effect. From these results, one scientist concluded that, \u201cThis experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming\u201d (6). 2) The upper atmosphere is cooling: As greenhouse gases trap more heat in the troposphere, less infrared radiation reaches the upper atmosphere, beginning with the stratosphere. Therefore, if the increase in carbon dioxide is responsible for the current warming, we would expect to see cooling in the upper atmosphere. This has been observed by several scientific researchers (7-9). 3) The tropopause has risen: Theoretically, global warming would also lead to an increase in the tropopause height. The tropopause is the atmospheric boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Because the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled, the tropopause has risen several hundred meters over the past three decades (10). 4) Oceanic heat content is increasing: Ocean heat content is increasing, especially in the upper layers. This specific pattern of ocean warming, with heat penetrating from the surface, can only be explained by greenhouse gas warming. As Barnett et al. concluded, \u201c[The increase in ocean heat content] cannot be explained by natural internal climate variability or solar and volcanic forcing, but is well simulated by two anthropogenically forced climate models. We conclude that it is of human origin, a conclusion robust to observational sampling and model differences. Changes in advection combine with surface forcing to give the overall warming pattern\u201d (11). 5) Observed precipitation trends can best be explained by increasing carbon dioxide: Zhang et al. showed that models do a much better job of matching the observed precipitation trends when anthropogenic climate forcings were included. As they stated, \u201cAnthropogenic forcing has had a detectable influence on observed changes in average precipitation within latitudinal bands, and that these changes cannot be explained by internal climate variability or natural forcing. We estimate that anthropogenic forcing contributed significantly to observed increases in precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, drying in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics and tropics, and moistening in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and deep tropics. The observed changes, which are larger than estimated from model simulations, may have already had significant effects on ecosystems, agriculture and human health in regions that are sensitive to changes in precipitation\u201d (12). 6) Most scientists believe that global warming is anthropogenic: Several studies have surveyed climate scientists who are actively publishing climate research. All of these studies found that over 97% of climate experts are convinced that humans are the primary factor changing global temperature (13-14). I look forward to my opponent's response!

            "premise": "GLOBAL WARMING IS REALAtmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are higher today than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. They are about 35% higher than before the industrial revolution, and this increase is caused by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. http://www.skeptic.com...; src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/4/3238/96287-3238-v3vsm-a.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.skeptic.com...; /> http://www.skeptic.com...; src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/4/3238/96287-3238-38un8-a.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.skeptic.com...; />Earth has been in radiative imbalance since at least the 1970s, where less energy leaves the athmosphere than enters it. Most of this extra energy has been absorbed by the oceans. It is very likely that human activities substantially contributed to this increase in ocean heat content. The amount of heat stored in the oceans is one of the most important diagnostics for global warming, because about 90% of the additional heat is stored there. The atmosphere stores only about 2% because of its small heat capacity. The surface (including the continental ice masses) can only absorb heat slowly because it is a poor heat conductor. Thus, heat absorbed by the oceans accounts for almost all of the planet\u2019s radiative imbalance. http://www.realclimate.org...; src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/4/3238/96287-3238-7g8k4-a.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.realclimate.org...; />Signs that the Earth is warming are recorded all over the globe. The easiest way to see increasing temperatures is through the thermometer records kept over the past century and a half. Around the world, the Earth's average temperature has risen more than 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) over the last century, and about twice that in parts of the Arctic. \"The planet is red\" in a global map of the change in average surface temperatures, noted Swiss climate scientist Thomas Stocker, co-chair of IPCC Working Group I responsible for this summary at a press conference. \"The world is warming.\" http://data.giss.nasa.gov...; src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/4/3238/96287-3238-kw63s-a.jpg\" alt=\"http://data.giss.nasa.gov...; />The Earth's average surface temperature rose by 0.74\u00b10.18 \u00b0C over the period 1906\u20132005. The rate of warming over the last half of that period was almost double that for the period as a whole (0.13\u00b10.03 \u00b0C per decade, versus 0.07\u00b10.02 \u00b0C per decade). The urban heat island effect is very small, estimated to account for less than 0.002 \u00b0C of warming per decade since 1900. Temperatures in the lower troposphere have increased between 0.13 and 0.22 \u00b0C (0.22 and 0.4 \u00b0F) per decade since 1979, according to satellite temperature measurements. Climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally varying fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.The climate system can respond to changes in external forcings. External forcings can \"push\" the climate in the direction of warming or cooling. Examples of external forcings include changes in atmospheric composition (e.g., increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in Earth's orbit around the Sun. Orbital cycles vary slowly over tens of thousands of years and at present are in an overall cooling trend which would be expected to lead towards an ice age, but the 20th century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden rise in global temperatures. For a direct look at the atmosphere of the past, scientists drill cores through the Earth's polar ice sheets. Tiny bubbles trapped in the gas are actually pieces of the Earth's past atmosphere, frozen in time. That's how we know that the concentrations of greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution are higher than they've been for hundreds of thousands of years.But if Global Warming is real, then why it is cold in US now? First of all US is not whole Earth, second of all may be because it is winter in northern pole. December 2013 was an unusually warm month even though it was colder in the U.S. In past December, North America was colder than the average over the past decade. But Europe and Russia were much hotter than average. India was cooler than average. Australia was warmer than average.

But although politics by nature is unscientific, the scientific community takes firm stances on issues that relate solely to science. \u201cWhen one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others\u201d (Russell). And on that note, the IPCC continues its statement, \u201cHowever there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities\" [58] Con appears confused: \u201cMr. Merrill's admission that his argument is poorly made is interesting,\u201d so it seems I must rephrase with greater specificity: Con presumed that because he could provide nine links that highlight second-decimal mistakes in climate prediction (round 1), climate science itself is a mistake, not unlike presuming that because one could find nine physicists who made mathematical mistakes, astronomy itself is a mistake. This I referenced as \"the fallacy fallacy,\" to which Con responded with incredulity [59], \"this is the first time that I have ever seen someone employ the \"logical fallacy\" card in a way as to be, in itself, a logical fallacy\" (round 2). . . though I am sure Con would love to believe I admitted to making a poor argument myself! To Con\u2019s question on the Appeal to Nature fallacy, how is an appeal to a scientific fact a logical fallacy? Well, take disease - it's natural, that's a scientific fact. \"Appealing to\" that fact doesn't just mean pointing out that it's natural, it means concluding that nothing can or should be done about it. \"Because something is 'natural' it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, good or ideal\" [30]. This is Con\u2019s argument that because climate fluctuations occur naturally, they cannot result from human activity. I did misrepresent that temperature anomalies chart, it showed 132 years. My apologies. It showed highly fluctuating anomalies in the last 17 years. If Con agrees with the Greenhouse Theory as he so surely claims, he cannot deny that significant increases in CO2 stand to boost global temperature. Con appreciates that my summary of source 41 conceded his point. I wrote it, I just re-read it, and I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cA causes B\u201d and \u201cB causes A\u201d - it\u2019s a simple positive feedback loop. \"The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society\" AAAS [60] This is not to be confused with political tactics like naming hurricanes after climate deniers. Science is defined by method which involves peer-review, and is not to be confused with the claims of political bloggers, activists or pundits. \"Comprehensive scientific assessments of our current and potential future climates clearly indicate that climate change is real, largely attributable to emissions from human activities, and potentially a very serious problem.\" - ACS [61] Nothing about the end of the world, just that it\u2019s a growing threat to society - probably one of many. \"It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.\" AMS [62] The AMS view is important here, because of Con\u2019s source that headlines, \u201cMeteorologists are Global Warming Skeptics.\u201d It\u2019s a strange headline for an article whose actual content states that \u201cAccording to American Meteorological Society (AMS) data, 89% of AMS meteorologists believe global warming is happening, but only a minority (30%) is very worried about global warming.\u201d Not skeptics, just not alarmists either. It\u2019s ironic that Con is the only debate participant here who believes scientists are alarmists on this issue. \"The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth\u2019s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.\" APS [63] No threats or bargains here, nothing about whether it\u2019s America\u2019s fault or China\u2019s fault, or whether this means we have to stop driving cars. This is about science, and science with a political target or without proper peer review is not science. It\u2019s easy to find geologists who are skeptical of global warming - they\u2019re paid to find oil, not think about its effect on the air. They don\u2019t perform peer-reviewed research. But the Geological Society of America, speaking for the science of geology over the business of it, concurs that Global Warming is anthropogenic. \"The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouseR08;gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s.\" GSA [64] And the American Geophysical Union agrees, \"The Earth's climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming. Many components of the climate system \u2014 including the temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean, the extent of sea ice and mountain glaciers, the sea level, the distribution of precipitation, and the length of seasons \u2014 are now changing at rates and in patterns that are not natural and are best explained by the increased atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols generated by human activity during the 20th century.\" - AGU [65] Sometimes the medical community even chips in: \"Our AMA ... supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.\" - AMA [66] 58. http://t.co... 59. https://t.co... 60. http://t.co... 61. http://t.co... 62. http://t.co... 63. http://t.co... 64. http://t.co... 65. http://t.co... 66. https://t.co...",

            "conclusion": "Climate Change is caused by Humans",
            "premise": "Point 1- There is an undeniable spike in CO2 levels in our atmosphere. To deny this is just simply foolish.In a matter of roughly 50-60 years, Co2 levels have spiked from 280 parts per million to over 400. To put that into perspective, in the past 800,000 years, Co2 levels have fluctuated between 180 ppm to 280 ppm. A change of 100 ppm would usually take 5,000-20,000 years, however, the current spike took a mere 120 years. While Co2 levels have certainly been higher than this previously in the history of the Earth, never before has Earth experienced such a rapid spike in Co2, the current increase is 100 times faster than at the end of the last ice age [2]. Point 2 - There is a human fingerprint on the carbon that we release. Carbon from different sources has different amounts of neutrons (called isotopes), for example, Carbon from the ocean is \"0\" (normal) while atmospheric carbon tends to be from -5 to -9 (meaning 5-9 neutrons removed). However, carbon from fossil fuels is an even lighter form of carbon; -20 to -35 [1]. Using this information, scientists can accurately identify the source of carbon that we find in our atmosphere. It is not coincidental that there\u2019s a rapid spike in Co2 while humans are polluting the air with tons upon tons of fossil fuels, the problem with this is, unlike plants and the ocean, factories don\u2019t take Co2 \u201cback in\u201d. The natural cycle balances the Co2 level by constantly adding and removing Co2, while humans are simply just adding Co2 without removing any [3] as shown by this chart. Point 3 - Using computers, scientists have shown that natural factors simply can't account for the changes we have seen. As shown by the following charts, without accounting human activity, these simulations can\u2019t explain the data we have been receiving. Point 4 - Since Co2 is inevitably a greenhouse gas, such a rapid spike in Co2 will cause temperature changes throughout the Earth. These temperature changes can provide a variety of consequences that scientists and the general population have observed; from rising surface temperatures to rising sea levels to the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere shifting up in recent decades. I won't go to the trouble to prove each of what has been observed for this debate is not about whether or not climate change is real, but whether or not it is caused by humans; both Pro and Con agree that climate change is real. In conclusion, scientists have recorded one of the biggest Co2 spikes in Earth history. Using the fingerprints that come with burning fossil fuels, scientists are able to record how much of the Earth's atmospheric carbon comes from the burning of fossil fuels. While the carbon cycle creates more carbon than factories, the carbon cycle is just that... a cycle, meaning it's constantly balancing the concentration of Co2 in Earth's atmosphere. However, factories, cars, and humans as a whole are just adding carbon to the Earth's atmosphere without ever using atmospheric carbon like the carbon cycle does. On top of that, recent computer simulations have shown that in order to get the type of changes we are currently experiencing... human activity has to be included or else the data we get back is not the one we have observed. The absence of human activity in these simulations results in completely wrong data, while the presence of human activity brings back accurate data; meaning human activity plays a large role in the climate of the earth. Since Co2 is proven to be a greenhouse gas and is proven to be directly correlated with temperature (as Co2 goes up so does temperature), a rapid spike in Co2 means rising temperatures across the globe, leading to a variety of consequences that we have recently observed. If not dealt with, these problems can only escalate and cause severe problems/destruction.Links[1] http://www.ucsusa.org...[2] http://globalwarming-facts.info...[3] https://www.skepticalscience.com...",

            "premise": "There are so many things wrong with this theory of global warming that my opponent is pushing, I will go over them and in effect respond to all of the claims that my opponent made in the last round. THE MATHIf 3.225% of CO2 emmissions are man-made, and 0.04% of the atmosphere is CO2, then man made global warming cxan only alter the global temparture by 0.000013%. In addition to this, CO2 is actually a very weak greenhouse gass. In fact, doubling the CO2 composition of the atmosphere would only increase the temparture by 0.6 degrees. {1} FEEDBACKSThe theory was that an increase in the CO2 composition of the atmosphere increased, and if this increased the global temparture, then the ammoun of water vapor in the atmosphere would increase, which would reduce the global temparture as water vapor, or clouds, reflect sunlight back into outerspace. This is actually demonstrable, if it is raining outside, is the air colder or warmer? Colder, of course, whilst, if this theory of possitive feedbacks were true, the temparture should increase when it is raining outside. Water vapor reflects sunlight, and every degree of heat on this plaet comes from the sun, directly or indirectly. In addition to this, the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes as its composition of a given atmosphere increases. {2}THE TRENDAs I said before, we are in the middle of a natural trend where the global temparture has been increasing, my opponent claims that climate change is still man made because 'there is no evience this trend will decrease,' but that's just nonsense, the global temparture has been rising since before man made CO2 emmissions. The temparture has been rising since 1600. GLOBAL COOLINGMore ice= colder tempartures, if warmer tempartures created more ice, then people would put ice cubes in their oven to freeze them, not their freezer. This is just common sense- if Antartic Sea ice grows,m this means that the temparture has declined, claiming that tempartures have declined because of global warming is just completely absurd. My opponent cannot simply dissmiss newsmax because he think's they have a quote 'right bias,' is just an ad-hominid attack, my opponent has used primarily liberal sites but seems to think that these are not bias. Fact is, the global temparture is cooling because the sun has cycles of higher activity and warmer activity, creating natural global warming , which is now coming to an end as solar activity is declining. {3} {1}.http://notrickszone.com...{2}. https://wattsupwiththat.com...{3}. http://isthereglobalcooling.com...",

But leaving aside the catastrophic/\"change dramatically for the worse\" assertion which is not supported by any scientific agreement. The most common source of this 97% number is in Cook et al. (2013) which leaves out the 'catastrophic' part. In Cook\"s summary of his paper: \"Cook et al. (2013) found that over 97 percent endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.\" ( main cause meaning over 50%) 97% of what? Of papers they surveyed. Not climate scientists. However, if we were to say \"97 percent of papers by climate scientists endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause\" this too would also false. ---------------------------------------- This is not a debate on if global warming exists or doesn't exist. This is not a debate on if global warming is harmful to humans. This is a debate on the 'Man Made' with the 97% claim. If it is not man made then it's usage is meaningless, and the claim should not be used. If there is not a 97% consensus, the the claim should not be used. My argument is that 97% of scientists, or climate scientists, or climate papers DO NOT agree that 'man made global warming' exists, and anyone who claims this is misrepresenting facts, and that the 97% claim should be disregarded a false. The Con side must prove that: 97% of scientists/climate scientists/climate papers agree that Warming is Man Made(51%).",

            "premise": "Thank you jwesbruce for accepting my challenge.first of all i would like to define the word climate change.climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years.it may be a change in average weather conditions or in the distribution of weather around avarege conditions.my main point on this issue is that climate change comes before the global economy so the world should focus on climate change.because if we do not focus on climate change it means that our land will be affected.e.g what if we have things such as global warming?that will be a case of one country but the world as whole will be affected.i would like to give you a very good axample by one country.let it be Zimbabwe.if there is global warming in Zimbabwe that means Zimbabwe can not produce the products it was manufacturing before because we manufacture products from raw materials.the country will have to depend on the other countries.that means there is no state income for that country.that is a process ,the economy that you were focusing on it start to decline.that will force you to go back and come with ways of ending global warming.because the economy of a country is sustained by the primary sector.how can you plant your seeds without the ground?and now where is people those are living in that country?is poverty not there?some firms will be closed up and people will be unemployed",
