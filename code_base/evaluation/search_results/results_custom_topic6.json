            "premise": "Due to recent events in our debates I have come to see that even though nationwide high schools now encourage students to strive for four-year universities and colleges I have come to ask myself if those four long years are really worth it? For many, a four-year college is an impossible option and other times for those who do strive for their education find themselves lost of what to now do with their acquired education. Seeing on the Debt.org website, an organization dedicated to aiding in college grads debt, that \"...college graduates are left with a diploma and an enormous financial burden of credit card and student loan debt \" and maybe no job in sight\". Especially focusing not just on these student's debt but also how they may not be able to even find jobs. In order for this economy to flourish we need a stable working class, but if the majority are jobless and in debt our country will plummet. In order to evade such disaster perhaps it should be taken into account that these full college educations are not worth it and instead strive for an Associates that can still provide well paid working jobs for many; trade skill occupations.",

            "premise": "Moving past unemployment, underemployment, and debt I would like to focus on life after a person has graduated a full four year college. Based off your claims I cannot deny that a person with a full college education does make more money than a person who decides to skip college or only work for their associates. Even seeing that unemployment and underemployment may be avoided if a person really strives out of a state such as California where finding jobs is much more difficult. But even though a person may find a job and pay off all their debt how long will it take for a four-year college graduate to finally live a normal life? Based off the online article website, \"The Balance\", and their article \"Making it Between College and Your First Job\", last updated March of this year, they state that it takes up to six months for a college graduate to find a job, depending on their field and the current economic conditions. Six months may not seem like a lot of time but compared to an average person without a degree who can find a job in between six weeks, there is a huge gap. Within these six months the graduate will need to not only figure out how to manage their lives but also figure out how else they will support themselves. This last issue many college graduates then face after college are the delays in their life. Facing the fact that compared to a person without a degree and who has already a paying job the graduate will then need extra time to move on with their lives. Finding delays in saving for retirement, delays in buying their homes, and maybe even delays in getting married. A full college education can take a majority of a person's time and while they are busy studying it takes time away from preparing for their life after college. However, because a person with a full college education can afford a home and save for retirement much quicker than a person without, it then all depends on the person. Some people would prefer living their lives out rather than having a college education and if that is their preferred life so be it. Overall, a college education can benefit those who decide to follow that path, but they will face their share of hardships during and after just as a person who doesn't go to college will face their own working difficulties.",

            "premise": "Increasingly in the past couple years, people have seem to forgotten the immense value of a college education, more specifically a four year degree. However a four-year degree(full-time) is more valuable now than ever. In a time of unbelievable competition in the job market, something has to be done to separate the best from the average. A four year degree shows not only knowledge in a specific discipline but also shows that one had the commitment to get the degree over a period of time. In the choice between a person with a four year degree and a lesser education, the person in the four-year degree tends to win due to the credibility of crendtials and knowledge. A four year college degree also gives an immense amount of options, compared to a two year degree which allows trade specialization. A four year degree allows trade speicalization of a two year, but also a lot more options that the other may not have available. A lot of the best paying workers start with a four year degree. In a dynamic world having options is invaluable and if you want real options of four year degree is the way to go. A full time education/ a four year degree often causes debt but so does any college education, however schooling for any comfortable life style costs money. The existence of grants and scholarships help offset much of this cost. Studies show that a full time student make more money faster than a part time student. According to Erica Loop who published an article called, \"What Benefits Are There for Being a Full-Time College Student Over a Part-Time Student?\" states that \"A full-time student is more likely to receive the full amount of the grant than a part-time student is\". It is more common for people with 4 year degrees make substaneously more than those with a Associates so people with a higher education degree have more of a capability to pay it off. Also some student may be discourage by the amount of time in order to be successful and loose focus.",

            "premise": "Main ArgumentI will be arguing that college is worth the time and expense.1. College graduates make more moneyStatistically, college graduates make more money opposed to those who are not college graduates. In America, those with four-year college degrees earned 98% more an hour than people without a degree in 2013. This has risen from previous years, meaning that college graduates are continually making more money than non graduates. Presently, the pay gap between graduates and non graduates is at an all time high. This makes a bachelors degree so much more valuable than it ever was before. Opponents of college say that it is too expensive, but because of the high pay earned by college graduates most graduates come out better than they were before. Think of college as an investment. It has been found that the average rate of return for a bachelor's degree has been about 15%, making it an excellent investment choice.The following picture shows the rate of return for the listed majors. 2. The benefits outweigh the costIt is true that college graduates will face financial expenses, but for the most part these are minuscule obstacles compared to the benefits of college. The average debt for college students is under $20,000. In the long-term, this is a minor expense compared to the money they will be making in the future. By far, the largest benefit of college is making more money than non gradates.Another benefit of college is that college graduates are more likely to have health insurance and retirement plans because they are more likely to get a well-paying career. Most careers include the benefits of health and retirement aid. Non graduates are more likely to be stuck working an hourly job that does not include health Going to college will naturally make you smarter. In college, a lot of thinking is required. This in turn develops the students brain and skills related to the brain such as problem solving, memory and decision making.To back up the claim that college students are smarter, I want to use a real life example. My Father is a project manager at a science institute. He has a number of people work for him who have graduated college, and who have not graduated college. Although these non graduates may be capable of doing what the graduates do, he states that the graduates are noticeably smarter, and have a better understanding of the work project than those without degrees. To conclude, he prefers college graduates as opposed to non graduates working for him.Sourceshttp://www.nytimes.com...http://www.usnews.com...http://money.cnn.com...",

            "conclusion": "A Full Time College Education is Not Worth It",
            "premise": "It is true that finding a job or position after graduating can be hard but like you said it all depends on the person's work ethics and situation. This may cause people to get a job from six weeks to six months depending on the major and area. Some areas need more jobs than others depending on the community's needs, resources, and stability. Some colleges have programs that make it easier to find positions for specific majors and it also depends on how bad the job seeker truly wants it. No matter what kind of education one accquires, full time or not, a person will have some difficulty finding a job. But it is after the position is obtained by an individual that makes the true difference. One goes to college to obtain a better and comfortable lifestyle by earning a greater salary. Charles Purdy published an article called \"10 Job Search Mistakes of New College Grads\" by a website called Monster Worldwide Inc, offering career advice and researching the top mistakes most job seekers and grad students make. Some of the mistakes listed on the website were not using the college's career office, not taking the job interview seriously, appearing unprofessional, setting expectations too high, misusing the internet, relying solely on the internet, and not being proactive enough. To elaborate on students and job seekers setting the expectation to high, most of them think of the perfect job instead of their \"first job\" or actually giving it a fair shot. In this economy, the first job should be about finding a position where one will learn great deals and skills, be super busy, and be surrounded by lots of people in order to get familiar and be more hands on with their career or major. Afterwards, there is always the option of transferring to another location if the first job isn't meeting their expectations. In conclusion, achieving any sort of education may seem challenging but the sole purpose of obtaining an education should motivate one to achieve greater than what they had before, whether it's a high school diploma or associates degree. A full time education may seem stressful but one should keep their eyes on the prize once their journey is completed.",

            "conclusion": "A Full Time College Education is Not Worth It",
            "premise": "One of your arguments are the factors of underemployment and unemployment rates when in fact it does rely and depend on the major or career. Many jobs today are being replaced by machines therefore people in society and undergraduates need to focus on being a full time student to get a four year education or higher to acquire skills and knowledge that can not be replaced by a machine. Whether a full time education is truly worth the time and money, one person may argue that with loans and being in debt may seem like a stressful situation, it pays off drastically with time. With a four year education, a loan can be paid off in a couple of years while still having a comfortable lifestyle. For instance, a family practice (doctor) goes to school for a total of twelve year (four years at a university, four years at medical school, and three years at residency) the tuition may seem high but he/she would be making around 325,000 annually so in numbers, it seems worth the time and energy to put force into a full time education, if the loans/debt will not be as a big deal to pay off. The conversation of underemployment and unemployment justifies the fact that the competition between a full time student and part time student is existing but the job or position will most likely go to the more committed student with more experience and education. Without being said, the rates of unemployment and underemployment are higher in California due to it having the highest population in the U.S with more people seeking classes in specific majors and jobs. This is why programs like the Regional Admission Counselors of California (RACC) is composed of college admission professionals who represent colleges and universities outside the state of California. They help students go out of state into universities with the same system and potentially find jobs and positions out in other states where the unemployment is not as high as California. With all this being said, myself as a high school and college student I would be lying if I said money was not a concern for me. However, according to Nerd Wallet, a website helping people save money had Devon Delfino, someone who personally invested in student loans wrote an article on December 16, 2016 called \"Advice From 3 People Who Paid off Student Loan Debt\" states that small adjustments make a difference into paying off student loans like \"tracking your credit score, using the avalanche method, and taking holistic approach to your finances\". All in all, this is something that will help students be young responsible adults and the rewards of a full time education will help take them to that next level.",

            "conclusion": "A Full Time College Education is Not Worth It",
            "premise": "I cannot deny that four-year college educations do provide higher paying jobs compared to a person with only an associate's degree, but even though the person may make more money it all depends. It depends on the major the person took, it depends on the amount of debt they will be in, it depends on the college they went too, it depends if there are even jobs available for them after graduation. I say this because yes, all college education does cost money, but some a lot more than others and it is because of this cost and rate of recent unemployment for certain jobs why perhaps the four-year education is currently not worth all its time and effort. While there are grants and scholarships for full time four-year college students to apply for to aid in their debt, that is if they take the time and effort to do so, many cannot forget that even after graduation and debt there also may lie unemployment and underemployment. Seeing in the online website article,\" The Economic Policy Institute\", last updated in April 21, 2016, that, \"For young college graduates, the unemployment rate is currently 5.6 percent (compared with 5.5 percent in 2007), and the underemployment rate is 12.6 percent (compared with 9.6 percent in 2007)\". Despite how low these rates may be now it cannot be ignored how dramatically the percentage changed from 2007 to 2016 in the underemployment rates and shows that in the due future these rates will only become increase. Through this percent of people who face underemployment and how it will begin to grow over time it can be seen that many people will have their four-year degree but most will never work to their educations actual potential. Lacking in that higher paying job they so longed for and then for those who had not applied for grants and scholarships finding themselves stuck in debt that they cannot escape due to their underemployed job. It is not common, but there are associate's degrees that allow a pay just as high as any bachelor's degree may provide. It is with these certain opportunities that people may take through a shorter college life that they will end up with not only a much smaller debt but also a well paid trade and working job that are currently in the need and are not facing unemployment or underemployment.",

            "conclusion": "Being successful in life is easier with a college education.",
            "premise": "1. My opponent makes the point that some of the most successful people did not attend college or did not graduate college. He provides a link listing the top 100 people that did not attend/graduate college. the issue with this argument is that this list is restricted to a very narrow career field. Most of the people on this list are either inventors, or founders of companies, with the exception of a designer and a few people who were successful in fields like law before it was legally required to have an education to do this. If someone did not want to go into these fields, it would be very difficult for them to be successful in life. My opponent also fails to mention that these success stories are a very small percentage of those that did not attend college. The majority of people who do not attend college are not this successful in life. There are huge numbers of people that do not attend college in the US alone, and we here very few success stories like this. The resolution also is discussing ease of success, not possibility. just because these people managed to be successful, doesn't mean it was easy. They had to work just as hard or harder to achieve success as someone that had attended college.2. My opponent argues that college leads to debt ad insecure financial standings. The source that he provides states;\"Seven in 10 college seniors (71%) who graduated last year had student loan debt, with an average of $29,400 per borrower.\" The source I provided stated;\"An Associate\u2019s degree is worth $390,000 more than a high school diploma. A Bachelor\u2019s degree is worth $1.2 million more than a high school diploma. A Doctorate (Ph.D.) is worth $1.7 million more than a Bachelor\u2019s degree. A Professional (law or medical) degree is worth $2.9 million more than a Bachelor\u2019s degree.\" Any one of these degrees will on average more than pay back the average $29,400 of debt that my opponent says college will give you. Which is more valuable: $29,400 in the present, or up to $2.9 million in a lifetime? Keep into consideration that saving the $29,400 in the present will not help you to earn more over a lifetime.3. My opponents first source from his third argument talked mainly about how the internship possibilities will help you in college applications and college. Also, the positions that you would intern in, generally require a college education to obtain in real life. This means that if you aren't attending college, this opportunity is of little to no value in the work world. My opponents second link is about cross cultural experiences you can gain n high school. While these are good experiences, and can help to achieve self fulfillment, they in no way can completely replace the college experience. Also, you can do both college and this type of experience, which would lead to even more self fulfillment.4. My opponent has failed to prove that college does not make financial success more easily obtainable. 5. My opponent has failed to prove that not attending college can allow you to achieve the same level of self fulfillment that attending college can give you. They have attempted to pose alternate solutions, but these could be used along with college to achieve maximum success in self fulfillment.6. My opponent has failed to prove that you can still have as many opportunities in different career paths if you don't attend college.My opponent has proven none of my points to be incorrect, and I have proven all of my opponents points to be incorrect. I can extend all of my points.I look forward to hearing my opponents arguments and thank them for the debate.",

            "conclusion": "This House Believes Single Sex Schools Are Better For Education",
            "premise": "I apologise. Unexpected opportunities for socialising arose. Well, you haven't really refuted my argument, you merely took the opportunity to focus entirely upon the academic aspect of education. Instinctively I suspected that there was far more at play than a simple coed / single sex dichotomy. Indeed, I know from personal experience that single sex schools are likely to be both highly selective and expensive. Satisfyingly, my thoughts are corroborated. \"As Faye Crosby, a professor of psychology at Smith College, and other critics have observed, Tidball did not control for characteristics of women's colleges, apart from sexual homogeneity, that might well account for the success of their graduates. She did not allow for the socio-economic privileges shared by many graduates of elite women's colleges or for the selectivity of the schools.\"[1] Furthermore: \"Tidball's subsequent finding, that single-sex schools produce more female achievers in the sciences and medicine, also collapses under scrutiny. Faye Crosby and her Smith colleagues found in a comparison of similarly selective single-sex and coeducational schools that \"women's colleges are not more productive.\" There are no definitive comparative data on the benefits of single-sex colleges for women. \"Data are slim,\" Crosby writes, \"but they indicate that coeducational schools are as likely to produce women scientists as are women's colleges.\"[ibid. p.2] In the same article, there is also a comment by sociologist Cynthia Epstein regarding the apparent superiority of single sex schools: \"There does not seem to be research support for this perspective\". It does not seem to be true, then, that your study is reliable. Even if I were to grant the truth of your study, what would this prove? Apparently, that single sex schools are better for girls. My issue with this is that we are discussing education for both sexes, and so you must prove it is better for both. I notice that your arguments have, on the whole, been rather feminist - discussions of 'sexual harassment', the focus on girls, and the idea that men are the 'aggressors' (a key feminist tenet). In the debate over coed and single sex education there is in general a rather sexist attitude - boys are incapable of keeping their hands off the girls, who are in turn 'frightened' and 'bullied'. These are two classic genders stereotypes, and they are always perpetuated by the side arguing in favour of single sex education. This is suggests to me that instead of challenging sexual inequalities through education, those in favour of single sex education are in fact promoting sexual inequalities by pandering to gender stereotypes. In my eyes, the position of those in favour of single sex education's superiority are in this mindset: 'Rather than teach our students how to coexist with the other sex, separate them!'. If you desire to create a world where males and females are equal and cohesive, then they must be educated together, for if they spend their education believing that men and women are irreconcilable, then they will likely believe this for their adult lives too.

Courseware is also free. This is more accessible to the poor because Hours are whenever you want to learn. There are no problem libraries. There is no one to bully you. The education you get will be the education you want. You can learn your whole life and not just K-12. I have already made that argument and my opponent replied incoherently. Again I am not advocating private education. I am advocating no education. A school voucher is a payment to a private school with funds that should be used for public schools. By using money that should go to improve the public schools, and instead giving it to private schools, School vouchers hurt the poor. The school system is not only racist but sexist and classist as well. Is there more emphasis on boys' athletics or girls'? How about in the colleges? A free educaion is exactly what we don't have. Remember it costs you. This will be simple. Everyone who would like all the money back that they spent for an education will vote for me. The \"education\" that you get is completely worthless. No employer will care if you know what the capital of Uruguay is. If you are self-taught that will catch his or her attention. It's clearly: Is the education you get in the public schools worth the money you are paying for it? You have to keep paying this $1500 for your whole life but are educated for only a few years, only about one-fourth of your life, so the real cost is about four times that, $6000 per year. So that's 1500 for life vs. \"education.\" A self-taught education is far superior to a classroom \"education.\" A community or neighborhood learning center with all the people participating vs the current system. Only losers cry \"irrelevant.\" Well the teachers do worse than the students on these tests so what does that tell you? Again \"private.\" I am not advocating private. I am advocating no. If the purpose of education is to prepare you for work then why not let big business finance education as they are eager to do and see what happens. The purpose of education goes far beyond that, however. How does English Lit prepare you for employment? It doesn't. It's not supposed to. Hannah Montana would be fine. Do you know the Bone Dance? YouTube would be more entertaining. Use the time you save to google \"open courseware\" as I have already advised. Visit your nearby computer, library, college and university. I have left out some of the details in order to allow the individuals to think for themselves. What is an \"education?\" Are we getting one? How should it be done differently? If you vote for my opponent but think about what has been said I will be happy. If you vote for me that would be OK too but more important is to think. My opponent is 21 and still in high school. I rest my case.",

            "premise": "First, let me show give you some definitions to you JudgeWe would like to define \u2018costs\u2019 We would like to define \u2018costs\u2019 as the tuition, textbooks, time, and the government\u2019s money we\u2019ll explain in depth later.The standard or Weighing Mechanism for today\u2019s debate should be EfficiencyWe use Efficiency as a standard or weighing mechanism for today\u2019s debate. We would like to state that colleges are good for individuals, family, and our society Judge, all of our contentions will refer to the observation that colleges are good. Please don\u2019t let our opponents trick you into believing that we, as the Affirmative, think that colleges are bad. We chose efficiency because we think of colleges as good, but they have too high prices. Imagine college education as a stock. One buys a stock and they hope their stock will rise in value so they can sell it for a better price. You may not buy a stock that has a high price since the probability of selling the stock later for higher is very little. The same thing is with a college education. You may buy a college education if the prices are low with a better chance of gaining a well paying salary in the future but you may not if the prices are high with a chance of a low paying salary in the future. This is why we argue Efficiency.With that we have 3 main arguments. Contention 1. The Individual Staindpoint We are worried that the costs of a college education will ruin someone\u2019s life...or rather more than one. According to the New York Times, college graduates under 25 that have a humanities major, 25.2% of them are not working, 29.4% have job that doesn\u2019t even require a college education. Only 45.5% of them are working in jobs that require a college education. That isn\u2019t even half! Obviously the cost is not worth the benefit. Carl E. Van Horn, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University said to the Huffington Post that \"Not every graduate program leads to a guaranteed job. You likely already have debt and you're going to incur more debt and what's it going to translate into down the road?\" asked Van Horn. \"While it's okay to major in cultural anthropology, understand that you may not end up as the next Margaret Mead. You may end up as the manager of a Sports Authority.\" This quote shows that not all graduate degrees will guarantee you a job, much less a well paying salary or a job that requires a college degree. You will most probably always be in debt. Contention 2. Government StandpointLoaning to high school graduates is all fine but this is not an efficient way to do things. This money that is going to the high school graduates\u2019 loans but they are being wasted with all the unemployment rates of college graduates being in debt. These college graduates are unable to pay their debt. This has led to parts of the Occupy Movement. These graduates are protesting to the government and asking them if they can not pay back the loans. If you, Judge, were looking at these protesters from a government standpoint, you would see all that money being wasted in the loans for the high school graduates and taking care of the protests.\u201cIt's a phenomenon familiar to economists. If you offer people a subsidy to pursue some activity requiring an input that's in more-or-less fixed supply, the price of that input goes up\u201d - startribune.com. This says that if there are government subsidies, the price grows. Since right now, we have government subsidies and that is what is bringing the costs up. Contention 3 - Societal BenefitsAs I stated in my second argument, subsidies are a waste. This money spent on subsidies could be used to improve public services including airports, roads, and the k-12 Education. Obama himself said in a recent speech that airports, roads, and bridges needed more money, according to CNS News. If we take away these subsidies, the extra money could go to there public services. Also, building and bettering airports, roads, and the k-12 system could supply more jobs, stimulating the economy, which, Judge, we all know is in very bad shape. The k-12 system especially needs some help. Only 7% of US students performs at an advanced level in math putting us behind 25 other countries. Only 32% of US students are proficient in math, placing us 32nd in the world-newsweek Aug 2011As you can see, abolishing college subsidies goes a long way.",

            "conclusion": "College Education should be Necessary for All U.S. Citizens",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for responding to my argument promptly. My opponent states 2 main points that: 1. American citizens can't afford a college education. 2. It doesn't guarantee a good job. However, I believe that college should be required as: 1. Universities offer better returns if you invest. 2. The number of scholarships are rapidly increasing, and even if you couldn't obtain one, community colleges offer a good education and often enough, financial aid. 1. Caroline Hoxby, a Stanford (and formerly Harvard) economist who specializes in educational issues, states that \"the value of the education has actually been increasing faster than the tuition. She calculates that at the most selective colleges, the amount spent on each student has grown at an average annual rate of 13% from 1967 to 2007, reaching about $92,000. Over the same period, tuition at the selective schools grew at an average annual rate of 6%. The difference is made up by increasing charitable contributions from alumni and others. The investment, says Ms. Hoxby, is well worth the money spent. Even accounting for charitable contributions, she notes, studies have found that students who attend highly selective colleges have much greater lifetime earnings than those who don't. The studies suggest that the return on investment in education at a selective school is similar to the long-term return on stocks. \"Since the mid-1990s, the average (inflation-adjusted) wages of college graduates have skyrocketed, increasing by 18 percent\" as of 2004, a recent study found. In contrast, wages of high school dropouts rose at about half that rate -- 10 percent -- over the same period. The Census Bureau in 2004 calculated that the average college graduate earns $27,800 more per year, adjusted for inflation, than the average high school graduate. That adds up to more than $1 million over a lifetime As you can see, and have probably already heard, a college education does lead to better wages for the majority of people who attend and graduate, therefore college does in fact offer better returns. 2. The number of scholarships are increasing, and community colleges are always an option. The University of Minnesota Scholarship Drive seeks to increase by 2,250 the number of students who are helped through privately funded scholarships. The goal is to raise $150 million, making it the largest scholarship fund raising effort ever undertaken by the university. Currently, 4,500 students receive scholarships funded through private gifts to the university. Indiana State University has increased the number of Presidents Scholarships to 20 for 2009-10, up from 15 in previous years, and has created a new University Honors Scholarship that will be awarded to 80 incoming freshmen. The Presidents Scholarships award is the most prestigious award at the Indiana State University, and increasing it to 20 is a massive amount, as it provides students with $15,000 dollars a year. The University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg will be offering approximately 75 more scholarships to incoming freshmen this fall as part of an effort to help students in tough economic times and maintain enrollment totals. Community college costs just a fraction of the total price tag for public or private four-year residential colleges. If you're short on cash and don't have the test scores to win a merit scholarship, community college can save you thousands. But don't make your decision based entirely on money -- many four-year colleges offer excellent financial aid for those with serious need. http://blogs.wsj.com... http://www.nasfaa.org... http://www.giving.umn.edu... http://www.pittsburghlive.com... http://collegeapps.about.com...",

            "conclusion": "The costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "=Monetary Benefits= My opponent tries to comb through my argument and pick through it but the bottom line is, though he disagrees with the extent of my claims made, that there still is a monetary benefit for college educated people. He claims there is ONLY a difference of over $275,000. That's still a lot; a salary boost of thousands a year. In the end, though we have varying studies (and there are literally dozens of college income and average income studies and numbers out there) the bottom line, concluded by both of us, is that there is a long term monetary benefit to attending college. Even the low number given by my opponent is pretty high, and if we average the two the benefit is even higher. Through it all my opponent failed to refute the claim that there is a monetary benefit to attending college which only helps to add weight to our case going forward when combined with other points.=Social Benefits= My opponent claims that 12 years of public schooling and some start up job positions can replace the benefits given by a college experience. However, this is simply not the case. He claims \"real world\" experiences are better than college experiences. However, while learning how to live on your own gradually and constructively in college you're also getting an education. Instead of flinging 18 year olds into a dingy apartment right away, college eases young adults into this transition making it easier on them. Also, my opponent claims \"job experience\" will give them more connections than college will. This is simply an unpractical claim to make. The jobs 18 year old high school graduates will be hourly wage jobs to start almost guaranteed. They'll have to work their way up to a management position in the 4-6 years they could be in college. College students however are usually hired for higher positions automatically and will forgo the wage jobs. Another thing, colleges have Career resource centers which specialize in helping college students get jobs. The UF center for example, gives out thousands of jobs a year to college students. [1] Also, they claim that many jobs are not advertised and are only reached through school and professional connections. Up to 80% of jobs never reach the \"job market\" via advertising. College students will have these connections via professors, internships and the resource center on campus. Non college students are barred from all this.=Opportunities=My opponent claims 54% of students have a chance of dropping out and 20% will drop out. Almost 100% of these drop outs occur within the first year of college meaning the damage financially and to their time will only be the extent of a year. They will owe 1/4th that of traditional 4 year students. The risk is not as high as my opponent claims. On year of tuition will be about $5k not the full extent of a student loan. Also, again, the experience and status of being college educated is always there. Even if you have to start out poorly, you will always have that status which will help you advance long term. People without college educations will always hit a barrier when on the rise. People without college educations will always be barred from positions requiring an education. This is huge. The opportunities presented by a college education are forever. Not having a degree will close these doors to you and they will never be opened. =Problems with Pro-College Studies=\"because it includes individuals who graduated college 20-30 years ago\" This helps to reiterate my point that college degree benefits are more long term than my opponent wants to acknowledge. Even 20-30 years later these college graduates will get jobs and according to multiple studies will be making some amount more than their non degree holding counterparts. My opponents claims about the recession are misleading. The recession caused EVERYONE'S unemployment numbers to rise. It did not affect any one group more or less than another. Of course, if unemployment is above 8% college graduates will be affected by this. =Causation Versus Correlation=My opponent makes a rather weak claim here about causation. He claims people who go to college would be successful anyways and therefore college studies are not as straight and true as they appear. However, it doesn't change the common denominator in all these studies which is a college education. People geared towards success do tend to go to college as my opponent points out. Why? Because college gives benefits. If college benefits did not outweigh the costs then these success driven people would not attempt to attend college. They attend college because of the tangible benefits to be gained.If these college eligible people would earn more regardless of college; why attend? Because college is obviously more beneficial than not. Or else they'd continue without it and earn more anyways. College enhances these skills and benefits. =Chance of Benefits=I said before, college benefits last a lifetime. The degree will always be with you, so chance of success is exponentially greater throughout their lifetime than a non degree holding person. Also, as I mentioned before, the drop outs occur almost exclusively in the first year of college so the damage done is only a year's worth. College loans for one year, not four etc.The chance of benefits and success are exponentially greater for a college degree holder than a non college degree hold over a lifetime due to the ability to be exposed to college educated positions etc.=Conclusion=* College monetary benefit is present and confirmed by my opponent* Opportunities for jobs are exponentially greater than non degree holding people* Most high level people (CEO's, politicians etc) all have college degrees* If college didn't offer benefit's so many success geared people would rely on themselves and forgo collegeThe benefits of college outweigh the costs.[1] http://www.crc.ufl.edu...",

            "premise": "The crucial aim of the students is to get a good job and a good life, and college is where they get professional knowledge, develop dreams, and complete education. College is also a good motive for students to study, and it helps students focus on studying. If students go to college, their individual potential will be raised higher and the educational quality will get higher. Also, with skills and knowledge learned in college, students will be enabled to get better jobs and better lives. Emphasis on college education will help economy and it will help citizens have higher competence. Moving on to my first argument, our first argument is about individual potential. There are many levels of schools. In elementary schools, students learn the basics. In middle schools, education is lengthened. In high schools, the education is advanced more. In college, education is completed. College is a good way in pulling up one\"s potential in many ways. Students who didn\"t study and who were lax in studying try to concentrate because they want to have a good life and college is a good tool in getting a good life. Also, while in college, students who didn\"t have interest in studying may start to get interest because they might find something specialized that they really like and develop a dream, or they could try to expand their education and get further knowledge. In college, educational quality is also higher. In college, there are specialized majors and much deeper education is possible. For an example, art learned in high school would comparatively be much shallower than art learned in college. So in college, students can have their individual potentials pulled up, and the educational quality is higher too.",

Some studies even show this \" Our analyses show that single-sex schools are causally linked with both college entrance exam scores and college-attendance rates for both boys and girls. Attending all-boys schools or all-girls schools, rather than attending coeducational schools, is significantly associated with higher average scores on Korean and English test scores. Compared with coeducational schools, single-sex schools have a higher percentage of graduates who moved on to four-year colleges.\" [3]In addition more boys tend to pass reading in single sex schools On balance people in single sex schools often spend more time with homework and studying as well Also just all around grades tend to be higher.

            "discussionTitle": "Federal Department of Education should be shut down",
            "conclusion": "Federal Department of Education should be shut down",
            "premise": "Thank you to Pro for putting up an interesting debate and one that should prove very interesting. I. History of the Department of Education The Federal Department of Education's origins date back to 1867 when President Andrew Johnson signed the legislation creating the Department. However, back then, it's main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the schools. There was concern that the Department would exercise too much power over local schools and thus, was demoted to the Office of Education 1868. Beginning in the 1950's, different changes in the social and political arenas resulted in expanded funding for education. With the launch of Sputnik in 1957, nationwide concern led to increased aid for science programs. During the 1960's, the nation saw even more education funding with President Lyndon Johnson's \"War on Poverty,\" calling for the creation of programs to improve the education of poor students at all levels. In October of 1979, Congress passed the Department of Education Organization Act and the Department began operations in May of 1980. [http://www2.ed.gov...] II. Purpose of the Department of Education The purpose of the Department of Education is to enhance \"student achievement and prepare them for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and insuring equal access.\" The absolute purpose of this Department is to ensure a quality education is made available regardless of age, race, and social status. III. Why we need the Department of Education a. The Department of Education is responsible for controlling college education funds that go out to needy students in the form of financial aid. Without the Department being involved, college education loans would not be as efficient as they have been in recent years. Student loans ensure that students can receive the education they deserve in a college of choice to help shape their careers, thus shaping the future of the country. b. The Department has positive impacts on the American Education system. The Department is tasked with the duty of looking into the needs of of teachers, children, and their parents to ensure that the highest level of education is being provided. c. Education rights of non-citizens would be violated. Thanks to the Department, it has been possible for international students to gain entry into American schools. IV. The Problem with eliminating the Department of Education Eliminating the Department leaves states to handle the Department's functions. Many cast doubt that the states would be able to administer these functions due to financial wars being witnessed by all of the involved states. Dividing and allocating the funding would bring much disagreement amongst the states. Which states would receive more funding? The states that have the higher populations? The states with the best test scores? The states with the worst test scores? There are too many questions too ask and every state would become upset that another got more funding. Education in America needs the Department because it ensures a quality education to both American and international students, ensuring equity in education provision and reception in schools.

            "conclusion": "The costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "=Monetary Benefit=The average cost of college tuition for a State school is roughly $15,000 a year for a 4 year program. [1] This averages out to $60,000 total in college costs after 4 years. The average salary for someone with just a high school diploma is $23,000 a year. [2] The average salary for someone with a Bachelor's degree is $45,500 a year. [2]With a college education you're making $22,000 a year more than if you didn't go to college.If we average this out, say you get out of college at age 22 and you work until age 65. That's 43 years of work. Say you're unemployed or injured for (a generous) 5 of these years. That's 38 years of work. Over these 38 years a college graduate will make $890,000 MORE than his counterpart that did not go to college.Subtract out the $60k for college costs and you've still got a net profit of $830k that you would not have made if you didn't go to college at all. =Social Benefit=There is a huge social benefit to going to college. Not only do you make lifelong friends and connections, you learn to live on your own. You have to feed yourself, go to class, work, pay your bills, do your laundry etc without your parents help. Those who leave (or don't leave) at 18 will have the penalty of not having the beneficial college transition into life. After college, students are usually prepared and willing to go out and live and work on their own, completely independent. While social benefit doesn't have a numeric value attached to it, it is extremely valuable. You can't replace the \"college experience\" with work experience. The friendships, job connections, skills and social transition are all invaluable and give those who finish college a huge boost over those who did not. =Opporitunities= My opponent keeps claiming that college is \"too risky\" and that many people shouldn't even try. But if you don't go to college at all, if you don't try for fear of failing etc then you'll forever shut out the opporitunities that a college education can bring you.Many jobs REQUIRE a college education. If you don't have one, you'll forever be barred from applying for them. Even if you don't get a job right out of college you'll always be able to apply for college degree jobs. Those who don't attend high school will never be able to apply for these, ever. My opponent claims the value of a college education is dropping - then how worthless is not even having one to begin with then? It is silly to forever shut out ample future opporitunities for better employment, better pay and greater experiences due to the fear of failing. Even if it doesn't pay off immidiately after you graduate, you'll always have the degree and the experience to use for the rest of your life. \" Individuals with only a high school diploma were twice as likely to be unemployed as those holding bachelor\u2019s degrees.\" [3] You're more likely to be unemployed...always, without a college degree. \"Statistics project that 75 percent of future positions are expected to require at least some type of certification or licensure, and professions that require a bachelor\u2019s degree are projected to grow nearly twice as fast as the national average, making a college degree a good investment.\" [3]All of these positions are forever barred to you without a college education. That severely limits your opporitunity of employment and careers. =Conclusion=* There are tangible and large monetary advantages for those with college degrees vs. those without.* College has social value and provides you skills and experiences that are valuable throughout life.* A college degree is a permenant asset and a long term plus. You'll always have it. * College degrees open up and hold far more opporitunities than just a diploma. * The costs of a college education are easily outweighed by the abundant benefits.

However, my stance is that we don't really regret the emphasis on college education, not that everyone should go to college. Believe it or not, in our country(I'm a South Korean), colleges have become prerequisites for entering into society, and companies and businesses put much importance on what college that person has come from. In the society that we face today, it is inevitable that we put emphasis on college education, and I don't regret it. People from vocational schools are also a bit discriminated, so it would be more efficient for the students to enter into college education. Moving on to my second argument, our second argument is about economic benefits. If students go to college, there will be much more economic benefits. First, the overall level of education will get higher, as people will get deeper levels of education. This will cause the general mature civic awareness, and people will get much more efficient in whatever they are working on. This will bring more profit. Also, with more specific information, better technology and things such as better inventions will be enabled to be made. Also, there are high possibilities that better firms will be born too. All these will help to make profits in global market and etc. So there will be benefits to the country because people work much more efficiently, better technology and products are made, and better firms are born. The cause of all this can be traced back to college education.",

Rebuttal: \"By benefit, I mean that it would cost less money for students over the time it takes to get a 4 year degree.\" Yes, the financial cost is remarkably lower. But, a vast majority of Community Colleges only offer a 2 year degree program. That is only worth an Associates Degree. With this being said, if you wanted to work harder towards a Bachelor's degree, you'd have to move to a University, or find a four year Community College to transfer to. Even then, that is IF the class is transferable. It's not necessarily less money either. When transferring into a University, most colleges charge full price for every class you still needed to take. Therefore, you're getting a somewhat better deal, but not much. If you're going to live on campus, that's even more. It's better in cases of class size, but the education value is much better at a University.

Both Con and I agree that college can be a great learning experience with good possible returns for companies and society. However, my argument from the start of this debate has been that there are alternatives that serve as good if not better purposes, and that emphasis alone won't lead to more successful college graduates. Pro says he doesn't necessarily support college as a prerequisite. This is really an example of emphasis taken to an extreme, one I have already explained is harmful to society and students. Pro says that civic awareness is gained through education. I agree. Any education can provide civic awareness. Therefore, this is not unique to college. Pro says that college can provide on-the-job experiences. I agree, though I would say this is uncommon. Both vocational schools and apprenticeships are guaranteed to include this, and therefore far more efficient. Pro says that a deeper, more specific education makes technology better. He also says they need a wider education. He can't have it both ways. You either get broader or you get deeper. As I granted depth, I'd say that's likeliest, and it leaves many students with very specific knowledge and little innovative capacity. So voters should be asking themselves some basic questions: 1) Does the emphasis on college education lead to more college students capable of doing well in that academic setting? 2) Is it better for students to feel that their future is determined solely by whether they go to college, or by whether they receive more extensive educations? 3) Does the emphasis displace other important forms of education that more directly lead to economic benefits for students, companies and society? 4) Does going to college strongly link to the beneficial outcomes Con has stated? I think I've made it clear what the answers to these questions are. I leave it to the voters to evaluate the debate.",

            "conclusion": "The costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "In this round, I will finish up final rebuttals, then list both the costs and benefits of a college education. Weighing and impacting each point will be done at the end of the round.Monetary BenefitsWhen talking about monetary benefits, note that the claim was always about lifetime earnings. Lifetime earnings and opportunity costs are different points, and higher lifetime earnings does not show that you will accumulate more wealth, simply that you will have a higher income. I agree with my opponent that the average college graduate will have a high lifetime earnings differential. However, there is no \"averaging\" to be done. The number stands at roughly $275,000, as other studies are too flawed to be considered.DebtMy opponent has mostly dropped this point, instead focusing on monetary benefits. Simply because one will have higher earnings (not wealth) over their lifetime does not mean that debt should be ignored.The average college graduate will be in debt until the age of 33. As was brought up in my first contention and not refuted: \"College graduates and postgraduates, instead of buying cars, buying houses, getting married, having children\u2014in other words, becoming full-fledged consumers are, as Nance-Nash puts it, \u201crunning back home.\u201d That hurts us all.\" Some small weighing to be done: A small chance of earning $275,000 versus being in debt for eleven years, with a 20% chance of defaulting and losing everything. It's fairly obvious that these costs outweigh the monetary benefits, especially when combined with opportunity cost.Investment Potential (opportunity cost)A brief reminder: If a college graduate misses out on an opportunity, this is considered opportunity cost. If I can show that college graduates miss out on an opportunity to make more money, then this must be considered for total wealth accumulation.My opponent only responded to my point on job experience, leaving the investment point un-touched for the entire debate. This alone justifies a pro ballot. Investing money, rather than going to college, will result in far more wealth (more than three times as much) by the age of 65, even if the college graduate invests too. This is using the average savings rate, investment returns, cost of tuition, etc. Simply put, this point outweighs any possible monetary benefits that my opponent can bring up, and the point was dropped. The opportunity cost of going to college is roughly 1.3 million dollars.Pro-College Studies PointIn the last round, my opponent claimed that this point reinforces his case. This is entirely false. The only way it would do this is if con could refute my points of how college graduates no longer receive the same benefits that they did years ago. I brought these points up in rounds 2 and 3, and will reiterate them here. In round 3, I showed that the recession did hit college graduates harder, as is shown by the fact that they now have the same unemployment rate as non-graduates, when 10 years ago they didn't. Again in round 3, I showed that job growth is occurring in areas where college degrees are not needed. However, more and more people are going to college. This greatly decreases the value of a college education. This causes underemployment, meaning more and more college graduates are not gaining the wage benefits that my opponent has brought up. \"More than half of America's recent college graduates are either unemployed or working in a job that doesn't require a bachelor's degree.\" Default rates have increased. Drop out rates have increased. An average college graduate is going into an environment that is completely different than it was 20 years ago. Thus, this entire point still stands: only recent college graduates can be considered, unless con can show that these graduates will eventually reach the earnings/employment potential of past graduates (note that burden of proof is shared in this debate). Drop-outs and Defaults.My opponent misunderstands my drop-out point. The focus was not on the cost of dropping out. The focus was on the fact that less than half of those who go to college even gain any benefits.Defaulting, however, should be considered as a cost. This point has not been adequately touched upon by my opponent. We've already established that the monetary benefits will be roughly $275,000 (other than opportunity cost). If you default on your student loans, you lose all of that. It cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy: your wages will be garnished, your tax refunds offset, you will be ineligible for future federal employment, etc. This is an extremely large point greatly undermines the value of a college education. One-fifth of all borrowers will default and lose all their monetary benefits. My opponent focuses a lot on the benefits of a college education. However, one must ask themselves: how likely am I to actually achieve this benefits? The answer is not likely at all, roughly 40%. Once again, this point alone can justify a pro ballot. If 60% of students will not even attain these elusive benefits, then they shouldn't even be considered in this debate.Social BenefitsAs I've stated before, this point has a very small impact.My opponent again mentions that you are \"learning to live on your own gradually and constructively.\" I brought up in round 3 that you must also learn to live on your own if you don't go to college. My opponent responded to this by saying that \"you're also getting an education,\" but this point is meaningless as we're debating about whether or not the education is worth it in the first place. What's the difference between learning to live in college, and learning to live in the real world? You have to constantly worry about debt, you have to work jobs to in order to finance your education on top of class work, you have to go 11 years knowing you're at a disadvantage for buying a home or getting married, you know you have a massive default/drop out rate, etc. The social benefits of going to college are easily countered with the social costs. I concede that you do not lose job connections by attending college. However, it is fairly clear that you don't gain many either. Why? Because the unemployment rate for college graduates and non-graduates are the same, and because the majority of job growth is occurring in areas where you don't even need a college education. Also note that my opponent statistic on 80% of jobs aren't advertised does not show that non-college graduates only gain access to 20% of jobs. Con's own source mentions you gain access to these 80% of jobs through your \"network,\" which includes, friends, family, peers, social organizations, service providers, recent graduates, etc. This does not require a college education. Causation versus CorrelationThis point wasn't intended to completely negate con's benefits. Rather, it was to show that those who qualify to go to college will automatically have higher earnings/unemployment potential than normal high-school graduates, due to their own personal traits. My opponent's claim that college offers benefits because success-driven people decide to go simply cannot stand in this round until con can show that they achieve such benefits. I've already shown that there are little benefits to a college education, and large costs.What is not a benefit?Lower unemployment.Greater overall wealth.Social benefits.Job opportunities. BenefitsRoughly a 40% chance for a $275,000 lifetime earnings differential.Costs1.3 million dollars of opportunity cost, which my opponent has not refuted at all.A 20% chance of defaulting and losing everything if you borrow money.Being in debt for 11 years and unable to become a full consumer.ConclusionYou will have roughly 1 million dollars less wealth than if you were to spend money elsewhere.You will gain no noticeable benefits over a non-graduate.You are extremely unlikely to achieve any benefits. College is 11-15 lost years of your life with nothing to show for it.",

So the point I am making here, Is that If we can put a generation through college for free, then they will be able to help fund future generations through college too. For my opponent's second contention- They stated that free college would be immoral. That it creates cultural Marxism. that it obscures our first ammendment rights. I don't see how any of these statements are true. I would also like to ask my opponent if the think that the American Public Education System is Immoral, just because there is no direct tuition involved. How is something Immoral because you are not directly paying for it? Also with my opponent stating that Free college is Immoral does this make the equality that it causes immoral? Does this make education Immoral? What exactly is Immoral about free college, What is immoral about diversity, and Learning? Since I fail to see how this argument even applies to the resolution I would like my opponent to respond to these questions in their next speech. 1. Immorality of free education???? 2. By saying that college shouldn't be free, You are denying the possibility of a better future to thousands of Students. What do you have to say about that. 3. Would you be willing to fund even one generation to go through college, so that they can fund the next generation and so on. Eventually someone that you know could benefit from this.",

            "premise": "I\u2019d like to thank my opponent for this debate and also apologize for the late response. Before I begin addressing the contentions, I\u2019d like to point out some issues associated with the way my opponent has set up this debate. First of all, because my opponent has not set any specifications for the term \u201ccollege\u201d, I\u2019m going to assume that he\u2019s referring to post secondary education in the United States. Additionally, we must also place a distinction between the inherent and extrinsic costs of college. For example, we can still have colleges without student loans; it is simply the government\u2019s choice whether or not to distribute them. Ergo, student loans are not an inherent cost of a college education; they are simply extrinsic costs that should not be associated with the \u201ccost\u201d of maintaining a college, making my opponent\u2019s second contention a moot point. We must also draw a distinction between private and public colleges, as they are funded differently and receive different kinds of subsidies, which I will address in the contentions. ===THE CASE=== Do individuals benefit from investing in a college education? My opponent\u2019s case hinges on the belief that college education does not necessarily lead to a career or a decent salary. To prove his point, he posts a bunch of unsourced statistics: \u201cCollege graduates under 25 that have a humanities major, 25.2% of them are not working, 29.4% have job that doesn\u2019t even require a college education. Only 45.5% of them are working in jobs that require a college education\u201d. The first problem with this argument is that the statistics he uses to back it up are biased and inconclusive. Obviously some majors are more likely to yield careers than other majors. To put this skewed statistic in perspective, only 4.2% of university graduates are unemployed six months after graduating if we account all majors [1]. Additionally, whether the job they land requires a college education is irrelevant, because a college degree is still an important credential which helps secure employment (even if I were looking for a cashier, I\u2019d rather higher a cashier with a diploma than one without). The second problem with this argument is that it needs some relative statistics to put the information presented in perspective. This relativity is essential because without it, we don\u2019t know whether the high unemployment rates are the result of an inefficient college education or just a frail economy, and when we look at the employment rates for America as a whole, what we find is that high school graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed when compared to college graduates. We can safely conclude that despite side proposition\u2019s misleading statistics, college graduates do have a significantly higher employment rate because of their investment in a post secondary education. This idea of relativity brings me to my constructive argument. The fact is that when we tally up unemployment rates, the degree you major in, the number of years it takes to major and everything, what we find is that the individual with a bachelor\u2019s degree earns, on average, almost 1 million dollars more than the individual with only a high school diploma [2]. I\u2019d gladly invest $20,000 \u2013 $30,000 for a million dollar return. Monetarily speaking, from the individual standpoint, college is an efficient investment and much more beneficial than costly. Additionally, one must not forget the experience of college, which, to many students, is priceless. Skipping college would mean missing out on college means missing valuable education, networking, and social opportunities (such as college parties). So unlike what my opponent suggests, the average college graduate will most likely not \u201calways be in debt\u201d. What\u2019s more likely is that you\u2019ll go to college, have a great time, and land a career that\u2019ll net you almost a million dollars more than your high school graduate neighbors. Because of the reasons that I have stated, college is clearly beneficial from an individual standpoint. Does the government/society benefit from investing in a college education? My opponent\u2019s argument here is essentially just pointing out how the government has to subsidize colleges, and that the subsidies can go into other much needed investments. This argument falls because my opponent does not state how much money goes into the college subsidies (like saying there is a cost, without saying how much the cost is), and because college subsidies need to be broken down to the cost of college per se and extraneous costs. This needs to be broken down further into subsidies for private and public colleges. When subsidizing public colleges, the government needs to fund the entire cost of building and maintaining the college. I accept that this is a cost of a college education, but I\u2019d just like to point out that the tuition costs of public colleges goes back to government coffers. When subsidizing private colleges, the government basically does three things. The first thing that the government does to subsidize private colleges is offer students financial aid. I have already explained why student loans should be dismissed, as they are not a direct cost of college. Even if my opponent can somehow prove that they are, the point about the inefficiency of providing student loans falls because government loans/subsidies per student have been falling due to increasing attendance rates, and tuition has still never been higher. The government also gives grants for research teams. However, these grants cannot fully be considered subsidies because we are essentially buying information, which is something we benefit from. Lastly, the government gives tax breaks to private colleges. If we disregard financial aid, private colleges are basically a self sustaining, mutually beneficial industry, that does not have a cost. Finally, I\u2019d like to point out that post secondary education is often cited as the most powerful contributor to social mobility, something that society and individuals benefit from. ===CONCLUSION=== I was a little confused when constructing my arguments because of some of my opponent\u2019s arguments. His last to arguments really seem to be about abolishing college subsidies and redirecting it to investments in things such as infrastructure, which I actually agree with. However, as I have explained, these are not inherent costs of a college education; they are simply inefficient ways that the government handles its money. My opponent seems to agree with me that the benefits of college per se outweighs it\u2019s cost, and that it\u2019s just the inefficient way the government approaches it that is the problem. Therefore, the resolution is negated because the benefits of a college education outweigh its cost; the only problem is the misappropriation of government funds. I thank the readers and hand the debate back to my opponent. ===SOURCES=== [1] http://www.economist.com...[2] http://www.lorainccc.edu...",

Most athletes at the end of The year still end up paying around 3k in exspense not covered by their scholarships to attend school. It is true that many athletes receive full scholarships to participate in college sports but the value of their educations is greatly diminished due to the demands put upon them by their participation in sports.

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for readily responding to my argument.Now I will immediately respond to his case points.1. Education is the most important thing you can have, therefore we should make it available to everyone.Your argument is based on nothingness. Is education really the most important thing you can have? Is education necessary to do manual labor? No. Education is not the most important thing in this life. The most important thing in this life is your life itself. You can still lead a good one without education.Look at people like Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates. Did they go to college? No. Yet they are still near universally looked up to as heroes of the uneducated world.2. Everybody needs a higher education.You basically just reiterated what you said earlier, ignoring my refutation. Not valid.3. A lot of people can't go to college because it isn't free.To begin with, I'd like to say that my opponent's statistics are heavily exaggerated. 71.3% of students do not drop out of college. I'd like to see his source for this.Secondly, people can still get quality higher education for a cheap price. Hundreds to thousands of community colleges exist across the country that are extremely cheap. Cost is in fact, not a large factor in getting higher education, as community colleges fall under the title of higher education and are readily available to the public.4. \"More people would be smarter. They would all have better jobs.\"Not everyone can be a CEO, or an executive at AIG, or a pharmaceutical rep, etc. Manual labor is what runs the country. If all people had access to education, then to an extent you'd need an even HIGHER level of education to get a good job. All of a sudden, higher education would become thouroughly unimpressive.Yes. More people would be smart if they had higher education. They're already available to you at a convenient price. Look for your local community college.5. Without education some people will be denied basic education.I already refuted this. Please see my arguments above. She only reiterated what she had already said.Now, since my disadvantages of Free Education were completely ignored, I will simply extend them by copying and pasting them.1. SpendingDo you honestly think, that as our government is struggling to finance by CouponDropDown\" href=\"#\">high schools and middle schools they will be able to perhaps buy up all private universities, create their own, and manage them? No. We're already in a huge deficit and we need to cut back on spending, especially on things not necessary, like this.or we could have a communist revolution. Jk.2. Crowds out the private market.For hundreds of year reputable by CouponDropDown\" href=\"#\">colleges and universities have given the highest education to those daring enough to walk their halls. If we were to implement a free form of higher education, people would stop going to these private colleges, who will without a doubt provide a higher quality of education than public colleges, and start going to a lesser college simply because its cheaper. This already happens in the private scale in terms of higher education, but making college free would make this issue skyrocket.Not only is this a violation against the individual, but is in fact a means of providing insufficient higher education to those who would generally go to somewhere like Yale or Stanford. To summarize this debate so far: My opponent has provided a few advantages of free education, all of which I have refuted. While she says that people are denied access to higher education because of cost, I defined higher education as a college or university. This means that community colleges are readily available to any enterprising young adult who wishes for a better future.She ignored all of my disadvantages. I refuted all of her advantages.Con is winning. I look forward to my opponent's next argument.",

But actually, my point is that the status quo is that college has become a prerequisite. I'm not saying that it should. Because it has become a prerequisite, the students should flexibly focus more on college education, like it or not. 2. About civic awareness- I think I need to explain what I meant by that. When people are educated, they come to reevaluate the injustices and etc. that are revolving around them. When citizens are better educated, they are less gullible, and less injustice would occur. 3. About higher efficiency- Actually, college does sometimes provide these on-the-job experiences when it is thought to be needed. A common example(at least in South Korea-I don't know about other places) is student teachers and trainee teachers. 4. About better technology- I believe that the more deeper and specific education the students get in college(you granted that) will be more help in making better technology and the wider view they get with wider education will make more creative and innovative ideas.

            "premise": "My case A college degree is only so valuable as the market decides it to be, and that is determined by the scarcity of the degree in the market. In applying for a job, the employer sees my resume, and sees that I went to college. This is valuable because it shows that I have taken the initiative to further my knowledge past the standard of education, which is currently high school, to go to college. However, what my opponent is advocating for is changing the standard of education to college education, instead of high school. When a college education is free to the student, future employers will expect their applicants to have a college education, rather than just a high school education, because really, what is the student\u2019s excuse at this point? This has a few impacts. One impact is that it drastically increases the amount of people going to college, thus increasing the costs for all taxpayers as tuition and student numbers go up, another is that it devalues the degree, thus making graduate school necessary for future high-earning employability, and finally, that it is making people who really shouldn't have to pay for someone's college education pay for it. College admittance overload When college is \"free\" to attend for the student, this means quite clearly that we are going to get a huge increase in the amount of people attending college. We\u2019re going to get teens, college dropouts, people who never attended, etc. all flooding the system, because now it is no longer a monetary investment for them to have the education that is publicly perceived as essential to being successful in life. One might say, \u201cWho cares? Now we have a more educated society.\u201d Well, the taxpayer, and hopefully the students, cares. It is predicted that, by 2018, 60% of job openings will require a college education (1). And that\u2019s just based on the status quo of how accessible a college education is. If one were to take into account the massive inflow of students that would come from taxpayer provided college education, we could expect that number to go significantly higher as college becomes the new standard of education, thus making a college degree approach pointlessness. Skyrocketing prices, decreased quality, or both? Now, my opponent would like you, the judge, to believe that government could somehow magically control cost without decreasing the quality of the education. But as I have shown above, the colleges are going to have significantly more students than they are going to be accustomed to, and the only way they would be able to adequately provide for them is if they were to increase costs. That being said, my opponent wants to plan controls into college spending levels. But if the college can\u2019t raise prices to be paid by the taxpayers, then the college won\u2019t be able to provide a high quality education to all of its students. But if my opponent revokes the cost control portion of his plan, then we are going to have skyrocketing prices to be paid by taxpayers that will be there for a skyrocketing amount of students. Essentially, with taxpayer-funded college, you\u2019re going to have an ever-increasing tax burden to be paid for by everyone as more people go to college. If price controls don\u2019t exist, then that price is going to be increased many-fold and will be increasing at a rate faster than ever before. If price controls do exist, then the taxpayers will be paying for an education that will be sub-par. What my opponent is proposing is a lose-lose system. Why should a person be forced to pay for someone else\u2019s kid to go to college? At the core of my opponent\u2019s plan, taxpayers would pay for college. However, it would seem ridiculous to force a parent to pay for another parent\u2019s child to go to college, or to force someone who doesn\u2019t even have kids to pay for that cost. This is also fundamentally unfair to parents who have already paid for their kid's college, and who now need to pay again, for, as I've shown, little to no clear benefit. So why should a person be forced to pay for someone else\u2019s kid? This is not a rhetorical question; I expect an answer from my opponent. If he can\u2019t adequately answer it, then he loses the debate. If he can, then he still needs to refute all of my other points, or I win. And now to take these points together What my opponent is proposing is a system where the taxpayer provides for college education to increase accessibility. However, what we see is that this would increase accessibility to the point where the college degree would be hugely devalued in the job market, thus making it so students would need to go to graduate school to get the high earning job formerly promised by a college degree (which repeats the problem of accessibility and price that my opponent is trying to solve for in the first place), which would make it take even longer for people to become productive members of our economy and would come at a huge cost to the taxpayer, which is everyone. Controls on how much colleges spend would inevitably decrease the quality of the post-secondary education (while still increasing price to taxpayers as people flood the system) and to not control the spending would mean an even higher rate of tax increases to the people of our country. And this would all be paid for by people who really shouldn\u2019t have to be paying for it. So now to refute my opponent\u2019s points. High costs can be negated by heightening corporate taxes These heightened corporate taxes would just be indirectly taxing the people. This is because, when a corporation expects to earn X dollars per year, and their taxes are increased, they just raise the prices of their goods and services so they still earn X dollars per year. The same people who are paying taxes are paying these costs, so heightening corporate taxes creates zero solvency. \u201cAs the wages of those who take advantage of this goes up, society as a whole also will make more money- Leading to everyone eventually benefiting.\u201d This is making a pretty big assumption that wages would go up. Everybody has more of their income taken away trying to pay for college through taxes, and additionally, the college degree would be devalued, as I have shown above. The value of a college degree is relative to how scarce it is in the market, and when most people have college degrees, that value goes away. \u201cOver about a ten year period, the cost to invest will go down and the country will still continue to show improvements in wages and lower poverty rates.\u201d This is a huge claim, and my opponent has not provided any evidence to support this, logical or empirical. Until he has provided evidence, I ask that the judges not take this bare assertion into account. But even so, we have no reason to buy that point based on the fact that the college education would be devalued in the market. Conclusion So to conclude this round, the judges have no reason to vote for Pro. The positive impacts of his case are based on the assumption that a college education would increase the value of the students in the job market, which is simply false given the fact that the value of the degree would go away. So this means that he would be pointlessly and drastically increasing taxes for no clear or evidence supported benefit. In my case, I have shown that publicly provided college/post-secondary education would exacerbate the problems we have with education drastically, by increasing costs, decreasing quality, decreasing the education\u2019s value, and forcing the payment on people who shouldn\u2019t have to pay for someone else\u2019s kid. Thank you for reading, I urge a vote for my side. Sources: 1. http://www.reviewjournal.com...",

            "conclusion": "Public college education in the United States should be tuition-free.",
            "premise": "Glad to be here, I just finished reading your arguments and now I am ready to post mine. First off, the government does have an obligation to the taxpayer, but is not obligated to allow this type of free higher education. If the constitution intended for taxpayers to have tuition-free public universities, wouldn't we have just had tuition-free public universities. Why would they forget to put in a mandatory obligation if they intended it? Second of all, college is not meant to be a free right of being a citizen. It is suppose to be place of higher learning that not all people get into. You are suppose to be able to work hard during high school to meet the college's requirements, fill out an application, apply, and enter a place that is meant for people who are smarter and will be the people in society that will make sure that our civil and natural rights are carried out. Taxpayers pay for these universities so that the best can get an education and not just some person who is not interested in learning after high school. Then there is equality of opportunity. College is not part of the basics in ensuring equal opportunity. The idea is that you learn in grade school in high school and those who are willing to put that extra effort to get a higher education can get ahead. Besides, college does not guarantee success. Having a knowledge of majors that are more likely to guarantee success, working hard, and giving your best effort is what guarantees success. On your next point of attainability of college because of costs can be easily fixed. Colleges just need to trim out all of these useless classes that do not grant success at all such as Philosophy, Arts, and Music. College is meant to be a place to train the greatest minds in the country for the real world and help them succeed in their career goals, not just some place where typical losers can go, not have any responsibility, spend four years singing and dancing, and wind up with a bunch of debt that will leave them very poor and probably will not ever be able to be paid back. With the importance of education, like I have said before, college is not for everyone. Simply going to college does not guarantee success. Right now almost half of all graduates with a bachelors degree are in jobs that do not require the degrees they have obtained. Simply going to college will not make you a better person, you need to be able to set goals and achieve them. Success in getting a good job and working hard is what makes you a better person. Education is an important thing but look at it this way. Most of these people that do not vote, get pregnant when they are teens, and do drugs have chosen their lifestyle. Putting them in college does not help them in their life. These kind of people slacked off in high school and will probably slack off in college. I like to think of college like having a baby. Only a few qualified and intelligent people should really do it but everyone does because it is fun. On the economic impact, how does college guarantee success? If they get one of the useless degrees that I mentioned earlier, they will have as much success as someone who did not even go to college. Also college is not as important as you might think. Yes, it might help you in applying for a job if they see you went to some fancy college but they just want to see you have a degree in the field you are applying. Even then just look at all the millionaires who just never went to college or just did not finish. As long as you are determined, work as hard as you can, and stay focused on your goals you will reach success sooner or later. As for the student-loan bubble, that can easily be fixed. Too many people go to college, never finish or get a degree that will not help them in life, and wined up with a bunch of debt that they will never be able to pay back. This then makes the tuition go up even more as they need to balance out the money the college's are not getting back. Its people's stupidity that causes tuition costs to rise and will eventually lead to the student loan bubble popping. That is why I disagree with you and do not think that we should have tuition-free colleges.",

            "discussionTitle": "In the United States, the costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "conclusion": "In the United States, the costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "All right so we're looking at the benefit to the majority. I don't believe the resolution should pertain to EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the United States. The ENTIRE population should not be looked at here. The main focus should be on the people actually paying to go to college. How would you analyze the benefits that a random person across the country receives from students paying to go to college? We must look at the group paying to go to college and what benefits they receive and whether this outweighs the cost (I'll touch on this later). 1. College does not benefit the majority Basically 68% of high school graduates went to college. So this 68% would be the ones receiving any sort of benefits. The people that did not even attend college cannot be a factor. Of course they didn't receive any benefits. But they didn't have to pay anything either! So these people who weren't even in college cannot be used by either side of this debate, because the resolution simply does not pertain to them. Now, my opponent says 45& of the people do drop out after paying for college. So this 45% does not receive any benefits. But guess what! The other 55% receives benefits from college! (I'll touch on the benefits later after my rebuttals) 55>45, therefore the majority still receives benefits. \"The Labor Department\u2019s American Community Survey[2]tells us of another 22% of college graduates that are currently employed at a job that doesn't even require a degree. All of this points to the idea that all of the individual benefits that the Con is sure to point out aren't actually obtained by the majority of the U.S populace.\" Ok so 22% of college graduates are employed at a job that doesn't require a degree... Well I'm glad that the other 78% of college graduates found their degree useful and a benefit to them. 78>22, therefore the majority receives benefits. 2. College contributes towards the growing income gap in the U.S \"According to the Center for the Study of Democracy in 2007[4], from 1973 to 2005, wages of those in the 90th percentile \u2013 where most people have college or advanced degrees \u2013 rose by 30 percent or more, and among this top 10 percent, the growth was heavily concentrated in the top 1%, which includes venture capitalists, corporate attorneys, and CEOs.\" Hmmm... getting a college degree leads to making more money? A lot more money? Sounds like a good benefit to me. \"In contrast, at the 50th percentile and below, where many people have at most a high school diploma, real wages rose by only 5 to 10 percent. Although there isn't a causal relationship between the growing income gap and college education, these statistics still show an increasing gap between the payment of a blue collar worker and a white collar worker. This means that people who can\u2019t afford college, people who drop out or fail college, or even people who don\u2019t want to go to college are punished, and in most cases, the act that they\u2019re being punished for is completely out of their control.\" You're right - there isn't a casual relationship between the growing income gap and college education. People who have college degrees ARE making more than people without college degrees. But again, my opponent is looking at a lot of people who didn't have to pay anything for college, because they just didn't go. If you don't go to college, how on Earth would you receive the benefits of college? 3. College contributes to the destruction of the U.S health care system Ok so basically my opponent is saying that medical sutudents pay much more for their education and many of them are in debt. However, the number of medical students in the US is only about 67,000 (http://www.medicalnewstoday.com...). Compared to the 18.2 million students who enrolled in college in 2007(http://howtoedu.org...), that number seems pretty miniscule. So the extremely high costs does not affect the majority, and the majority is not left in a ton of debt. 18.2 million total>67,000 medical therefore majority is not affected. All of the other statistics my opponent is showing is basically trying to connect the bankruptcies and misfortunes of other people to the costs of college. Once again, I believe the group who is closely affiliated with the colleges and the costs and benefits of them, i.e. students, should be looked at here, not every single person in the US. Ok, the US has a very expensive healthcare. So what? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Number 1 Benefit for Going to College - \"College graduates, on average, make a whopping one million dollars more in lifetime earnings than those with a high school diploma.\" (http://www.eduguide.org...)Now isn't that worth the measly costs of college? College costs are on average $29,000 for private colleges and $12,000 for public colleges, every year (http://businessmajors.about.com...). But for paying that amount to go to college you earn 1 million more than you would have if you didn't go to college at all! Talk about a benefit!Of course there are many other benefits to college that can't be measured in numbers such as the whole experience. Meeting lifelong friends, awesome parties, living on campus, etc.Sure college can be pretty costly, but it more than makes up for it in the end. Vote Con!",

            "premise": "As you all know, college is an important milestone in life. Personally, I think that a college degree is worth pursuing regardless of an individual's career goals. First off, Candidates can explore new specialisation fields and experiment around to find their passion. This can actually help students to save money as well- If they are aware of their specialisations in a field of their choice, there is no need to take multiple courses in university. Instead, they can just directly choose to study in their field of choice. Which leads us to the next point. It serves an advantage. When students go to college, they may be unsure of what field to specialise in. however, as students grow older, they may develop sudden interests in medicine, law, economics and etc. When they finally decide what do they want to specialise in, they have a college degree to help them get into schools of their choice. Thirdly, college gives second chances. for those students who didn't do very well in high school, college is a perfect opportunity to earn back the grades they think they deserve. For all education levels above college, they tend to weigh your college degree higher than your high school degree. My fourth point is that college helps us build a strong foundation for future studies. It gives you the basic knowledge you will need for future studies. Students can gain advanced knowledge in the fields that they are interested in and can have a general understanding of the other subjects. It also helps students to exercise their critical thinking skills and make sensible choices as well as help them to express themselves through writing and speech. Another point I would like to use to oppose to the opinion that college is redundant for further studies is that it helps students increase their chance of admission into schools of their choice. Imagine that you are checking 2 resumes from 2 applicants. They both have the same amount of experience, but one applicant gained a higher college degree that the other. Which one would you choose as a new intake? I believe that all of us will choose the student with the higher education background. However, in real life, students are compared with thousands os applicants, so they must have some academic achievements that make them appeal to the university that they are applying for so that they will choose the student as their intake. Last but not least, college prepares students for university life. Students learn to deal with the hardships in life in college. It makes the student strong and practical enough to deal with the hardships that they are going to face in the future. Students learn to adapt to new situations and new environments in college just as they would do in graduate school or university. Overall, I would like to conclude that college is in fact not redundant for further studies but it plays an important role in a student's education. Thank you.",

            "discussionTitle": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "conclusion": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "premise": "I'm typing this on my phone so sorry in advance for any typos/terrible sources. Thus debate has been quite problematic as... 1) whilst the premise 'higher education is outdated for the millennial generration' is clear enough, I wasn't clear on what my argument would be on - that higher education is outdated and needs serious reform whilst being maintained. 2) con accepted the debate believing that higher education was indeed, outdated for the millennial generation, and accepted anyway believing that he would argue for 'pro education' (if my interpretation is correct) 3) this confusion was found out after my first argument as shown in the comments. Hence I suggested and we agreed to compromise so that my argument would be 'higher education is outdated, and therefore not worth it to everyone'. Sadly I later found myself arguing for a position I did not personally believe in, but I will maintain this position for the sake of this debate. CON RE: millennials care more about contributing to society, and college education opens up more doors to help society that High school cannot. (E.g. Nursing, doctors) 1- Yes, nursing and doctoring can definitely improve our quality of life - yet does this really create a big social impact? According to 80000.org (1), each doctor saves about 90 lives in their lifetime. Medicine has extended everyone's quality of life for 7 years. Yet, 1) the amount of good medicine has done is overestimated 2) increase in age is not mutually exclusive to increase in disabled life - hence a full quality life is not completely true. 3) doctors cannot take sole credit for medicine. (Researchers, managers, scientists, nurses) In the end, we can save 6 times the amount of lives a doctor saves by simply donating 10% of our income wisely to a worthy foundation. 2- You don't need to go to university without creating a big social impact (the idea that these are mutually exclusive is false) examples : Stephen Spielberg, Mark zuckerverg, Bill Gates 3-Medicine is not the only way you can solve world problems it is sometimes not even the best way. What about electricity? Or education? Or government? CON RE: if college is not worth it, why are more millennials going to college than any other generation? They must be going for a meaningful degree that can help society. Millennials are going to college more than any other generation because they have the most opportunity to go, because they are pushed (45%) by their parents to go, perhaps because they believe it can lead them where they want to be also. However millennials are also expected to only be able to repay their debts in the next 11 years, 37% students regret going to college, and 49% graduates believe that they would have ended up where they are today without a college degree. (2) RE: there exists alternative pathways to college education - Con argues some fields do not have alternatives, and alternatives are not needed if college education becomes tax funded. 1- yes some fields do not have alternatives, but it is increasingly clear today that college is not necessary for everyone and not worth it for everyone. Commerce, arts and in some cases even in science. Con uses the doctor argument again, yet it is revealed above that medicine is not as influential on the quality of life than investing and utilising your money to elsewhere for society, which millennials care more about. Additionally one field of practise is not enough to validate the value of higher education for the entire pool of millennials as a whole. Only 0.27% of the population are doctors, for example. (2) 2-Con suggests that tax payer money be used to fully fund college education. Whilst that is the case for Germany today, and even Australia in the past, I personally don't believe this is possible in America. It is a strong liberal democracy that values it's small government. It also strongly advocates for the freedom of the people from 'corrupt officials' etc. To believe a call for such a huge reform with such major repercussions on the people to become successful would be too idealistic. One would have to convince the president-trump, Congress (which I imaging would be near impossible) and the judiciary to even consider this. Not to mention the inequality that exists in the US today already - to ask for more tax paying money would be difficult. RE: Skill can be better used as a qualifier for job performance - Con argues you often develop your skills from college and not every employee will give you an examination, and hence college is necessary to indicate your skills. Yes many develop skills from college but this is only because it forces people to keep working. Your own resolution to succeed is what is important. Hence, you do not need a college degree to develop your skills. No, usually a career in these fields do not require an examination, but rather an example of their work (e.g. A photograph, a piece of writing, a translation, a conversation in French etc.) which I believe speaks louder than certifications of a degree. RE: statistic argument Sorry as you didn't exemplify that you averaged the two statistics I only guessed that you compared each statistic with the general statistic of 23.5%. Yes I admit my calculation was wrong but I didn't really trust that addition of the two percentages anyway and it was used more of an example as to why comparing 2 independent means together is unreliable. As to why your calculation is unreliable - I don't have my computer here but it seems to be that you don't know the sample size of any of the statistics that you used (undergraduates with anxiety or depression, postgraduates with anxiety or depression, adults with anxiety, adults with depression) and hence am unable to make a reliable statistical comparison between any of the figures. You don't know if these population sample figures are normally distributed either, or independent from each other. Hence you cannot come up with a reasonable T statistic to accept or reject the null hypothesis which is - are the means of postgraduates with anxiety or depression the same with the means of adults with anxiety or depression? (Or likewise with undergraduates) not to mention that adults with anxiety or depression have two different sample sizes being from different sources. I have also taken statistics as a unit this year (3) Also, Thanks for this debate con! I enjoyed it despite our confusions haha. I have developed a lot more insight about millennials, about the past, and about college and higher education in general. 1) https://80000hours.org... 2)http://www.forbes.com... 3) https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu...",

I'm going to point out that he failed to create a clear resolution other than \"free education\". While I was going to argue that we already have that, it seems based on his argument text he believes that \"higher education\" should be free. I'm going to refute his points now.So, since he has failed to create definitions, I will make some of my own.Free Education: Attending a place of higher education, for example colleges and universities, for free.Basic Education: An understanding of basic mathematices (ie. multiplication, addition, etc), some history and science. 1. Everybody needs a higher education.Well, this is a bit of an assumption. While it would be beneficial to everyone if they had an education, there is no clear NECESSITY to have one. If someone, I'll name him Bob, finds a job at a construction site, he's not going to need to have an understanding of astro physics and quantum theory. What he will need, is a pair of strong arms that he can't get through school.His only other point was the need for basic education.2. Without free education some people will be denied basic education.Everyday, across this country, children wake up to go to our perhaps most effective means of government spending. The Public Schools. Here, kids learn what I've defined as basic education. They learn US History, they learn the history of Mesopatamia and Russia, they learn how to divide numbers, they learn that Velocity = distance/time. Higher education is not required to give people a basic education. In fact, higher education is defined as being above basic education.Now onto the Disadvantages of Free Education1. SpendingDo you honestly think, that as our government is struggling to finance high schools and middle schools they will be able to perhaps buy up all private universities, create their own, and manage them? No. We're already in a huge deficit and we need to cut back on spending, especially on things not necessary, like this.or we could have a communist revolution. Jk.2. Crowds out the private market.For hundreds of year reputable colleges and universities have given the highest education to those daring enough to walk their halls. If we were to implement a free form of higher education, people would stop going to these private colleges, who will without a doubt provide a higher quality of education than public colleges, and start going to a lesser college simply because its cheaper. This already happens in the private scale in terms of higher education, but making college free would make this issue skyrocket.Not only is this a violation against the individual, but is in fact a means of providing insufficient higher education to those who would generally go to somewhere like Yale or Stanford.I wait for my opponent's responses and expect a positive debate.",

            "conclusion": "The costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting.BenefitsAs the majority of this debate will come down to weighing costs versus benefits, we first must know the benefits of a college education. \"Properly using the present value of the lifetime earnings, adjusted for the cost of going to college and the difference in the number of working years, and excluding those graduates with advanced degrees, calculated and the three percent discount rate used in the report produces a lifetime earnings differential of only $279,893 for a bachelors degree versus a high school degree.\" (http://www.insidehighered.com...) (his actual report can be downloaded here: http://chronicle.com...)Monetary Costs\"This year, according to the College Board, average published in-state tuition and fee plus room/board charges exceed $17,000 at four-year public institutions.\" (http://www.cnn.com...) At four year private institutions, this number is roughly $11,500 annually. (in the Charles Miller report). Students are forced finance these costs with large loans, resulting in a student loan debt of tens of thousands of dollars by graduation. \"Two-thirds of bachelor\u2019s degree recipients graduated with debt in 2008, compared with less than half in 1993. Last year, graduates who took out loans left college with an average of $24,000 in debt.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...) The effect of this debt goes far beyond decreasing the lifetime earnings of a college graduate. Collegeboard now reports that the average age by which student loan debt is paid back stands at 33. (http://www.soundmindinvesting.com...). This greatly limits what can be done by graduates within the first 11 years of their working life. \"College graduates and postgraduates, instead of buying cars, buying houses, getting married, having children\u2014in other words, becoming full-fledged consumers are, as Nance-Nash puts it, \u201crunning back home.\u201d That hurts us all.\" (http://chronicle.com...) Opportunity CostTo show that opportunity cost outweighs the monetary benefits of a college education, one must show that there is a better way to spend the money which can not be achieved by going to college. This can be done fairly easily with investing potential. Using the average savings rates, cost of college tuition, student loan interest rates, and investment returns, an individual who invests their college fund instead of spending it will earn $1.3 million by the age of 65. A typical four year college graduate \"will have less than a third of that.\" (http://www.nypost.com...) There are other, similar methods of investment, all of which will result in more money than a college education.Another form of opportunity cost is the 4-6 years of lost job experience while attending college. With more and more job opportunities opening for those without college degrees, the 4-6 years of additional training and chances for promotion may very well outweigh the $279,893 monetary benefit of college. This job experience can also be gained while investing in the previous scenario. Shrinking Benefits of a College EducationRecent graduates, which excludes graduates over the age of 25 who where able to find a job before the economic downturn, now have roughly the same unemployment rate as non-degree holders. \"Over the past year, for example, the unemployment rate for college grads under age 25 has averaged 9.2 percent, up from 8.8 percent a year earlier and 5.8 percent in the first year of the recession that began in December 2007. That means recent grads have about the same level of unemployment as the general population. It also suggests that many employed recent grads may be doing work that doesn\u2019t require a college degree.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...) The majority of college graduates that do find a job are often underemployed, working as waiters food-service helpers. \"More than half of America's recent college graduates are either unemployed or working in a job that doesn't require a bachelor's degree, the Associated Press reported this weekend... According to the Census, the number of Americans under the age of 25 with at least a bachelor's degree has grown 38 percent since 2000. Not nearly enough jobs have been created to accommodate them, which has resulted in falling wages for young college graduates in the past decade, as well as the employment problems we're now seeing.\" (http://www.theatlantic.com...) With food preparation and service receiving the largest job growth between 2000 and 2010, the job opportunities for non-degree holders are only increasing. In fact, \"among the top 10 with respect to actual job growth, 3 will require a postsecondary degree and only 1 will require a BA.\" (http://www.educationalpolicy.org...) The Risks of Attending CollegeThe risk one takes while attaining their college degree is the most important cost to be considered in this debate. These two risks, defaulting on student loan debt and dropping out, go hand in hand.In the United States, only 46% of all students who started college managed to complete it. \"The \"Pathways to Prosperity\" study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2011 shows that just 56 percent of college students complete four-year degrees within six years.\" (http://www.reuters.com...) College dropouts are forced to pay back their debt, but without the benefits of receiving a college degree. Dropouts gain a very minimal increase in wages, and spend years of their lives with nothing to show for it except debt.Default rates are also abysmally high. 19.2% of \"borrowers who graduated with a certificate from a for-profit, less-than-four-year institution\" defaulted on their student loans. (http://www.educationsector.org...) \"A recent study by the Institute for Higher Education Policy found that for every borrower who defaults, at least two more fall behind in payments. The study found that only 37 percent of borrowers who started repaying their student loans in 2005 were able to pay them back fully and on time.\" (http://www.nytimes.com...) Student debt overall has now reached over $1 trillion, more than credit card debt. (http://www.theatlantic.com...) With student loans unable to be forgiven through bankruptcy, and with defaulting resulting in tax refunds being offset and wages being garnished, a college education is a high-risk, low-benefit investment.",

            "premise": "The idea of a free college education sounds great and would be great if it worked. The biggest problem to this theory is the term \"free\". It may be free to the students, but it is not free for everyone. Someone has to pay the colleges for their expenses. Teachers are not going to work for free and someone has to pay the building costs and maintenance. As we are seeing with \"free health care\", someone has to split the bill. Maybe some cities or even states can afford to take on this roll in the short run, but the long term costs are going to eventually make this nearly impossible. My first main question to my opponent is: where is this money going to come from? My second argument is that there are programs already available to help with the costs of college. Yes, some of these are loans, which are costly and time many years to pay off, but there are millions of dollars of grant money and scholarships wated each year because people do not apply for them. I am hearing high school councilors say all of the time that there are hundreds of thousands of scholarship money available to any high school senior. The problem is that either they do not know about it or do not go through the process of trying to earn it. I know of one scholarship at our school last year that was worth $2,000 dollars. The person that earned it received it because he was the only one to apply. There are numerous academic scholarships, extracurricular scholarships, and work programs that help with the cost. I am a college graduate who was able to earn my degree with student loans and grants. Yes, I have to pay those loans back, but there are even programs to help with the repayment of loans. Most loan institutions offer a repayment plan based off of your income. This greatly reduces the monthly payment. Many loan companies have loan forgiveness after paying on the loan for a certain number of years. Some places of employment even pay a portion or all of a student loan. Our very own President came from a poor family in Hawaii. Yet he ended up with an Ivy League education, a United States Senator, and eventually President of the United States. Therefore, it CAN be done.",

            "premise": "Student loans are a problem is society. They leave people in debt and it is almost impossible to afford college without loans and not be struggling to pay it off. Student loan rates have only been increasing and putting more people into debt. Take this fact for example from ProCon.org: \"Student loan debt often forces college graduates to live with their parents and delay marriage, financial independence, and other adult milestones. According to a 2012 Federal Reserve Study, 30-year-olds who have never taken out a student loan are now more likely to own homes than those who have taken out loans. Auto loans are also trending down at faster rates for those with student debt history than for those without. [35] In 2013, student loan borrowers delayed retirement saving (41%), car purchases (40%), home purchases (29%), and marriage (15%). [38] Less than 50% of women and 30% of men had passed the \"transition to adulthood\" milestones by age 30 (finishing school, moving out of their parents' homes, being financially independent, marrying, and having children); in 1960, 77% of women and 65% of men had completed these milestones by age 30. [39\" Student loans hold people back. And free college is possible. It is very likely in the near future we can have free college. \"The Atlantic.com published an article in Jan 2014 that claimed the federal government would only have to spend \"a mere $62.6 billion dollars\" to make tuition at public colleges free for undergraduates in 2012.\" Sources used: http://college-education.procon.org... http://www.collegerank.net...",

            "conclusion": "The costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for the quick response.My refutations:Monetary BenefitsMy opponent comes up with a number similar to that cited by collegeboard, of roughly 1 million more dollars being earned by those holding bachelors degrees, as opposed to those holding high school diplomas. However, my opponent's calculations fail to take a variety of other factors into account. The letter from Charles Miller, cited in my \"Benefits\" section, shows one of the issues: \"The report assumes a student will finish college in four years. Actually, the typical time to graduation is closer to six years in higher education today. The addition of two extra years of college costs and two less years of earnings makes a significant difference.\" My opponent also fails to take into account the fact that tuition is financed by student loans, which are difficult to pay off. As I already mentioned, the average college graduate will be unable to pay off their debt until age 33. Given my opponent's estimates, this age should be 23.5 years, or after 1 and a half years of earnings. My opponent's number for the yearly cost of college also should not be considered, as he only included the price of public institutions. According to the fact sheet that he cites, the yearly cost of all four year institutions is $20,986. The income data which is cited by my opponent is also from the 2000 census, which is far too outdated. To repeat the quote used in my \"benefits\" section: \"Properly using the present value of the lifetime earnings, adjusted for the cost of going to college and the difference in the number of working years... calculated and the three percent discount rate used in the report produces a lifetime earnings differential of only $279,893 for a bachelors degree versus a high school degree.\"At the end of this round, I will be showing another major issue with my opponent's case in general which works to farther refute this monetary point.Social BenefitsThe majority of societal benefits cited by my opponent are not gained solely through a college education. An individual must learn to live on their own even if they don't go to college. Other benefits which my opponent brings up, mostly social skills, aren't as beneficial as one might think. Students already go through 12 years of school to gain social skills. The additional four years, while it may be beneficial, are by no means required. Rather, students should be putting their social skills to the test in the real world. Simply put, real world experiences outweigh college experiences. My opponent also briefly mentions \"job connections.\" In this case, the 4-6 years of employment and job experience gives far better job connections than the college experience. The overall impact of this point is very small, and can be easily countered by weighing it against the arguments I brought up. Opportunities My opponent is attempting to decrease the impact of my risk point. \"Fear of failing\" is not an adequate phrase. The fear is of 54% chance to drop out, and to not gain any of the benefits from a college degree. The high default risk, almost 20%, is far too large of a risk for the average student to take. I'd also like to state that student loan debt cannot be forgiven through bankruptcy. Defaulting on such debt is virtually a guarantee to have your wages garnished, to suffer an incredibly large drop in your credit, to have tax returns offset, and to be ineligible for future federal employment. My opponent also asks if \"the value of a college education is dropping - then how worthless is not even having one to begin with then?\" The reason why the value of a college education is dropping, largely in respect to employment opportunities, is because more and more individuals are graduating college, while job growth simply cannot keep up. This does not decrease the value of not going to college. My opponent then brings up job sector growth. There is a large issue with the statistic my opponent brings up: It is focused on percentage increases. Meaning an industry which goes from 100,000 to 200,000 jobs would be said to have higher growth than an industry which goes from 5 million to 9 million. The study which I cited in round one focuses on the actual number of jobs created. Among the top 10 growing jobs, only one requires a bachelors degree, and among the top 20, only 4 do. Problem With Pro-College StudiesThis section is aimed at employment and income prospects. Any study which brings up the benefits of a college education must show that these benefits can be obtained by recent graduates. For this reason, the quote \"individuals with only a high school diploma were twice as likely to be unemployed as those holding bachelor\u2019s degrees\" cannot be considered because it includes individuals who graduated college 20-30 years ago, when the benefits of a college education were much larger. College graduates were hit especially hard by the recession: the previous unemployment rate of 5.8% has nearly doubled to 9.2%. \"That means recent grads have about the same level of unemployment as the general population.\"The same goes for future earnings. Studies cannot include individuals who have already held a college degree for 20+ years, and already achieved a large income. This is due to the fact that the rising costs prevent current graduates from reaching such future earnings. Effectively, recent graduates are no longer able to obtain the employment and income benefits that past graduates have. Therefore, studies which show the benefits achieved by past graduates do not show that recent college graduates will obtain such benefits.Causation Versus CorrelationWhile this may be a generic argument, it is important to consider in this round. What's important to note is that college's tend to enroll students who are already geared toward success. Students who graduate with high gpas will, more often than not, continue in to college. However, as high school gpa is also correlated to future earnings, this skews statistics which report on the earnings of college graduates. This rebuttal can be summed up as follows: Any student which meets the requirements to go to college will, on average, earn more than the average high-school diploma holder, regardless of whether or not they attend college.This does not completely negate con's future earnings statistics. It is true that college graduates will have higher incomes. However, one must always keep in mind that, due to what I described above, the numbers will always be a couple thousand dollars lower than what is cited.The Overall Chance of Any BenefitsThis relates to my rebuttal against \"opportunities,\" yet is large enough to deserve its own section. The overall chance of achieving these benefits is very low. The 54% drop out rate means that one is more likely to not receive any of these benefits, and instead be faced with massive student loan debt. The 20% default rate means that even if one does manage to beat the odds and graduate they will not receive any of the benefits. Instead, they will receive massive wage garnishments and federal benefits being offset. Even if one can somehow manage to graduate and not default on their student loan debt, they will more likely than not be put into a job that doesn't even require a college degree. Thus, even if my opponent manages to prove that the monetary benefits of college outweigh the monetary costs, voters must keep in mind that its extremely unlikely any college graduate will actually achieve these benefits.ConclusionCollege graduates only earn $279,000 more over the course of their lifetime, not $890,000.A college graduate is unlikely to actually obtain such lifetime earnings.There are very few social benefits of going to college.The large risks taken to obtain a college degree vastly outweigh the potential benefits.College graduates do not have a lower unemployment rate.Job potential for high school graduates is increasing.",

Sure there's public education. You still have to pay taxes for that. Virtually, colleges cannot be free. This leads to my third point. 3)There's this thing called community college. It's cheap and inexpensive. Most people that go there either need to save money or just extend their studies before they transfer to a better college. 4)Scholarships help a lot with loans. Most students can get a scholarship. Not the big flashy \"Bill Gate Scholarship\", but a small one that pays for a part of your tuition. All in all, the way colleges run is that they provide education in return for money. Also, public colleges are funded by the state. Private colleges aren't. This is why they are usually more expensive and in return you get better education. And that's pretty much it for my side of the debate.",

For a high school student it is very unlikely to get a job that pays them at the most $15 an hour, even if the manage to get a job that pays that well, it has to be a really odd job ( speaking from experience). Now for college students there are loans you can take, financial aid and not to mentions the scholarships. Any of the above can pay for your tuition.

            "conclusion": "State Colleges should be free for the students that live in that state",
            "premise": "Okay, let's take this by the numbers. 1) You are correct, college is a privilege. A privilege that only the upper middle class and the wealthy can afford. Four years of college can easily top $140,000 (that's $35,000 / year for four years). An average family has two children. So if both will attend similar colleges, that cost will double to $280,000. Where does the average upper middle class family making $75,000 (that's gross salary not take home pay which is 30% less) get this kind of money? You can buy another house for this amount. So, unless you have outstanding grades, meet the government's definition to be eligible for grants or are wealthy, college is not easily obtainable for most Americans. The average graduating high school student who wants to attend a college to further their education may not have the financial means to do so. Oh, financial aid you say? Have you seen what is offered these days? These are no more than loans at higher rates than you pay for purchasing a car. Sure, let's take out $280,000 worth of loans at 6% - 9% interest. If each student in my example graduated and was fortunate enough to get a job making $45,000 per year, it would take each graduate just under five years to pay back the loan. And this is not realistic because I did not take the interest rate into account nor did I allow them to spend any of their earnings at all. They both remained in their parent's home for five years taking all of their earnings and paying off the monster loans incurred from their college education. There are countless potential college students who don't get the opportunity to go and get this higher education because of the outrageous costs. The government provides oil companies with billions of dollars to explore for oil, why can't we shift that money towards college tuition? 2) Financial burdens to taxpayers. Yes, we are taxed too much. There are very few people who would disagree. But much of our tax burden goes to fund unemployment, welfare and other programs to assist the unemployed. One reason for unemployment is because most of the businesses are looking for employees with specific skills and talents, most of which can only be obtained through an college education. So in my opinion, it is in the taxpayers best interest to get as many young adults, and older ones for that matter, into college to gain this knowledge. 3) Students don't always graduate is no reason not to try and change how a college education is funded. There are not guarantees in life especially in business. When you get a job, you are not guaranteed to keep it or be as successful as you would like. College is the same. When you start, you don't always stay with your first chosen line of study. Likewise, you may not have what it takes to get through a college curriculum. So allow students to try and fail. Colleges also offer vocational courses for plumbing, welding, electrical, etc. This is a perfect alternative for those people who are better working with their hands than sitting behind a computer screen. Government funding of colleges allows students to gain knowledge and skills they would not have been able to afford otherwise. So maybe paying back the cost is not a good idea, but not being able to afford to get an education at all or putting your financial future in question because of excessive tuition costs are equally as bad. The specifics need to be worked out. Although I don't have the specifics on how to get this funding from the Federal and/or State governments, it still makes the most sense to me to have the American society assist in making higher education affordable and available to everyone. Education should not be for the \"privileged\" few who can afford it, but to the masses who need it.",

            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for continuing this debate so effectively. Con is essentially non-responsive to my points. He states that there are other roads one could take, and then disregards the analysis I've provided in support of them. I don't see any response to vocational schools and apprenticeships specifically, so extend my analyses there. Also extend my points regarding why college is not for everyone. Con then proceeds to outline the very reasons for my concern. The situation is South Korea is, in my opinion, net harmful. College shouldn't be a \"prerequisite for entering into society,\" partly because it completely excludes those who cannot succeed in a college setting. One type of education should not be preferred over another, and Con has provided only limited reasons why college is specifically important, and none for why it is more beneficial than anything I've offered up. Con then proceeds to explain the benefits of such a system. He says that there would be more economic benefits. His warrants are here lacking. I don't see any actual link made between higher education and increased benefits to individuals or society, mainly just assertions that the link exists. Let's go through those assertions. 1) Higher education = deeper education Not necessarily true, but I'll grant this. 2) More civic awareness No reason for this given - Con assumes what is taught to everyone in college. 3) Higher efficiency Again, not supported. I'd argue the reverse - the lack of on-the-job experience makes them very inefficient. 4) Increased profit for company No reason to believe that someone coming from the insular academic environment will lead to increased profits. 5) Better inventions and technology Perhaps, but neither of these things require a college background to accomplish. 6) Better firms Not likely, given that college graduates aren't normally that capable of starting their own businesses since they don't have experience in this regard.

            "conclusion": "Free tuition for college students through government taxation should be supported.",
            "premise": "While my opponent wastes valuable time disputing that the cost of college is one of the most expensive things people will ever \"buy,\" I'd just like to point out that of the people that have a college education, that education cost vastly more money than any other thing they will ever buy. This is to say that the average person will spend more on college than they will on their cars, watches, prostitutes, etc... unless somehow the average person shells out $100,000 for their watch and car. While the restrictions I speak of do not necessarily follow the resolution to the letter, I'd also like to point out that we've been given a terrible resolution for implementation in the United States and to implement it here would mean the introduction of compromises and restrictions, and indeed, many social programs in foreign countries are contingent upon certain conditions - the government in the UK won't pay for a student with a High School GPA of 1.8 to go to college. It's simply a waste of money. In these restrictions, I mentioned the lack of need to give tax money to millionaires. If they're not receiving the benefit of the tax, why should they pay it? Everyone pays social security tax, yet many people don't use it. We all pay taxes used to provide welfare, yet most of us don't use it. Therefore, it would follow that there is no change in the system to tax people for social programs they won't use. Everyone would pay the tax, and the usage of the program would depend on income level. I also mentioned that outrageously priced institutions should not benefit from this resolution. This of course makes perfect sense in the current system. Food stamps do not pay for persons to buy fillet mingion every night. As with that program, this resolution should provide a basis for education. The education from a state school such as Purdue University or Iowa State is perfectly acceptable - in fact, some of these schools are much better than more expensive private institutions (Purdue in engineering, Iowa in political science). >> \"If free tuition through taxation were to be a reality, then all college students should be able to benefit equally.\" Why? Not all college students ARE equal. This is quite clear in the fact that colleges turn down students based on academic performance or provide financial aid to those students who otherwise would not be able to pay for college. Why should the 4.0 student recieve the same benefit as the 0.8 student? That's ludicrous. Why should the millionaire get the same ammount as the student who is also using food stamps. That's ludicrous as well. >>\"Unfortunately, per the restrictions assumed by JCMTarzan, the Dept. of Education calls you up and tells you that you cannot attend because it is too expensive. The program didn't really work in your case, did it? A highly specific example, but it makes the point.\" It makes the point that this program can easily be adapted to suit individual needs, not that the program is fallacious. Obviously, if the student is of a high enough caliber to be accepted to MIT, then there's no reason the government can't put them in a higher strata of assistence. This is done with hundreds of government programs - why not this one? >>\"There is no guarantee that such a huge investment, which could only happen by way of taxes increasing, as my opponent admits, would prove to be worthwhile.\" It is a fact that persons with a college education make more money (on average) than those that do not. When people make more money, they pay more taxes. It's pretty clear that there is a relation between education and tax income for the country. >>\"\"There is a definite correlation between the investment in education and the literacy rates and success of a country.\" -What might this correlation be?\" It would seem self evident that when a (successful) investment is made in education that literacy and competency rates in a country would rise. Foreign governments outspend the US on education, an the US finished LAST in the most recent international physics olympiad. >>\"Whatever happened to self-made men (or women), self-reliance, and self-responsibility? The primary problem with socialism is that once you are getting the \"free ride,\" as it were, that many, many people do not want to get off. Shall the government in turn provide graduates of their free-tuition system with jobs if they are unable to find one themselves? Why not: they got them into college in the first place.\" I'm not entirely sure what the self-made man and self-relienace has to do with this as a whole. Those are American philosophies, and you admitted in the previous sentence that this resolution did not deal with the United States exclusively. Therefore, introducing American philosophy is fallacious and irrelevant to the argument writ large. >>\"I agree that the applicant pool will be larger; of higher calibre I am not so certain: the more applicants there are, the lower their average calibre would be. That's a simple law of statistics. More students, larger classes, etc, less quality of services rendered (education).\" I will admit you have a point with the higher caliber issue - I must admit I misspoke. The pool itself will not be higher caliber, but the accepted pool will be. Institutions will take the best they can until they are full. The pool will increase, but there is no reason that schools will reduce the quality of their education - if they grow proportionally and maintain the ratios between students, classes, and professors, the quality will not change. >>\"Universities now have breeding programs in line with Social Darwinism? A shock, to say the least ;)\" Actually, that would be quite welcome... I merely meant the American workforce. >>\"-OBVIOUSLY not. If more people go to school, then more are educated. Of course, educated is not synonymous with intelligent, hard-working, or even contributory in any way to the overall well-being of society.\" I see - therefore, according to you, the Chinese, Brits, Spainards, Poles, etc... must all be more intelligent than Americans. It has nothing at all to do with their education system and the fact that their college students are of higher caliber on average. >>\"Someone somewhere is getting the raw end of the deal - paying the taxes but not having children, paying the taxes while having children but not seeing them benefit because of good economic status, etc. Other societies do as they like, sure, but in providing \"free\" tuition do they not devalue the education that is sought? Whatever is worth having is worth earning, worth working for, sacrificing for; do we not appreciate what we have worked hard for more than what is simply \"given\" to us (while at the same time being taken from others)?\" The very nature of politics is that there are ALWAYS going to be winners and losers. Are not the losers in the current system those who cannot afford to go to college at all? Why should they be denied a college education in the same country where a high school education is free? Other societies DO do as they like, and their results seem to be eclipsing the United States. Is their education devalued? I'd say not. Our Chinese foreign exchange students at my college spend about 3 or 4 times as long studying for classes as American students because they view their education as so important. >>\"Reread \"The Republic,\"\" Indeed, please do. Education in The Republic is the responsibility of the state. >>\"and side CON\" Indeed please don't. The nexus of Con's argument is that it is \"unfair\" to people. All political processes are unfair to someone. This is not new news.",

This is not an argument, I will say he forfeit.Now my summaryCollege should not be free for these reasons.i. University education should require paymentCalifornia's board of Education claims they have increased their prior balance for education by $1474 million from 2013-14. Their revenue has also increased by around $4,000 million.[http://www.cde.ca.gov......]As of right now, they have about $109,391 million in resources (books, supplies, etc.). California's student loan debt is around...$20,000. Since their revenue is $105,488 million this includes student loans being paid off. Imagine no more student loans. Around...60%-70% students go to college in California. Now, let's do the math. We can estimate in the future this will cost Universities in California about...$1,149 per person that attends college. Take this into account with the percentage of people that will go to college and the colleges will lose a lot of money. About a few million. Eventually, the colleges and universities will have to close, and then no more free university education. The population will not receive sufficient education due to this. While the idea of the free university education is to let the lower class go to college, it will eventually back fire to the point where not even the upper class will be able to go to college.[http://quickfacts.census.gov......]ii. The taxesAs mentioned often through this argument, the taxes.To pay for EVERY college in the USA for every one's education is costly. Not to mention the supplies, services, and possible transportation for each college. This will have a backwards effect on the economy than what is expected. Instead of people getting jobs, they'll start losing houses. A simple $15 per hour job can get pushed down to a $12 per hour job to pay for the education. As the population grows, this tax is supposed to increase to match the amount of people that need an education. Eventually expect $10 per hour jobs. Businesses will eventually close down, thus getting rid of HUNDREDS and THOUSANDS of jobs. Eventually, colleges will close because the government won't be able to fund them because no one will have a job to pay for the tax that funds them.",

            "premise": "As billionaire Warren Buffet stated, \"The greatest investment is yourself.\" Before stating my contentions, I'd like to define some terms within the resolution. A college education is the completion of a bachelor's, master's or PHD degree. Outweigh: to exceed in value, importance, or influence, (and) benefits: something that is advantageous or good in short and long term. Contention 1: - There are many alternatives to pay for college rather than paying out of pocket. As we all know, the United States is currently in a recession, attacking the middle class drastically. Many people who are not financially capable to pay for college can obtain certain resources like scholarships, grants and/or financial aid to help pay for expenses. The people who receive these financial aids come from struggling middle class families. According to CollegeBoard.com, a total of 35% of high school students earned academic scholarships and 11% earn athletic scholarships in 2011. Also, 20% of students going to ivy league schools obtained the pell grant. As you can see, there are many alternatives to help paying for college without giving the students too much debt. Why should financial burdens prevent a qualified student from going to a college of his or her dreams? Contention 2- People that go to college have a more fulfilling job. The definition of satisfaction is an act of fulfillment and gratification. One may be content with themselves no matter what occupation they do every day. However, when one obtains a degree in a specific field, they will gain more financial wealth and security, thus gaining the capital needed to pay for student loans and other expenses. According USA.gov, in 2010 alone, 68.1 percent of high school graduates attended college. Compared to the 32 percent that didn't attend college, those who did grossed an average of 29,000 dollars more a year. With that much money made more a year, a college graduate can afford a larger mortgage, or save their money towards his or her's children's college fund. The more someone invests in themselves, the more return they're going to get out. Contention 3-When students attend college, they help maintain the democratic system America has so perfectly designed. Imagine if your state senator or representative did not attend college? Imagine what decisions these politicians would make without having taken an ethics class? As Thomas Jefferson stated \"Information is the currency of democracy.\" If college is not worth going to as the affirmation attempts to advocate, then, my fellow americans, we are a country of poor democratic worth. Also, according to a statistic stated by CollegeBoard.com, 60% of college graduates play a role in our democratic system, either by attending city council meetings, volunteering for potential political candidates, or simply voting. As you can see, when students go to college, they participate substantially more than high school graduates.",

            "conclusion": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "premise": "RE: What one will earn with a college degree is almost double the amount of money that a high school graduate will earn. I don\u2019t doubt these statistics and agree that it is probably true one with a college degree earns more than the amount a high school graduate can earn. It is beneficial for society as a whole to earn a college degree rather than without. However, in the context of this debate it is important not only to ensure that millennials are not being exploited by college degrees, but that they are using them in alignment with their core values/ ambitions, for higher education to be worth it for them. Therefore, the fact that one can earn more than a high school graduate is only a good thing for millennials given that: P1: Millennials aim to utilise university to generate the most income The millennial generation can be characterised as being \u2018interested in daily work reflecting and part of larger societal concerns\u2019, helping communities, caring more on corporate social responsibility and the environment. Importantly, millennials place higher worth on experience rather than material things. (1) 87.5% millennials disagreed with the statement that \u2018money is the best measure of success\u2019, in contrast to 78% of the total population (2). Hence, if most the millennial generation are not pursuing high income earnings directly this point is not enough alone to argue the worth of a college degree for millennials. RE: College education easily indicates to employers of higher-skilled jobs that you are qualified. \u2018there is no way that employers validate that you have knowledge enough for the field they employ in.\u2019 P1: Yes, a college education is an indicator that you have reasonable knowledge to qualify for a job. But if this is considered a reason as to why you should go to college \u2013 so you can indicate to employers of higher skilled jobs that you are qualified (and not to learn and get more skills), this merely strengthens my case that education needs serious reform! As reinforced by A4: students go to university for the degree, and not the education. P2: Yes, a college education indicates to employers that you are qualified. Similarly, a college education also increases inequality by providing less opportunity for the poor, where they are kept from knowledge! and jobs! Due to their economic position. I know scholarships exist and all that but in an ideal society a poor kid with above average intelligence should not be prevented from entering college due to monetary issues when a rich kid with below average intelligence can graduate from one. Of all millennials that are not in college/have not earned a college degree, more than a third (36%) say that it is because they cannot afford it. (3) \u2018this (college debt) is not exactly a problem that needs to be solved by getting rid of college education or necessarily reforming it, but it could be solved by making colleges tuition free and paid for by taxes.\u2019 I agree with the latter, but disagree in the former as I believe the fact that con agrees this issue can be solved by making college tuition free reinforces my point that college education needs reform (I would say the total eradication of fees is considered serious reform) P3: There also exists a large array of alternative pathways apart from a college education today. You can take an exam to do actuary. If you are skilled and want to be a lawyer badly enough you don\u2019t even have to go to law school \u2013 you can pass 3 examinations and sit with a practising attorney for four years \u2013 you can save time and money by avoiding law school altogether. Abraham Lincoln himself says \u2018if you are absolutely determined to make a lawyer of yourself the thing is more than half done\u2026it is a small matter whether you read with any one or not; I did not read with anyone...Always bear in mind your own resolution to succeed is more important than anything\u2019 (4) P4: A degree is not the only indicator of being qualified \u2013 experience and skills are also good qualifiers. You do not need to major in journalism, history, french, photography etc. to qualify for work in these career fields. This is as skills can be used as a qualifier (which is arguably the better indicator for job performance). RE: College education helps you go into a career you really want I admire those who know what they want in a career and go after it. I agree that a college education may help you reach there \u2013 having a college education is perfectly fine here. Especially if you know you want to be a teacher, doctor, engineer etc. What I have a problem with is many young people do not know what they truly want. We are characterised as the \u2018indecisive generation\u2019 because we have so many more options than previous generations available to us. By 2010 nearly 60% of employed millennials had already switched their career at least once. Whilst the possibility exists that some people equated a \u2018career change\u2019 with a \u2018job change\u2019, it could also mean that millennials are considering alternatives and many options when it comes to finding a career pathway either due to personal preferences or societal pressures (rapidly transforming jobs etc. as elaborated in A1, P3). (3) Additionally, 50% of students in 2005 (including myself) who declared a major changed majors. 40% of students who enrolled in a 4 year college program will not have graduated by year 5 or even year 6. (5) This is alarming given that a college degree is very expensive, and should not be wasted on young people who do not know what they want due to the pressure to decide and fast track to a certain pathway with little to no experience with the working world or what a certain career path will be like. Hence, reform is necessary to allow students to experiment and experience practical work culture etc. instead of allowing vulnerable youth to pursue something they are not interested in/do not know much about under the pressure from their parents etc. RE: RE: University education today fosters a grade-oriented, disengaged, depressed culture that fails to prepare students for real life. \u2018In other words, anxiety and depression is lower among college students than the general population.\u2019 There is a simple observational error. My opponent has compared a statistic I used (anxiety or depression affection 13% U/G and 15.6% P/G) (6) that was recorded in 2005 with results that were measured in 2015 (6.7% of the general population affected by depression). Additionally, whilst the statistic used in regards to anxiety affecting the general population being 18.1% is verified, 1) This statistic excludes those who entered higher education (like me) below 18 years. (I spent half of my first university year being underage, it is not as uncommon as it may be in America) 2) There is a problem with the method of calculation. According to con\u2019s calculations, an accurate representation would be 18.1% of the general population in 2005 have an anxiety disorder + 5.4% of general population in 2005 with a depressive disorder(7)=23.5% affected. Therefore as 23.5% is greater than 13% and 15.6%, anxiety and depression is lower among college students than the general population. The problem is, if you combined both figures to calculate the total of those with anxiety or depression in higher education, 13% + 15.6% = 28.6% affected. This is higher than the average anxiety or depression disorders existent in the general population, and hence you can argue that anxiety or depression is higher among college students than the general population. This is an example of why this form of comparison is not very good. It is better to quote research involving direct comparison between college students and non-college students. Final Remarks I\u2019m sorry I could not add additional arguments to this debate. Although the bit about college education increasing inequality might be considered one, I\u2019ve mostly only included rebuttals this round due to time constraints as I\u2019m currently travelling. Thanks for your response con, I look forward to continuing this debate!

            "premise": "I thank Capitalistslave for accepting my challenge. I will now proceed with the debate by stating my arguments. Also happy new year and sorry abt the confusion earlier.Technology & globalisation has made knowledge taught at higher education increasingly redundant P1) Technology has created access and opportunity. It allows humans to communicate and collaborate with each other. Teachers are in many ways no longer the primary sources of information. It has become increasingly flexible to reach out to information and consume it, allowing us to be eager participants in lifelong learning. [1] [2] When we have the internet, college degrees are increasingly redundant as the content we learn can easily be learnt online.P2) University curriculums rarely change. [3] Colleges are too slow to reinvent themselves [6]. An example of this is accounting where graduates struggle in practical situations that are not visited in their classes. Technology has revolutionised accounting so much that much of the content that taught in accounting are also automated and do not need to be learnt. [4] Essentially it becomes clear that most students are attending university for the degree, and not education.P3) Jobs and knowledge are transforming too rapidly in today\u2019s world to validate the worth of a single/double rigid university major. We are constantly multitasking, we are time poor and we are predicted to have 7 career changes in our lifetime. [5] What is the point of studying for a job with a curriculum that was written decades ago when said job did not exist?University education is no longer worth itP1) Unlike previously thought, a four-year college degree has no guarantee for decent wage growth due to wage stagnation [6] Figure 5. Hence the argument that college is an investment as it helps you become a high-income earner is not true. Hourly wages for young college graduates were lower than they were in the 1990s [6] Figure 5. This further reinforces my point that higher education is not a worthy investment.P2) Higher education is a money consuming machine - in 2014 college tuition has effectively risen to 1125% of 1978 figures. Compared to the 279% increase of the consumer price index, this is massive. In an increasingly tougher labour market, to have a huge sum of tuition fees to repay is an additional burden. [7] The costs that are incurred in higher education are uncorrelated to market trends, making it difficult for students to support themselves after. University education today fosters a grade-oriented, disengaged, depressed culture that fails to prepare students for real life. P1) Evidence suggests that mental health issues are increasing amongst students in higher education. In 2005 alone, 10% of undergraduates seriously considered attempting suicide. In 2007, 13.8% of undergraduates and 15.6% of postgraduates were screen tested positive for depression. Students facing financial struggles because of university and those who spend more hours working face a higher risk of mental health problems. [8] University students are four times more likely to be depressed/anxious than others their age. [9]\u2018Most lifetime mental disorders have first onset during or shortly before the typical college age (Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005), and these problems may be precipitated or exacerbated by the variety of stressors in college life, including irregular sleep patterns, flux in personal relationships, and academic pressures.\u2019 [8] If long term mental disorders are mostly developed during or just before higher education \u2013 we must seriously consider the benefits to cost ratio of putting oneself in a high stress situation, and the costs may be permanent & long lasting.Students nowadays go to university for the degree (appearance), and not the education (depth).P1) There is a lack of intellectual curiosity and creativity in universities. An indifferent culture is a dangerous culture that has its youth disengaged and complacent. If this is the culture in uni today, there is not much reason to go.Now I\u2019m not claiming that it is specifically the fault of universities, but still the rigid structure of university courses perpetuates ancient dogma (that is no longer relevant) about what you can get out of university. (e.g. a job, a successful life etc.)Under the guidance of \u2018helicopter parents\u2019, students were less open to new ideas/actions and instead was stressed, anxious and self-conscious. Today they are pushed for academic achievement, \u2018completely uninterested in the items in their resumes\u2019 etc. Many college students think that they must study a specific area and their paths have already been set out for them. (like engineering, law, accounting etc.) [10] A combination of old beliefs about having a straightforward path to success with the inflexibility of university courses results in students being prevented from fully discovering their interests etc. This creates a generation that is disillusioned, trapped and dissatisfied. Additionally, when acknowledging world famous institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge, a former student is not surprised when increasingly seeing unaccomplished graduates from these places. This is because a \u2018sense of entitlement, elitism and false idea that one is somehow better for having attended Oxbridge can prepare a person for a frankly unimpressive life. One characterised by complacency and security rather than by the ability to make genuine contributions to society.\u2019 This is where graduates aim for a privileged life instead of a meaningful one. [11] This is yet another example where passion is no longer present in higher education, and how many turn to it to create illusions of success and accomplishment in correlation with our increasingly superficial world. Concluding remarksI\u2019d like to add once again that I\u2019m not against university. But I do believe in terms of the material/content that is taught much reform is needed for university to truly be worthwhile.Sources:[1] http://online.purdue.edu...[2] http://www.sanfordbrown.edu...[3] https://www.ft.com...[4]https://books.google.com.au...[5] http://www.wsj.com...[6] http://www.epi.org...[7] https://www.bloomberg.com...[8]https://www.researchgate.net...[9] http://www.smh.com.au...

            "conclusion": "Resolved: That American College Students Should Receive Free Education",
            "premise": "Here's the rules: This debate will follow a loose Lincoln-Douglas style format. Round 1: each opponent will give a small introduction, a display of definitions, and the two or three grounds upon which each argument is based. Round 2: each side will elaborate fully upon their argument. Round 3: refutations will be given to both initial arguments. Round 4: arguments will be defended against refutations. Round 5: small refutation of round 4 and conclusion. Please participate, but only if you are willing to strictly follow this format. This format is designed to give the debate more structure, which will lead to stronger arguments, and a clearer line of persuasion. I have read too many confusing debates that get off track. Let's make this clean and professional. Also, please use quotes, and not links to resources. This will allow for a more effective refutation, and easier evaluation for those voting. Thanks, and looking forward to the debate. Resolved, that American college students should receive free education. This is a controversial view, one with strong socialistic ties, but it could perhaps be the answer to many problems American citizens have. According to Bernie Sanders, a democratic senator from Vermont, \"Colleges must control costs and the federal government must provide the necessary assistance so every person in this country \" regardless of income \" can get a college education.\" He proposed on his official website that \"[the government should] provide $47 billion in federal funding to incentivize states to increase investments in their public higher education systems and eliminate tuition for undergraduate students.\" American tuition rates are rising, and so is the national student debt. Free college for undergraduates could be just what this country needs. Definitions: College: an institution of higher learning, especially one providing a general or liberal arts education rather than technical or professional training. Students: a person formally engaged in learning, especially one enrolled in a school or college. received: to have (something) bestowed upon or conferred. free: clear of obstructions or obstacles. education: a degree, level, or kind of schooling. American College students should receive free education because it would 1). help to relieve the terrible student debts in the country, giving young graduates the ability to persue a graduate degree and attain financial security, and 2). would encourage more Americans to attend college and better not only themselves, but society as well by doing so.",

I can't imagine a more easily indoctrinated group of individuals than a captured group of young impressionable students under a person who has the capability to determine the outcome of their endeavors, whether they succeed or fail while in an educational institution for lengthy periods of their lives. This lengthy indoctrination period that students go through and experience while in Educational institutions has the same effects as what often happens when people are captured and imprisoned by an enemy, described as capture-bonding,... a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, The Helsinki Syndrone.

The College Board is a mission-driven not-for-profit organization that connects students to college success and opportunity.

            "premise": "College does make success in life more easily achievable. 1.) College makes financial success easier to obtain. Students that graduate from college have tremendously larger average lifetime salaries than students that do not attend or graduate college. You can more than double your income though attending college, and college graduates are more likely to obtain jobs with better benefits, saving them tremendous amounts of money over a life time. College graduates also have more job security and a lower rate of unemployment.2.) College allows you to experience new things, and expands your point of view, allowing for a life that is based off of more experiences, and is open to many more perspectives. Going to college allows you to have experiences you would not have otherwise, which allows you to feel more fulfilled in life. Self-fulfillment is a large part of success as it leads to happiness in life.3.) College opens doors and allows you more choice in your future. By obtaining a better education, you also have the opportunity to explore different fields of study and work that you would not be able to explore without a college education. The choice of what path to take in life is a form of success because it makes it easier to be an autonomous individual.College allows oneself to be more successful in life financially, though self-fulfillment, and through allowing more autonomy and opportunity for happiness.Sources:http://www.finaid.org...I look forward to hearing my opponents arguments.",

This is no significant increase in the probability of a player being hurt. ======== =Summary= ======== CON never rebutted any of my arguments, gave multiple new (unwarranted) arguments in the final rebuttal, and never even used the word 'BCS' in his last speech.

            "discussionTitle": "College Athletes Should Be Paid",
            "conclusion": "College Athletes Should Be Paid",
            "premise": "Many thanks to my opponent for accepting this debate. I accept the burden of proof; I am in fact arguing a positive claim against the status quo. College Athletes Should Be PaidCollege athletes work hard. They spend an average of 43.3 hours dedicated to their sport per week [1]. Not only is this 3.3 hours longer than the average American work week, but college students often work harder academically than their peers as well. Because they often travel for games, they miss class and have to rely on tutors, not professors, or teach themselves the material and pass with decent grades in order to qualify for games. At some schools, the road to the NCAA men\"s basketball championship may require student-athletes to miss up to a quarter of all class days during their Spring semester [2]. Furthermore, because they must also take classes and travel, they do not realistically have time for another job. As such, many college students are very poor and struggle to make ends meet while in college [3].College athletes receive scholarships and other benefits, but this is not fair/optimal for several reasons. First, college athletes have different skill levels. In life, we are compensated based on our value. Our monetary value is determined by how much money we generate. Our value is also determined (in sports) by our ability to help the team win. Thus better athletes are worth more and should be paid more money; not all college athletes, including those on the same team, are worth the same amount. Since athletes already receive scholarships and other benefits, they are essentially being paid. Why not determine their value like you do in the real world?On this point, paying college athletes would make the sports more competitive. Compensating players would encourage them to play harder, as the better they are, the more money they would make. Many college athletes are worth far more (based on talent and popularity) so it is not fair they are \"paid\" the same amount. Professional athletes are notoriously bad with money [4]. By providing college athletes pay, it teaches them fiscal responsibility. It encourages them to figure out ways to support themselves while they are still under the strict guidance of parents and more importantly coaches and mentors. Because many college athletes struggle, and are enticed by the allure of professional perks, a lot of college athletes violate the rules and receive some type of back-end compensation anyhow. Over 96 D-1 teams have been caught in the last decade alone [5]. Imagine all the ones that didn't get caught or penalized. Rather than turn a blind eye to what is rampant and justifiably so, paying college athletes and allowing them to cash in on the perks promotes honesty and up-front dealings. This is how we have accountability and ensure fairness, as opposed to having things going on behind closed doors and only penalize the ones who get caught. Consider this: college sports is very lucrative. Advertisements, sponsorships, video games and ticket sales lead to huge profits for college teams worth tens of billions of dollars [6]. Why should athletes only be paid what their tuition is worth, when coaches and other people profit off the NCAA and make millions of dollars on the backs of the athletes? [7]The athletes are the ones putting their bodies and lives on the line every single day. Indeed, football player Eric LeGrand from my alma matter, Rutgers University, suffered a devastating hit during a football game that has left him paralyzed [8]. Many college athletes suffer injury that prevents them from moving on with their college or professional athletic career. They sacrifice their bodies daily, and many suffer long-term negative effects. Over 96% of pro football players (who started in college) have some type of brain injury or deficit [9]. If they can make money while playing the sport, they should be able to while they still can. Their career can end at any day. There is plenty of money to go around. The NCAA currently produces nearly $11 Billion in annual revenue from college sports \" more than the estimated total league revenues of both the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League [10]. The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar business where the only people who are restricted in their earnings, are the athletes. That is not fair. \"This year, the University of Alabama reported $143.3 Million in athletic revenues \" more than all 30 NHL teams and 25 of the 30 NBA teams. Much of the huge revenues collected from college athletics do not go directly back into the classroom. Instead, a substantial share of college sports\" revenues stay \"in the hands of a select few administrators, athletic directors, and coaches\" [11]. Success in college sports improves the school's notoriety, brand recognition and thus application rates. In turn this increases the caliber of admitted students at certain universities. For example, how many people on the East coast would know about Gonzaga if not for their popular athletics program? Athletes contribute to their schools and deserve to be paid for it. College sports are a huge park of many college's marketing and promotion [12]. It seems exploitative to use the athletes and compensate them so little compared to the value they bring in. In the end, there are really no solid arguments as to why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I look forward to hearing my opponents contentions, and explaining how college athletes can be paid. They should be.

            "discussionTitle": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "conclusion": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "premise": "Rebuttal 1:The millennial generation can be characterised as being \u2018interested in daily work reflecting and part of larger societal concerns\u2019, helping communities, caring more on corporate social responsibility and the environment. Importantly, millennials place higher worth on experience rather than material things. (1) 87.5% millennials disagreed with the statement that \u2018money is the best measure of success\u2019, in contrast to 78% of the total population (2) - lighth0us3This is true, though there are also many opportunities to be able to obtain a degree for a career that helps society out. For example, one can't become a nurse without a nursing degree, and not only is higher education necessary for doctors and specialists, who also help society, but post-higher education is as well. With a high school diploma, one is very limited in what they can do, so a college degree opens up many ways in which millennials will be able to help the community in some way. Also, if college education is truly outdated for millennials, why are there more millennials than any other generation going to colllege or who have a college education?[7] They must be getting a college degree for some reason, and it would be logical, that since the millennial generation is more interested in doing a job that is helpful to the community, that they go to college for a meaningful degree that will lead them to a career with which they can do much for the community. Rebuttal 2:P1: Yes, a college education is an indicator that you have reasonable knowledge to qualify for a job. But if this is considered a reason as to why you should go to college \u2013 so you can indicate to employers of higher skilled jobs that you are qualified (and not to learn and get more skills), this merely strengthens my case that education needs serious reform! As reinforced by A4: students go to university for the degree, and not the education. - lighth0us3Well, this isn't the only reason to get a college degree. There are plenty of other reasons, which I gave a few others already. If this was the only reason to get a college degree, then yes, college would be outdated. Agreement 1:P2: Yes, a college education indicates to employers that you are qualified. Similarly, a college education also increases inequality by providing less opportunity for the poor, where they are kept from knowledge! and jobs! Due to their economic position. I know scholarships exist and all that but in an ideal society a poor kid with above average intelligence should not be prevented from entering college due to monetary issues when a rich kid with below average intelligence can graduate from one. Of all millennials that are not in college/have not earned a college degree, more than a third (36%) say that it is because they cannot afford it. (3) This is why I think, perhaps, I misunderstood what con was supposed to be arguing for, because I agree that college education should be reformed to be available to everyone regardless of income. This isn't a concession, because I believed this before I began the debate, so I'm not sure that this should be a reason why voters should vote against me, since I simply may have misunderstood what con was arguing for. Again, I was thinking along the lines of that con was arguing that college education in general(and not how it necessarily is currently) is not outdated for the millennial generation. It wasn't clear upfront (to me at least) that con would be arguing that how college education is currently executed is not outdated for the millennial generation. I would agree that how college education is currently executed is outdated, and I agreed with that before the debate began, so again, I'm not sure if we should continue this debate or not. Either I misunderstood still, or this point is irrelevant because it can be solved by making higher education tax-payer funded.Rebuttal 3There also exists a large array of alternative pathways apart from a college education today. You can take an exam to do actuary. If you are skilled and want to be a lawyer badly enough you don\u2019t even have to go to law school \u2013 you can pass 3 examinations and sit with a practising attorney for four years \u2013 you can save time and money by avoiding law school altogether. -lighth0us3 But I don't believe it works that way for every field. To become a doctor, for example, I don't think you can just do something similar: Pass examinations and sit with a practicing doctor for a few years. Maybe one can do this, and I don't know that one can. Even if it does also work that way for doctors, there are so many fields out there and I doubt all of them work that way. Not to mention, if we did make college tax-payer funded, then either route is just as viable as the other as neither cost money for the student.A degree is not the only indicator of being qualified \u2013 experience and skills are also good qualifiers. You do not need to major in journalism, history, french, photography etc. to qualify for work in these career fields. This is as skills can be used as a qualifier (which is arguably the better indicator for job performance). -lighth0us3 Yes, but it's often the case that one doesn't obtain the skills needed unless they have a college degree. Not every employer will give you an examination to see if you're qualified and have the skills for the job, so a college degree is necessary to indicate to them you have the skills needed.Rebuttal 4/Agreement 2Additionally, 50% of students in 2005 (including myself) who declared a major changed majors. 40% of students who enrolled in a 4 year college program will not have graduated by year 5 or even year 6. (5) This is alarming given that a college degree is very expensive, and should not be wasted on young people who do not know what they want due to the pressure to decide and fast track to a certain pathway with little to no experience with the working world or what a certain career path will be like. -lighth0us3 The only thing I have to rebut here is the cost wasted you brought up. No matter how you go about getting experience within a field, it will cost money. There's nothing that can be done about that some people will waste money. Whether you waste it on paying for classes that are going to be useless because you changed career paths, or do it by paying for some sort of career workshop or really any alternative to education but later change your career path, you're still spending money and it costs money to teach people in a specific field or give them experience. I agree that there should be something done to change the pressure to decide a career path immediately, or at least some sort of class or something that will give people experience in a given career field. I also agree with what you said in the following paragraph that reform is needed. Again, this might be due to that I wasn't clear on what con is arguing for. I absolutely agree, and would have from the beginning before accepting this debate, that education should be reformed. Rebuttal 5This statistic excludes those who entered higher education (like me) below 18 years. (I spent half of my first university year being underage, it is not as uncommon as it may be in America) -lighth0us3 Well, yes, the statistic I used was a survey of adults 18+, but if teenagers were included it would likely only lower the percent a little. Either way, the point was that adults, in general, have more instances of anxiety or depressive disorders than university students. Really, the problem with my statistic is that it includes university students(those who are 18 or older). That would lower the percentage since the percent of university students with depression or anxiety is lower than for adults out of college. The problem is, if you combined both figures to calculate the total of those with anxiety or depression in higher education, 13% + 15.6% = 28.6% affected.Those numbers cannot be combined though, as they represent two completely different populations. The 13% statistic is those who are in undergratuate education with depression or anxiety, and 15.6% is those in graduate school with depression or anxiety. It's not 28.6% of college students(of both grads and undergrads) that have depression and anxiety, rather, it's the average of the two numbers(though it's a little more complicated than that because the number of undergraduates outnumber the number of graduate students in education). First, we need to take into account how many graduates there are in post-graduate school, then add it to the number of undergraduates. That's the total number of college students in either undergratuate education or post-graduate education. Now that we have that, you take the number of graduate students who have depression or anxiety(15.6% of the total number of graduate students), add it to the number of undergradute students with depression or anxiety(13% of the total number of undergraduate students), and then divide that by the total number of graduate and undergraduate students. Adding the percentages does not work, and the actual percentage of college students(including both graduate students and undergraduate students) with depression or anxiety is somewhere in between 13% and 15.6%; it would be closer to 13% than 15.6% since undergrads outnumber graduate students(I don't think I need a source for that undergrads outnumber graduate students right? That should be common knowledge that most people stop after 4 years of college education) Source:[7] https://www.whitehouse.gov...",

            "premise": "Thank you Pro for your acceptance. To be clear, yes, optional courses of study which remain the choice of the student is a good definition. I will expand on the definition and add that Senior electives, electives applicable to one's field, don't count. College is expensive. The average cost for tuition alone averages about $23,000 (http://nces.ed.gov...). Unfortunately, I can only go off of personal experience here, but when I was in college, I had to take 12 credits just in electives (http://www.csmd.edu...). That's an entire semester. Not only is it a waste of money, but it is a waste of time. Most engineers do not use music in their discipline. Most theoretical physicists don't use philosophy in their discipline. I think it would be more worth a student's time to take courses he will use than courses he will not. Interestingly enough, a large number of college graduates (as much as 40% in some studies) don't even use their degree! However, that's outside the scope of this debate. The time spent on electives could be put towards one of two things. 1) Graduating early 2) Taking more credits related to one's field The latter would be more realistic, as colleges have established, in general, that a standard undergraduate degree takes 4 years to achieve. I think it would be more time efficient if students would take more classes pertaining to their degree. An scientists could take classes pertaining to modern discoveries, artists could study more art styles, students could enter graduate school earlier. I think taking electives out of college curricula would improve the efficiency of our education system. Thank your for your acceptance again. I look forward to your rebuttal Pro.",

            "premise": "\"con mostly just talks about the value of education. that doesn't mean excess spending is going to do anything to promote education.\" The amount of spending that we have is in no way excess spending. Like I said earlier, schools have no excess of supplies, to the contrary, they are frequently running out of them. And of course I talk about the value of education, as that is the thing that you are trying to take funding away from. By showing the importance of education, I have shown the importance of keeping education funded. \" and con doesn't even provide any examples of the feds doing anything helpful that isn't done by locality.\" If you would like to see what the federal government does to improve education in the US, look at this link to their website: http://www2.ed.gov... Cutting the federal department of education's budget will stop it from doing many of these tasks. And if you want the federal department of education to be able to do more for education, it will need more funding, not less. \"the core of schooling is provided by the local level. that is why pro had a poor upbringing. but we can see that the federal government with all that spending did nothing to change his upbringing. the money went to burocracy instead.\" Once again, I would like to ask that Pro provided some form of evidence that the entirety of the US federal department of education's budget is going to the \"burocracy\", and not towards the educations of students. \"as examples. in ohio, common core comes with a seven hundred million dollar price tag if the states deny doing it. ive seen first hand the excesses they use in scoring that material. standards can be placed, but they shouldn't and needn't come at hefty price tags.\" It seems reasonable that all states be held to a higher standard of education, and punished if they fail to meet it. here is a break down of the department of educaiton.... \"\"The primary functions of the Department of Education are to \"establish policy for, administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education, collect data on US schools, and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights.\"[11] The Department of Education does not establish schools or colleges.[12] The Office of the Inspector General conducts audits and investigation in connection to the Department's programs. Unlike the systems of most other countries, education in the United States is highly decentralized, and the federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards (with the recent exception of the No Child Left Behind Act). This has been left to state and local school districts. The quality of educational institutions and their degrees is maintained through an informal private process known as accreditation, over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control.\" Wouldn't the most logical fix for such a decentralized education system be raising the funding of federal education, so it can cover more costs for the local schools? \"The Department's mission is: to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.[13] Aligned with this mission of ensuring equal access to education, the Department of Education is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness,[14] and works with federal partners to ensure proper education for homeless and runaway youth in the United States.\" some of those things are good, keepting statistics, helping homeless and runaways etc. but things like no child left behind or race to the top or common core, unnessaary.\" Please provide an argument supporting the claim that holding educators to a higher standard is \"unnessaary\". \"and even the more fudamentally good aspects arent that great. the free market will ensure the required level of education.\" That claim you have made is ridiculous. All Leaving education to the free market would do is keep the rich smart and successful, while dooming everyone else to much poorer educations. It is the responsibility of the state to provide an education for those who live in it. \"it will function just fine. we're throwing money at problems like runaways when in the bigger picture, that is a problem that has only local consequences, local to that kid. the free market will be just fine. at a time of record debt, sometimes hard choices have to be made.\" Please provide justification to support why leaving education to the free market would solve the problems, as it seems completely counter intuitive to me.",

            "conclusion": "Should The Age of Adulthood In America Be Changed",
            "premise": "When the accepted age of adulthood was set at 18, most jobs in America did not require anything more than a high school diploma. In essence, the government provided young adults with the necessary education to succeed in their world by ensuring that they could obtain the education to get them into the careers they need. Colleges, back then, were extras, for overachievers who wanted more. Thus, colleges were attended by those who had the financial means to afford it and the intelligence to perform at a high enough level to obtain a degree and become integral parts of society in its more important positions. In America today, however, most non-poverty wage jobs require post-secondary education. In today's society, the secondary school diploma is worth as much as a primary school diploma, and a bachelor's degree is worth as much as a secondary school diploma was worth a few generations ago Because of this, most young Americans need to attend college so as to be able to be a part of the middle class. The government, however, does very little if anything at all to help young adults attain college, and therefore, forcing young adults to fend for themselves, causing them to accrue large debts, and forcing college-bound students to work exorbitant hours in jobs where they only can earn poverty wages, because they don't have the degree that would afford them the opportunity to work in jobs that would pay decent wages. In short, the American government does not afford its young citizens the necessary education to succeed in today's world anymore, instead asking them to take the burden of getting their own education by themselves. The sad truth of the current state of American society is that the Millennial generation constantly gets blamed for acting entitled, when we only act that way because we are the first generation that hasn't had the basics afforded to us by older generations. We have actually had to work and pay to get the bare minimum. While individual parents have been pockets of hope, not everyone has a good set of parents. It is for this reason the free public education exists, and with the age of adulthood being pushed back a few years, free public education could be raised to include underclass post-secondary education.",

            "discussionTitle": "In the United States, the costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "conclusion": "In the United States, the costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "Thanks for accepting. I'd like to start off by outlining a framework for this debate. There are a few key factors that need to be looked at: 1) The cost to the individual 2) The benefit to the individual 3) The cost to the majority 4) The benefit to the majority In any effective cost/benefit analysis, the cost or benefit to the majority is always carries more impact than the cost for benefit to the individual. Thus, for framework of this debate, the Pro must prove that the costs outweigh the benefits for the majority of the U.S populace, and the Con must prove that the benefits outweigh the costs for the majority of the U.S populace. With that, here are my contentions: 1. College does not benefit the majority The Bureau of Labor Statistics sheds some light on the amount of students who attend college, and from that, the amount who actually graduate. According to a BLS study in 2010[1], 68% of high school graduates attended college. According to this same study, 45% of those who enrolled in college didn\u2019t even graduate. From that, we can conclude that 62.6% of the students that graduate from high school did not receive a college degree, whether they dropped out or didn\u2019t even attend in the first place. Right off the bat, that's more than half of the U.S population who do not receive individual benefits from a college education, whether the reason be dropping out of college or not even attending at all. Although that doesn't seem like a lot, it's enough to prove a point. The Labor Department\u2019s American Community Survey[2] tells us of another 22% of college graduates that are currently employed at a job that doesn't even require a degree. All of this points to the idea that all of the individual benefits that the Con is sure to point out aren't actually obtained by the majority of the U.S populace. 2. College contributes towards the growing income gap in the U.S Bryan Caplan, a professor of economics at the George Mason University, says that \u201cFrom a moral point of view, far too many students are going to college \u2013 just as far too many people stand up at concerts\u201d[3]. This analogy compares going to college with standing up at a concert: Sure, doing so will benefit you individually, there's no denying that, but by doing so you are effectively hindering the people around you. The more people that stand up at concerts, the more it hinders everyone there, just as the more people who attend college, the more it hinders the U.S populace, which includes both people who chose to attend college, and those who did not. According to the Center for the Study of Democracy in 2007[4], from 1973 to 2005, wages of those in the 90th percentile \u2013 where most people have college or advanced degrees \u2013 rose by 30 percent or more, and among this top 10 percent, the growth was heavily concentrated in the top 1%, which includes venture capitalists, corporate attorneys, and CEOs. In contrast, at the 50th percentile and below, where many people have at most a high school diploma, real wages rose by only 5 to 10 percent. Although there isn't a causal relationship between the growing income gap and college education, these statistics still show an increasing gap between the payment of a blue collar worker and a white collar worker. This means that people who can\u2019t afford college, people who drop out or fail college, or even people who don\u2019t want to go to college are punished, and in most cases, the act that they\u2019re being punished for is completely out of their control. 3. College contributes to the destruction of the U.S health care system The U.S is infamous for its astronomical health care prices, and semi-infamous for the high cost of a decent college education. Is it a coincidence that a medical school education is one of the most expensive educations that one can receive, but the potential profit from that career path is exponentially higher? I think not. The Association of American Medical Colleges reports that tuition rates alone for first year students averaged at $50,000 a year[5]. This doesn\u2019t include room and board, textbooks, and other expenses, and it also doesn\u2019t include graduate school. A study done by the American Medical Association reported that the average educational debt of indebted graduates of the class of 2010 was $157,944[6]. From the same study, they found that 78 percent of graduates have debt of at least $100,000, 42 percent of graduates have a debt of at least $150,000, and 85 percent of graduating medical students carry outstanding loans. In fact, the average amount of time that it takes for a graduated medical student to pay off his or her debts acquired from med school is 11 years. It's no wonder why health care costs are so high, how else would these students pay off their loans? The AMA states that tuition fee is the largest contributor towards the astronomically high price of health care by saying \"Medical education debt is driven by rising tuition. AAMC data show that median private medical school tuition and fees increased by 50 percent (in real dollars) in the 20 years between 1984 and 2004. Median public medical school tuition and fees increased by 133 percent over the same time period. Other recent 20-year periods show similar trends.\" What problems does this cause for our health care system? Reuters ranks the United States as the most expensive health care in the world[7], which is largely due to the debt accumulated by medical students and their need to pay it off. The cost of U.S health care has led to 16.7% of the U.S population who are completely uninsured because they can\u2019t afford health care, according to the U.S Census Bureau in 2009[8]. This lack of insurance leads to the unnecessary deaths of 18 thousand people per year according to the U.S Institute of Medicine. Those who are insured still have trouble paying the costs of the health care they receive. A 2001 study in five states found that medical debt contributed to 46.2% of all personal bankruptcies and in 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. Having the most expensive health care in the world wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it was also the best, but that\u2019s not the case either. The World Health Organization ranks the United States as having the 37th most effective health care out of the 191 countries that were analyzed. So if you\u2019re somehow able to afford health care, it\u2019s still not even the best you can get, despite its outrageously high cost. To summarize, college education in the United States does not benefit the majority, it contributes towards an increasing income gap between blue and white collar workers, and it leads to the increasing of price in the already ridiculously overpriced private health care in the U.S. Given these contentions, I affirm. 1. http://www.bls.gov... 2. http://www.census.gov... 3. http://chronicle.com... 4. http://www.frbsf.org... 5. http://services.aamc.org... 6. http://www.ama-assn.org...? 7. http://www.reuters.com... 8.

If the \"Dumbing down,\" of America is the objective of America's institutions of higher learning then, and only then, should Colleges and Universities be allowed to claim that they have achieved their promised goals. \"Do the colleges and Universities still retain the same value to individuals that they once provided, Thats the question, I believe the answer is \"College, Why bother..\"",

            "discussionTitle": "Education should be funded by vouchers granted to individual families, not public schools.",
            "conclusion": "Education should be funded by vouchers granted to individual families, not public schools.",
            "premise": "The point of providing a \"voucher\" instead of cash is that the voucher can only be spent in a certain way. Education vouchers could only be spent on education. If there are to be no standards on what qualifies as education, as you're suggesting, then there is absolutely no point in providing vouchers -- cash could be used instead. If there are some kind of standards to be applied to who can receive the vouchers, then this means the government will be setting the standards, thus regulating and controlling schools and turning all private schools into public schools -- just as has happened with colleges. The above is irrefutable. Your \"free market\" argument is laughable. The free market is what I'm arguing for -- you're arguing for wealth redistribution. Someone who has ten children would receive ten vouchers' worth of subsidies, while someone who has one child would only receive one voucher's worth of subsidies. If the vouchers can be spent on anything, then this is just a crude wealth redistribution plan -- and you're saying, yes, despite the fact that it makes absolutely no sense to provide vouchers that can be spent on anything (defeating the entire purpose of a voucher vs. cash), the vouchers in your system would be able to be spent on ANYTHING. It's doubly ridiculous to suggest that parents wouldn't make poor choices, such as sending their children to the Video Arcade Academy. Do parents not make poor choices now with their own money? Of course they do! Although a true free market would provide better quality education and more choices, there would still be parents who made poor choices. WHAT ABOUT HOMESCHOOLING? Would homeschoolers not be eligible for the vouchers? Would their taxes pay for them either way? If they would be eligible for the vouchers, to be paid to themselves, then isn't this obviously open to massive fraud and abuse? Unscrupulous parents could have ten or twelve children and collect $8,000 to $10,000 per year, PER CHILD, for \"educating\" them, whether they actually educated them or not! And if homeschoolers are not able to receive the vouchers, then is this not an outright assault on the freedom to homeschool? You are arguing for tyranny and cloaking your words in the parlance of freedom. It is truly Orwellian. It is downright blasphemous to use the \"invisible hand\" metaphor when you're talking about a big-government, wealth-redistribution program. Do you honestly believe your own rhetoric? Vouchers are a neoconservative transfer-payment apparatus. That conservatives and libertarians have fallen for this charade is one thing, but to disingeuously use \"free market\" rhetoric in order to justify the case for the socialization of education is downright insulting to people's intelligence. Your understanding of the Constitution and Original Intent is horrid. If the First Amendment's \"separation of church and state\" applied to the states, then why did official state churches in Massachusetts and Connecticut endure until 1833, and why were they abolished through state legislative process, not the federal government's enforcement of the First Amendment? You have a very liberal, big-government understanding of the Constitution. The Constitution clearly says \"CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW...\" That's what it says, and it doesn't matter what FDR's judges have said since. Of course, the above has nothing to do with the debate at hand, but it merely shows your lack of constitutional logic, and the Rooseveltian liberalism that informs your supposedly \"libertarian\" stand for wealth redistribution and state-sponsored education camps. A voucher system would take the partially monopolized education system and make the monopoly complete. There are only two colleges that refuse federal money. There are many more private schools at the K-12 level. If your system were adopted, then truly private schools would become as rare as truly private colleges, thus effectively abolishing the private alternative to public education. AND AGAIN, WHAT ABOUT HOMESCHOOLING? Every worthwhile argument you've made for a voucher system can also be made for a truly free market in education. You've done nothing to show why vouchers are better than a true free market. I have shown why a true free market is better than vouchers -- which are NOT a \"free market\" (PLEASE!). I will go further to say even the status quo is better, because at least now, parents are able to send their children to truly private schools. Under your system, that would cease to be the case.",

            "conclusion": "In the United States, the costs of a college education outweigh the benefits",
            "premise": "Higher education is required for all but the most basic of jobs (Contention 4)You're probably wondering why I'm trying to make this point. Obviously college benefits the individual even more if it's required to get a halfway-decent job, right? That's exactly the point. But what happens to the rest of the population without a degree? They're left behind to \"feed off the table scraps\".In the book Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life, Anthony T. Kronman, a professor of law at Yale Law School, said: \"All but the most unskilled forms of labor are increasingly based on knowledge of a kind that can be acquired only in school, and in supplying that knowledge America's colleges and universities provide a tremendous service to the individuals who come to them to learn a trade of profession\"[1]. There is no denying the benefit to the individual when he or she receives a college education, but those who do not are limited to all but the most basic of jobs. In defense of my contentionsContention 1) College does not benefit the majorityMy opponent states that the people who do not attend college should not factor into this debate because the resolution doesn't apply to them. This was true, until I brought up my fourth contention. Now, those who do not go to college must be included in this debate as a group of individuals who are suffering the consequences of not going to college. If we are forced to include the individuals who do not attend college, we are now left with a resulting 62.6% of high school graduates who have not benefited - but have actually been impacted negatively - by a college education.Contention 2) College contributes to the already growing income gapGiven my response to my opponent's objection to my first Contention, my opponent's response to my second is also void. Yes, college graduates make more money, and their income has been proven to increase over time compared to the income of blue-collar workers. This is exactly what my point was trying to get across. If the wages of higher educated jobs are increasing faster than the wages of lower education jobs, then that is an income gap that is increasing.Contention 3) College contributes to the destruction of the U.S health care systemMy opponent seemed to misunderstand this contention. Yes, it's true that med-school students have to pay more than regular college students, and yes, they are part of the minority. But I wasn't arguing that. I was arguing that health care prices in the United States are so high BECAUSE med school students have to pay so much towards their educations. It takes an average of 11 years to fully pay off the debt that one acquires through med school, and it is for this reason that the costs of health care in the United States is so high. And seeing as the cost of health care affects everyone, this is an obvious detriment for the majority of the U.S populace.Responding to my opponent's contention:College students make more moneyI agree. The arguments in my fourth contention apply here as well. What about the students that do not attend college? What about the students that can not attend college? It's simple, they are forced to make less than their higher-educated counterparts. So again, I acknowledge the benefits to the individual, but that is insignificant compared to the detriments to the majority.I urge an affirmative vote.Citations:1. http://books.google.com...",

            "premise": "My opponent has dropped ever single argument I have made and merely added a set of new contentions. So that is the first reason to vote CON. The thesis of this debate is exactly what my opponent said in his first speech, it can't be changed throughout the debate arbitrarily as he attemtps to do in his second \"rebuttal\" therefore we instantly drop these non-topical argument and focus on those presented (I will argue them however). Thesis: \"I believe that a required college education would be very important, as with a college education, better paying jobs are available\" Therefore the burden of the CON is to prove that College education does not provide better paying jobs. As I have done in my first speech, also I took it a step further to point out how rather than provide a head start on success in life college sets students back, therefore we can clearly vote CON. Also we must note that their are no warrants supporting his first speech so we can once again drop all these absurd claims. On to the PRO Main Point 1: Universities offer better returns if you invest. This is by far the most non topical argument of the round, so I see no reason why this should even be taken into consideration. Now it is non-topical because my opponent talks about Universities not Colleges. Universities are An institution for higher learning with teaching and research facilities constituting a graduate school and professional schools that award master's degrees and doctorates and an undergraduate division that awards bachelor's degrees. (http://dictionary.reference.com...) and Colleges are an institution of higher learning, esp. one providing a general or liberal arts education rather than technical or professional training. A Blatant difference, had my opponent clarified at the beginning of the debate that we are discussing both, I would argue them both, but because he didn't and there is little time for me to respond if he decides to arbitrarily establish this bond we can not allow him. Main Point 2: The number of scholarships are rapidly increasing, and even if you couldn't obtain one, community colleges offer a good education and often enough, financial aid. After we remember that we are trying to establish that college = better jobs so more money, we can realize this main point is incorrect. Because of the first main point where he says \"studies have found that students who attend highly selective colleges have much greater lifetime earnings than those who don't\". This is only talking about selective colleges and community colleges are not selective, also for this matter what are these studies? He never manages to cite them so how are we to know they actually exist? We can't so dismiss the studies but keep in mind that he agrees. Also going back to my point about universities and colleges the entire set of warrants for how scholoraships are more available are only referenced from Universities, so we can dismiss this claim. Remember we are not discussing Universities only Colleges, and for that matter my opponent fails to uphold a clear debate he merely suggests contentions and then drops them. So",

            "discussionTitle": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "conclusion": "Higher Education is outdated for the millennial generation",
            "premise": "I would actually agree that higher education is outdated for the millennial generation, but I believe it is still necessary. The first point I shall make is that, while I agree that there is probably not much to gain from a college education since we have access to all of the information at our fingertips through the internet(though, I would argue that in many ways the internet has made us dumber; however if you're smart, you know how to find high quality articles on matters, such as using google scholar instead of plain google) the formality of going through a college education does have a lot of bonuses to it.1) What one will earn with a college degree is almost double the amount of money that a high school graduate will earn. While what my opponent said that a college degree earns you less than it did in the past, it still is a fact that a college degree earns you more than a high school degree does today. \"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the annual salary average differences between educational levels is staggering: High school drop outs: $18,734 High school graduates: $27,915 College grads (with a bachelor\u2019s degree): $51,206 Advanced degree holders: $74,602\" [1] Now, while a high school graduate will be able to earn more money upfront, whereas a college student will be spending a lot of time on college, probably after a few years of a college graduate being in the workforce will ballance out to the money that the high school grad earned. If you take these numbers(which are not what the person makes first out of college or first out of high school, so these numbers would be lower for that, but I'll use them anyways).Suppose you have person A who is going to college before doing any kind of work, and Person B who started working full time right out of high school. Person A is not earning anything while Person B is earning money. Person B, in 4 years(the amount of time the average college degree takes to earn) would earn $111,660. At this point, the college grad would then be able to start working in the work force, and they would be getting $51,206 a year. After another 6 years the college grad will have earned 307,236, while the high school graduate, in 10 years(4 years of working while person A was in school, and 6 years while both were working) of working will have earned 279,150. So, in the long-run, a college education will earn you much more. And that's not taking into account that as a college student, you can easily have a part-time job while going to school full-time. I did this myself and still retained excellent grades.I suppose Person A, however, may have a lot of college debt, which my opponent mentioned that higher education is very expensive. However, this is not true for every college graduate. Some had such good grades that they earned scholarships, others came from a family that was well off enough to afford to put them into college, and others went to a community college(which are much more affordable than 4 year universities) and then transfered to a 4 year university and saved a lot of money going that route. In addition, this is not exactly a problem that needs to be solved by getting rid of college education or necessarily reforming it, but it could be solved by making colleges tuition free and paid for by taxes.However, now that I looked into the average debt a college student has when coming out of college, it's $30,100[6]. This amount can be paid for by less than two years of work, since the average college student makes $24,000 more per year than a high school student. Sure, for the first year and half, they would in reality be making the same as a high school graduate since they have to pay off their debt, but after that they will catch up to the high school graduate in less than 10 years and surpass them in the amount of money they gained over the years.Here's another example where a college education would greatly benefit a person. Depending on what field a person goes into, they will earn a lot more than others too. So, people could easily choose the higher-paying careers. For example, I'm currently going to school to become a psychiatrist. This takes an addiitonal 4 years after a bachelor's degree to complete, usually. The average annual salary a psychiatrist has is $193,680.[2] A psychiatrist earns more than double the amount the average wage for advanced degrees, and doctors and other specialists are in the same boat. If more people were to consider going into the medical field, they would earn a lot more and it would definitely be worth it. There are also other fields which pay well as well. 2) College education easily indicates to employers of higher-skilled jobs that you are qualified. Now, if you take a high school graduate who learned everything online, there is no way that employers validate that you have knowledge enough for the field they employ in. Unless employers started giving some sort of examination on their field of work instead of requiring a bachelor's degree, a high school graduate who learned all of the necessary things for that career via online with no degree is at a disadvantage for getting that job, and probably will earn around the average a high school graduate makes. So, in order to make what my opponent proposes come true, where people could just self-educate themselves via the internet instead of a formal education, we would have to force employers to stop looking for college degrees from people and have them hand out some sort of examination to test if the person is qualified for the job. There's no guarantee employers would do this either, unless we forced them to. 3) College education helps you go into a career you really wantAs mentioned in the previous point, to get a specific career, it's often the case you need a college degree. Even if it's not earning enough to ballance out the fact that maybe you have some debt and that you weren't earning more money while you were going to college, it still means you got to go into a career you enjoy which you may not have been able to if you didn't have a college degree. RE: University education today fosters a grade-oriented, disengaged, depressed culture that fails to prepare students for real life. As for my opponent's argument that university causes depression and anxiety disorders, I would like to point out that the study they linked to says \" The estimated prevalence of any depressive or anxiety disorder was 15.6% for undergraduates and 13.0% for graduate students\" [3] while my opponent was slightly off for the numbers, that's not what my point is going to be about. Let's compare that to the anxiety and depression rates of the general population. In the general population 18.1% of adults have an anxiety disorder[4] while 6.7% of all adults have depression[5] for a combined total of 24.8% of the general population with either. In other words, anxiety and depression is lower among college students than the general population. This is a good thing that the rate of depression and anxiety is lower amongst college students than the general population. It indicates that college is not as big of a stressor on people than events later on in life.

            "discussionTitle": "Free University Education",
            "conclusion": "Free University Education",
            "premise": "Hello. Firstly, I would like to thank Philocat for giving me my first debate with a person who isn't trying to troll me, as I am rather new here. My opponent has stated that the right to free education as listed in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights does not necessarily apply to tertiary education. This is true, as what the text actually says is \"Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.\" (1) However, it does state that everyone has a right to education and that education shall be made \"generally available and equally accessible to all.\"(1) College education in many countries is ridiculously expensive, and, as a result of this, education is not \"generally available and equally accessible to all.\" People may not be able to afford being burdened with massive bills and/or student loans. They may have a family to feed but can't do so on their current salary and want to go to college so that they can earn more money, but due to the increased Harvardization of higher education, the potential increase in salary will be offset by paying for college. Granted, a small percentage of the population is rich enough that they can just afford college easily with money from their own pockets, but this elite is not representative of the majority of the populace in countries where higher education is not communal or nearly communal. My opponent has stated that college is non-essential, non-core education, when in fact an average of 2 years of college education are dedicated to core learning. My opponent has stated that college is for only the brightest in our society to do the most cognitively challenging jobs, such as that of a physician, lawyer, architect, etc., while himself admitting that nearly half of people (not sure where he's referring to, though) have attended/are attending/will attend college according to current rates. This is contradictory, as highly specialized academic professionals such as those listed by my opponent make up well below half of employed people. My opponent has stated that making college free is unfair on those who don't attend college. This is a self-disproving argument, though, as, if college were free, these people who don't attend college would be able to remedy the issue by, you guessed it, going to college. For free. My opponent has stated that free education will make people want to do more drugs and alcohol because they're not paying for the arbitrary cost of college. I'm not sure I understand the reasoning behind this, but I suppose he's referring to the stigma that college students retain when it comes to partying and whatnot, and that they would care less about their education because the money is not coming out of their pocket. This isn't really an issue, though, because people that behave that way in a setting with free higher education would either clean up their act or be filtered out of the system, just as is the case in countries where college is not free. And countries where college is free generally have a higher population percentage with degrees, so obviously most people don't behave as my opponent has suggested. My opponent has stated that attending an absolutely free university that only serves to widen your options is a bad thing somehow. He seems to believe that this will decrease the size of the pool from which countries draw unskilled labor. It won't. Even assuming that there is a low carrying capacity for educated jobs, as my opponent suggests there is, those who don't manage to land one will just end up doing lower-paying jobs, just as they do in countries where college is not free. They wouldn't have to worry about paying for student loans on this low salary because, again, college would be free. There would be roughly the same percentage of people working these unskilled jobs because, going along with the hypothetical situation that my opponent established wherein there is a small carrying capacity for educated jobs, only a set number of people won't have low-paying jobs anyway. Plus, these people with low-paying jobs will have a degree that gives them increased potential to advance their status and makes for an educated, intelligent, well-informed populace. My opponent says that going to college breeds a sense of entitlement, and that graduates won't want to work low-paying jobs. Some will have to, though, if, as my opponent said, there is only a set number of academic careers. My opponent has stated that \"If the financial advantage that graduates receive is balanced out by requiring them to pay for their tuition, then no group has a disadvantage.\" This is true, except for people who can't afford to pay for college. Which, in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., etc., is, you know, most people. Plus, if education is free, this whole point can be disregarded because *everyone can attend college.* They don't have to stay at a disadvantage if they don't want to. My opponent has stated that \"so it is only fair that if someone is going to get a financial benefit from going to university, then they should be expected to financially subsidise it.\" There are these magical things called taxes. They are for things that benefit the public, like free education and such. They're pretty handy in situations such as these. 1- http://www.un.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Free tuition for college students through government taxation should be supported.",
            "conclusion": "Free tuition for college students through government taxation should be supported.",
            "premise": "My arguments stand in opposition to the resolution \"Free tuition for college students through government taxation should be supported.\" My opponent opens with \"College tuition is one of the most expensive expenditures any person or family faces. In fact, after possibly a house, it is the most expensive thing any person will \"buy.\"\" While college may indeed be one of the *more* expensive purchases a person or family might makes, it seems a tad broad and inaccurate to state, as a fact, that college is the *most* expensive thing *any* person will buy, qualified only with \"after possibly a house.\" This is totally dependent on what person we are talking about, and in turn that person's (or that person's family's) financial standing. These days, depending on who we are talking about, the cost of college can easily pale in comparison to such things as cars, real estate (not a house), market investments, political influence, prostitutes, and watches. I am not denying the expense of college, only saying that we cannot afford to reach such unsound conclusions, or take any statement given as fact to actually be fact without further exploration of the topic at hand. After this statement, my opponent goes on to say, \"However, it should be the case that the government provide students extra funding drawn from tax dollars. There should of course be restrictions placed on this - there is no reason tax dollars should be given to millionaires' children or for people to attend outrageously priced institutions.\" JCMTarzan wants the government to provide, through taxation of course, free tuition. Of course, as with any social program, and government-provided free tuition is that if nothing else, this would be massively unfair, especially in light of the restrictions that JCMTarzan proposes: no money should go to millionaires' children, or toward the attendance of \"outrageously\" priced colleges (Ivy League schools.) On the one hand, the currently wealthy should handle the majority of the tax burden (as they already do, not just in the US but everywhere) but their children should be disqualified from benefiting from their family's \"investment in the future.\" Not a very equitable investment on a personal level, and I think most would agree with me. On the other hand, this is an argument for my position: the resolution speaks of no restrictions - it only says \"college students,\" which I take to mean all college students, that is, college students in general. My opponent cannot pick and choose which students will benefit and which will not; if JCMTarzan's view is in fact this which he writes, then he is not truly \"For\" the topic resolution. If free tuition through taxation were to be a reality, then all college students should be able to benefit equally. As for his restriction on possibly over-priced schools, a thought experiment will serve my purposes: You are high school senior living in Massachusetts, and you have applied to Boston University, the University of Mass., and, although it is possible but unlikely that you are accepted, to Harvard, Cambridge, and MIT. Your family is of average economic standing - if you were accepted it would not be on account of any \"legacy\"-type tradition, or even on scholarship, as you are not THAT smart, but smart enough to have a chance. Free tuition from the government is in effect. Amazingly, you are accepted. The chance of a lifetime has been dropped in your lap. As you do not have a scholarship or other means to pay tuition, you must rely on the government's program. Unfortunately, per the restrictions assumed by JCMTarzan, the Dept. of Education calls you up and tells you that you cannot attend because it is too expensive. The program didn't really work in your case, did it? A highly specific example, but it makes the point. \"There are two main reasons tax dollars should be used in this way: It constitutes and investment in the future, and it will increase the base of educated people.\" First, is not every investment an investment in (or for) the future? Unfortunately, some investments have a good return and some have a bad return. Anyone who has ever bought a stock knows this well. An investment, in simplest terms, is nothing more than a gamble at best: ask the stockholders of Bear-Stearns. There is no guarantee that such a huge investment, which could only happen by way of taxes increasing, as my opponent admits, would prove to be worthwhile. Second, an increase in the base of educated people is not necessarily a good thing. More on that in a moment. \"There is a definite correlation between the investment in education and the literacy rates and success of a country.\" -What might this correlation be? \"Consider that in the UK...\" and \"In Spain...\" -I understand and agree that the resolution is not aimed specifically at the US. However, this is simply socialism (as my opponent also admits), or many people getting a free ride at the hands of the few on the education bus. Whatever happened to self-made men (or women), self-reliance, and self-responsibility? The primary problem with socialism is that once you are getting the \"free ride,\" as it were, that many, many people do not want to get off. Shall the government in turn provide graduates of their free-tuition system with jobs if they are unable to find one themselves? Why not: they got them into college in the first place. \"The payment of tuition from tax dollars constitutes this incentive. If institutions of higher education maintain the same enrollment rates, but have \"free\" tuition, the applicant pool will be both larger AND of a higher caliber because you'll be getting students who otherwise could not afford to go to college actually applying.\" -First, that is a big \"if.\" If free tuition were enacted, there would be so many applicants that schools could not help but increase their enrollment rates: who wants to pass all of that money by? Unless new entrance standards were introduced along with free tuition, this seems inevitable. If you have X GPA, X ACT or SAT scores, and other current standard qualifications, as many who do not go to college on account of the expense do, then all of these people would have to be accepted somewhere if they chose to go at all: they would have overcome their only stumbling block (money), so what else would stop them? I agree that the applicant pool will be larger; of higher calibre I am not so certain: the more applicants there are, the lower their average calibre would be. That's a simple law of statistics. More students, larger classes, etc, less quality of services rendered (education). \"Institutions can take the best of the pool and increase both the size and quality of the American Populace.\" -Universities now have breeding programs in line with Social Darwinism? A shock, to say the least ;) \"However, cases show that the education rates of other countries that DO practice this are higher than that of the United States. Coincidence?\" -OBVIOUSLY not. If more people go to school, then more are educated. Of course, educated is not synonymous with intelligent, hard-working, or even contributory in any way to the overall well-being of society. JCMTarzan urges the reader to support this idea, but I ask you not to, for it is a socially onerous but politically expedient idea. NOTHING is free. Someone somewhere is getting the raw end of the deal - paying the taxes but not having children, paying the taxes while having children but not seeing them benefit because of good economic status, etc. Other societies do as they like, sure, but in providing \"free\" tuition do they not devalue the education that is sought? Whatever is worth having is worth earning, worth working for, sacrificing for; do we not appreciate what we have worked hard for more than what is simply \"given\" to us (while at the same time being taken from others)?

            "conclusion": "Public college education in the United States should be tuition-free.",
            "premise": "Thank you so much for an entertaining and informative debate. I will begin with another overview, and then I will move into several points of crystallization that will attempt to frame the key issues in this round, and demonstrate why Pro has won them. Con's arguments can, almost exclusively, be grouped into two categories: 1) Is/ought fallacies, and 2) Assertions and rhetorical questions. Repeatedly, we hear about what public means, student loans, what the state of the American educational system is, what the implications of a college degree are, and that college is not for everyone, among other things. None of these are arguments about why the system should be one way or another; they are simply observations about the current state of affairs, regardless of their correctness. Secondly, Con repeatedly makes absurd assertions and asks nonsensical rhetorical questions; for instance, \"I have never heard of anyone pursuing philosophy and then going to law school,\" \"We should not just give people handouts,\" or \"Why should I pay for someone else's mistakes.\" I am sorry; these are not arguments that attempt to explain why something should or should not be. 1. Role of the State I have, in this round, set up a consistent framework whereby the state has one key role: to fulfill the social contract. To fulfill this contract, the state must provide public goods, which are paid for by everybody through taxation. These public goods include national defense, clean air, and, to this point, education before college. I have argued that, due to the changing nature of our society, that college is quite equivalent to what high school once was and, as such, should be provided to better societal outcomes. I have also argued that it is intrinsically wrong for citizens to pay for a public good, but to not have access to it, simply by nature of their poverty. None of these arguments have been refuted. I have also stated that members of the Continental Congresses and the Constitutional Convention did not include such a provision in the Constitution since such a system was not in existence at the time. Con claims that the University of Virginia having tuition now proves that Jefferson did not believe such things. On the contrary, Jefferson simply, in the early 1800s, could not secure sufficient funding, a problem which persists to the present day [1]. Thus, if I have proved that the state has an obligation, under a social contractarian framework, to provide education, then I win this round. 2. Rights and Equality I have argued, throughout this debate, that tuition abrogates equality of opportunity because it prevents people from both self-actualizing and from accessing labor markets. Con has attempted to negate this by arguing 1) That student loans exist, 2) That college should just be made cheaper by cutting departments, and 3) That some people are just not meant for college. Firstly, student loans are not optimal for many of the reasons I have listed previously. They act as a drag on the economy due to decreased spending, they form a bubble which could pop and seriously harm the integrity of the institution of higher learning, they coerce students into choosing careers that are perceived to be financially-rewarding, and they price students on the margins out of higher education. Con claims that monthly payments could simply be adjusted; this is often not possible, and any payment still prices those on the margins out. Even worse, student debt cannot be liquidated in bankruptcy; it follows a person until they die or until the debt is paid. Con next argues that college could be made more accessible by cutting departments, incredulously claiming that nobody, literally nobody, that pursues philosophy goes to law school. If this is the case, then I suppose that I do not exist. In fact, statistics show that philosophy is tied with economics for the highest LSAT score [2]. The same sorts of arguments go for arts and music; training in these fields still can benefit society and the person pursuing them. Any anecdotal claims by Con to the contrary do not have any bearing in this round. Con finally argues that some people are not meant for college. I will further expound the benefits of training more people later on, but this argument is faulty on face. The fact that some people are not as intelligent does not mean that they do not have the same right to equality of opportunity as everyone else. Con has never dealt with this line of thinking, and it will prove damaging. I have stated repeatedly that preventing people from having the opportunity to self-actualize or access labor markets equally is anathema to the idea of equality of opportunity, and we have never really heard a response from Con on this point. If I can prove that tuition impinges equality of opportunity, then I win this debate. 3 . Benefits of Education College education is a sound financial investment [3]. On average, graduates make more money and have lower rates of unemployment than non-graduates. This accrues to more spending and increased GDP, which raises the standards of living for all Americans. Con has never negated this. Instead, Con argues on two main fronts: 1) College does not guarantee success and 2) Some people are not meant for college. Both of these arguments are faulty. Firstly, I have demonstrated that college increases the probability of financial success, even if it does not guarantee it. I have never argued for absolutes, but, on the macro scale, it is empirically true that college is beneficial for one's earnings. A few anecdotal counterexamples does not disprove this. I have several responses to the second argument. Firstly, training people, even if they are less intelligent than others, has many advantages. I have already demonstrated that college graduates are better citizens and make better decisions than non-graduates [4]. This is better for society, and, when combined with the increased earning potential and ability to innovate, make for truly compelling economic reasons to educate more people. Secondly, some people will not be successful in college, some people will major in less financially-successful careers. However, if we agree that everybody should, independent of themselves, have equivalent rights claims, and if we agree that education has value, economically and for self-actualization, this is irrelevant. All majors can contribute to society, many in unique ways. Less people majoring in theater, arts, music, philosophy, etc. has serious implications for the place of the US on the global cultural landscape. Not everything is solely financial. A few people who abuse the system, which occurs in the status quo all the same, does not negate rights claims and general economic arguments. Finally, though Con claims that we should not have to pay for others' mistakes, a college education that can be had for free allows those who are trapped in poverty to self-actualize and to be able to contribute to society. So, rather than paying for mistakes, we are investing in human capital. The returns for such, as I have already stated, are huge. Throughout this round, I have argued that education is good both intrinsically and economically, both personally and across society. It leads to better behavior, increased GDP, more innovation, more lives saved, and a higher standard of living. Con has, quite literally, never argued against this. If I have proved the benefits of college education, then I win this round. Conclusion Throughout this round, you have seen a dichotomy in argumentation. On Pro's side, you have seen cogent argumentation and rebuttals; on Con's, you have seen assertions and non sequiturs. I have repeatedly argued that the government philosophically should provide education, that equality of opportunity should be maintained regardless of an individual's characteristics, and that education has myriad benefits. Con has presented many arguments, but they can all basically be summed into the following: there could be some bad apples. This is not responsive to my resolution, as this debate is on the macro scale, and is equally present in status quo; all the resolution changes is the ability of willing and able students to attend college. Thank you very much for this excellent round, and I urge a Pro vote. Sources: 1. http://www.monticello.org... 2. http://www.potsdam.edu... 3. http://www.bls.gov... 4. http://www.jstor.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Healthcare and Education Should Be Free",
            "conclusion": "Healthcare and Education Should Be Free",
            "premise": "Thank you for your argument, Pro. For starters, I would like to something up. For one, when I meant free education, I meant free community colleges/ two-year colleges but not free large colleges or universities that are not small community colleges. Community colleges already are very low-level when compared to other universities but are still a way to get education beyond the K-12 teachings for some people, so, as a safety net, community college should be free for those who need it. Now, I will state my reasons and rebuttals to Con's reasons. Rebuttal #1: Con stated that he/she believed that it would be too expensive to sustain free community college and healthcare. This is wrong, as if countries like North Korea can afford free healthcare and education, then so can we. There are a few things we can do, however, that can make free healthcare and community college/ two-year colleges free. To begin, as previously stated, we can cut military spending, as our military spending is way beyond other country's military spending. USA's military spending still dwarfs other country's spending, and if other countries can have great militaries with lower spending, then we can too. By cutting military and useless spending in the government, reorganizing the tax system to make taxes easier to understand and easier to pay, and by smarter spending, smart spending cuts, and a reorganized tax system, then the U.S. can afford free healthcare and community college without raising taxes through the roof (as countries like Japan that have very low-cost universal healthcare have taxes similar to ours). Rebuttal #2: Con also stated that he/she believed that free healthcare and education could make the quality of education lower. However, this is also not accurate. For starters, I only want free community colleges and two-year colleges, and these colleges are already not the highest quality, so making them only funded by taxes wouldn't affect their quality by to much. K-12 education is already pretty much funded by the government as of now, so the quality of our K-12 education right now is probably not being lowered by the fact that it's essentially free, as many states with free or close to free education have very good education programs. Healthcare, on the other hand, may have lower quality, but there is also a solution to that. Free public healthcare can still be free and available to all and funded by the government (which I believe can be done well if the government can spend and fund smarter). This would act like a safety net for people who cannot pay medical bills and would provide some level of healthcare to everyone. There would then be private healthcare, which would have to be paid for if you want it and would offer higher quality healthcare. This way, we would have free public healthcare with doctors paid for by government funding, which would naturally lower quality, but we would also have private healthcare, which would have to be paid for and would have higher quality. Many doctors today already work for public healthcare that is still have to be paid for and doctors who cannot work or cannot qualify for working in private healthcare can work in public healthcare. You can do this by restricting the number of doctors working in private healthcare in order to have a good supply of doctors working in both private and public healthcare in order to keep the quality of healthcare, and restricting the number of doctors working today is already what the AMA do today. In conclusion, while Con had some good arguments, his/her arguments are not good enough to show that healthcare and community college/ two-year colleges shouldn't be free. To live in a country that does not even freely provide people with their basic rights and standards for living would take way its citizen's dignity.

            "discussionTitle": "Public college education in the United States should be tuition-free.",
            "conclusion": "Public college education in the United States should be tuition-free.",
            "premise": "Thank you for accepting, and hopefully we can have an interesting, lively, and informative debate My first contention is that the government has an obligation to the taxpayer. I will first discuss social contract theory. The government of the United States arouse out of the public signing of a social contract, in which members of society forgo some of their rights as present in the state of nature in order to foster more optimal outcomes for the whole of society. This contract can be most clearly seen through the United States constitution, particularly in the preamble, which promises to \"promote the general welfare.\" These more optimal outcomes can take a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, the enactment of civil rights, the provision of public goods, etc. The government therefore has an obligation to uphold this social contract by fostering more optimal outcomes for the whole of society. I will next discuss the provision of public goods. One important mechanism that upholds the social contract, upholds the public welfare, and creates legitimacy in a government is the provision of public goods. These public goods, like national defense and infrastructure like roads, are necessary for those in a democracy to exercise their natural rights and civil rights as granted by the state. Essentially, these public goods are those that are non-rival and non-excludable, that foster optimal outcomes, and are necessary for rights protection. Education, as will be warranted later, is an important mechanism for citizens to access all of their civil and natural rights, and is unparalleled in fostering the public good, in a multitude of fashions. Therefore, the state has an obligation to its citizens to provide such a good, regardless of cost, practicality, and other factors. However, under the status quo, the word public has taken on another meaning; if you listen carefully, you can hear the social contract tearing. Taxpayers pay for public colleges and universities; yet, due to the nature of colleges now, many cannot access them. This is a direct affront to the idea of \"public\" and a disservice to taxpayers who pay for these colleges. Creating a system paid for by the taxpayer, but that is only accessible by those taxpayers with sufficient funds, is a direct example of the government neglecting its duty to its taxpayers. My second contention concerns equality of opportunity. One of the most important ideas behind the founding documents of the United States, especially the Constitution, is equality of opportunity. While the government does not have an obligation to ensure equal results at the end of the day, it does have a responsible to ensure all citizens have equal access to programs necessary for them to achieve their maximum potential. I will first discuss the idea that the status quo is income-discriminatory. As is common knowledge, a university education in the United States is often grossly expensive, to the point of being prohibitive. Due to this high cost, many of the poor and middle classes are unable to access education fairly. Education is a public good in the United States, indeed, a liberal, Western democracy, one that must be provided to foster governmental legitimacy, because it fosters the public good and allows access to rights. We see this manifested through free, compulsory K-12 education, which is funded by the taxpayers in order to foster the public good. The line between high school and college is arbitrary and dangerous; we see that the government has an obligation to educate its citizenry, but, for some reason, the United States stops this after high school. By continuing this arbitrary distinction and making college tuition extant, the United States is deliberately and tangibly restricting education to those who cannot afford it. Allowing the status quo to continue deliberately and tangibly violates the standard of equality of opportunity, as outlined in the nation\"s founding documents. In fact, this policy of charging tuition encourages inequality by restricting access to an important resource necessary for economic and personal fulfillment. I will next discuss the idea that the status quo tangibly restricts rights. As previously stated, a college education is unattainable for many of the poor and middle classes who seek it due to prohibitive costs. This lack of access is a direct affront to the complete access of first amendment rights and complete engagement in the democratic system. In fact, this lack of education, and its prohibitive cost, is a direct tax on rights and benefits. In order to access economic well-being and rights, as mentioned earlier, citizens must pay this tax. Thus, those who cannot afford a college education are doomed to a lesser economic class and lower personal fulfillment, through no fault of their own. This is unacceptable in the United States, as it deliberately violates various sections of the Constitution and contradict founding principles of the United States. My third contention will concern the importance of education. I will first discuss the private benefits that education can confer. A college education has many benefits to the citizen, benefits that foster public good by increasing the welfare of each citizen that receives this education. These private benefits can, essentially, be grouped into two areas: personal and economic. Personal benefits include the idea that learning, for its own sake, is an important experience; it fosters personal growth, both through responsibility and mental capacity. These benefits foster a sense of happiness and knowledge in the individual citizenry, and accrue into increased happiness, discourse, and even quality of government, across society. The clich\" \"knowledge is power\" is the tagline of this line of thinking; indeed, more education empowers citizens to make responsible decisions and fosters a sense of fulfillment in each person. I will next discuss the idea that, across a society, education has many important impacts, which will be further warranted later. These include increasing the quality of a democracy by fostering knowledge of politics and the electoral system, increasing the quality of life through fostering innovation and technology, and increasing the economic well-being of its citizenry. Another important societal benefit includes decision-making; college educated citizens tend to have higher voter turnout, lower rates of teenage pregnancy and drug use, and higher rates of financial literacy. Since all of these foster more optimal outcomes for citizens, and since education is a public good that provides access to these rights and benefits, the government has an obligation to provide college education. My fourth and final contention concerns economic impacts. I will first discuss innovation. Education fosters innovation through increasing the education and knowledge necessary for technological growth to occur. This has two main impacts: economic growth and increased quality of life. Increasing technology directly results in lives saved, which the government has an obligation to do, and outcomes bettered. This leads to economic growth. Due to this increased innovation, along with the increase in college degrees among both the general populace and among the poor, economic growth will increase. Innovation will lead to an increased GDP per capita by fostering technological jobs that are higher paying and that create products that can demand more from the marketplace. Increasing college degrees generally will lead to higher wages and higher standards of living for the general population. More college degrees among the poor will lead to increased economic equality, thus eliminating deadweight losses and fostering a healthier and more stable economy. I will next discuss the elimination of student-loan bubble. Since a college education is so expensive, many students are forced to take out massive student loans to pay for it. These massive student loans have a negative effect on the economy due to the high rate of default on these loans, due to high interest rates and the inability to liquidate this debt through bankruptcy, in addition to the decreased spending causing by accruing this debt. These lag on the economy, foster deadweight losses, and, thus, create an inefficient economy that remains stagnant and ever on the edge of a \"popping\" of the student loan bubble. For these reasons, public college education in the United States should be tuition-free. I look forward to the Con arguments!",

            "discussionTitle": "Free University Education",
            "conclusion": "Free University Education",
            "premise": "Thank you Pericles :)Cost of universityMy opponent's main argument is that the cost of university disproportionately harms the poor, and hence university education isn't \"generally available and equally accessible to all.\"But that is the reason we have student loans! If one gets a university place, they will almost certainly get a student loan. This means that there is no immediate financial barrier to going to university. No matter if someone is living in poverty, they will be able to go to university because of student loans.Therefore, the statement that free university education is needed to make it available and accessible to all is just not true.'My opponent has stated that college is for only the brightest in our society to do the most cognitively challenging jobs, such as that of a physician, lawyer, architect, etc., while himself admitting that nearly half of people (not sure where he's referring to, though) have attended/are attending/will attend college according to current rates.'I do not contradict myself, because the former is what university should be and what it was designed for, and the latter is what university has actually turned out to be.Until 1997, university was just for those who required specialist education to do the most cognitively challenging jobs, but when Tony Blair became Prime Minister in the UK, he instigated a 'student drive' that wanted 50% of young people to attend university (1).So the concept of university education being the norm is a relatively new one, and it has had negative consequences - namely regarding the over-saturation of the graduate market. There are simply too many graduates.'My opponent has stated that making college free is unfair on those who don't attend college. This is a self-disproving argument, though, as, if college were free, these people who don't attend college would be able to remedy the issue by, you guessed it, going to college. For free.'Well yes, but as I have made very clear, we do not want everyone to go to university! Only 27% of jobs require a degree, so the last thing we need to be doing is encourage everyone to go to university by subsidising it.Value of universityMy opponent argues that those who do drugs and party excessively will be filtered out of the system. I agree with this, but generally those who don't take university seriously are only kicked out at the end of the year (i.e when they fail the year), by that time two things have happened:1. \u00a39000 has been wasted2. From the government's perspective, they have lost one year's worth of tax revenue from a person partying at university instead of working.So, although those who don't take university seriously will eventually be kicked out, it is better to have university fees so:a) They are less likely to attend a university in the first placeb) They will be less likely to waste \u00a39000 if they have to foot the bill.'And countries where college is free generally have a higher population percentage with degrees, so obviously most people don't behave as my opponent has suggested.'The reason for that is simply that more people go to university in countries with free university - I still maintain that more people would use university as a three-year party.Benefits of university?'My opponent has stated that attending an absolutely free university that only serves to widen your options is a bad thing somehow. He seems to believe that this will decrease the size of the pool from which countries draw unskilled labor. It won't. 'Except most graduates don't think like that. If someone has spent three years extra in education, being told they will get a graduate job, they would naturally feel entitled to a graduate job and will often refuse to work in other jobs.Moreover, they would generally only want to work in a job that accords with their degree (for example, a law graduate would only want to work as a lawyer), so instead it seems that a degree actually narrows one's prospects - at least from a psychological perspective.'those who don't manage to land one will just end up doing lower-paying jobs'Even if graduates do decide to do this - if they are just going to go into low-paying jobs eventually then why shouldn't they just go straight into them after high-school? If a graduate doesn't take a graduate job, then the \u00a327000 cost of a university course is essentially wasted.'Plus, these people with low-paying jobs will have a degree that gives them increased potential to advance their status and makes for an educated, intelligent, well-informed populace.'But if these people want to 'advance their status' then they will not be committed to doing the low-paying job they are doing now, also, if people doing low-payed jobs are always looking for a chance to get a better job, then any resembelance of stability will be lost from these industries.Furthermore, those who choose not to go to university are not necessarily less intelligent, educated or well-informed than those who do go to university, as real-world experience often develops wisdom in a more beneficial way than theoretical education does. Evidence for this is how employers generally value experience over qualifications.Universities, on the other hand, only really cater to educate someone in a specific field, instead of the holistic education that is needed for a well-functioning member of society. Moreover, the anarchism that is rife in student communities can even foster a desire to not conform to society.'My opponent says that going to college breeds a sense of entitlement, and that graduates won't want to work low-paying jobs. Some will have to, though, if, as my opponent said, there is only a set number of academic careers.'Or, as is shown by the high-levels of graduate unemployment (2), they will just resort to claiming benefits until their 'dream job' turns up.'This is true, except for people who can't afford to pay for college.'These people do not exist, because there is such a thing as a student loan.'Plus, if education is free, this whole point can be disregarded because *everyone can attend college.* They don't have to stay at a disadvantage if they don't want to.'And we definitely do not want everyone to go to college. Considering that only 27% of jobs require an associate degree, it is economic madness for a government to spend \u00a327000 per person to be educated for a job that likely does not exist.__________________________________________________________________________________________(1) http://www.telegraph.co.uk...(2) http://www.independent.co.uk...",

            "premise": "Alright, let's start. To begin, healthcare and education are fundamental rights that all humans should have, and we should not have to pay for our rights. No human should be uneducated, as education equals knowledge which equals power. Keep in mind that I do not believe that all colleges should be free, but I believe that some community colleges should be free in order to provide some level of education beyond K-12 education for people who cannot afford or qualify for other colleges. Therefore, public education and community colleges should be free so everyone gets to be well-educated without having to worry about about financial drama. Education is right and not a privilege. Secondly, no humans should have to worry about being sick or have to go into financial turmoil because of having to be treated of any serious illness they might get. In 2007, 62 percent of bankruptcies were due to medical bills (http://www.cnn.com...), and many of the people who went into bankruptcy were well-educated, middle-class citizens who could not control the fact that they got an illness for the most part. Nobody should have to worry about getting sick because of financial reasons, especially the uninsured. Therefore, healthcare is also, like education, a right and not a privilege. Sources: http://thelawdictionary.org... http://www.cnn.com... I also believe that our America can afford free healthcare and free education and community colleges. If North Korea can afford free healthcare and education, then we sure can. One way we can make our budget able to afford these things is to cut some military spending. America currently spends more than the next seven countries combined (https://en.wikipedia.org...) (http://pgpf.org...), so, while you can arguably say that our military is, in a way, declining, it is certainly not because of the fact that our budget is too \"small\", but it because we are spending our military budget wrongly. If countries with smaller military budgets than us can have great militaries, then we can cut our military budget and still have a great military as well. Anyways, as long as we cut our military budget and cut wasteful spending, I believe that we can afford and provide free healthcare and community college (sorry for the misleading title, as it said free education, which might lead some people to believe that I mean ALL colleges should be free, which I do not believe in). My idea is that America should have a free public healthcare system, and, if people want better healthcare, they can pay for better private healthcare. Community colleges should be free as well as to expand the concept of having free K-12 AND community college education.",

            "conclusion": "Should there be free college",
            "premise": "It is in within my rights to believe we should not have free college within the United States of America It is a fact the U.S. is in extreme debt, that is fact. However, Colleges and universities being made free, despite what you may be inclined to believe, would actually substantially increase the debt of the U.S. in the best scenario. First off, taking more taxes from rich people comes with many problems. You cannot tax more from just the rich without extreme opposition. You would need to increase taxes in general (which would also bring about extreme opposition). But then, There are better things to use more tax money for, like fore example,starting to pay off national debt, or better yet, fund internal improvements. Either way, I would like to open my paycheck and actually have something in it. Next, 2 to 3 years is not enough to get students a well paying job. 4 years is usually the minimum to get a degree, but to get more well paying jobs, you need more years of education, which in turn would just increase the debt of the USA. And going back on your previous point, Why would anyone want to get rich if they knew after they crossed a certain line thy would get taxed heavily. The point \"More people would be educated which would then create more jobs\" is also false. First of all, it would not create more jobs, only take up more job openings or open small businesses which don't generate lots of revenue quickly. Sure there would be more employment, but that does not lower national debt. The best way to lower national debt is to export goods, have tariffs, and taxes mostly pay schools, police departements, and, yes, colleges, but colleges also rely very heavily on the money students/scholarships pay. Without these, the Colleges would need so much money from the government it would, again, increase the debt. \"More people with more money\" is also a false statement since there is a finite amount of cash value in a country. The only 2 ways to increase a country's wealth is through exporting goods. \"Our debt goes away\" also is an unlikely statement since it would take years, decades even to get rid of this debt. Finally, I would like to point out that more availability to colleges would not mean many more people go. There is a long and tedious process to apply and get accepted into college. Making college free would only mean more people would go for higher education, costing more money, increasing debt, and at the end of it, do you really want to be rich in a country that heavily taxes the rich? Or the envelope of a paycheck being worth more than the contents inside? I don't think so",

            "conclusion": "State Colleges should be free for the students that live in that state",
            "premise": "1) Teaching IndependenceIm not denying that colleges dont teach independence, I was challenging your statement that \"College is supposed to teach young adults to be independent\" by arguing the main purpose of college is to teach people careers, not to be a 4 hour sleep-away camp....\"It is an all-around experience that everyone should get to have.\"College isn't a ride at Disney, its a privilege! College is a decision that an individual makes to undergo 4 more years of school to specialize in a career of your choice. College is an investment and a commitment, its not a right that everyone deserves and should be given a free shot at. 2) In State Recruiting\" I stated that only the tuition would be free\"Um, Bullsh*t, This whole debate has been about free education, free college, no expenses, free free free.... \"With all of these expenses put together, the schools would have enough funding to be run properly.\"A) Tuition still makes up the bulk of most college expenses so if you make that free then you still are putting a massive financial burden on schools, oh wait, on taxpayers...B) Cutting Tuition and nothing else would still prevent people from being able to apply to college since it wouldnt be \"free\" anymoreC) So the one thing you want to cut from colleges to help people afford an education........... Is the cost to finance the education........... Do you see how that might be a little counter productive?That being said, the massive number of primarily in-state recruiting among schools would place a massive burden on college's quality of bettering individuals. So under free college, or free tuition (whichever the Pro is going for now) both the taxpayers and the students would be taking a hit. 3) Students dont always make it. The Pro admits that many people would not be able to make it through college through separation anxiety, poor work ethic, bad grades, etc. but the Pro tries to show this isnt a problem is by saying that \"For some people, yes college is too hard and they end up dropping out. And if this be the case, that person would pay the government the money that the tuition was for the time they spent at college\"So college tuition would be completely free, but if they fail they have to PAY FOR IT? That would send families of unfortunate souls straight into debt they would never be able to get out of! Imagine if honest kids just couldnt make ends meet and now he had to live the rest of his life knowing he single handedly put his entire family into debt because of his mistakes..... \"This would give the person a reason to keep their grades up and work hard\" Its also a good reason to kill themselves or their whole families if they fail. Threatening to throw people under a guillotine doesnt guarantee performance, it sparks fear in them that they would have their whole lives in college. imagine if you knew that one bad grade could determine if your family gets to stay in the middle class or becomes part of a statistic for poverty level that you yourself caused....4) Education and the Economy The Pro keeps saying how if college is free it will give us an edge over China, and rather than tear into that argument Ill re-state my point that there are other ways we can improve education that does not involve forcing tax payers to spend an enormous amount of money on taxes on something that is a privilege, not a right. - 1 - Increasing funding into high schools, which are already paid for by taxpayers, would be a good start because the reason education is lagging isnt just from students not having a chance, Americans are flat out dumber than most other students, and so the problem of increasing brains may lie in high school, not college. - 2 - One of the biggest problems American education has is that it has to integrate more than other European or Asian school programs do. America has a hell of an immigration issue where people from all over the WORLD with different backgrounds and different native tongues have to be integrated into the school system. - 3 - We should be looking how to make education more effective and get a better result for the same cost instead of just through money at the problem like a buffoon...It could even cause problems in the system - 4 - Colleges might not strive to get better if now they only have to raise acceptance rates to get oodles of government/taxpayer funds - 5 - Tuition rates are always rising, and if the government is funding ALL of it, then tuition rates might keep increasing and it would affect taxpayers and the government debt alike, its not guaranteed that tuition rates would stay at a fixed rate, and if the government tried to make it that way there would be war between colleges and the government over funding, something that we simply could not afford, literally. - 6 - Lets face it, taxpayers would be PISSEDThere are healthier alternatives to raising education without recklessly pumping billions of dollars into the already flawed system, education should be made more effective not just bigger. 5) Unequal opportunityThe point of the example was that schools may give out-of-state applications a bigger value than in-state applications if funding was suddenly cut off. The out of state applicant would pay money directly to the school, whereas the in school applicant would have money go through the government first, and that could raise a boatload of issues if the government decided to use those funds for other programs....With out of state applicants, money is guaranteed, for in state applications, that is not the case, and that could give colleges a hell of a reason to focus on out of state recruiting and forgo in state recruiting..6) TaxesHell yea taxes would be increased, it could be argued that taxes would have to be raised to over 60% and american families already fight tooth and nail to keep taxes low there is no telling what people would do if their tax rate doubled or tripled to fund education for someone who might not even make it. Even if the college was prestigious or not the cost of adding up all the current tuitions from every university and every college and every community college and every prep school and everything else in between divided by the number of people who actually pay taxes would drive the middle class into the ground.State colleges (or state tuition, i dont even know what it is anymore) should not be made free. It will raise taxes to extortionate levels, its a really poorly conceived way to gain an edge over other countries, there are far better ways we could be improving education, PEOPLE OFTEN DONT MAKE IT, Colleges may be forced to give lower qualities of education to cope with the loss of funding, the government may end up using the funds designated for colleges on other programs, students may major in stuff that isnt even useful, And most importantly......College isnt a right, it is a privilege, and American families shouldnt be forced to pay 60% to give high school graduates a chance at college if its not even guaranteed that those same people will make it or if the government or even if colleges, people, and the government alike are fighting constantly over who gets how much funding and who has to pay for it...",
