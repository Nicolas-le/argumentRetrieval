            "premise": "I would like to use this round to refute my opponents attempts to attack my arguments. She says as one of her first arguments this round that, \"Most schools don't have band or art classes, they may have music class which has to do with mostly the instrument The Recorder.\" This is woefully inaccurate. The choir from my high school (uniformed) was the North Dakota Governor's Choir 2 years in a row. Also, I see no factual basis for this proclamation. I know in my hometown, all 4 major high schools as well as the 3 middle schools all have art classes and extracurricular activities for those who want them. It is not true that there is not art classes that students can take. Even if there are only what my opponent would consider \"sufficient creative opportunities\" in one school in the country the Con side prevails. She states, \"Students of any school in the country should not have to wear [uniform].\" By using the word \"any\" my opponent has shown that if a uniform would work for one school, the con would win the debate. She goes on to say \"most schools don't have band or art classes.\" Implying that some do. Therefore, the argument of students being able to express themselves different ways than in dress prevails. Secondly, my opponent asserts that \"most students don't have many friends because they don't know who their TRUE, FULL, personalities.\" This implies she thinks that it is difficult to make friends at school if you wear a uniform. I can say from personal experience that it is not. I met some of my best friends in a school where we were required to wear uniforms. I disagree personally on this point, the Pro still seems to be working off her stereotype of uniformed students as nerdy goody two shoes style students, this isn't true. Thirdly, by my opponent's second paragraph I assume she was saying something along the lines of \"students may feel self conscious while wearing the uniforms.\" School uniforms are not designed to be looked at, therefore taking the problem of distracting clothing out of the classroom. For this specific reason people are less likely to feel self conscious about how they look, because everyone looks the same. My opponent also states, \"It is safer to keep all students shirts tucked in so no gang members are able to hide any weapons such as knifes,guns, ect.\" I agree and this was a point I made in my constructive, see video above. Fourthly, my opponent very clearly concedes that most students aren't judged on what they wear, therefore her point about wearing clothes as self expression becomes weak, seeing as no body notices anyway. In short I have refuted my opponents contentions. My opponent has made no effort to attack my contention about the economy and has conceded on the point that uniforms make for a safer school environment. I urge a Con vote.",

            "premise": "I accept this debate. I will be taking the Con side (students should not have to to wear uniform). Firstly, uniforms restricts a student's individuality and identity. Forcing students to wear uniforms constricts their creativity and freedom of expression. Clothes do not detract from a student's ability to learn. School uniforms are completely unnecessary. Secondly, people tend to believe that if everyone is wearing the same clothing, it will decrease the chances of getting bullied for what you wear, but this is totally not the case. Bullying is a huge problem that effects many students whether they are in schools that require uniform or not. Forcing children to wear the same uniform does not make issues such as this magically disappear. Schools want children to make good decisions and take responsibility for their actions, but how can we expect the children to do so if we do not give them decisions to make in the first place?",

            "premise": "sorry for the miss, but here goes 1. the expression of students via clothing style & colors is something students can do after school. the argument is that during scholling hours lets not create layers of priorities that compete with the learning of the child, there are other avenues that students can productively express themselves creatively during school time 2. to the contrary school uniform even the playing field enabling socioeconomic status not to be an issue as regards to a students learning potential. moreso school uniforms equalize students and clearly reinforce the american constitution by saying we are all equal nomatter how financial positions, we can all learn & we can all be something in life irregardof our finances 3. fashion shows that students do in non-uniform schools trying to compete with each ther are an unecessary distraction to learning 4. by saying robots u are implying that uniforms stifle creativity but Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, both extremely intelligent men, grew up wearing uniforms to school. Proof enough that wearing uniforms dont stifle creativity or make people roots but actually help students to learn and not to indulge in distracting fashion shows. 5. in non-uniform schools student wear their own clothes now this means the cloths wear & tear faster as they are used more often meaning you have to replace your childrens clothing more. so having 2 pairs of uniform to wear for the whole year is cheaper, simple economics. additionally 1. school uniforms teaches students about being professional and prepares them for an adult world. People in the business world wear a uniform of sorts every day; can you imagine a court of law where the judge was wearing a sloppy t-shirt or jeans with their underwear showing. Uniforms set a tone to the atmosphere and a behavioral expectation. Students should be encouraged to dress for school just like they would if they were working at a job. 2. institutions in the world have dress codes, even schools that dont wear uniforms have dress codes. it becomes a nightmare to enforce such a dress code in non-uniform schools taking valuable time better spent on teaching.",

            "premise": "Ladies and gentlemen, Though it is my first time debating in this website, Fear not! For I have experienced debating. I will try my best to rebut or post my argument in due time since I am having technical issues (don't ask me why) Anyhow, Let us begin. First, Let me define what a school uniform is. There is a difference between a dress code and a uniform. According to a scholar, This scholar said that a uniform can be called as a uniform if: > It serves the purpose of representing the school, > Suppresses individuality; > Proves legitimacy by exposing the student's position. Okay, Sure, I agree with the fact that they can express and it \"becomes easier\" for students whenever they go to school, But, Here is where your point slips up. Let me tell you the benefits of wearing a uniform: - EQUALITY - SCHOOL SPIRIT - DISCIPLINE > It supports discipline (not on a strict level) > It makes the student proud of the school they are in (because the school's emblem is imprinted in the uniform) > It improves school spirit > Promotes healthy relationships within student-teachers > Promotes individual self-expression > Reduces expulsions/suspensions > Decreased vandalism and crime > Increased chance of staying in school, Commitment to learn and much more. > Helps in repressing students to buy trendy clothes To make you understand better, Let me answer this through a Q and A: Q: School uniforms prevents students from expressing themselves A: So what? If they can't express themselves through their appearance then they can express themselves through other ways. Q: School uniforms does not decrease bullying and can increase violent attacks A: That is the reason why there are rules and regulations for this. And detention. And counseling. And expulsion. And many Q: School uniforms = Too tight/too loose A: Again, So what? If that's the case, Then a solution to this would be to create a system in which before school starts, Parents can adjust and measure the size of the uniform they need. Now, For the rebuttal: If there was no school uniform. . . . . . It would push students to wear trendy clothes or which are inappropriate. . . . School spirit would decrease . . . It will increase the likelihood of rape or sexual harassment . . . Rich families will make their children (or the children themselves decides) to wear expensive clothing, Which the financially challenged families can't, Causing competition. Dear audiences, If we were to implement the so called \"no school uniforms\", Schools would look like picnic grounds with actual students walking around. However, In order to solve the problem being \"expressing yourself\", Then simply just make it so that maybe at the last week or maybe the school can add events where students can wear their own attire. Henceforth, Whether it be with no school uniforms or yes school uniforms, The best answer here would be that YES SCHOOL UNIFORMS as it has already been implemented throughout the globe around the 1600's when it hit the historical records. This is one of the reason why my case stands better, Because of the mere fact that up until now, Uniforms are still being worn and used. Now, Tell me your specifics why there should be no school uniforms. Tell me who that writer you were talking about and when he/she stated that statement. My case is better and should be voted upon.",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for starting this debate, and I hope to change her opinion before the debate is done. I would like to take three main points and end by rebutting some of my opponent's points. First I would like to discuss the sense of unity that comes with a uniform. Second I would like to discuss the economic benefits of a school uniform. Thirdly I would like to discuss the social benefits of a school uniform. Let me start out by saying that I went to a school with a required uniform code. The uniform served as a common point of discussion between all students. Whether you were a Freshman, Senior, boy, or girl, you followed the uniform code. Everyone wearing the same uniform made the student body feel more connected. Secondly, with less time spent getting ready in the morning students have time to get more sleep and be more prepared for class in the morning. Second is the economic benefit. Parents especially in inner-city schools do not have the money to spend on expensive designer clothes for school. 3 sets of school uniform can be bought for around $70, around the same as a hoodie from Abercrombie and Fitch. [1] Parents in tough financial situations should not be forced to buy different clothes for their children for every day of the week. Thirdly I would like to talk about the social benefits of a uniform. First and foremost, it decreases teasing. Students are constantly teased because they don't wear the right clothes. Since this takes clothes out of the equation more groups can coexist without bullying. Secondly, It decreases gang allegiance as well. If gangs cannot show their colors, it eases tensions because no one knows their gang affiliation. Also it decreases school violence this [2] video, though a little extreme shows the benefits of having students tuck in their shirts. Intruders to the school are also easier to spot if everyone is in uniform. \"Students of any school in the country should not have to wear because it's taking freedom of expression.\" My opponent seems to be under the assumption that dress is the only way to express ones self. I disagree 100%. I would say that is almost insignificant. At my school, we were extremely creative and able to express ourselves through the arts, and music. There are plenty of other ways to express your individuality. \"I'm a dull student that isn't allowed to wear what I want, however I want it.\" My opponent is using the stereotype that students who wear uniforms are uptight and dull. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have classmates who skydive, scuba dive, and drive stock cars. Not being allowed to wear what we want in class does not, make us dull. \"Most students don't like the way they look in the uniform...\" I would like to disagree with this from personal experience, I really liked my uniform. I wore a white button-up, red tie, navy sweater vest and khaki pants for most of my high school career. I really liked the way I looked in that uniform (probably where I got my fondness for sweater vests). Of my class mates I talked to, most of them said they did not mind the way the uniform looks. Because of the class unity, economic effects, and social benefits of uniforms, as well as the facts that uniformed students have other ways to express creativity, and are not dull I urge a Con vote.

            "premise": "Hello, everyone, welcome to this debate. Today I would like to debate in affirmation of the topic that students should be required to wear school uniform. My first justification is that it creates an orderly, organized atmosphere which enforces discipline. My second argument is that it eliminates part of the popularity system. And my last argument is that it generates revenue for the government. Although this has no solid, tangible evidence, it is true that having uniforms creates an organized and orderly atmosphere. It is no secret that private schools and schools of high ranking all require their students to wear uniforms. When students are required to wear uniforms, discipline is in action. And discipline constitutes good education. A subpoint of this argument is that it gives the wearer a sense of honor and pride to wear such a uniform. My next point of analysis is that this eliminates the popularity system. Go to any school, and you could be sure to find some sort of clique or group ruling the school, or at least a complex system of factions. This is inevitable. And one of the main causes of this is fashion. At the initial first day of school everyone is at square one. No one knows no one, and there is no popularity system. So how does people know who's going to be popular, and who to be friends with? The first reactions is to look at their clothes. Do they dress nice? Do they wear this brand? Once a group of girls have established a clique, there is already a system of clans and gangs beginning to form. The remedy to this phenomenon is to eliminate a cause of popularity, fashion, by making uniform-wearing mandatory. Only this way will people consider others for who they really are, not by their clothes. My last contention is that this generates revenue for the government. When the uniforms are sold to the students, they have to pay taxes, which therefore generates funds for the government. This might seem pretty minimal compared to other revenue-earning tactics, but consider this: thousands of schools across the country, with hundreds of students flooding the campus every year, selling uniforms. After a decade or so, we would have cleared a significant portion of our national debt while giving leeway to other fund-needing programs. To sum it all up, my three main assertions are that: uniforms create a sense of conduct, uniforms eliminate the complex popularity system in schools, and lastly, uniforms generate significant revenue for the government. Thank you.",

            "premise": "Students of any school in the country should not have to wear because it's taking freedom of expression. Yes, expressing your style can be made in different ways such as the hair. If you're expressing yourself through your hair then that's not really ALL of what you want to express. Most schools that do have uniforms deny to let the average student wear a different color from the uniform such as a hat,scarf's,bows, ect. Most students don't like the way they look in the uniform and most parents accept the idea because it saves money on school clothes and cost less during school supplies shopping. Most students have said, \"The uniforms take the expression from students.\" , \"Uniforms should be worn because no one would judge on what each other wear because everyone would be wearing the same thing.\" Students have spoken for themselves. And it is true that many students will judge each other on what they wear, but it doesn't matter. Uniforms are a way of saying, \"I'm a dull student that isn't allowed to wear what I want, however I want it.\" Uniforms take away that expression of your own personality, who you are, if you take that from a student then most won't be who they really are because they're afraid to either be made fun of for sticking out of the crowd, or breaking the rules but most don't' care about the rules. Uniforms take away who your are and should not be worn to schools.",

            "conclusion": "Private Schools Should Have Their Students Wear Uniforms",
            "premise": "My opponent violated my rule that first round was for acceptance, and therefore loses conduct points. My Arguments 1. Uniforms may increase a student\u2019s self esteem because they do not have to worry constantly to be better dressed than those around them. [1] Many kids are discouraged by the fact that they don't own, or cannot afford some of the clothing other kids can. Uniforms put all kids at the same level, and takes that much more stress off the students that cannot afford the latest \"fashion\". [2] By implementing uniforms confidence is boosted and negative peer pressure is eliminated. Over 75% of schools that implemented school uniforms noticed a drop in peer pressure. [3] 2. Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted. Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the classroom, especially if you are bored. Kids always want to know what others are wearing and even judge other students over it. Uniforms eliminate this problem and helps kids to stay focused in class. 3. Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\". [4] This togetherness helps to eliminate division among students at the school and reduces bullying; giving a sense of community is beneficial to the mental well being of a student. [5] 4. Uniforms help the school faculty to quickly identify who is part of the school and in the end could actually help in keeping strangers and potentially dangerous people off the campus. This helps to make students feel safer at school. School uniforms may also eliminate gang and clique symbols bringing about a feeling of safety and togetherness. Safety is very important when increasing the amount of students who enroll in a school. 5. Bullies like to pick on kids who are lesser than them, and therefore tend to pick on kids who do not wear quality or popular clothes. [6]By implementing school uniforms this problem is solved. School uniforms encourage discipline through neatness, order, and equality among students. [6] 6. School uniforms encourage creative forms of self expression. Since students lose the ability to express themselves in certain ways through the clothes they were, they will be more likely to express themselves through things such as their personality, academic performance, clubs, and sports. It pushes students to put themselves out there. 7. School uniforms reduce violence and student behavioral problems. [7] Long Beach, California District School held a study comparing violence and behavioral problem rates among students before and after uniforms were implemented. In the five years following the implementation of school uniforms there was an 86% drop in violent assaults. Vandalism cases dropped from 1409 to 106. [8] The U.S. Department of Education also found that school crime decreased 36%, sexual offenses decreased 74%, and fights between students dropped 51% after school uniforms were implemented.[13] Almost 80% schools that implemented school uniforms noticed an improvement in student discipline. [9] Schools that implemented school uniforms also showed to have a higher graduation rate and attendance rate than schools without school uniforms. [11] [12] School uniforms have helped improve schools, as emphasized by one study that finds that \u201cvarious benefits to wearing uniforms were reported, including decreases in discipline, gang involvement and bullying; and increases in safety, eases of going to school, confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, school police data showed a 63 percent reduction in police log reports during the first year of implementation. Other decreases were noted in reports of gang-related activities and student fights, along with graffiti, property damage, battery and administrative assist. \u201c[10] Contentions Forfeiting the ability to wear whatever you want certainly does not outweigh all of the good that is achieved through uniforms. As you can see in the arguments I presented, every individual argument for having students wear uniforms certainly outweighs a student not being able to wear what they want. In addition, I argued that by implementing school uniforms it focuses on kids being able to self identify themselves through other means, such as through personality and hobbies. My opponent states that if kids do not wear their own clothes they will be more likely to be made fun of for things like their personality. Cutting down on bullying through controllable factors is key. A controllable factor in this case would be implementing uniforms and doing away with free dress. However, people who bully others for uncontrollable factors cannot be stopped, such as bullying someone for how they look or their personality. The problem then, rests in focusing on bullying and eliminating it more than it focuses on eliminating factors that cause bullying. In the end, the bully is the problem, not the factors that cause bullying. [1] http://everydaylife.globalpost.com... [2] http://www.eduguide.org... [3] https://www.dickies.com...

            "premise": "My opponent has failed to recognize that private schools have the right to institute their own rules, and do so without permission or thoughts from the parents. My opponent\u2019s response to my arguments is similar, and mine will be also. My opponent entirely misses the point; he ignores the argument itself and instead responds with \u201cthat should be the decision of so-and-so.\u201d By completely dodging the argument itself, he has essentially dropped the argument, and decided to argue something irrelevant to the topic at hand. The resolution isn\u2019t that parents should have an active rule in making decisions with/for private schools. The resolution is that private schools should have school uniforms implemented. 1. Your response is irrelevant to my argument. I argued student equality and self-esteem in this section and you responded that patrons should be able to decide whether they send a student to a school that has uniforms. Implementing school uniforms institutes a controlled environment that helps take pressure off of children. 2. It doesn\u2019t matter what the parents decide, or what the parents do about it. The fact remains that implementing school uniforms that free dress clothing is a potential distraction to students, and it\u2019s a benefit to have that distraction removed via uniform implementation. 3. It is irrelevant what the parents and students want. This is a private school, and private schools have the sole power over any rules they decide to implement. Implementing uniforms eliminates a variable that is prone to bullying, which can therefore reduce bullying and victims. If bullying continues this time focused on a different variable, the problem lies within the bullies themselves and not any variables that are prone to being victim by bullies. At that point, schools should take action to eliminate bullying itself. In addition, your argument doesn\u2019t even apply to how uniforms provide a sense of community, which is psychologically beneficial to students. 4. I am arguing that it is worth it, and that this is one of the several benefits uniforms provide. All of these benefits provide justification that schools implement school uniforms. 5. Same as three. 6. Again, it does not matter what families think; private schools exercise the sole power to implement any rules they want. You did not respond to the argument itself, and have therefore dropped the argument. 7. Again, its not about what parents think. The Long Beach study had every student in the district wear uniforms for years. This means that schools of all sorts had to have their students wear uniforms. Other than that, you have done nothing to refute the statistics I have presented showing that uniforms help to prevent student behavioral problems. This debate isn\u2019t about what families think they need for their children; it is about private schools implementing a policy that is overall good for the well being of students as a whole. Private schools have the right to institute many rules that public schools cannot, including the ability to implement school uniforms.",

            "premise": "My Arguments 1. Uniforms may increase a student\u2019s self esteem because they do not have to worry constantly to be better dressed than those around them. [1] Many kids are discouraged by the fact that they don't own, or cannot afford some of the clothing other kids can. Uniforms put all kids at the same level, and takes that much more stress off the students that cannot afford the latest \"fashion\". [2] By implementing uniforms confidence is boosted and negative peer pressure is eliminated. Over 75% of schools that implemented school uniforms noticed a drop in peer pressure. [3] 2. Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted. Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the classroom, especially if you are bored. Kids always want to know what others are wearing and even judge other students over it. Uniforms eliminate this problem and helps kids to stay focused in class. 3. Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\". [4] This togetherness helps to eliminate division among students at the school and reduces bullying; giving a sense of community is beneficial to the mental well being of a student. [5] 4. Uniforms help the school faculty to quickly identify who is part of the school and in the end could actually help in keeping strangers and potentially dangerous people off the campus. This helps to make students feel safer at school. School uniforms may also eliminate gang and clique symbols bringing about a feeling of safety and togetherness. Safety is very important when increasing the amount of students who enroll in a school. 5. Bullies like to pick on kids who are lesser than them, and therefore tend to pick on kids who do not wear quality or popular clothes. [6]By implementing school uniforms this problem is solved. School uniforms encourage discipline through neatness, order, and equality among students. [6] 6. School uniforms encourage creative forms of self expression. Since students lose the ability to express themselves in certain ways through the clothes they were, they will be more likely to express themselves through things such as their personality, academic performance, clubs, and sports. It pushes students to put themselves out there. 7. School uniforms reduce violence and student behavioral problems. [7] Long Beach, California District School held a study comparing violence and behavioral problem rates among students before and after uniforms were implemented. In the five years following the implementation of school uniforms there was an 86% drop in violent assaults. Vandalism cases dropped from 1409 to 106. [8] The U.S. Department of Education also found that school crime decreased 36%, sexual offenses decreased 74%, and fights between students dropped 51% after school uniforms were implemented.[13] Almost 80% schools that implemented school uniforms noticed an improvement in student discipline. [9] Schools that implemented school uniforms also showed to have a higher graduation rate and attendance rate than schools without school uniforms. [11] [12] School uniforms have helped improve schools, as emphasized by one study that finds that \u201cvarious benefits to wearing uniforms were reported, including decreases in discipline, gang involvement and bullying; and increases in safety, eases of going to school, confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, school police data showed a 63 percent reduction in police log reports during the first year of implementation. Other decreases were noted in reports of gang-related activities and student fights, along with graffiti, property damage, battery and administrative assist. \u201c[10] [1] http://everydaylife.globalpost.com...

This is simply false. The problem here is that many people assume that once you have to wear a uniform everybody immediately because mindless drones that all act the same. True individuality comes from personality, beliefs, and even minor accessories such as wrist bands, earring, hair styles, ect. which are all still allowed. The argument that students lose their individuality is completely overrated and isn\u2019t reason enough to deny all that exponentially great benefits school uniforms give. \u201cSome parents also worry that when the freedom to express themselves through their wardrobe is removed, kids will resort to more extreme forms of expression like piercings and tattoos.\u201d Correlation does not equal causation. There is no empirical and logical evidence to suggest that students will go to extreme measures to express themselves when they must conform to school uniforms so the statement can be dismissed. \u201cKids need to learn to accept and celebrate each other\"s differences, up to and including the way that different cultures dress.\u201d That\u2019s great and all but that\u2019s not how it is. Uniforms solve problems that arise from the inability to be accepting of others, in addition to some other things. \u201cSome religions have strict rules about what is and is not considered acceptable dress, and school uniforms may not always fall in line with those religious requirements.\u201d The benefits of uniforms completely outweigh this very rare case. \u201cFor some parents, being able to purchase clothing at the beginning of the school year that adheres to the uniform code is a financial relief.\u201d Indeed. \u201cbeing forced to purchase specific clothing infringes upon their kids\" right to a free education\u201d Lolwut [1] http://www.unr.edu...",

            "conclusion": "Private Schools Should Have Their Students Wear Uniforms",
            "premise": "My opponent violated my rule that first round was for acceptance, and therefore loses conduct points. My Arguments 1. Uniforms may increase a student\u2019s self esteem because they do not have to worry constantly to be better dressed than those around them. [1] Many kids are discouraged by the fact that they don't own, or cannot afford some of the clothing other kids can. Uniforms put all kids at the same level, and takes that much more stress off the students that cannot afford the latest \"fashion\". [2] By implementing uniforms confidence is boosted and negative peer pressure is eliminated. Over 75% of schools that implemented school uniforms noticed a drop in peer pressure. [3] 2. Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted. Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the classroom, especially if you are bored. Kids always want to know what others are wearing and even judge other students over it. Uniforms eliminate this problem and helps kids to stay focused in class. 3. Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\". [4] This togetherness helps to eliminate division among students at the school and reduces bullying; giving a sense of community is beneficial to the mental well being of a student. [5] 4. Uniforms help the school faculty to quickly identify who is part of the school and in the end could actually help in keeping strangers and potentially dangerous people off the campus. This helps to make students feel safer at school. School uniforms may also eliminate gang and clique symbols bringing about a feeling of safety and togetherness. Safety is very important when increasing the amount of students who enroll in a school. 5. Bullies like to pick on kids who are lesser than them, and therefore tend to pick on kids who do not wear quality or popular clothes. [6]By implementing school uniforms this problem is solved. School uniforms encourage discipline through neatness, order, and equality among students. [6] 6. School uniforms encourage creative forms of self expression. Since students lose the ability to express themselves in certain ways through the clothes they were, they will be more likely to express themselves through things such as their personality, academic performance, clubs, and sports. It pushes students to put themselves out there. 7. School uniforms reduce violence and student behavioral problems. [7] Long Beach, California District School held a study comparing violence and behavioral problem rates among students before and after uniforms were implemented. In the five years following the implementation of school uniforms there was an 86% drop in violent assaults. Vandalism cases dropped from 1409 to 106. [8] The U.S. Department of Education also found that school crime decreased 36%, sexual offenses decreased 74%, and fights between students dropped 51% after school uniforms were implemented.[13] Almost 80% schools that implemented school uniforms noticed an improvement in student discipline. [9] Schools that implemented school uniforms also showed to have a higher graduation rate and attendance rate than schools without school uniforms. [11] [12] School uniforms have helped improve schools, as emphasized by one study that finds that \u201cvarious benefits to wearing uniforms were reported, including decreases in discipline, gang involvement and bullying; and increases in safety, eases of going to school, confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, school police data showed a 63 percent reduction in police log reports during the first year of implementation. Other decreases were noted in reports of gang-related activities and student fights, along with graffiti, property damage, battery and administrative assist. \u201c[10] Contentions Controllable Factors vs. Uncontrollable Factors My opponent brings up that since uniform implementation eliminates the bully\u2019s ability to focus on things like your clothes, they may instead bully someone for something they cannot control like their personality or how they look. This is not a problem of school uniforms. The problem rests in the bullies, not uniform implementation. By eliminating free dress, bullies cannot attack someone for a controllable factor, which would be what clothes they wear. Eliminating it has a plethora of other benefits but one is that it beings all students on the same level to eliminate this form of controllable factor bullying. Uncontrollable factor bullying however, can never be stopped. That sort of bullying would mean that bullies will always find a way to bully someone, even if all controllable factors are eliminated. At this point, the problem rests in the bullies and not by any other external means. If bullying gets that bad it is up to the school to put a stop to it the central problem, which again would be the bullies and not any external factor that may be a victim to bullying. Takes Away Creativity This is a small price to pay for the plethora of benefits that uniforms create. In addition, by implementing uniforms students are forced to be able to express themselves in different ways, whether it be through personality, clubs, or other things. In addition, private schools gain no benefit from allowing students free dress, but they do benefit from having students wear uniforms. [1] http://everydaylife.globalpost.com...

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for posting an interesting debate. My opponent says that students should not be forced to wear uniforms because if violates the first amendment. This is not true. Schools are either privately run or government run institutions that have the primary function to teach students about well rounded subjects such as mathematics, science, history and so forth. When you attend school you lose several of your rights. For example, the 2nd amendment states that all citizens should have to right to bear arms. Should students be able to carry guns on campus based on the second amendment? Are high schools violating our rights? Are Jr.high schools violating our rights? Of course not. The first amendment also gives us the right to say just about anything we want, does that mean I can go around a school and use derogatory terms when speaking to people of different races, genders, and sexual orientation? I may be allowed to use the word, N*gger, K*ke, and F*ggot on the streets and it would be a violation of my rights as an American if I were forced to stop but in a school it shouldn't be tolerated and teachers have every right to punish me for using such language. In conclusion many of our rights as citizens are curtailed when we enroll in the public and private institutions of schools who enact and enforce certain policies to make schools have an effective learning environment. I claim that schools need to have uniforms to instill good discipline in students. It makes students look proffesional and forces them to take good care of their uniform as if it were their work clothes. When students are forced to take responsibility of how they look they look more proffesional. When students dress proffesionally and conservatively they tend to be more focused in school and perform better. I agree that students can experience bullying at schools with uniforms. That I acknowledge, but the Pros outweigh the Cons regarding forcing students to wear school uniforms.",

First, if students have to wear the same thing as everyone else, then there is no way to express your personality. Your clothes are a way to show who you are to others. Next, this would be another thing to buy. People will say that you will not have to buy as many outfits, but although you do not wear these clothes to school, you still need clothes to wear around town and at home. You buy clothes as it is, so why not get more use out them before you outgrow them. You will never wear your uniform after you're done with school, so why not pay for clothes that you can re wear over sand over again. Also, some people may feel restricted and uncomfortable in these outfits that they are forced into. Everyone has a different body shape and type. Why should we force everyone to look and dress the same? Some people also say that clothes can distract students from learning, but if they are uncomfortable in the uniforms, they will not learn. We should allow student to dress in clothes that they are comfortable in. Lastly, I believe that it can draw away from school spirit. If you have to wear uniforms, you cannot wear a specific outfit with your sports team. You do not have the option to show team spirit when you are forced to wear the same outfit as everyone else. I believe that there are some pros to having uniforms, but the cons outweigh them. Your clothing is a way to express yourself and is a freedom that should not be taken away from you.",

            "premise": "kids should be allowed to express themselves in school. If they are not allowed some amount of self expression now it will come out later, usually much more forcefully than had they been allowed some freedom as children. Not everyone person needs to be shoved into the same box. We do not all fit just one mold. We should learn to celebrate the differnces in each other. This is the lesson that should be taught to our children. Not that everyone should be the same. I want my children to be who they are, Not cookie cutters. wearing uniform is NOT important wearing uniform is not important because almost all the kids dont like uniform because they could get bullyed for wearing them and by NOT wearing them they could express them self They are a waste. What are uniforms for exactly? To keep us safe? Clothing doesn't make you safe. It doesn't change anything from crimes ot theft at school. Uniforms are bland and are just useless! They cost money and for what? Students don't change their behaviour because of what they wear. Well, uniforms has its ups and down but really? Uniforms? What's the use! i think that we deserve some indivuiality in school. They are saying that if we wear clothes it changes who we are. The schools thinks that if we have uniforms then we will be better in schooling. Really, as soon as school lets out we will be right back in our designer or play clothes. Teachers and school boards should really worry about education. Are parents are in charge of us, not the school. Who agrees with me, let your voice be heard! No! Students should be allowed to express themselves with parental vision. Parents need to be more active in the child's schooling. And should not allow their child to wear offensive clothing. It's not the public schools fault the type of clothing that their students are allowed to wear. Having uniforms will not make everyone equal. It will not stop bullies and gang violence. Uniforms will gives false security. For example, a child with an lower society meets a child with an higher society. The child in the lower society will still feel the same with or without uniforms. And the uniforms may even complicate the child's (lower society) feelings for the child in the higher society. Besides, there are still other ways to ostracize a student by their clothing. Also, in the real world we don't wear uniforms. And that goes for most professions. Then there's also a conflict of who will pay for the students uniforms will it be the school or the parents. Students should NOT wear school uniforms Students have a right to be an individual. Our gov officials do not have a right to tell our students what to wear. NO! Students should express themselfs and in the Buisness world uniforms arnt really required! no they are not there style students should have there own style and not wear uniforms that are so not them they should express there feelings as someone choosing what they should be cause no one should choose for them cause its someone not them and is not fair no uniforms they feel uncomfotable uniforms should only be used in work or something like that they are uncomfortable and some r expensive so no school uniforms Uniforms are rarely need in the Business world Uniforms are anachronistic compared to the daily live of an average worker. Very few jobs require uniforms. Most jobs that do are low paying service work. We don't want to have kids aim for that. Why should we wear uniform if our main role models-teachers-don't? Realistic preparation I do not think students should wear uniforms, cause it gives them a false sense of even opportunities. While that may be the case in school, it would not motivate poorer students to try harder since they won't have the same financial backing with their rich counterparts. no i think students should not be forced to wear uniforms. i feel that students wants to express thereself and show off thier own creativity.i also think that students will not feel comfortable in something they don't want to wear because they may think its uguly,or baggy or something like that. I am against school uniforms, because the stifle creativity and self expression. I am against school uniforms. I believe children need to be able to express themselves as much as possible as they are trying to figure out who they want to be in this world. Clothing is a big part of self-image and identity and should not be stifled. I think it is a better idea to just ban overly revealing clothing and blatant gang colors and aside from that, let the kids be who they are. I oppose the school uniform because we are not Nazi Germany; we should not force students to dress the same. We were born as individuals and should go to school and wear different clothing that represents us as individuals. If everyone wears the same thing, where is the freedom? It will be like a prison where everyone wears orange all the time and cannot question the authority. I will fight school boards who try to do this to children. We are a free country and this should not happen in the United States of America. Each of us is unique and different and that should not be forced to change. Schools should not require uniforms as they are an unnecessary component of education. Schools should not require mandatory uniforms for students because the serve no useful purpose within the educational process. The freedom to express oneself is part of the growing and learning process as much as academic lessons, and students need this freedom to discover who they truly are as people. Uniform dress in schools give the message that diversity is a bad thing and to conform is to prosper. While school uniforms may be a good idea in some schools it should be required in all schools. Each school should have its own right to determine whether school uniforms are appropriate or not for the school. While there have been some excellent examples of school behavior being enhanced by school uniforms particularly in urban disadvantaged neighborhoods this needs to be a choice of the school. Studies have shown that academics sometimes improve with uniforms and that a competitive element is reduced. Yet to make this a requirement for all schools to do does not take into account different neighborhoods and different school characteristics. For example a high school that may foster the arts would be totally out of line requiring uniforms and could be a damper on the creativity that they are encouraging. In some cases uniforms may also place an economic burden on a family. To conclude each school district needs to determine what is best for the district and the individual schools and uniforms should be a voluntary thing. I don't think schools should require students to wear a uniform. I do not think that schools should require their students to wear a school uniform. I do not think it is fair for students to be forced to do something. Students have the right to stand out, if all are wearing the same outfit they can not stand out. Also some families can not afford to by the uniform. I do not think that uniforms should be a requirement but is should be an option. If a parent finds it more economical to purchase uniforms in a public school setting then they should have that option. Uniforms are great because students don't feel a sense of competition between other students. If would not matter how much money your. I don't feel there's a need to force a uniform on anyone. I do believe that individuality in dress is important, it breeds creativity. As a child the only thing you really have control of. Is your style , it would be a shame to loose that in a uniform. Schools should not require students to we",

            "premise": "We already have catholic and private schools - usually those schools require their students to wear uniforms to attend that certain school. Then we have public schools - which do not require uniforms. At the current state we are in, everyone has the CHOICE if they want to go to a private school and wear a uniform or go to a public school and don't. Ammendment 1 grants every american citizen the following freedoms: Speech, Press, and Religion. People dress to represent themselves as a person. Their clothing tells peers who they are through expression. How someone dresses is their freedom of speech, because they are speaking of themselves through their clothing. If all schools required students to wear uniforms - then our younger generation will have their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY. This is against the law and is not allowed - or puts a good name upon our country in question - USA. At least where we are at the moment, students have the CHOICE if they want to go to a school that requires them to wear a uniform or not. They CHOOSE if they accept the fact that if they go to a spacific school, then they may not have all of their rights while atttending. Where we are now is fair, everyone have freedom of choice, and the choise of what to do with their rights; and that is what being an american citizen is all about. Even if schools did want to require their students to wear uniforms - where would they get the money to buy such uniforms on manufacture them? You see, if this were reality then it would be a MAJOR financial, and constitution violation and issue.",

            "conclusion": "Private Schools Should Have Their Students Wear Uniforms",
            "premise": "This is the argument from my former account xXCryptoXx. This argument was not plagiarized; for it is my own work being used on this account that I created. My Arguments 1. Uniforms may increase a student\u2019s self esteem because they do not have to worry constantly to be better dressed than those around them. [1] Many kids are discouraged by the fact that they don't own, or cannot afford some of the clothing other kids can. Uniforms put all kids at the same level, and takes that much more stress off the students that cannot afford the latest \"fashion\". [2] By implementing uniforms confidence is boosted and negative peer pressure is eliminated. Over 75% of schools that implemented school uniforms noticed a drop in peer pressure. [3] 2. Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted. Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the classroom, especially if you are bored. Kids always want to know what others are wearing and even judge other students over it. Uniforms eliminate this problem and helps kids to stay focused in class. 3. Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\". [4] This togetherness helps to eliminate division among students at the school and reduces bullying; giving a sense of community is beneficial to the mental well being of a student. [5] 4. Uniforms help the school faculty to quickly identify who is part of the school and in the end could actually help in keeping strangers and potentially dangerous people off the campus. This helps to make students feel safer at school. School uniforms may also eliminate gang and clique symbols bringing about a feeling of safety and togetherness. Safety is very important when increasing the amount of students who enroll in a school. 5. Bullies like to pick on kids who are lesser than them, and therefore tend to pick on kids who do not wear quality or popular clothes. [6]By implementing school uniforms this problem is solved. School uniforms encourage discipline through neatness, order, and equality among students. [6] 6. School uniforms encourage creative forms of self expression. Since students lose the ability to express themselves in certain ways through the clothes they were, they will be more likely to express themselves through things such as their personality, academic performance, clubs, and sports. It pushes students to put themselves out there. 7. School uniforms reduce violence and student behavioral problems. [7] Long Beach, California District School held a study comparing violence and behavioral problem rates among students before and after uniforms were implemented. In the five years following the implementation of school uniforms there was an 86% drop in violent assaults. Vandalism cases dropped from 1409 to 106. [8] The U.S. Department of Education also found that school crime decreased 36%, sexual offenses decreased 74%, and fights between students dropped 51% after school uniforms were implemented.[13] Almost 80% schools that implemented school uniforms noticed an improvement in student discipline. [9] Schools that implemented school uniforms also showed to have a higher graduation rate and attendance rate than schools without school uniforms. [11] [12] School uniforms have helped improve schools, as emphasized by one study that finds that \u201cvarious benefits to wearing uniforms were reported, including decreases in discipline, gang involvement and bullying; and increases in safety, eases of going to school, confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, school police data showed a 63 percent reduction in police log reports during the first year of implementation. Other decreases were noted in reports of gang-related activities and student fights, along with graffiti, property damage, battery and administrative assist. \u201c[10] [1] http://everydaylife.globalpost.com...

Even so, most schools have scanner machines so that students can use their school district ID's to sign in. If someone that was not a student at the school happened to trespass, they would be caught immediately. Personally, I think dress codes would be better.

I'm sorry that your copy/paste response was not tailored for my counter-argument. Also, you don't seem to understand the fundamentals behind a free-market education system, which is what private schools are. If parents think a school and its rules are terrible, they don't send their kids there. The school administration can write the guidebook, but if the parents don't approve, the school will not get any students. The topic of this debate was not whether or not school uniforms have benefits for the students or not. It was if private schools should have their students wear uniforms. It's a question of what is good for the school. A school without any students isn't not a good school. The free market is the only deciding factor in this question. Many private schools do implement uniforms, and many do not.",

            "discussionTitle": "School uniforms should be required",
            "conclusion": "School uniforms should be required",
            "premise": "I would first like to thank my opponent for creating such a unique debate topic from what I've seen on this site. I'm sure this will be a interesting debate for the both of us. I accept my opponent's definition of \"school uniform.\" However, my opponent has to realize that the government cannot force private schools to wear uniforms if it chooses not to require them if he hasn't realized such a thing. I also ask that any videos not be looked at until I ask you dear reader. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I shall now jump into my opponent's points and begin to refute: 1.) As a high schooler, I know full well that I would hate certain aspects of my school with or without school uniforms. In fact, being forced to wear school uniforms will make me dislike my school more. My opponent talks about helping each other to succeed, which is fine on a team but school is about individualism. There is rarely team \"tests or team essays which are the majority of grades in most classes. Comparing sport teams to school is like apple and oranges. In fact, many students would feel like the school is more of a dictatorship then anything with uniforms. Again, school uniforms suppresses individualism and discourages teachers to recognise students for their different personalities, character, and abilities. School Uniforms also stop students from taking responsibility for the aspect of dressing themselves for a public environment. Uniforms fit for Military schools where unity, and discipline are key along with following orders. Not public school where creativity, and being yourself are key elements. Private schools do not matter in this debate as I've shown above. 2.) It surely does not help students focus as they will only find other ways to bully or tease one another. Furthermore, it encourages others to mock those who do not have their uniforms as perfect as perhaps their own little group. Other students will simply bring a outfit from home to change into the minute class ends. I would know as many of my friends (both boys and girls) attend private catholic schools where uniforms are required. (Oh and they hate the uniforms). 3.) School Uniforms alone do not teach boys to be neat and girls to be attractive. Who says the boys and girls must keep their uniforms in fashionable or even clean shape? All school uniforms reenforce is wearing semi-formal outfits in school. 4.) Again, untrue as I've already proven above. My opponent also fails to realize that if this was true then it would only make other students get bullied more often if not more for simply acting differently or having a different personality. 5.) Students will be less likely to want to learn in a strict environment. The Japan cosplay example my opponent gives is a rare one at best and this entire point really is invalid since students can express themselves in fashion outside of school without school uniforms. This link explores the difference between Japanese and U.S. schools: http://sitemaker.umich.edu... Japanese students go to school for 240 days out of the year compared to 180 for American students and Japanese students go in for a half day of instruction on saturday. Japan also uses it's school funding better then America since getting to the students to the school is less of a issue in Japan. This link explores Taiwan schools: http://en.wikipedia.org... From the Link: \"It has been criticised for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favour of rote memorization.\" There is a difference between teaching and turning students into robots who merely repeat what they been programmed to do. \"Students often stay as late as 8 or 9 PM for \"extra classes\" which is explored more after the link jump. We have nothing near that for public schools in America. Kids in Taiwan also stay more days a year in school then U.S. students. This link explores Hong Kong schools: http://en.wikipedia.org... Hong Kong students spend roughly 195 days a year in school, and like the other two countries have a higher amount of work ethic and amount for their schools. To quote the link: \"The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately 3 to 4 hours of schoolwork nightly.\" Does everyone notice a pattern? How school uniforms are barely mentioned if at all in these links? How more school work, days in a school year, and format are the reasons why these schools have the best scores on international tests. If my opponent truly wants to improve schools, I'd advise making a separate debate about changing the format of public schools. Adding school uniforms will do nothing but create a negative impact as I've shown throughout this debate. So therefore, logic says that CON (me) should win this debate. Other reasons why school uniforms are a bad idea: 6.) School uniforms would make students very identifiable outside of school and would make the divisions between schools wider. This would only lead to more bullying and fights to develop between students from rival schools as they travel to and from school. If my opponent does not believe such a thing could happen, I ask him and the reader to now look at the first, second, and third video in order in which rival schools fight at basketball and Lacrosse games where each side knows where the other stands obviously. In the first two videos, students and others from each school are fighting while in the third video it is the players from the schools who fight constantly throughout the game. http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... http://www.youtube.com... 7.) Uniforms cause major discomfort to the student and therefore distract the student for learning. The uniforms which are particularly bad for girls who have to wear skirts. They have to wear them all year around, this includes in the coldest of winter months. There is also the hottest months of the year that can affect the student having to wear uniforms. 8.) This is related to #7 but a point all on it's own. This serves as a distraction for the teacher to make sure all teachers are enforcing said dress code and therefore takes time out of the class. This is bad both for the teacher who is now behind in teaching the class and the students who will be forced to learn something a little faster at the very least due to what should be a non-relevant issue like clothing except for the fact all students are now required to wear uniforms they don't like or want to wear. 9.) No substantial evidence offered by my own opponent as to why School Uniforms would be superior to regular clothing outside naming three countries that have the highest test scores for reasons I have listed above. With that, I do believe I have refuted all my opponent's points. I will sum up as to why exactly I have won this debate in the third round. So I would just like to thank my opponent for creating this debate and of course you the reader for taking the time out of your day/evening to read it. I cannot wait to see my opponent's 2nd round argument so we may continue this debate. Thank You",

If the student is wearing school uniform, then the teacher would know that he is a student and help to bring back to his class. But if the student is not wearing school uniform, then the teacher would not know he is a student. Bullying does happen in schools if the students wear school uniforms or not, but at least for schools with uniforms, the victims of bullying will not have to worry about the clothes they wear which is one less thing to worry about as long as they keep their uniforms neat.",

Then we have public schools - which do not require uniforms. At the current state we are in, everyone has the CHOICE if they want to go to a private school and wear a uniform or go to a public school and don't. Ammendment 1 grants every american citizen the following freedoms: Speech, Press, and Religion. People dress to represent themselves as a person. Their clothing tells peers who they are through expression. How someone dresses is their freedom of speech, because they are speaking of themselves through their clothing. If all schools required students to wear uniforms - then our younger generation will have their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY. This is against the law and is not allowed - or puts a good name upon our country in question - USA. At least where we are at the moment, students have the CHOICE if they want to go to a school that requires them to wear a uniform or not. They CHOOSE if they accept the fact that if they go to a spacific school, then they may not have all of their rights while atttending. Where we are now is fair, everyone have freedom of choice, and the choise of what to do with their rights; and that is what being an american citizen is all about. Even if schools did want to require their students to wear uniforms - where would they get the money to buy such uniforms on manufacture them? You see, if this were reality then it would be a MAJOR financial, and constitution violation and issue.",

Look up \"http://www.eminence.kyschools.us...; they exist. When I said 500 people per class, I meant in my graduating class, not every classroom. There is anywhere from 7 to 30 students per classroom, depending on what class it was. Also, there were 2 or 3 teachers per subject because there were so many students. The school does have a dress policy. If you want to see what it is, go to this website: http://www.mcsk12.net... I find your accusations very offensive. For your information, I am the smartest person in my GRADUATING CLASS. I am taking college courses at Bellarmine University. I focus on my school work. In fact, I take pride in my academic accomplishments. You have no idea what I do. I do not obsess about my clothes. I throw on what I pull out of my dresser. The truth is, I DO NOT CARE about my clothes. You would have to know me personally to know why. So you can assume all you want. But the reality is, you do not know me at all. The kids Cordova High had a total disregard for policy. You are under the misconception that all kids like to follow the rules. Let me make a suggestion, go visit Memphis. Maybe that will open your eyes to the truth about students' feelings for policy. The fact is that students hate being told what to do. That is why tension rise. Not because everybody is wearing the same thing, but because they are being forced to wear clothes that are uncomfortable. Your argument about why uniforms are good for parents is not very logical. Parents still have to BUY the uniforms, in addition to clothes that their kids wear outside of school. With no uniform policy, the students can wear what clothes they already have. I think that I will list all of my academic accomplishments next round if you want me to.",

I see what you mean by others who cannot afford uniform, but no one wants to wear them. 2. If school wasn't as boring as it is, then teachers shouldn't have to worry about their students being distracted. If faculty does more to help students become hands-on learners, they wouldn't have to worry about wearing uniform. 3. It won't reduce bullying, if a bully wants to bully a kid, he/she is going to do it, with or without uniform. Everyone that goes to that school is apart of the same school. 4. I see where you're coming from that, but for closed schools, it shouldn't be a problem since you have to go through several security guards standing at the gates. 5. Even if you don't have the latest fashion, no one will make fun of you. I wear age-old clothes to school, and people think I'm stylish. 6. By not wearing school uniforms, the students have more opportunities to express themselves, and boost their imagination. Even by not wearing uniforms, their academic standing will stay the same. But if you implement uniforms on them, they will get bored by not having things to do, or talk about. 7. Wearing uniforms have no real correlation with those statistics",

            "premise": "(rebuttal for first paragraph): But how does it decrease such rates? You are stating the effects without the causes. You need to explain each point because it seems as if you are rambling about a random tangent you do not have any idea about. It does not help that you did not provide any citations or evidence. Therefore, who is Virginia Draa exactly? Is she biased? Does her school allow uniforms? What is her credibility? What exact study is that from? Because, right now I do not have a counterargument for this section if you are unwilling to explain your points. (rebuttal for second paragraph): Once again, WHAT STUDY? It seems like you are making this up. You may want to read my first paragraph again because it seems as if you have not already: We already have catholic and private schools - usually those schools require their students to wear uniforms to attend that certain school. Then we have public schools - which do not require uniforms. At the current state we are in, everyone has the CHOICE if they want to go to a private school and wear a uniform or go to a public school and don't. Ammendment 1 grants every american citizen the following freedoms: Speech, Press, and Religion. People dress to represent themselves as a person. Their clothing tells peers who they are through expression. How someone dresses is their freedom of speech, because they are speaking of themselves through their clothing. If all schools required students to wear uniforms - then our younger generation will have their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY. This is against the law and is not allowed - or puts a good name upon our country in question - USA. At least where we are at the moment, students have the CHOICE if they want to go to a school that requires them to wear a uniform or not. They CHOOSE if they accept the fact that if they go to a spacific school, then they may not have all of their rights while atttending. Where we are now is fair, everyone have freedom of choice, and the choise of what to do with their rights; and that is what being an american citizen is all about. Even if schools did want to require their students to wear uniforms - where would they get the money to buy such uniforms on manufacture them? You see, if this were reality then it would be a MAJOR financial, and constitution violation and issue.\" \" A 1999 study conducted by experts from Texas Southern University showed that bullying incidents increased by as much as 12%, after the implementation of mandatory uniform wearing. Echoing this sentiment is a 2007 study published in the Southwest Journal of Criminal Justice. According to the research, assaults increased by as much as 14 incidences yearly, right after the introduction of school uniforms. A similar finding was discovered by the Office of Education, Evaluation, and Management of the Miami-Dade County. Violence, especially in the middle schools, increased by a hundred fold after the students were required to wear uniforms.\" (mentioned below as well).(rebuttal for third paragraph): What about poor families who cannot afford such uniforms? They cannot afford a certain outfit and therefore cannot recieve education due to their unwealthiness? That is DISCRIMINATION and it is ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL, as I have mentioned previously. Once again, where are you getting your information from? Please site your evidence. \"People who are for uniforms say that it promotes social conformity, so the less-to-do don\u2019t have to be pressured to keep up with their well-off contemporaries. Unfortunately, it does not work that way. They still are forced to spend because the school requires their children to wear costly uniforms.\"More facts and statistics:\"The path to adult development is honed throughout the duration of early schooling. However, your transition towards adulthood can be hindered with uniforms. Since it is mandatory, you are not given the chance to decide for yourself, which is one of the hallmarks of adulthood. You know you are an adult when you are given the freedom to choose \u2013 whether you like this or that. When you were young, you know you are not an adult yet because your parents (aka the \u2018adults\u2019) made the decision for you. However, when you are restricted to wearing uniforms in school, you are denied the opportunity to make decisions for yourself. After all, you do not have a choice because the others have already made it for you.\"\"Uniforms aim to give everybody a homogenous look, right? Instead of improving a student\u2019s self-image because he looks just like the others, it actually does the opposite. Students have different weights, body types and heights. Whenever one looks at himself in the mirror, he depreciates his self-image because he feels like he doesn\u2019t look his best. Unfortunately, this case is often seen in girls, who feel \u2018embarrassed\u2019 when they go to school in uniforms. According to development psychologists, ladies have the huge tendency to compare how they look in uniforms. This is especially the case when the student sees herself to have a curvy or plus-size body. This also happens to girls who deem themselves very short or very tall.\"\"A 1999 study conducted by experts from Texas Southern University showed that bullying incidents increased by as much as 12%, after the implementation of mandatory uniform wearing.

Some uniforms are made from unpleasant fabrics that will make you itch from the first class to the last class. Some are so badly-designed that they can make the wearer look bigger or pudgier. Yes, there are so many things that can make uniforms so horrendously uncomfortable.\"\"Those who are in favor of uniforms believe that they are cheaper alternatives, because the students have to wear them every day. That is actually a point of contention, as uniforms are very costly too! In fact, Americans spend about $249 on uniforms yearly. When you compound all the people that have to buy school uniforms, it totals to $1 billion annually. That\u2019s the cost of the Chicago Cubs, LA Lakers, and the Toronto Maple Leafs (each team, of course.) Heck, you can buy the Solomon Islands for $1 billion.\"\"Children are always taught to break free and stand out. But with uniforms, the schools are actually lobbying for the opposite. Uniforms actually force students to kowtow to the rules of conformity. After all, a pupil needs to wear something that is prescribed for everybody, not something that expresses his individuality.People who are for uniforms say that it promotes social conformity, so the less-to-do don\u2019t have to be pressured to keep up with their well-off contemporaries. Unfortunately, it does not work that way. They still are forced to spend because the school requires their children to wear costly uniforms.\" \"The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees one the freedom of religion, assembly, and right to petition. Most importantly, it assures a citizen\u2019s freedom to expression. Unfortunately, this is inherently violated by requiring the students to wear uniforms. Freedom of expression is not just about saying what you want to say, it\u2019s also about seeking and imparting ideas, regardless of limits and boundaries. Expressing your ideologies, beliefs and philosophies, unfortunately, are hindered by school uniforms. That\u2019s because you are forced to wear something you don\u2019t believe in. You are no longer given a chance to express your ideas, which you can impart simply by choosing the clothes you like to wear.\"\"There have been numerous polls made to determine the acceptance of school uniforms, and most of them show that students are against them. Take the case of the Harford County Public School students, wherein 87.9% are in strong disfavor of the mandatory uniform system. The parents of school children feel the same way as well. According to the Rasmussen Reports, 47% of parents are against school uniforms, compared to the 41% who are in favor of school dresses. 12% still remain undecided on the issue.\"Citations: http://www.listland.com...",

If kids are being bullied because of what they are wearing - then they have several options before taking their lives: 1. telling a counselor or adult 2. switching outfits 3. defending themselves. Just because someone insults someone's outfit does not mean that they are going to kill themselves - and if that is the case then please prove it to me. The school systems right now in our country are an option - you can either go to private or public school. Under ammendment 1 of the constitution - every citizen in the united states has the freedom of speech, press, and religion. What clothes we wear is considered to be freedom of speech since we are expressing whom we are. If we make all schools provide their students with uniforms - then we are taking away the student's rights of freedom of speech, violating ammendment one of our constitution. Making this action highly unconstitutional. We should leave it at a choice for a parent to decide for their kid to go to a school where they wear a uniform or not because then freedom is still in everyone's hands and they can choose if they want to wear a uniform or not. Making kids wear a uniform will not decrease the amound of suicide in our youth - it is a much more complex issue then that.",

            "premise": "Yes, you are correct that first round is for acceptance. Thank you for givng me the benefit of doubt. 1) Benefits of Uniforms1. Uniforms may increase a students self esteem because they do not have to worry constantly to be better dressed than those around them. Many kids are discouraged by the fact that they don't own, or cannot afford some of the clothing other kids can. Uniforms put all kids at the same level, and takes that much more stress off the students that cannot afford the latest \"fashion\".2. Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted. Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the clasroom, especially if you are bored. Kids always want to know what others are wearing and even judge other students over it. Uniforms eliminate this problem and helps kids to stay focused in class. 3. Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\".4. Uniforms support conformity. Although some may think this isn't that great of a thing and that kids should express themselves, in the end, life is truly about conformity. Humans strive to be like each other and don't want to be the odd one out. Uniforms support this and put all students on equal terms instead of wealthy students coming in with their fancy jeans and shirts and the less fortunate students coming in with ratty looking clothes. 5. Uniforms help the school faculty to quickly identify who is part of the school and in the end could actually help in keeping strangers and potentially dangerous people off the campus.

            "conclusion": "Private Schools Should Have Their Students Wear Uniforms",
            "premise": "I apologize for the forfeit in the last round; I lost track of time. To start out, I would like to refute my opponents' arguments and points. First off, my opponent stated that \"uniforms may increase a student's self esteem.\" I disagree, firstly because this is an assumption, secondly because this is a wrong assumption. I currently attend a private school, and we wear uniforms. Let me tell you, they are the ugliest things around. Plus, they're extremely itchy and uncomfortable. Therefore, uniforms actually decrease self esteem. Secondly, my opponent stated that \"many kids are discouraged by the fact that they [...] can't afford some of the clothing other kids can.\" I disagree with this, mainly because students' parents can hardly afford uniforms. At the school I attend, a 100% polyester (cheap) shirt goes for around $70, 100% polyester shorts for about $80, and our formal uniforms, altogether, around $250, once again 100% polyester. Therefore, uniforms are not only uncomfortable, but they are not the solution to my opponents' point that kids can't afford some clothing since \"some clothing\" means uniforms. Thirdly, my opponent stated that \"uniforms put all kids at the same level.\" I disagree with this for two reasons\"they don't, and that it's not good to be at the same level. First reason: Uniforms do not put kids at the same level whatsoever. There are plenty other kids that separate the \"level\" of kids such as their wealth, their athletic abilities, their artistic abilities, their looks, their weight, etc. Secondly reason: It isn't good for kids to be at the same level. If everybody were at the same level, then there would be no competition, and no progress would be made. This is not an assumption; it is backed by evidence. Think of communist countries. There, the government tries to put everybody at the same level. But does that work? No! Therefore, students should not be put at the same level, and uniforms don't even put students at the same level. Fourth, my esteemed colleague said \"By implementing uniforms confidence is boosted and negative peer pressure is eliminated.\" He also stated a study where over 75% of schools that implemented uniforms had a drop in peer pressure, but this is, in my opinion, a false cause, because how would uniforms eliminate peer pressure? Peer pressure and uniforms don't even relate to each other. If by peer pressure, my opponent meant bullying, then they don't eliminate bullying, because, as I stated above, there are still other things such as their wealth, their athletic abilities, their artistic abilities, their looks, their weight, etc. Therefore, uniforms do not eliminate \"peer pressure\" or stop bullying in any way, shape, or form. Onto my opponent's second argument. My colleague's entire second argument says that \"Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the classroom\", and that \"Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted\". I disagree because there are tons of other distractions in the classroom involving people. How about that ugly girl with the huge moles who never had, doesn't have, and never will have a boyfriend? She's a distraction! And how about that hot girl with the huge boobs? She's a distraction! What about when other students ask you for a pencil, pen or paper? That's a distraction! And what about when that misbehaved kid is always cracking jokes at the wrong time? That's also a distraction! Therefore, uniforms are not by any means the solution to eliminating distractions. My opponent's third argument now. He said: \"Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\". [4] This togetherness helps to eliminate division among students at the school and reduces bullying; giving a sense of community is beneficial to the mental well being of a student.\" Uniforms do represent the school, and show that you are a part of that school, as my opponent stated. But, the only thing uniforms are is a marketing scheme. Uniforms have the name of the school or logo printed clearly on them, and people see that logo, and think \"Hey, I want to go to that school!\" Even the director (principal) at my school admits that they are for advertising! Therefore, my opponent's argument about \"school spirit\" is invalid because uniforms represent more \"marketing spirit\" instead. I have limited characters, and do not wish to use all of them up, so my refutations from here on out will be shorter. Number five, I have already refuted above. It is about bullying. Number six, I have also somewhat refuted. Students can express themselves through makeup, bands, pins, and t heir personality. Personality plays a large part in self-expression. His argument seven is a false cause. How do uniforms affect crime rates? They don't. He has only provided evidence, but no reasoning to prove that it is a false cause. His closing statement is that school uniforms have helped to improve schools, but, according to my refutations, they do not do any of the benefit that he has stated. Now, I would like to bring up a few arguments of my own. Private schools should not have their students wear uniforms because they are expensive. My opponent seems to think that uniforms are the solution to all expenses of \"in\" clothes, but look at the facts. A complete uniform can cost up to $250! And this is one that is made out of cheap material. They break, seams come undone, and you have to buy more uniforms. Soon that $250 becomes many thousands of dollars. Private schools should not have their students wear uniforms because they are uncomfortable. Most uniforms are made out of 80-100% polyester. If you are not aware of what polyester is, according to dictionary.com, it is defined as a fabric made from such textile fibers. Polyester, because it is made up of textile fibers, is one of the most uncomfortable fabrics you can wear. Since uniforms are made out of polyester, they are highly uncomfortable, so we can't have our kids walking around all day, itching, scratching, and complaining about their uncomfortable, cheap uniforms sold at scandalously high prices. Now, I would like to weigh the impacts. On their side, their arguments boil down to less bullying and benefiting kids, all of which are false, as pointed out in my refutations. On my side, it boils down to the fact that uniforms are uncomfortable and pricey. Voters, would you want kids walking around in uniforms that are not worth the polyester they're printed on? I sure wouldn't think so. Thank you, and please vote for the Con side of this debate.",

            "conclusion": "Private Schools Should Have Their Students Wear Uniforms",
            "premise": "This is the argument from my former account xXCryptoXx. This argument was not plagiarized, for it is my own work being used on a different account I created. My opponent broke my rule that first round is for acceptance, and therefore loses conduct points. My Arguments 1. Uniforms may increase a student\u2019s self esteem because they do not have to worry constantly to be better dressed than those around them. [1] Many kids are discouraged by the fact that they don't own, or cannot afford some of the clothing other kids can. Uniforms put all kids at the same level, and takes that much more stress off the students that cannot afford the latest \"fashion\". [2] By implementing uniforms confidence is boosted and negative peer pressure is eliminated. Over 75% of schools that implemented school uniforms noticed a drop in peer pressure. [3] 2. Uniforms improve learning by not allowing kids to be distracted. Clothes can be a huge distraction when you are in the classroom, especially if you are bored. Kids always want to know what others are wearing and even judge other students over it. Uniforms eliminate this problem and helps kids to stay focused in class. 3. Uniforms show that everyone there with you is part of your school. It shows you are all part of a team. It promotes school spirit and shows that everyone there is \"on the same side\". [4] This togetherness helps to eliminate division among students at the school and reduces bullying; giving a sense of community is beneficial to the mental well being of a student. [5] 4. Uniforms help the school faculty to quickly identify who is part of the school and in the end could actually help in keeping strangers and potentially dangerous people off the campus. This helps to make students feel safer at school. School uniforms may also eliminate gang and clique symbols bringing about a feeling of safety and togetherness. Safety is very important when increasing the amount of students who enroll in a school. 5. Bullies like to pick on kids who are lesser than them, and therefore tend to pick on kids who do not wear quality or popular clothes. [6]By implementing school uniforms this problem is solved. School uniforms encourage discipline through neatness, order, and equality among students. [6] 6. School uniforms encourage creative forms of self expression. Since students lose the ability to express themselves in certain ways through the clothes they were, they will be more likely to express themselves through things such as their personality, academic performance, clubs, and sports. It pushes students to put themselves out there. 7. School uniforms reduce violence and student behavioral problems. [7] Long Beach, California District School held a study comparing violence and behavioral problem rates among students before and after uniforms were implemented. In the five years following the implementation of school uniforms there was an 86% drop in violent assaults. Vandalism cases dropped from 1409 to 106. [8] The U.S. Department of Education also found that school crime decreased 36%, sexual offenses decreased 74%, and fights between students dropped 51% after school uniforms were implemented.[13] Almost 80% schools that implemented school uniforms noticed an improvement in student discipline. [9] Schools that implemented school uniforms also showed to have a higher graduation rate and attendance rate than schools without school uniforms. [11] [12] School uniforms have helped improve schools, as emphasized by one study that finds that \u201cvarious benefits to wearing uniforms were reported, including decreases in discipline, gang involvement and bullying; and increases in safety, eases of going to school, confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, school police data showed a 63 percent reduction in police log reports during the first year of implementation. Other decreases were noted in reports of gang-related activities and student fights, along with graffiti, property damage, battery and administrative assist. \u201c[10] Contentions \u201cUniforms ultimately cost more\u201d The basic uniform, khakis and an oxford, can be produced cheaply. In fact, the basic uniforms are actually cheaper than lots of clothes found in the store. If possessing a uniform becomes a problem, many organizations help with getting them to children. \u201cUniforms do not teach children how to deal with people who are different then themselves\u201d It does however, eliminate difference through clothing, thus bringing kids on to an equal level. \u201cCliques will still form.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what uniforms can\u2019t do, rather it is important to focus on the plethora of things uniforms accomplish. In the same, you can\u2019t say \u201cglasses don\u2019t raise grades,\u201d because that focuses on what glasses can\u2019t do, ignoring all the things glasses can do. \u201cIt is impossible to prevent all outside intrusion\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter whether uniforms can stop all outside intrusion if uniforms as a whole help to prevent intruders from coming on campus. \u201cChildren will still ask for designer labels for outside of school clothing.\u201d This is overall irrelevant to the debate. \u201cIf you need uniforms to distinguish between public and catholic/private schools it's time to re-evaluate where your child is going\u201d Implementing uniforms isn\u2019t about distinguishing from other schools, rather it is about the benefits uniforms directly provide to the school implementing them. \u201cUniforms teach children that in order to get along everyone must conform to the same standards. \u201c Conformity helps in keeping things under control, and is something that will be seen in everyday society even after the student is out of school, therefore this isn\u2019t actually a bad thing. \u201clike i said uniform is strict and conduct a boring environment that unsuitable\u201d Uniforms do not create a boring environment, rather they promote an orderly, neat, and professional environment which is an environment suitable for learning in.

            "premise": "Thank you for your response. Rebuttals 1. It is irrelevant whether students want to wear uniforms or not, as it is irrelevant whether students want to go to school or not. Private schools have the right to institute school uniforms, and seeing that uniforms provide a plethora of benefits private schools ought to implement them. 2. It is irrelevant whether school, or even classes, are boring or not. Teachers do not have to entertain their students; they\u2019re only job is to teach their students. In addition, you argument does not take away from the fact that regardless of whether the class is boring or not, implementing school uniforms still eliminated a potential distraction. 3. Even if it does not eliminate bullying all together, it does eliminate a factor that may be victim to bullying, thus reduce bullying. If bullying still continues, that is not the fault of school uniforms, rather the problem lies within bullies themselves. If that is the case, the school should work towards eliminating bullying as a whole and not factors that either cause bullying or are victims to bullying. 4. Most schools do not have security guards, or even necessarily security gates to keep strangers off of campus. This argument directly applies to school that do not have these security measures. Implementing uniforms is a security measure in itself in that it helps to identify students from nonstudents. 5. That is an appeal to personal experience, and can therefore not be trusted as a valid argument. The fact stays that clothing may easily represent wealth, wear wealthier kids will be able to keep up with trending fashions or even more expensive clothing whereas less fortunate kids will not, and even have to go as far as to wear old, outdated, or worn clothing. This can easily make them victims to bullying through snide comments about them being poor, ect. 6. I am not arguing that uniforms increase academic performance, because studies have been inconclusive or have found that uniforms do not increase academic performance. Students do not only talk about clothing, there is much more to talk about. They can talk about their social lives, families, social media, clubs, sports, classes, ect. Therefore your argument that they will have nothing to talk about is invalid. 7. I have provided seven sources backing up this argument, whereas you have only concluded through your own opinion that there is no correlation. There this argument can be considered dropped. Over to you.",

            "premise": "Thank you opponent, I hope the same as you. Words from an study of Arizona State University: \"Public School Uniforms: Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perception,\" I am in favour in this debate. I think school uniforms should be ban. Children' freedom is restricted with school uniforms. Students should be able to wear the clothes that they want to express their style. Why not to create a dress code instated of having uniforms? Like this, students will look well and can wear what they want. There are many students that infringe the uniform code because they don't feel comfortable with the clothes of it, but in my personal opinion it would be easier to follow a dress code with clothes chosen by students, because it's what they like and since they feel comfortable with their clothes, they will make a little effort to look more pretty following the school dress codes. How many replies does schools get because they have school uniforms? A lot. Sometimes boys look under the girls' skirt. Many people reply school uniforms are uncomfortable or ugly. So to stop get g this replies, school should abolish uniforms. It would not be that easy for your parents to find you if you are wearing the same clothes that everyone is wearing. I think that since people are young, they have to learn that everyone is different and this is limited with school uniforms, because everyone wears the same thing. Students can express their creativity and individuality choosing the clothes that they are going to wear and this can make them know that they have some likes that are different from other people. If schools have uniforms, that will be the only option for kids to wear and, what happens if a kid don't find his/her size? It would be difficult for parents, they will have to search someone that make the uniform or buy an smaller or bigger size for the kid, but without uniforms, kids will have a lot of options to wear and that problem will go out. Uniforms can decrease self-esteem. Instated of increasing it, many students can dislike the way they look with uniforms because their image is not the best, it is just limited If you think that wearing school uniforms reduce bullying, you are totally wrong. A 1999 study conducted by experts from Texas Southern University showed that bullying incidents increased 12%, after the implementation of mandatory uniform wearing in schools. Uniforms are boring. The way in which I understand this point is thinking that seeing the same clothes over and over again can make people to get tired of doing it. Also because of the colours: uniforms just have between 2 and 5 colours! This will make also people being tired of seeing the same colours lot of times. I think schools uniforms should be banned for schools to stop receiving reapplies, for student's freedom, and for all the reasons mentioned above.Dress codes instead will work. Good luck opponent!",

            "premise": "I will proceed to refute pro\u2019s arguments. #1 Uniforms will not boost a student\u2019s self-esteem. Insecurities among adolescents are caused by puberty. Every teen will go through it. It is hormones that cause self-consciousness, not clothes. Teens will always want to identify themselves, be it through clothing or other things. [1] I would also quickly like to point out that the source pro uses to back up his statistics is an online-shopping website for school uniforms. This is a biased source and therefore not legitimate evidence. #2 Pro doesn\u2019t seem to have a source backing this claim up so I will assume it\u2019s a personal opinion. I will counter this with an opinion of my own. I\u2019m a high school student and I have never been so distracted by other people\u2019s clothing that it interferes with my schoolwork. Frankly, I can\u2019t say what\u2019s so distracting by a sweater or a pair of jeans. And I highly doubt other teenagers are so distracted that a uniform system should be introduced. #3 Again pro, websites selling school uniforms are NOT valid sources. I will comment on the bullying in a short while. #4 I would like pro to give me some examples of bad scenarios that happened because the offender was not identified by anybody of the school security. Cliques and gangs will always exist among teenagers because hormones cause them to rebel against the status-quo. #5 According to Psychology Today bullies are often the result of bad parenting. They do not pick their targets based on what they wear, but whether if they can dominate and humiliate them. Sub-assertive classmates are often an easy target, for they will not fight back. An assertive person can wear the cheapest clothes and still fend off a potential bully. [2] #6 Pro says that students find different ways to express themselves because they lose the freedom to pick their own clothes. This contradicts arguments #1, #3 and #4. On the one hand he claims that cliques and gangs will be avoided and students will have a feeling of togetherness. How will this happen if students are going to express themselves through other things? As I already established teenagers will form their own identity and will derogate others for it. #7 The sources did not explain in which manner the uniforms prevented behavioral problems and reduced vandalism. Meanwhile, I have found a detailed report of a similar experiment in Michigan. Here, the data suggested no correlation between uniforms and academic improvements and reduced behavioral problems. [3] As we can see, there is no conclusive evidence suggesting anything pro claimed. Only circumstantial evidence. [1] http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] http://www.psychologytoday.com...

            "conclusion": "School uniforms should not be allowed in schools",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for his response. Now I will give my rebuttal. 1) in relation to my point that \"school uniforms save both time and money\" you say that there is many types of uniforms that pay a whole lot of money as opposed to normal clothes which are cheaper. You also say that \"The family will still buy regular clothes because since the student will probably want to wear something more comfortable in their free time\". This is not the case. If you think about it, students wearing normal clothes to school everyday of the week results in a much higher demand for clothes to be washed and ready. This means that sooner or later clothing outfits will be used up and there will be a need to buy more clothes. Whereas with the uniform, it solves the potential problem of constant washing and availability of clothes. Despite it's initial cost, it saves money in the long run there will no demand to buy extra clothing. Also you haven't touched off my second part of the point that uniform also saves time so that still stands. 2) I never once claimed that uniforms will end social class discrimination, I merely said that it fixes the problem of students being embarrassed about their clothes. Therefore the uniform reduces the perceptive division of social class as every student is wearing the same thing. You say \"Families who have less money can only afford to pay for a couple complete uniforms options thus making the student wear the same outfit often causing it to get more worn and more used thus causing wear so the outfit may be torn and worn out\". I still attend school. I have 1 school jumper, 2 shirts and 2 pairs of trousers that last the whole school year. There is little to no wear or tear on them. If a student is careful with their uniform then it can last for a very long time. And of course if a family is scarce in money then I think we can safely say that in that case a uniform would be taken care of very well. Now of course bullying will always exist, with or without uniforms but nobody is talking about a uniform putting an end to bullying; just potentially reducing it on ONE level. If everyone wears the same clothes then it is harder to delineate social class division in theory. It's not a means to an end but at least it helps as opposed to non-uniform schools where picking out different social classes is much more evident. 3) Again yes there is always going to be a bullying problem but the uniform again reduces it on one aspect. Yes students can bully other students about many other things, but not about there clothes in this case so therefore this is a benefit. A student's own clothes do no such thing in hindering bullying. Yes people can hide weapons or drugs in backpacks but with the uniform it reduces the chance of weapons being on the students physical person which potentially reduces the ability of harming other students. Again a student's own clothes do no such thing. Yes uniforms can be stolen too but what do you think is more likely, that a student steals a uniform or that a student steals clothes that appeal to them such as designer sneakers, jackets etc. It is much more likely that student steals what they don't have than what they do have. Again as previously stated, schools where uniforms are required have seen a 95 percent decrease in crime, 90 percent decrease in suspensions, and vandalism on school property decreased by 69 percent. I would like to point out that my opponent has not shown any such statistics that favour non-uniform schools in his argument or cited source. Also I would like to say to my opponent that stating that bullying will exist anyway, or that uniforms can still be stolen etc. is not really making a case that \"school uniforms should not be allowed in schools\".",

In some regards, School uniforms teach students that it is more important to think and act like a group instead of thinking and acting like an individual. Although there are many influences that can shape mob thinking patterns, This type of policy can be a foundational element of it if the uniform policies are not carefully introduced and monitored. Some accessories for girls are considered inappropriate. And as genders increase, Uniforms get complicated and it seems much easier to be able to get your our choice upon stuff. ==Why wear uniforms? What's the point? In our life, We will be faced with millions of choices, But how will we face THOSE, If we still have our clothes chosen for us. We need to learn our independence before learning our restrictions. There are 4/10 chances that groups of students will get in a risky situation in school hours.

When schools have uniforms kids focus more on they're studies not on they're clothes or how they look. If everyone wore the same clothes no one can say theirs is better and no one will be teased of what they wear. When everybody wears the same thing their will be less prejudicism and more nationalism. Kids will get along better and create more social groups. Students spend less time deciding what to wear, because no one will judge what they choose because they're all wearing the same thing. Nobody likes to be mocked when you choose the best clothing you had and then the other laugh and bully him for trying. When theirs the uniform policy kids will be friendlier and smarter because of the intelligent decision the school made for the kids own good.",

            "premise": "Okay so now your bragging about your academic accomplishments, not proving your point. Just so you know I'm 12 years not 21 in the profile description. I'm only twelve and still winning this debate. My school has a uniform policy and all the students are smart and intelligent. In my last school there was no such thing as an uniform and I couldn't spell us. I was that dumb back then and now with my new school and uniform policy, I'm smarter than you. With no uniform i only cared on what people wore, with uniforms I can study on my work. You're lying when you say you wear the first thing you grab out of the closet. What if you pull out a dress that your sister put in there. Having uniforms make it an easier playing field for poorer students that can't buy fashionable clothing, to wear to school. They end up being teased, bullied or starting fights because there was no school uniform. If there was a uniform policy the other kids wouldn't even know that they were at all. With the money the parents saved not buying clothes for school they can buy their kids some really fashionable clothing to wear on the weekdays or on breaks. In Long Beach, CA, after two years of a district-wide K-8 mandatory uniform policy, reports of assault and battery in the district's schools decreased by 34%, assault with a deadly weapon dropped by 50%, fighting incidents went down by 51%, sex offenses were cut by 74%, robbery dropped by 65%, possession of weapons (or weapon \"look-alikes\") decreased by 52%, possession of drugs went down by 69%, and vandalism was lowered by 18%. http://school-uniforms.procon.org... In my new school with the uniforms nobody is ever late, why? Uniforms help the students get ready faster in the mornings and improve attendance, which helps their over all grade. Instead of trying on each and every clothing in your wardrobe wear the one you wear everyday. Vote smartly.",

            "premise": "Thanks for a detailed reply!First I will be refuting my opponents 3 arguments (no, I don't agree with them), then I will be going back to strengthen my own.My opponents 1st argument was about how uniforms create an orderly enviornment. They also talk about an honor and pride to wear such uniformsThis is completely wrong in this case.These uniform are not letting students to express themselves. My opponents show nothing in their case that expression is going to create a distruptive enviornment. Students have the right to express themselvesMy oponent also talks about first impression causes a popularity system in their 2nd argumentHowever, There are other ways to see someone for the first time, not neccessarily their clothing. They can see people based on their hairstyle, and other characteristics. Their third argument is that the uniforms generate money to the government.However, Judge, you must see that this is completely non uniqueThis can also be turned to my side of the debate.People without uniforms buy regular clothes and if they buy regular clothes ( my opponent says that there is a LOT more regular clothes than uniforms in the 2nd round) then shouldn't there be more tax being generated WITHOUT uniforms?Now I will strengthen my argumentsMy first argument is that it violates freedom of expressionMy opponent states that there is a hierarchy in the schoolHowever, my opponentes show no link to why this is harmful.If there is a hierarchy, (I am not agreeing to this) then the students who are low in the hierarchy can still learn. They are still getting an education, not harming anyone at all!My refutation against hierarchy earlier can be crossapplied. I stated that There are other ways to see someone for the first time, not neccessarily their clothing. They can see people based on their hairstyle, and other characteristics. My second argument was that uniforms are expensive and they cost $249My opponent says that people buy way too many clothes, more than $249First of all, many girls aren't that rich. There are many others that do not have more than $249 to spare. This leads me to their second refutation, which was that you only need to buy this once.I agree, you only need to buy this once...until you outgrow it. In almost one year, you have to buy another set, for another $249. If you wear uniforms since kindergarten to 12th grade, then $3,237 will be spend on uniforms alone for a whole student going to school. What if the family has more than one kid? If they have 2, it will be double, and if they have 3, the price would be tripled and so on and so forth.My opponent also talked about how this sustains the economy.Again, I will like to appy my previous refutation which is that One must see that this is completely non uniqueThis can also be turned to my side of the debate.People without uniforms buy regular clothes and if they buy regular clothes ( my opponent says that there is a LOT more regular clothes than uniforms in the 2nd round) then shouldn't there be more tax being generated WITHOUT uniforms? They also talked about how schools can pay for us.However, this is wrong because school do not have that much money at handMy 3rd argument is that this cause bullyingThey state that students don't wear their uniforms outside of school.This is completely wrong!What do they wear once school ends? Do they go naked? (joke intended)People do walk to and from school. Obviously, they will meet rival members of another school, and since Students at my school hate students at a nearby school, some people would go into fistifightsSince none of my opponents arguments stand, the CON/NEG should winThank You",

Oh well, I'll guess I'll have a head-start as well. 1....focus on their school work as opposed to what type of clothes they wear, you say?? Well, in the adult world students have to make their own choices and school uniforms exclude that, as shown in \"Brosnan, Peter, and Alexis Brindley. \"What Not to Wear: A School's Dress Code Limits Clothing Styles and Colors.\" Current Events, a Weekly Reader Publication 28 Mar. 2011: 7. Opposing Viewpoints in Context.Web. 10 Feb.2014.\" 2. ...same level as socioeconomic status is not apparent from the uniforms ...which is exactly why school uniforms send out a sense of anti-individuality that goes against our personal liberty and freedom of expression. A nation that believes in this kind of thing should not go against it. It would not really matter if this was not in the constitution in the first place, but seriously--the constitution is the basic belief of America, and breaking it is a big blunder! the author of \" Fetzer, Kent J. \"School Uniforms Stifle Freedom of Expression.\" Salt Lake Tribune [Detroit] 18 Apr. 2002: F2. Opposing Viewpoints in Context.Web. 10 Feb.2014.\" clearly agrees. 3. Removes the status symbol associated with flashy clothes...arguably nobody can display how high their status are with school uniforms, a clear down side. 4. Bring a sense of uniformity & unity among pupils...Perhaps it is too much of a unity, almost like robots! As shown in \"Dolan, Maura. \"CALIFORNIA; Court Rejects School's Shirts; Judges Say Requiring Students to Wear the School's Motto Is a Free-Speech Violation.\" Los Angeles Times [Los Angeles] 15 Feb. 2014: AA3. Elibrary. Web. 21 Feb. 2014.\" The parent openly disagrees, stating \"I believe we should...advance independent, creative thinkers -- not standardized, uniformed thinkers.\" Frudden said. \"To do anything less is to do our children and our society a disservice.\" 6. Save parents money...As shown from \"Brosnan, Peter, and Alexis Brindley. \"What Not to Wear:... Styles and Colors.\" Current Events, a Weekly Reader Publication.\", parents are unsatisfied with the school uniform prices, indicating that school uniforms don't exactly save parents money. They would not complain if the school uniforms actually saved money! 7. Uniforms also enable students to get ready for school faster...again, very arguable. Students could change clothes at night and go to school at the same pace of another student who has a school uniform. 8. Uniforms enable students to self express....NO, they do NOT! As I said before, the uniform sends messages of anti-individuality, the exact opposite of expressing one-self! In addition, emblems are heavily disdained, as shown in \"Dolan, Maura. \"CALIFORNIA; Court... Violation.\" Los Angeles Times [Los Angeles].\" and 9. Enable children to make friends... instead of what you wear....You have given no evidence that children base other children on what they wear. 10. ...uniforms reduces bullying...A person's clothes really have nothing to do what goes on. If someone isn't very smart or physically capable they will still get bullied regardless of the fact that they look the same as everyone else. Good luck making your rebuttal!",

Many thanks to my opponent for starting early.A sense of discipline given by a school uniform isn't necessary, as children should be disciplined at home by their parents. When a group wears a uniform e.g. at work, or in the army, it reinforces the idea that the group is part of a team. However at school, a child's primary goal is not to work well as a team but to become a competant individual, able to complete coursework and exams on their own, and think entirely on their own.Schools do set team excersises e.g. quizes, challenges, and have sport acticities. But again there is no need for students to wear the same uniform, even when playing footabll it is not necessary to be given bibs because there are no spectators! It is not difficult to remember who is on your team when a captain from each side picks his players, and when you're familiar with fellow students. The sole purpose of uniforms is to diminish competition by allowing teams to be created randomly (i.e. unfairly), which is a bad thing. Children should not be forced to have pride in their school. Not every school is great. They should be able to buy clothing with a logo just like any other club to freely express their pride. Also why should students waer a tie, do up the top button on their shirt, or even wear a shirt? if it makes them feel uncomfortable and inhibits their learning? Students should be given reasons to enjoy going to school, not reasons to hate it. They are happier on non-uniform days, why take that away? It seems to me that students must a wear a uniform so they feel like cattle, or something inferior. Is this how students should respect other people, by feeling inferior? I think I've made enough points, I eagerly await your argument, many thanks",

In school, Uniforms won't help students learn more, But learning more is the purpose of school. Uniforms are too much trouble for very little benefit: schools would have to design special dress codes, Lots of students would get in trouble for not wearing uniforms, The schools would have to spend money on making uniforms, Etc. Uniforms in school violate freedom of expression. Students should be allowed to wear what they want as long as it doesn't distract other students. Coming to school in a bikini distracts other students, But not wearing a uniform doesn't. Students should be able to choose what they wear and be fashionable! School would be a very boring place if everybody had the same clothes. Wearing one uniform would be very problematic. If a student spills something on their uniform, They won't be able to come to school until it's washed. If a student rips their uniform, They won't be able to come to school until they get a new one. This is so much trouble that could have been avoided if there were no uniforms in school. Always wearing a uniform will make it dirty, And it will have to be washed all the time. It's better to wear different clothes. Making a uniform mandatory won't help students choose clothes. Nobody is forcing you to choose what to wear, You can wear one tracksuit for the whole year (very similar to a uniform, Heh). Nobody spends hours on putting together outfits, That's nonsense. Forcing others to wear uniforms because you can't choose what to wear to school isn't right. Other students aren't responsible for your issues.",

How can one teacher teach 500 kids at once. Don't blame it on the uniform, it has nothing to do about it. If your new school had a uniform policy it would be number one, but they decide they don't need it and all those intelligent kids aren't being used for they're full potential. If those school have a uniform policy they wouldn't be putting the make up on and combing they're hair, because they would of did it at home because they would spent less time trying to choose what they should wear to school. No, the kids at your new school care about they're cloths. You just don't see it because your all caught up in your clothes not on other people and your school work. Why would tensions escalate if everybody is wearing the same thing, no one is above or below anyone in their fashion. Fights don't start when kids are all wearing the same thing. They only start when one person knows the other kid is wearing something better than them and take the first blow. Think about it would you start a fight with someone who is wearing the same clothing or someone who keeps bragging about how much richer they're families and how stupid you're cloths look. In my school there's a uniform policy and a lot of rich kids. All the kids are wearing the same thing so you can't tell who's rich and who's not. Students at the school I go to there are no rich cliques to bully the poor kids or poor tough kids that get angry real easy and start fights. Also uniforms are good for the children's parents. Why, uniform cost a lot and schools require you to get them. In a school without uniform policy parents have to buy more cloths which cost more money and time to get them. Wearing one thing for the whole entire year is much cheaper for the parents and helps the child go to school faster.",

            "premise": "Here is the cost of common articles of clothing that compose a typical school uniform. (http://www.target.com...) Boys Shirt 8$ (http://www.target.com...) Boys shorts 3-5$ Boys long pants 14$ I know these aren't a universal standard and the costs vary but the fact that a major corporation sells school uniforms shows that many schools have their students buy articles of clothing from here. Walmart, known for their extraordinarily low prices sells pollo shirts for 6$ each. (http://www.walmart.com...) Wal-mart t-shirts barely beats the prices that major national retail outlets charge for school uniforms. Now I actually provided links to where I got my price figures, unlike you, where you fail to show where even one school charges 250 dollars for a uniform. This is even assuming that most students buy their clothes from Wal-Mart, which they don't. They buy from Abercrombie, American Eagle, Hollister, which sell simple T-shirts for as much as 20$ Hollister prices for simple T-shirts (http://www.hollisterco.com...) Abercrombie prices for simple T-shirts (http://www.abercrombiekids.com...) I buy from Wal-Mart and Target and my family is okay financially, but I've met several students who live in shammy houses and have closets full of designer jeans, and over-priced T-shirts. Americans are well off and paying on average 8$ for a uniform shirt is not unreasonable. It really doesn't matter what students like or dislike. I hated math, still had to take math. Therefore you statement \"students do not like to wear the same thing over again\" is irrelevant. Some students like knives, I for one like guns, others like tobacco. Who cares? You can't bring those on campus. You've had 3 rounds now to explain how what students like meant that it was necessarily good for them and you have not. Regarding teachers and uniforms, that's something you forgot to bring up. I am not the instigator, you made the claims for me to refute and when you don't mention one, that is your fault. Schools aren't looking to instil discipline or responsibility in their instructors, why would they make them wear uniforms? It also separates student from instructor. This also occurs in the military in a similar form. An enlisted man does not wear the same clothes as an officer nor do enlisted men have the same privileges. Giving those in command of one another more privileges and freedoms is good at defining the separation between the two parties. My parents could stay up past 9:00 when I was 8, I couldn't ,was that bias or a violation of my rights? Does that mean I shouldn't have had a bedtime when I was 8? The answer to both of those questions is no. And again, on someone elses property, you don't have the right to wear what you want. Unless you own the school you have no right to decide what they you should be able to wear. \"some kids don't wear the school uniform at all and then teachers spend 10 minutes in class just because of a kid that has a family who can't afford the uniform Spend 10 minutes in class doing what? I'm going to have to assume you meant scolding the student for not wearing a uniform. 1. School uniforms are that much more expansive then the cheapest apparel around and are much cheaper then what kids wear when they decide what is in fashion. 2. Schools always work something out with families unable to afford certain services. 2a. Most people can afford a school uniform easily 2b. The few that can't work out plans with the school regarding payment and economic assistance. Many schools, due to budget cuts, ask students themselves to print out their own homework because schools can't afford the ink and paper themselves. When a student didn't have a printer or the money to print out packets and booklets from the school, manage to either pay a reduced fee or pay nothing at all to get the necessary learning material. This is what will happen with school uniforms. Then you have to abide by the rules your local school. Simply because you don't like a certain policy a certain private or public entity enforces does not mean you have the right to change that policy to fit what you \"like\". There are several fast food buildings that don't sell food to people who don't meet a certain dress code. If a woman walks in without shoes or a man walks in without a shirt, they can't buy a hamburger. Does that mean McDonald's should be forced to change it's rules to comply with those that don't wish to follow it and can't get a hamburger anywhere else. You have failed to show where a uniform costs 300 dollars per while I posted sites showing that uniforms were actually very reasonably priced and in many cases cheaper than what most kids wear. You have also failed to post a single instance where a family actually went into debt due to expensive uniforms. Audience, my opponents ONLY sources come from assumptions, and personal experiences, mainly regarding the claims he makes about uniform costs. I posted a site showing what a major retail outlet sold uniforms for and compared them to stores that sold cheap clothes and stores that sold clothes most children wear. Regardless or your position on this topic, my opponent \"research\" was inferior to mine. I already agreed in the first round that bullying would still remain, I said that students would be more disciplined and more focused resulting in higher grades and here are my sources to back up my claim. Here are a couple articles reporting on studies showing how attendance records and graduation rates improved (http://www.woio.com...) (http://findarticles.com...) Here is a list of which countries perform the best in mathematics. (http://nces.ed.gov...) The top 5 countries in 8th grade math are, in order Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Honk Kong, and Japan. All of these countries have school uniforms. Audience, my opponents sources were hearsay, personal accounts, and can not necessarily be verified. His arguments which derive from these supposed \"sources\" are therefore flawed and with out base. I realize most of you probably agree school uniforms are bad and I'm not even sure where I really stand on this issue in real-life. But to vote for Pro who offered no verifiable sources, built his entire arguments on these unverifiable sources, would be an insult to your own position.",

            "conclusion": "Should schools have a Uniform",
            "premise": "I am arguing that school uniforms should never be in place at a school. I will look at this from three aspects: the legal aspect, the interpersonal aspect, and the intrapersonal aspect. Firstly, school uniforms infringe upon the individual's constitutional right to express themselves. In the Supreme Court case Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (7-2, 1969), ruled that everyone, including minors, have the right to express themselves. They also ruled that though the students were on the public school campus, they still had that right under the First Amendment. Not only should schools not have uniforms, they cannot by law have uniforms. School Uniforms also don't provide any benefits in any way. This is a direct passage straight from the article \"Pro & Con Arguments: \"Should Schools Adopt School Uniforms?\" that states and provides proof for the negative effect of the school uniform policy: \"A 2007 peer-reviewed study found that \"school uniforms increased the average number of assaults by about 14 [per year] in the most violent schools.\" A 1999 Texas Southern University study found that school discipline incidents rose by about 12% after the introduction of uniforms. According to the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Education Evaluation and Management, fights in middle schools nearly doubled within one year of introducing mandatory uniforms. David L. Brunsma, PhD, Professor of Sociology at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), co-authored a study that analyzed a national sample of 10th graders and found \"no effects of uniforms on absenteeism, behavioral problems (fights, suspensions, etc.), or substance use on campus\" and \"no effects\" on \"pro-school attitudes, academic preparedness, and peer attitudes toward school.\" Brunsma also found a \"negative effect of uniforms on academic achievement,\" and later found that uniforms were equally ineffective on elementary students and eighth graders. A 2009 peer-reviewed study found \"no significant effects of school uniforms on performance on second grade reading and mathematics examinations, as well as on 10th-grade reading, mathematics, science, and history examinations... [I]n many of the specifications, the results are actually negative.\"\" This has scientific proof that if school uniforms relate at all with the behavior of the minors in school, it has a negative effect. Also, the pro side of this debate may argue that school uniforms disavow socioeconomic differences. However, within two months, the people who can only afford one school uniform have a tattered uniform, only emphasizing the socioeconomic difference. Again, in a 2007 survey of the Long Beach Unified School District reported: \"81% of middle school students said uniforms did not reduce fights, 76% said they did not help them fit in at school, 69% said they did not make them feel more connected with the school community, and 71% said they felt no safer traveling to and from school.\" Lastly, school uniforms effect the student's view of themselves. They can have a detrimental effect on a person's self-image. School uniforms allow students to compare themselves to one another much easier, and most often provides a less-than-encouraging statement to the students. Also, it encourages conformity rather than diversity. The United States of America is based upon diversity. Without it, we would not be the same country today, and most likely not even a country. They might be learning about Booker T. Washington or Rosa Parks, who changed their country through being different, when they are not even allowed to express themselves in a different way than one another.

            "conclusion": "Private Schools Should Have Their Students Wear Uniforms",
            "premise": "1. Yes, my opponent has pin-pointed the central cause to self consciousness, or rather, he has pin-pointed the scientific explanation for self consciousness; he has not however, affectively refuted the fact students who cannot keep up with the latest trends or wear quality clothing are going to be more likely to feel self consciousness about themselves. My opponent didn\u2019t actually refute that these factors may cause self consciousness, rather he attempted to refute the factors that cause self consciousness by giving the explanation as to why those factors cause self consciousness. My opponent\u2019s argument may go as follows: P1. Not keeping up with the latest trends or wearing low quality clothing may cause self consciousness. P2. This self consciousness is explained by hormones. C1. Therefore hormones cause self consciousness, and not any other factor. This logic though, is flawed in that premise two only provides an explanation for premise one, whereas my opponent assumes that premise two follows premise one and thus leads to the conclusion. Since premise two does not lead into the conclusion, the conclusion therefore is also flawed. A logically sound argument when be provided like so: P1. Not keeping up with the latest trends or wearing low quality clothing may cause self consciousness, which is explained by hormones. C1. Therefore not keeping up with the latest trends or wearing low quality clothing is a factor explaining self consciousness among some teens. Biased source? My opponent makes the claim that my source is biased because it is a website that sells school uniforms. This is not an adequate basis for dismissing my source. Just because a source may be potentially biased does not mean that the source is wrong. Until my opponent can show that the information the source itself provides is flawed, the source should be used to support my argument. 2. My opponent has made an argument fallacy from personal experience. Since personal experience cannot be trusted as a legitimate source or even a norm, my opponent\u2019s argument is therefore null. The fact remains that students may be distracted by the free dress clothing of other students. Implementing school uniforms eliminates this potential distraction. 3. My opponent drops this argument on the inadequate claim that my source is biased, without any proof that it is biased or any proof that the information within the source is flawed. In addition, the argument does not even require a source for proof, since it is an argument derived from logic and not from statistics. This argument can be considered dropped by my opponent. 4. It is irrelevant whether and actual instance has occurred in which a man intrudes onto a school campus and is not identified because there is no uniforms policy (although I am sure something like this as happened). What is relevant is that such a thing can happen, and this has been recognized by school administrators also. [1] The existence of cliques and gangs however, may be deterred in that school uniforms will make them look physically equal to everyone around them, as opposed to them using clothing (such as bandanas with certain colors in gangs) to off-set themselves from everyone else. 5. My opponent\u2019s own argument works against him. He states, \u201cThey do not pick their targets based on what they wear, but whether if they can dominate and humiliate them.\u201d What my opponent does not realize, is that bullies can easily take advantage of a student\u2019s self consciousness over their clothing and use it against them therefore humiliating them. They use a student\u2019s clothing in order to dominate that student. A bully will choose their victim to be a sub-assertive kid of course, but they can use the clothing of a sub-assertive kid as a way to bully that kid. Uniforms eliminate this problem. 6. My opponent claims that this argument contradicts arguments 1, 3, and 4, yet I do not see how any of those arguments are relevant to this one at all. Self expression and self identity is not a bad thing. The bad thing is judging others over what they wear, and not who they are. Implementing school uniforms eliminates problems and encourages students to express themselves in ways that are true to who they are, and allows students to base others off who they are and not what they own. My opponent wrongly states that students will always form into cliques and derogate others for not being a part of their click. Implementing school uniforms eliminates a material inequality among students, which is good because students should not base others off of material goods. 7. I read the entire report on school uniforms and student behavior and to put it quite bluntly, my opponent has misrepresented and falsely stated what study reports. For one, I am not arguing that school uniforms improve academic achievement, because they don\u2019t. The study my opponent presented confirms the Long beach Study I presented, stating that the only flaw in it is that the study could have been in act for a few more years in order to draw a clearer correlation. In addition, the other study presented in the report also finds a correlation between school uniforms and reduced behavioral problems including less weapon related incidents and less incidents related to alcohol, drugs, and gangs. In particular, the studies found that bad behavior was reduced more in middle schools, as opposed to high schools. After looking through the entire source my opponent used to support his position, I found no mention of the study conducted by Michigan that finds no correlation between school uniforms and student behavior. I have used eight sources and about three studies proving that there is a correlation between school uniforms and a reduction in behavioral problems among student which contests with my opponent\u2019s one study (which I couldn\u2019t find in the source he presented) claiming there is no correlation. Just a reminder not to post any new arguments in the last round (standard debate conduct, although you may of course provide rebuttals) and I\u2019d like to thank my opponent for a great debate. Over to you. 1. http://triblive.com...",

Because students have the right to a free education, if the school wanted the kids to wear uniforms then they must pay for it. Now lets look at a school system like mine with about 10,000 students. According to learningin21 \"Uniform tops cost $26.99, uniforms bottoms cost $34.99 or $44.99, pullovers cost $39.99 and vest cost $35.99.\" Now each child will need about 3 outfits. This will cost a public school system greatly. Like I said, because you cannot deny children access to public education, the school system must pay for students who cannot afford these uniforms. Please keep in mind that I am only talking about public schools here. Private schools wearing uniforms is a totally different issue. :)",

            "conclusion": "Puclic Schools Should Require Uniforms",
            "premise": "The debate of whether public schools should require uniforms is forever an ongoing, and often a touchy subject. However, I feel it is vital that public school students be required to wear a school uniform. Especially in this economy, it's important that money be saved wherever and whenever for families struggling to make ends meet. Requiring students to wear uniforms would, in the long run, save parents or guardians a boat load of money. Rather than having to buy their children a plethora of expensive clothing, the parents would simply purchase a few uniforms that the children would wear five days out of the week. The amount of \"regular\" clothes they would be forced to purchase would significantly decrease, allowing for parents to use that money elsewhere. Children often desire expensive shoes, shirts, and pants (not to mention accessories). Because their children do indeed need clothing to wear to school, parents are often roped into buying their children over priced clothing. Children want to fit in with the latest craze, often prompting parents to have to shell out thousands on Uggs, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Juicy Couture \u2013 for example \u2013 when that is just not necessary. If uniforms were enforced in public schools, children wouldn't be as fascinated with the latest crazes, for all of the students would be wearing the same things anyway. Money would also be saved in the sense that children and students could get multiple years out of the uniforms. For example, I'm a college freshman and still often wear some articles of clothing I wore in the seventh grade. After puberty, most students won't do much growing and could even get most of their high school careers out of the uniforms. Even at the least, students could get two years out of the uniforms, which would cause parents not to have to keep spending money year after year on clothing because the children's clothing from the last year went out of style. Also to be considered is that if the uniforms don't change for multiple years, parents could save the uniforms and give them to younger siblings of the same gender to wear, which would help them save even more money! The uniforms could also be considered lucrative for the public schools themselves for they can make a small profit from the purchasing of the uniforms and use that money to improve things around the school. Requirng public school students to wear school uniforms is a simple way for public schools to make money, as we all know that is extremely dire in this world today. Requring public school students to wear school uniforms proves to be quite lucrative for all of those involved. Businesses that make school uniforms would prosper as well, which would help in job creation. Those companies and businesses that students currently wear wouldn't suffer too much damage either, for they often make clothing for all ages, and a small decrease shouldn't hurt much.",

            "premise": "As per your statement about students being more intelligent and efficient if they have uniforms, that is a common misconception. I point to Memphis City Schools as my evidence. Cordova High School has a very strict uniform policy, yet a very high fail rate. I know because I attended that school for two years. Out of the 500 people in my class, only half were passing. At my new school, we have no uniform policy, yet, it is praised as one of the top 5 schools in the State of Kentucky. You are also wrong when you say, \"When schools have uniforms kids focus more on they're studies not on they're clothes or how they look.\" Once again, I use MCS as my evidence. Every single day, girls would come into class and put on their makeup and guys would comb their hair with their hair picks, in total disregard for what the policy states. At my new school, everyone does their work and they don't really care about what other people are wearing. Kids are not friendlier when there is a uniform policy in place. In fact, students are more hostile. In the minds of students, they are being forced wear something that they do not want to. Because they feel like they are being forced to do something, tensions can escalate quickly. At Cordova High, fights were almost an everyday thing.",

Wearing school uniforms can cause stress on a student to dress and act like everyone else in order to abide by the rules. Public Schools should not be able to enforce uniform dress codes because they are free institutions open to all. Uniforms cannot be totally enforced in public schools because it can then violate the open policy of accepting students. Students who cannot economically afford a student uniform can become discouraged from attending school and feel unwelcome. Student Uniforms do little to improve a students education. If students aren't distracted by their clothing choices they will find something else to get side tracked with. Student mandated uniforms will take away from student expressive individuality. Some students express themselves through their clothing choices and find common interests with others based on shared fashion choices. If a student can\"t express themselves through their outfit choices their personal identity and individuality is compromised. Thought school uniforms would aim at increasing students success, the solution is too controlling and the benefits wont out weight the means. If all students are forced to wear uniforms what would be next? Administrative approved backpacks?",

            "conclusion": "High School / Secondary school Students should be required to wear a uniform",
            "premise": "In almost all government schools in the USA, uniform is not required, whereas there are few schools in the UK, private or government, that allow students to wear anything they like (usually a loose dress code applies). I will be arguing in favour of all high schools and secondary schools to make uniform compulsory. There are my main arguments. Having a uniform creates a sense of community Especially in larger schools, (800+ students) many teens feel left out, or that they don't belong. Having a uniform unites all the students, and shows that even though the school's population may be high, all the students are equal, which brings me on to my next point. Especially in government schools where there is a wide range of financial status between students, many may feel unhappy or left out if they can't afford more expensive clothes. Imagine how low a teenager's self esteem can be if most the girls or boys in their class show up to school in expensive or branded clothes, and they can maybe only afford clothes from supermarkets? This can cause many problems for the student. As I mentioned, feeling as though they are \"poorer\" than other students can really lower a student's self esteem, which isn't healthy for a teenager, or anyone for that matter. Secondly, if the student feels under pressure to wear certain brands to school, they may spend all their pocket money (if applicable) and wages (if they have a part time job) on expensive clothes rather than things they need such as stationary or study guides. Thirdly, as I mentioned; students can be subjected to bullying if they are not wearing \"cool clothes\" and this can cause psychological problems for the student later in life. Thirdly and finally, I believe that the media (movies, TV shows etc) really expresses how a student's clothing matches their personality. For example, \"goth kids\" wear dark clothes and lots of black eyeliner, and \"theatrical kids\" wear colourful retro clothes, or whatever. Some kids may feel like they don't belong in a certain friendship group or clique, because they can't afford or don't want to wear the kind of clothes the other people in the group wear. I believe that students should join friendship groups based on their personality, and not whether they have the right clothes to join. Thank you for reading my argument.",

Another point, you mentioned how: \"Students will have their first amendment, granted to them at birth, infringed.\" The Bill of Rights was granted at birth, but it will not be infringed. There are free dress days. Students can also wear whatever they want outside of school. Not all children get a proper education, the ones who do have the chance are educated.

            "premise": "My Arguments:-Uniforms ensure equality among students. If children wear uniforms then they cannot be judged by what they wear. [1]-Uniforms make students less self-conscious of their appearance. Students would not have to have to stand in front of the mirror for half an hour every morning to decide if their outfit is good enough or what outfit to wear. This argument can be applied to many students, especially girls.-It shows signs of respect and politeness. You show respect to your school and teachers when you wear uniforms.-Uniforms save money. When you only have to wear two outfits a week that aren't your school uniform, you can have a more limited selection of clothing. You do not have to buy as much clothing, and therefore, you save money. In low income areas, uniforms would be a good idea because parents wouldn't have to worry about buying all sorts of new clothing for their children and children wouldn't feel pressured to have new cloth items to fit in because everyone would have the same clothing as they did.-Uniforms enforce discipline. Students are made to wear uniforms instead of whatever they want.-Teachers don't have to worry about dress code. Things to worry about in dress code:hats/hoodsreally short shorts/skirtsetc...If there are uniforms then everybody will be dressed appropriately. This would give teachers one less thing to worry about.-It helps prepare students for their future jobs. Students learn how to dress appropriately for work. If they dress in t-shirts and jeans while they go to school then they might think that this would be OK to do when they go into jobs as adults. If this is what they learn at school, then this is what students would do as adults. I understand that there is always a good chance that parents might teach students how to dress appropriately but this doesn't always happen. [2]-School uniforms could lower the cases of bullying within schools. In many cases kids are insulted and picked on because of the clothes they wear and how they look. If all students wear the same thing it would be very hard almost impossible to make fun of someone who is wearing the same thing as you.-Making all children wear school uniforms would make them put more focus on school work. Kids wouldn't be constantly looking at what others are wearing and thinking about what they should be wearing. In addition to this, students often waste a lot of time shopping. If students had to wear uniforms then they wouldn't need/want to shop as much since there would never be a chance to wear the as much cloths.-Uniforms save water. This might seem like an odd argument at first site. However if you think about it, this argument would start to make more sense. Students would only have 2 uniforms per weak and wouldn't have as much chance to wash them. Today, many students wear one pair of jeans, one t-shirt, and one sweater per day and wash seven pairs of all three items every day. Students wouldn't have 5 uniforms (one for each school day) and as a result, a lot of water would be saved.-What studies show. Some studies show that school uniforms might help attendance and graduation rates.Studies show that having students wear uniforms would help them get through school. \"...reported that mean graduation rates rose nearly 11 percent at schools that required uniforms, compared to pre-uniform years. Non-uniform school mean graduation rates dropped 4.6 percent, compared with the earlier years.\" [link below]http://www.19actionnews.com...The negative sides of uniforms:I agree that there are several negative sides to wearing uniforms. I will state some of them now and I will also state my arguments that oppose these points.-Students wouldn't get the freedom to choose what they want to wear. My response:People's lives must have some limits. Children and teens may want to wear whatever they like and would be very unhappy if they were forced to wear uniforms. However I showed that students would benefit from being forced to wear uniforms and that benefit is more important than freedom.-Students wouldn't be able to express themselves properly.My response:This is true. People are often judged by how they dress. If a student is dressed neatly and has clean clothes every day then teachers may think differently of that student than they would think of somebody who constantly has sagging jeans and dirty clothes. I haven't really responded to any of my opponents arguments since my opponent has not yet had the chance to state any. I simply stated my opinion and position on what I think my opponent's arguments will be in the next round.Conclusion:I have provided many arguments that support the idea of having uniforms at school. Although uniforms may be unpopular with many people, they are not a bad idea. Studies support my thinking. The future of students should be put in front of what individual stunts want to wear. Students would be more successful if they did not get the option of deciding what to wear every to school. After all, students can always wear whatever they want on the weekends. Weekends are for students to do what they want. I await arguments and/or responses from my opponent.Sources:http://www.angelfire.com...http://www.ehow.com...",

            "premise": "R1 & R2 & R3The Department of Education recieves $58,556,223,831 [1]. This is distributed according to the need of each school. There is enough funds to pay $12,979 per student per year [2]. The rest is for utilities. Funding for public education is at a all-time high [3]. They do not need more funds; they already have enough. My opponnet states the following:'kids could reuse their regular outfits, but trends for students change basically over night. Parents would have to continue buying new brands of shirts, shoes and pants more frequently than they would have to purchase uniforms.'While this is probably true, it is not the job of the schools to clothe children; it is the job of the parents. Clothing differences are going to be the way in their future, and the sooner they learn that the better. My opponnet goes on to say:'Some students may protest, yes, but tat can not be said for every student. One boy wearing a skirt to school to protest uniforms isn't enough to suggest students as a whole hate the idea of school uniforms. I'm sure students who are picked on for their clothing wouldn't mind uniforms, for they would be wearing the same clothing as the people who pick on them.'However, I gave more then just one piece of evidence. I gave numerous proves and events that the majority of students do not want uniforms. I mean since when does one size fit all? Just because a few students can't get the right clothes or are bullied does not mean the government should make everyone that goes to a public school wear the samething whether they want to or not. The majority of students hate the very idea of uniforms. Just because a few are not comfortable does not mean it is right to make the vast majority uncomforable.My opponent claims: 'In a survey conducted at Roy Gumm 80% of parents liked the school uniform requirements.'What about the other 20% of the parents and nearly all of the students? It is absolutely wrong to enforce things on the few that do not agree with it. Also. bear in mind that the researcher was researching for EIGHT YEARS. That usually means it's a more accurate study. D1: Forcing kids to dress alike will only help create more followers than leaders.Even minors understand how much outer appearance effects how they are seen by their peers and society as a whole. This is the whole point why the majority of students are opposed to uniforms. They see the only time to wear what they want and express themselves through appearance is in danger of being taken away. To take it away just because of a few extra bucks or a few 'oddballs' is just not right.D2: Uniforms are unconstitutional.Yes, because students are going to agree on every single issue, phrase, word, book, etc. (end of sarcasm). Each student is unique in just about every way. Whether that be in the words they use or the shirt they where. This includes opinions. Just because one or some students find one thing offensive does NOT mean it is just to punish the rest of the students in every single school for that. It is not the job of schools to crack down on divisions, they are only there to teach. I will now await my opponent's response.[1]http://wiki.answers.com...[2]http://en.wikipedia.org......[3]http://www.spokesman.com...",

If a student isn't being bullied about their clothing they could get picked on for what shoes they wear or what accessories or backpack they have. School Uniforms don't create a safer environment but instead enforce a more hostile one. Students who violate the uniform dress code can be taken out of instructional time based on their outfit. Some students might also stress over having enough uniforms or how much money they spent on their uniform, these feelings exist with both regular clothing and uniform apparel. While uniform policies try to even the playing field among students, students find ways to break the dress code or modify their uniform to outshine each other. Uniforms don't even the playing field instead they create a whole other playing field that students still compete on. School uniforms enforce unrealistic expectations of unity amongst a large number of people. In the real world you don\"t dress exactly the same as the person next to you. Everyone strives to be their own person in society and one way of showcasing your individuality is through uniforms. Students can begin to lose a sense of individuality by continuously looking like everyone else. Students should have the right to express themselves through their choice of dress as long as it abides by the safety dress code regulations. Uniforms can\"t fix the bigger picture of creating a safer environment for students to attend.",

            "premise": "The bullying is still going to go on. Are school uniforms good or bad? This question has created debates in many schools. There are many different reasons for school uniforms. Some say that school uniforms represent discipline and obedience while others say it prevents creativity and individuality. The following essay will explain the advantages and disadvantages of uniforms. If your school doesn\"t have uniforms, you have experienced those days when you couldn\"t decide what to wear. With Uniforms, you wouldn\"t spend time in the morning choosing what to wear. You will pay less attention on clothes and you can concentrate more on your studies. Uniforms help us to develop self-discipline and obedience. If you go to a job interview wearing baggy clothes, most probably you wouldn\"t get the job. Another advantage of wearing uniforms is that students won\"t buy fashionable and expensive clothes which will save money. Also, wearing uniforms can help some students to avoid uneasiness from the side of their classmates. Sometimes students feel embarrassed if they are wearing cheap clothes. They will feel comfortable if everybody is wearing the same thing. It might be annoying for some people if they wear the same thing everyday. Uniforms prevent originality of a student. If you wear the clothes you want, it might show your personality and give you confidence. Some students want to be different than others. Uniforms makes you blend with others. The people who are different than others are usually the creative ones. I do not prefer uniforms because they are uncomfortable. If you are uncomfortable during school, it would be hard for you to study. It would be difficult to play sports and games in uniforms. In your casual clothing you have the freedom to wear clothes of your own choice. This is why many people prefer normal clothes",

            "premise": "This debate has come down to 3 things: 1. Violation of rights 2. Grades of students who wear uniforms 3. Personal experience We forgot to mention in the debate that the cost of non-uniform clothing is less than of uniform clothing. This is another flaw with uniforms. The flaw is that low-income families cannot afford uniforms, because the cost of uniforms are 250 dollars, which means kids that already buy lots of clothes will get even bigger expenses and lower-income and unemployed families cannot afford it. They can`t wear something that expresses their interests, they can not wear anything that expresses their emotions and other things. Students do not like to wear the same thing over and over again, which is why I only know of 1 school with uniforms within 50 miles of me, and that is a catholic school and those uniforms are ugly. The strict dress code policies are to prevent non-existent problems at most schools. At the high school with uniforms, I still heard the f-bomb on the way back to the bus to pick us up from the field trip. This is because school uniforms DO NOT impact the behavior of many kids. If you took a group of bullies and made everyone wear white polo shirts, it wouldn't stop them from being a bully, it would just mean bullies in white polo shirts. As far as the US service academies go, this is about public schools or high schools with uniforms, not academies. It`s obvious they have too though, because they will be wearing the SAME uniform in the military, and even then, some jobs have no uniforms, just a dress code like my school does. Our dress code lets us wear any color or anything as long as it is not too revealing and does not contain references to drugs, alcohol and violence, among other inappropriate references. Simple dress code, and only 2 or 3 bullies in the whole school. Another thing my opponent forgot is how teachers don't have to wear the uniforms and the students do. That is total bias. It's the fault of the parents if a kid in a normal clothing school puts on a inappropriate t-shirt with drug references or something like that, not the school, because the parents should have checked the kids t-shirt if it did happen, and not let it slip. I wasn't forced to follow the rules they set because I am not a part of the school, and the dress code at the school ONLY applied to students, not visitors like us who were just going on a field trip with about 5 other public schools in the area who were my age and watched 'Paper Clips', a movie about the Holocaust. You already forgot to point out two new topics yourself, and I`ll point out my 3rd point you could of found yourself. Some kids drop out of high school or transfer to a one that has no uniforms so they can wear whatever they want, and some kids don't wear the school uniform at all and then teachers spend 10 minutes in class just because of a kid that has a family who can't afford the uniform. What would they do about low-income families? Home schooling would be impossible for my family because my Dad has a big job in a plant in a company with 4 plants in 4 countries, and Mom works as an EA at a public school, so consider that before you tell me if I don't like the uniform idea that I should be home schooled. Another thing with the cost of uniforms is that you need 4-6 uniforms just in case you spill something on it by accident. Let's say there are 5 uniforms that cost 300 dollars, which is actually a realistic price for uniforms. Just to buy 1 uniform and an one just in case, that would already be 600 dollars, and to buy all 5 in case an accident happens on the remaining 4, is 1500 dollars. That would be a pain if I was a low-income or unemployed family. Even worse that you have that much money for uniforms in a time where more and more families have low-income or unemployment from a economic disaster which we are having causing trillions of dollars in debt.

Based on that logic, now that I am in a school without a uniform policy, I am nothing more than a blathering idiot, as well as ever other student in attendance, which is not the case.

There would be almost no crime in Memphis, which is not the case. There would be no fights, which is not the case. Do you see the pattern? Clothing does not change anyone's character. You also say that parents save money by not buying clothes for school, if they wear school uniforms. I say, yet again, that if I buy schools uniforms, which cost more that the eight dollar pair of jeans and the seven dollar t-shirt that I can get from Walmart, I will not be able to buy clothes for use outside of school. But, if I go to a school that has no uniform policy, I can wear the clothes that I already have, instead of having to go and buy clothes specifically for school. I have never known anybody that tries on every piece of clothing that they have before school. I miraculously arrive EARLY to school despite the fact that it does not have a dress policy. (He said sarcastically) In conclusion, clothing has no effect on your character. School uniforms does not save money, because you have to buy twice as many clothes, the uniforms, and clothes for after school. Nobody tries on all of their clothes before school. And oh, by the way, the last time that I pulled a dress out of my closet was never, because my sister prefers to keep her clothes in her own closet.",

            "premise": "Sigh...I've already won this six times. Nevertheless, everyone forfeited at least one round of my 5 serious debates, and Ajab seems to have never forfeited, so I trust that he'll become the first debater to not forfeit one of my serious School Uniform Debates.I define \"required\" as \"forced, mandatory\".You may start on round one. MY OPENING STATEMENTS/ARGUMENTSIn the adult world students have to make their own choices and school uniforms exclude that \"training excercise\" of having to choose what clothes to wear. [1]School uniforms send out a sense of anti-individuality that goes against our personal liberty and freedom of expression. A nation should not go against its beliefs. It would not really matter if this was not in the constitution in the first place, but seriously--the constitution is the basic belief of America, and breaking it is a big blunder! [2]Although school uniforms can bring a sense of unity among students, the unity is too robot-like! As shown in source [3], a parent openly states \"I believe we should...advance independent, creative thinkers -- not standardized, uniformed thinkers.\" Frudden said. \"To do anything less is to do our children and our society a disservice.\"In addition, school uniforms are simply a band-aid on school violence. In fact, in a study published in The Journal of Educational Research, the authors concluded that requiring students to wear uniforms has no direct effect on substance abuse, behavioral problems, or school attendance. Further tests proved the students they studied who were required to wear uniforms actually scored lower on standardized achievement tests than did a comparable group not required to wear them(Brunsma, Rockquemore). [4]This only supports the fact that because uniforms do not allow creativity through expression of clothes, and Albert Einstein once said \"Creativity is intelligence having fun\", this study highlights Einstein's fact and proves both of my argumemts to be correct. In other words, not only do school uniforms have negative impacts as demonstrated, this study also strengthens my argument about the uniform restricting students' creativity. (Einstein's quote is in source [5])As shown from source [1], parents are unsatisfied with the school uniform prices, indicating that school uniforms don't exactly save parents money. They would not complain if the school uniforms actually saved money! This shows school unforms are a financial burden for poor families, and morever, are an unfair additional expense for parents who pay taxes for a free public education. To demonstrate this, on average clothing costs $72.00 per month. [6] In contrast, school uniforms can go all the way up to $156 for boys, $140 for girls, approximately twice as much as money spent in a month. [7] And if the school uniform gets too small or ripped...well, the cost is doubled! This just shows how unfair the cost of school uniforms is.People usually judge other people based on the clothes they wear, I agree, but a person's clothes really have nothing to do what goes on. If someone isn't very smart or physically capable they will still get bullied regardless of the fact that they look the same as everyone else. In other words, bullies can still persist, teasing other students concerning their mental ability instead of physical. Kids might be more likely to be made fun of if they are overachievers. Likewise, kids who struggle academically, or kids with mental disorders, might become easier targets for bullies. [8] Furthermore, not everyone bases people on their clothing. Sure, nobody's like the Beauty from \"Beauty and the Beast\", but everyone can see some desirable traits underneath the ugly face! (No offense, Mr. Beast)There are even more ways for bullies to get to other students if they wear uniform. One example is if a child doesn't feel comfortable in his uniform, his silent cues makes him more likely to be victimized by students who would prey on his insecurities. [8] This actually makes sense, as some students do not dare stand up against these school rules and their poor ability to fight back is practically a lure for bullies!In fact, even those who stand up can be annoying. Without school uniforms, obviously nobody would complain about their lack of freedom. However, in source [9], even though the author completely dismisses the victim and says \"Mike DePinto is wasting time\", this only shows the further complications that school uniforms bring. If school uniforms weren't required in the first place, Mika DePinto would have been happy and not have rebelled. Another example is presented way back in source [3]. Again, if school uniforms weren't required, there would be no need for the arguing over the emblems and all these complex problems would be solved.Onto you, con!

Wearing them can get distracting during the day. Some schools say uniforms make us united as a school, but I don\"t think they do anything but bother students. Simple rules instead of a uniform could easily be put in place. Instead of having uniforms I believe we should just have simple guidelines as to what we can and can\"t wear. Part of being in school is learning to become responsible. How is telling us exactly what to wear teaching us responsibility. We should be able to know how we can and cannot dress without having the privilege completely taken away. Following the guidelines would help to make us responsible because when we get ready to have a career, our clothing will most likely not be completely decided for us. We will have to follow guidelines for that particular company. Having guidelines for how we dress will also help teach us to follow simple directions. With different rules in place we can reclaim our individuality. When wearing uniforms, it is a struggle to be an individual. Teachers are always saying how important it is to just be ourselves and not worry about what others might think. Having a uniform takes that away from us, and this may lead students to try to find other ways to be different. They might begin to act out so they stick out from the crowd. Without uniforms we can show everyone who we are through our clothes. Opinions shouldn\"t be based solely on clothing of course, but clothing is a fun and easy way to show who are. Being different is huge part of being in school and I think we should be able to have the privilege of wearing what we want. It can also give us more confidence.",

Because you are con and your title states \"Against School Uniforms\" that would mean you are against, not having school uniforms. Meaning you are for school uniforms. I am not sure if you purposely did this, but for future reference, remember that Pro means you agree with the title of the debate and Con means you disagree with the title of the debate. Now then, We should not have school uniforms for the following reasons: 1. \"Uniforms violate the student's freedom of speech and expression.\" You are restricting the student's way of expressing themselves which can keep them from sharing themselves and who they are with other people. 2. \"Cost too much for families who already struggle to make ends meet.\" This is a problem for families who would otherwise have their children wear clothes that are cheaper than the school uniform itself. Sometimes every dollar counts for families who already struggle to keep their children in school. 3.\"Emphasize conformity, not individuality, and do not allow students to develop their identity.\" Not everyone is the same, nor does everyone want to be. People want to be their own person! Uniforms restrict students showing their own individuality. 4.\"Hide warning signs that point to problems. Often the way a child dresses can indicate the way he is feeling. Uniforms eliminate these red flags.\" This is self-explanatory. 5. \"Fail to allow students to learn to make good choices based on their own values.\" Children need to make their own choices and learn from their mistakes. Giving everyone a uniform does not teach them what is appropriate to wear in circumstances and what is not. Children need to learn themselves what is appropriate and what is not. Giving them the right to wear their own clothes will allow them to test these boundaries and see what works and what doesn't.",

It would not really matter if this was not in the constitution in the first place, but seriously--the constitution is the basic belief of America, and breaking it is a big blunder! [2]Although school uniforms can bring a sense of unity among students, the unity is too robot-like! As shown in source [3], a parent openly states \"I believe we should...advance independent, creative thinkers -- not standardized, uniformed thinkers.\" Frudden said. \"To do anything less is to do our children and our society a disservice.\"As shown from source [1], parents are unsatisfied with the school uniform prices, indicating that school uniforms don't exactly save parents money. They would not complain if the school uniforms actually saved money!People usually judge other people based on the clothes they wear, I agree, but a person's clothes really have nothing to do what goes on. If someone isn't very smart or physically capable they will still get bullied regardless of the fact that they look the same as everyone else. In other words, bullies can still persist, teasing other students concerning their mental ability instead of physical. Furthermore, not everyone bases people on their clothing.

            "premise": "I would like to thank Liberal_moron for accepting this debate. (1) By having school uniforms, you restrict freedom of expression by students. This can closely be related to the case of Tinker vs. Des Moines as they were restricted to what they could wear such as an arm band. By limiting students to a uniform, kids aren't able to freely express their selves. \"compelled conformity to conventional standards of appearance\" does not \"seem a justifiable part of the educational process.\" (2) By using a school uniform, it is promoted that a student has to conform to society and not individuality. It is shown to be a contradictory method when school uniforms are put into place as it contradicts the lesson that is suppose to be taught. Students learn everyday about history and how people were able to freely express their selves. By setting a standard of a school uniform, it reverses the process and starts an upbringing that students are no longer free. (3) By statistics, it is shown that violence and bullying did not reduce in numbers but actually increased. \"A 2007 peer-reviewed study found that \"school uniforms increased the average number of assaults by about 14 [per year] in the most violent schools.\" More assault and bullying cases seem to occur when school uniforms are brought into standard. While kids can try to think that they will be victim less inside their school, there is still the worry that kids from other schools that don't have uniforms may target them. (4) My last point I would like to argue is that school uniforms can have a detrimental effect on a student's self image. By allowing school uniforms, more students are prone to embarrassment by not only their peers but even by adults. By giving students a specific uniform, it allows them to be targeted at their insecurities. Having a school uniforms shows that the learning experience is more disrupted than without having a uniform.",

            "premise": "First of all, thank you stew95 for accepting my debate. You said, \"if you were to go to school without a uniform then anyone could easily walk in a do anything!\" However, I disagree with the exclusiveness of this applying to only schools without unifroms. Anyone with enough money for a school uniform could go buy one, then walk in. The same thing happens in Boy Scouts. Last summer, when we went to Scout Camp, they made us check in for wristbands, as well as wear the uniform, so they knew A) we were scouts, and B) we had checked into a campsite that was reserved. So obviously, the unifrom doesn't actually prove you are a student. A student I.D. would be more effective. For your second argument, \"i mean it would also cause alot of groups/gangs because you could tell who is gothic, neddy, ect...\" I believe you meant that it would NOT cause the gangs/groups you mentioned. i disagree, for the following reason: if you want to do something, and you are prohibited, will you not try to find a loophole to try and get around that hole? If a gang wants to make itself seperate, they will give themself a different marker than baggy jeans, like bracelets, necklaces, rings, etc. A point I would like to bring up is that of actual education. You may not think that a school uniform can interfere with an education, but consider this: in America,there are an average of 180 school days a year (according to http://ask.yahoo.com...), if you spend even only 20 minutes inspecting a class of thirty students to make sure their uniforms are all being worn correctly, assuming it takes about forty seconds per student, then you have wasted, on average, 2 hours per class the students are inspected in. Now some schools may only do the aforementioned inspection during the first class. Others may do it for all eight periods, adding up to 16 hours. People already complain that education money is being wasted, what will they say when so much time is being wasted on inspection. It doesn't contribute to your education in the slightest. I await my opponents next argument.",

            "premise": "I believe that school uniforms should be required because they promote discipline, school spirit, reduce non-academic distractions, less stress on parents/ guardians, safety, and bullying. I will now explain my reasoning. Discipline: If an adult wore a slobbish outfit to work, they would not have the energy or will to behave professionally. The same goes for students. If a student is wearing whatever they find in their closet, they will not want to try as hard as they normally do. Wearing uniforms will cause students to pay better attention and \"earn\" the uniform. School Spirit: When all students are wearing the same outfit, they will feel a sense of unity, even if they do not know any other people. Reduce Non-Academic Distractions: \"As kids mature and begin to form self-identities, designer status symbols become more and more important as they try fit in with their peers. All too often, children are bullied if they can\"t afford the new designer jeans or the latest name brand shoes. Uniforms minimize socioeconomic status between students by removing the option for different types of clothing. In addition, school administrators spend less time tending to dress code infractions, as the rules are clear and concrete.\" See source. Also, it will prevent guys from ogling over a girl's cleavage, while preventing girls from staring at a guy's butt. Keeping the distraction off of the other gender will allow for kids to pay better attention on the assignment. Less Stress on Parents/Guardians: \"After taking a shower, waking up the kids, making breakfast, checking emails, putting in a load of laundry, making snacks for later, brushing teeth, and combing hair, the last thing any parent wants to do is have an early morning battle over what their child is going to wear to school that day. Uniforms reduce morning stress by making the process of getting dressed a no brainer. Students know exactly what they can and cannot wear leaving parents with only one concern\" when is the last time those pants were washed? Besides having one less thing to fight about, parents also benefit from not having to buy their children expensive, designer clothes for schools. In the cooler months, students simply add approved outwear and girls add tights or leggings to their basic uniform. And since uniforms do not vary from year to year, students can wear their uniforms for more than one year without fear that they are out of style.\" See source. Safety: In a school of standards, anyone who isn't wearing a certain color will stick out as an intruder. Also, on school field trips, any kids who get lost will be easily identified. Bullying: While I understand that wearing one outfit every day will not eliminate bullying, it will be one less thing to not have to worry about. Source: http://www.davidsonacademy.com...",

            "premise": "Thank you for your arguments. As your 1st argument, that it will violate students' freedom of expression, may be true, it can be true in a harmful way. For example, this will stimulate the popularity hierarchy once students could dress whatever they want. The ones with the fancy clothes could easily become the top dogs of the school, which wouldn't happen if uniforms were banned. And the 1st amendment says that yes, there may be freedom of expression, but then why don't we ban uniforms altogether? There are lots of private schools out there that still use uniforms. Why don't we just ban uniforms in those schools? As for your 2nd argument, yes, uniforms are expensive, but normal clothes that popular girls and boys buy to show everyone that they are \"cool\" are also expensive, maybe even more. They buy them in loads. Open any girl's wardrobe and you would find tons of dresses and jeans that would cost much more than 249$, I can assure you. And besides, even if some students do not buy so much clothes, this is still only a one-time thing. They just need to buy it once, and that is it. For just 249$ a kid, we could substantially improve our national debt. A poor family could at least afford 249$ for one kid, and if they can't (which is highly unlikely) they will not be denied the opportunity. The school could pay for them. And finally, for your last argument, that it causes bullying, that is highly unlikely as students will not wear the uniform outside of school. If students want to express themselves, which you had said yourself, then they wouldn't wear the uniforms unless required. Therefore students would only wear them inside school. And even if this is not true, our nation isn't so corrupted that fistfights and riots would break out just because of uniforms. And bullying is mainly inside a single school, not a rival school student picking on another school student. No one would bully a stranger that they don't even know, unless they are a gang member, and gang members don't go to school. Before I end, I would like to add to my previous contentions. Since you have not given me your opinions on my contentions, I assume you agree with me. If not, then please tell me why you do not believe so. 1. Discipline/honor It creates a discipline needed for the real world, and it also gives the atmosphere a more honorable feeling. Students would feel more honored to don their school uniform. It creates a sense of pride. 2. Eliminates popularity system By closing the gaps between the well-dressed students and the poor-dressed students by giving them all a mutual uniform, we are making friendship more easier. A common barrier of friendship is popularity, and popularity is partly caused by clothing. Once students all wear the same uniform, they can accept others for their inside, not outside. 3. Lastly this generates revenue for the government. As my opponent has kindly stated, uniforms cost 249$. Imagine all the schools in the country, with huge numbers of students enrolling, multiplied by 249$. That can generate pretty big revenue. And while this can inflict some financial damage to poor families, it truly does not really hurt them, as 1. They should be able to scrape at least 249$, and 2. if they can't the school will pay for them. Thank you.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting the challenge. It violates the first amendment because it says you have freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Both are not what you lose when you attend a school with no uniform. Racism and genders being discriminated is obviously going to be not allowed, because schools are supposed to be good places, and not places where people use racist terms. My opponent also says uniforms instill good discipline. This is not true, as many people don't wear the uniforms anyway, so therefore, get in trouble for not doing so. Students may look professional, but they might not act professional. I know many who have been forced to wear uniforms and they still saw jerks. Many kids take good care, but like all other clothes, have to be cleaned and it does not work well in the washer and dryer, according to many who have had school uniforms. My source is some of the comments on here about this topic: http://ezinearticles.com... My opponent also says that students tend to perform better. You my friend are wrong. The two biggest high schools in my town are one that has no uniforms, and one that does. The one with no uniform gets better grades than the one that does. Going to public schools, I would still disagree because NONE of the public schools in my town have uniforms, and many of the students are good. And one last thing to bring up, they don't look professional in uniforms. In the high school that wears uniforms (I've been there for a field trip), they are terrible looking uniforms. They didn't even look professional. My clothing was far more professional looking than their uniform.",

While my opponent may be a student, he is not necessarily every student, nor does his status as a student confer upon him any special abilities to discern the advantages and disadvantages of uniforms; and(2) & (3) sampling bias. My opponent has not provided carefully scrutinized statistics but rather his own selective sample of a group of uniformed hooligans. These hooligans may not be representative of the entirety of students who wear uniforms. In addition, the earlier mentioned problem with regards to the elimination of raucous parties appears to be no problem at all if the elimination of such parties preserves the safety of the students. I am sure there are some nice uniform-wearing students in the world, Con. You just need to meet them. Perhaps you could don a uniform and approach them in disguise. If they accept you, the uniforms must be working. As an aside, I went to a school that had a uniform and a school that had a dress code (elementary and high school, respectively). I don't know about all of the students, but I was an okay enough individual. Methinks uniforms might not be the cause of the issues of which you complain.",

            "premise": "I concede that it's not the responsibility of the school to clothes its students. However, requiring uniforms would help both parents and the school out, making it a win-win for everyone. Unfortunately, the money schools receive is not enough. Schools are constantly being faced with budgets cuts and having to cut programs and teachers. While their funds may be at an all time high, it's still not enough to cover each and every expense they are faced with. In New Jersey particularly, budget cuts have left schools unable a thorough and efficient education for its students. since when does one size fit all? I'm sure uniforms would be provided in all shapes to accommodate every kind of student. Just because a few students can't get the right clothes or are bullied does not mean the government should make everyone that goes to a public school wear the same thing. While this could be considered true, it's the government's responsibility to protect the well being of its people. When children's lives are threatened (whether by another person or by themselves) it's imperative to take every measure possible to protect them. If the uniforms in place save even just one bullied student's life, I would consider it a success. In this country especially, majority rules. It's simply the type of voting system in place. 80% vs 20% is an overwhelming majority rule. I concede that an eight year study would hold accurate results, but the results may not be the same for every public school afflicted. Children can find other ways to express themselves besides their clothing, such as hair, activities, jewlery, music, etc. Their identities aren't being stripped. To conclude: Public schools requiring school uniforms is a good idea, and should be practiced. Uniforms can help save parents money in the long run, for they wouldn't have to keep buying their children new, trendy clothes as often as they would if regular outfits were allowed. If the style of uniforms were to stay stagnant, parents could reuse them for their other children. Students would also be able to reuse their uniforms for upwards of three-fours years. School uniforms would help appease the epidemic of bullying. Children would all be wearing the same thing and would no longer be teased for their outfits and what they can't afford to buy. Uniforms would ease some distractions in classes (i.e., outfits revealing too much, offensive slogans) and put the focus on learning, rather than fashion. Uniforms would prepare students for the workplace where there will be strict codes on what they will be able to wear (sort of like uniforms in their own right) All in all, uniforms would be beneficiary to parents, students, and public schools. Thank you for accepting this debate. I look forward to your concluding arguments. http://www.nj.com...",

            "premise": "My first contention is that uniforms improve schools overall-- Uniforms, according to a study done by Virginia Draa, assistant professor at Youngstown State University, found that uniforms in schools increased attendance, graduate numbers, and decreased suspension rates. What we can derive from this information is he following. Schools in which uniforms are institutionalized have students who are more academically productive, disciplined and good citizens of the world, and are studying in a safer environment. Children are the future. They are the future business, political, and social leaders of our world. It is absurd to call that a problem in any way. My second contention is that uniforms are the best solution to bullying-- Bullying is a large problem in schools all over the world. Bullying leads to depression, lower self esteem, academic problems, and in many cases suicide. A study done proves that most bullying incidents occur as result of clothing or apparel. The study shows that kids who may not be able to afford expensive designer clothing become easy targets. Instituting uniforms completely solves this problem. The result of This is a lower in bullying and crime in schools. This helps students focus on their academic, spiritual, and self goals without the distraction of bullies, or worry about their appearance. My third and final contention is that uniforms are good for the economy-- The popular assumption, as my opponent stated, is that using uniforms would give a blow to the textile industry. However it is absolutely incorrect. When uniforms are put in place families must spend money on the uniforms to wear to school. Each school, district, or state may have a different sponsor who provides the uniforms. That boosts those companies' sales. But, children don't only attend school all day, they also have outside activities or just daily wear. The market for textiles doubles! Uniforms and other after school wear. Not only this, but schools and families will result in a more disposable income. Taxpayers will get more out of their schools because the schools will be spending money on improving education, rather than disciplinary measures. All in all, taxpayers get tenant they deserve, and the economy is actually boosted. As my clear reasoning and evidence has proven, uniforms are indeed good for children, our economy, but most of all the world. It would be absurd to call uniforms bad.",

            "premise": "Thank you very much, Westernguy2. Rebuttal to your 1st counter argument, on the freedom and expression: Yes, having expression will not create a disruptive environment, but however, but with uniforms there will be a better environment. There is no harm for freedom of expression, but there is benefits for uniforms. After all, another meaning of the word \"uniform\" means organized. So while the neg argues that there will be no harm, I argue that there will be no harm AND benefits. Yes, students have the right of expression, but again, uniforms are already used by much of the private schools in our country. If students have to have freedom of expression, then why don't we ban uniforms in those schools? Obviously this does not violate the 1st amendment as much schools already use uniforms, so his counterargument is void, and my 1st contention still stands true. Rebuttal to your 2nd counterargument, on the popularity argument: Agreed. Hairstyles can be expressed for popularity, I wholeheartedly agree with that. However, although enforcing uniform-wearing does not COMPLETELY reduce popularity, it reduces a good portion of it, as most people look at the clothes. And that is still good, and is still a benefit. There is no disadvantage to it. Also, the reason why clothes are the main factors while other details are minor ones is because clothes have brand names. People want to look for good brands, and it tells people if the wearer is rich or not. Hairstyles do not have brands, it is really not considered much. As long as you are wearing Hollister or Nike no one pays much attention to your hairstyle. So, the neg wants completely or nothing. He wants the popularity system to remain, or to be completely destroyed. However, this is a bad attitude, as we are reducing, say, 80% of it, which is much better than not doing it at all. Therefore my second contention is still standing. Rebuttal to 3rd argument, taxes: Actually, this is not true. You say that more taxes are generated with regular clothes. Yes, of course it does! However, this is not a choose-one option. It's not like you have to ONLY buy the uniform and never buy regular clothes again. You can buy both! You can wear normal clothes outside of school, which is actually more than the time inside of school (per week). So basically buying uniforms is an add-on which helps generate revenue alongside regular clothes. Your take is too extreme; people will obviously continue to buy regular clothes. Let's say regular clothes generate x revenue. Uniforms generate y revenue. He says generating x is better than generating y. I say that we generate both x and y. Therefore this contention is still standing. To refute your arguments which you strengthened: 1st contention: A popularity hierarchy is obviously harmful! No one wants to be left out just because they wear ratty clothes. Isn't it better if everyone is on the same level, without rankings based on clothes? Yes, lower people can learn. However, it is not about learning, but the mental damage he/she takes from always being the last one called in kickball, etc. And mental damage does hurt learning. If you are a loner at school because you wear bad clothes, then in a group project you will have no teammates, since no one wants to be with you. Therefore you have to do it all yourself, which is not a good learning way. For your part on hairstyle, I have already refuted above, so your 1st contention is refuted. 2nd contention: You say girls are not rich. Maybe. But girls DO love shopping, and DO love buying. At an immature age they do not know how to save money and will carelessly spend money regardless of how much money they have. And since you are saying girls do not buy too much clothing, you are hurting your own argument/refutation that more taxes will be generated if people buy regular clothes. And you say students can outgrow. Isn't this good, as it generates more revenue? Sure, this may harm the family, but no family is too poor to buy a mere uniform. They spend a lot on school supplies. And your estimate on how much it takes to buy uniforms from k-12 is too extreme. They will outgrow, but probably only in two or three year intervals, not every year. And while it may cause some damage, uniform prices vary, from 20$-249$ (the most extreme). They won't buy uniforms all priced at 249$. And if the family has more than one kid then the older kid can give his old uniform to the younger. Families aren't too rich to buy the most expensive uniforms, every year, for each of their kids. Therefore this contention is refuted. I do not know which contention this is, but you said that more tax is generated with regular clothes. You basically restated your previous statement, and I already refuted that above. Therefore this is refuted. For schools paying for needy families, this is already used in action. It is even used in my school. Therefore this is also refuted. 3rd contention: They wear regular clothes outside of school, obviously. Once school ends, then they wear the uniform until they get home and change. For your joke, haha. And this contention is very illogical as bullies will not just bully people just because they are from a different school. Besides, schools wouldn't be so close that people from both schools can meet on their way home. Again, people will not bully strangers that they do not know. For your personal example, as you have yourself witnessed it, I will not deny it, but keep in mind that your two schools is two out of a million schools in the nation. What may be true for your school may not be true to the millions of thousands of schools out there. As I have rebutted all your counterarguments, I have completely polished all my contentions and they are still standing. I have refuted all your contentions, so they are all void. And not only due to the amount of contentions still unrefuted, or the refutations made, the factor of the winning person should be focused on the reasoning and logic behind their arguments, am I right? Thank you Westernguy2 for having this nice debate with me.",

            "premise": "Ok, you have explained the three major things. Yes, students can express their ways by music or art, most schools don't have band or art classes, they may have music class which has to do with mostly the instrument The Recorder. Students that wear the uniforms can express their personalities by just being their selves, but most students don't have many friends because they don't know who their TRUE, FULL, personalities. Students take the concept of \"Looking Good\" in the uniforms most students do have a big of a stomach so if the uniform makes them feel more conscious about their body so that being said by a student it's possible for the student to become Bulimia, Anorexia, ect. If not possible for the student to be self conscious on how they look in the uniform and they claim to enjoy them, that is accepted. Some majority of the students don't like the uniforms because you have to tuck in your shirt. It is safer to keep all students shirts tucked in so no gang members are able to hide any weapons such as knifes,guns, ect. Students wearing the same uniform will be less bullied about what they wear. This is true but most students aren't judged on what they wear and how they wear it. Uniforms don't make anyone look any different on the outside. The labels people are given are Nerd,Jock,Prep,Band Nerd, Science Geek, ect. The labels that people are given stay the same no matter how you dress, it's all based on the way that you act, yes, this does fall into the category of expressing yourself. But my point being is that not all students like the uniforms, yes, they are safer, but most students don't like the way they look in the uniform because they're supposedly not \"Thin.\" Students shouldn't have to wear the uniforms, most think the uniforms are quite comfortable but others or as you would call them the \"Misfits\" they may not like the colors because they would like to wear pink,purple,black,yellow,green,white,ect,ect.",

            "premise": "Thank you for the debate. I will present my main arguments on why I think that school uniforms should be in schools and are overall beneficial. 1) School uniforms in fact save time and money. So much time is wasted with students sorting out what clothes to wear on what day. The demand for a variety of clothing pieces is reduced to just the ones that meet school policy. Yes initially uniforms do cost some money but parents save in the long-run. Students don't need a constant closet of clothing combinations to wear to school. The uniform does it all. Uniforms therefore save both time and money. 2) School Uniforms equal the inevitable variety of social class If there is no uniform then students who come from families of lower economic status may be embarrassed about their cheap clothes they have to wear to school. The uniform fixes this problem. Students don't have to be embarrassed if they can't afford the latest clothing trends. If every student wears identical clothing i.e a uniform then the social status division is much less of an issue and therefore more beneficial to the student. This also potentially reduces bullying. 3) School uniforms improve student safety. When students are required to wear uniforms, the wearing of gang symbols or colors becomes harder, and therefore, reduces student risk and danger. Also a uniform means that baggy clothing is not allowed, so there is less opportunity to hide weapons or drugs in clothing. Therefore school violence is reduced. School theft is also less of a threat, because there is no ability to steal sneakers, expensive jackets etc. To back this up, schools where uniforms are required have seen a 95 percent decrease in crime, 90 percent decrease in suspensions, and vandalism on school property decreased by 69 percent. Source: (www.educationbug.org) I feel that uniforms are very beneficial to students. They protect them, make them feel equal and are very convenient even if the students don't realize it.",

            "discussionTitle": "School Uniform Should be Compulsory",
            "conclusion": "School Uniform Should be Compulsory",
            "premise": "Thank you Con for understanding. :) Firstly, I would like to clarify the main contention of my argument: while I do believe that schools should have compulsory uniform, I do not necessarily agree with the way every school that has compulsory uniform enforces their policies regarding school uniform. You mentioned that in Asia, You went to a school with a strict system, And that you could be punished for wearing a dirty uniform. This is not something I agree with at all, And I do not believe schools should be this strict with regards to uniform. Schools should have compulsory uniforms (for the reasons I already mentioned), But they should be lenient with regards to dirty or lost uniforms (this is what the schools I attended were like). This issue of dirty clothes is not unique to schools that have compulsory uniforms either. For schools that do not have school uniforms, I believe that students should not be punished if they accidentally dirty the clothes which they wear. You also state that wearing our own clothes eliminates the need for unnecessary fear of the rigid codes of uniforms which school students have; this is an exaggeration. While there are many students who disagree with the concept of uniforms being compulsory, Students tend to accept that uniforms have benefits and they are certainly not \"fearful\" of it. A survey conducted in Nevada found that 90% of students dislike wearing a uniform to school, But 54% of students think uniforms do not compromise their identity and 41% thought that school uniforms reduce gang violence. School uniforms may not be universally loved, But they are certainly not feared or demonised by students. You linked an article regarding the causes of bullying. The issue with this is that the article does not prove whether economic bullying is common. In nowhere in the article does it say that the list of causes is exhaustive; bullying is an extremely complex issue and there are many possible causes for it. In addition to this, Economic bullying can \"fit within\" the causes that are listed in the article. For example, Cause #10: Untaught. This can include economic bullying, As many children (especially younger children) may not realise that they should not judge people based on how they look or dress, As they were never properly taught it, And as a result participate in economic bullying. While there is a difference between a rich student wearing a clean uniform and a poor student wearing an untidy one, It is not as large as the difference between a poor student wearing dirty, Cheap clothes and a rich student wearing clean, Expensive clothes. A large proportion of child psychologists in Australia have said that having compulsory uniforms remove distractions for students and removes pressure for them to keep up with the latest fashion trends. Uniforms may not eliminate bullying, But they do reduce it. My school gave students a choice as to which business you can buy your uniform from (all businesses sold the same school uniform for a given school), And also had a second hand uniform store. (I believe this is something all schools should do). Some businesses sold uniforms for a low price (you could sometimes buy a complete uniform for under $30), And it was often cheaper than if you had to buy regular clothes for school. Even if you did not have to wear uniforms to school, It means your parents would have to purchase more normal clothes that you can wear to school/outside school, Compared to if they did have to buy school uniform. As a result, Having school uniform can be more affordable for some parents. Regarding the time factor, Some people (in schools that do not have compulsory uniforms) spend a lot of time picking what to wear for school because they feel pressured into wearing something that will lead them to not be judged by their peers. As I already mentioned, Ironing and washing your clothes needs to be done regardless of whether or not you wear school uniform. Therefore, School uniforms are beneficial in terms of economics and time. Your poem on unity is very well written (good job! ) but it is inaccurate. Yes, It is definitely true that people judge each other based on race/skin colour/sexuality etc. (and this is a huge problem), But people also judge each other based on clothes, And this is not limited to school. Imagine turning up to a formal job interview for a medical clinic wearing a singlet (with no shirt), Shorts and thongs. Obviously, Before the interviewer even starts asking you questions, He/she will probably already be subconsciously negatively judging you, Regardless of what your race/skin colour/sexuality etc. Is (and you will be significantly less likely to get the job). Judging people based on their clothing is (unfortunately) something many people do. While uniforms do not completely create unity, They will bring students closer to unity. A similar argument can be made with regards to safety. Class roles and ID cards won\"t always work either - the criminal can prey on students during break time, While the supervising teachers will not know every student and therefore will not know if everybody is a student of the school or not. Also, CCTV cameras are extremely expensive (my school had fake CCTV cameras because it could not afford real ones, And they pretended that they were real to scare off criminals, But someone in my school\"s bag was stolen, And when they asked if it was caught on CCTV, It was revealed that the CCTV cameras were not real. So now everybody knew that the cameras were fake and they became effectively useless). Uniforms will not make it impossible for criminals to enter schools, But they make it significantly more difficult. With regards to liberal discipline, I would argue that school children already have enough freedom. For example, During break time they are allowed to do anything they want (as long as it is within the rules), And when they get back home from school they have a lot of freedom in many aspects, As long as it is within their parents rules (including what to wear). It is not worth it to give school aged children too much freedom with regards to what to wear to school, Because you have to sacrifice so many other important aspects of a child\"s school life that I have already mentioned (for example, Unity and equality). School students should have freedom, But not too much freedom. While school uniforms do not completely eliminate bullying, Or completely allow for unity, Etc they certainly do provide a step in the right direction with regards to those issues. Therefore, Compulsory school uniforms for students are the best policy. I would like to thank Con, This has been a very interesting and challenging debate. Good luck with Round 4. :)",

            "conclusion": "School uniform should be banned",
            "premise": "Hello, this is my first debate. I wish good luck to my opponents.Commenters please advice me in the comments section and thank you!So let's get started.Point 1:School uniform can be a indication of the student's pride and loyalty of the school. By wearing school uniform, students will feel proud of their school. However, this only applies if the school is reputable as if the school is not reputable, the school uniform would indicate that the student is not a good student due to his school.Point 2: School uniforms help teachers and staff to identify students. This is especially useful during school trips. Imagine what would happen if school uniforms were banned, how would the teachers identify their students during mishaps and accidents? Besides, it is also easier for a teacher to do a head count of the students as most of the students would be wearing the same type of clothes. Compared to students wearing different colored clothes with different designs , students wearing the school uniform would be certainly more easily recognized.Point 3: Wearing a school uniform will change a student's mindset and attitude towards their study. Psychologist have proven that wearing the school uniform will cause a student to be more serious compared to wearing home clothes. Thus, wearing school uniform would enable a student to focus more easily during lesson.Point 4: School uniform can improve the image of a school. As the saying goes, ' The clothes makes the man' By wearing a smart standardized uniform, a student will look like a studious scholar, by wearing a shirt with a punk-like design, the student will look like a hooligan, while wearing a shirt with a cartoon design would make the student look childish and immature. The clothes of what we wear reflects who we are,even if some do not notice. For example, if we wear a tank top and yellow pants with pink polka dots to a job interview, you would be perceived as a foolish person with a can't be bothered attitude. Thus, if a group of students wears a class uniform, the school would be seen as organized and would of course make a better impression than a school with students wearing clothes of different designs.Point 5: School uniform can reduce the bullying of many students. Bullying has been a common issue in schools due to many factors. One of the factor is the clothing. Wearing inappropriate or abusive clothes can lead to a disruption in class, and also, in more serious cases, a fight. For example, if a student wore a shirt to school with the words 'Chinese Suck', the Chinese of the school would feel offended and will most probably find a way to have revenge. Some of them might even perhaps commit self harm or try to engage in a fight with the student wearing the repulsive shirt. Likewise, if outsiders see a student wearing an abusive shirt, and identify the student, it would bring a bad image to the school. Therefore, cases of bullying can be reduced if students wear the same uniform.Point 6: Due to poverty, the clothes of a poor pupil might be torn, worn or dirty. This may lead to the discrimination of other students. If all students wore the same uniform, less people would discriminate students due to their clothes as their first impression on others would be based more on the mindset , personality and attitude of the person rather than his clothes.In conclusion, the uniform may have disadvantages, however, the benefits of a uniform outweighs the negative effects of a uniform, therefore, the uniform should not be banned.",

            "premise": "Being forced to wear school uniforms will do little to prevent bullying from happening. If a student isn't being bullied about their clothing they could get picked on for what shoes they wear or what accessories or backpack they have. School Uniforms don't create a safer environment but instead enforce a more hostile one. Students who violate the uniform dress code can be taken out of instructional time based on their outfit. Some students might also stress over having enough uniforms or how much money they spent on their uniform, these feelings exist with both regular clothing and uniform apparel. While uniform policies try to even the playing field among students, students find ways to break the dress code or modify their uniform to outshine each other. Uniforms don't even the playing field instead they create a whole other playing field that students still compete on. School uniforms enforce unrealistic expectations of unity amongst a large number of people. In the real world you don't dress exactly the same as the person next to you. Everyone strives to be their own person in society and one way of showcasing your individuality is through uniforms. Students can begin to lose a sense of individuality by continuously looking like everyone else. Students should have the right to express themselves through their choice of dress as long as it abides by the safety dress code regulations. Uniforms can't fix the bigger picture of creating a safer environment for students to attend.",

Because of this feeling, they worry all day long about what everyone else is thinking of them. Having confidence can be of great importance. Weather it\"s a simple project presentation at school or a big job interview, confidence is key. While wearing uniforms, confidence is sometimes a hard thing to accomplish, but this isn\"t the only distraction of wearing a uniform. Uniforms can be quite distracting during the day because of all the restrictions. During the day you constantly have to worry about having your shirt tucked in and keeping everything according to code. While worrying about tests you are also constantly worrying about getting caught with a uniform violation. After enough uniform violations there will of course be consequences such as a detention. I personally am not always thinking about what I should be, but instead checking my uniform over and over to make sure not to get in trouble. Students have enough stress in their lives; why add more? With so much stress about getting good grades and getting everything done on time, we shouldn\"t have to deal with the stress of uniforms. Students already have so many things taken away from them during school hours, individuality and confidence shouldn\"t have to be hidden by uniforms. Having a few dress code guidelines is quite an easy fix to these issues. I believe that students should not have to wear uniforms.",

            "conclusion": "this house will ban school uniforms",
            "premise": "Resolution: School Uniforms don't bother kids. Many kids believe that school uniforms should be banned because they don't like the right of not choosing what they where. However many people are challenging this idea now. Scientists conclude that having uniforms is good because it keeps you less concerned on what you wear and more concerned on other things. Also it is very easy to know what school you go to or it is not like having everyone looking at what you wear. For example do you really want people to know you by what you where? People might bully you if you wear bad clothes or clothes with a low price. But uniforms... No problem! Everyone wears the same thing and no one would bother what you wear because they wear the same thing. Also In some countries, like the U.K., Japan, Hong Kong, and several African countries, school uniforms are worn in almost every school. In other countries, like France and Germany, school uniforms are only worn in a few schools, or even none. However, in some of these countries opinions are changing. For example, both France1 and Germany2 have recently considered bringing school uniforms back, and in the U.S.A. the percentage of public schools in which children wear a uniform has increased from 11.8 in 1999-2000 to 17.5 in 2007-20083. On the other hand, some schools in the U.K. have gotten rid of school uniforms4. With such different rules in these different countries, it is important to think about whether or not school uniforms are really necessary, and why. School uniforms create a sense of equality School catchment areas are diverse and in private schools, some children are there on a scholarship. So, without uniforms there are clear indicators of wealth between what children wear. This makes poorer children stand out, (or even possibly the reverse). Children can then be bullied for being different, which diminishes a child's enjoyment of school. A study in New York has shown that 84% of parents think uniforms promote equality, and 89% of guidance counselors think uniforms help teach children to be more accepting of others who are less fortunate[3]. This perception among parents will help create the same perception among their children. This is also likely to translate to the teachers who will therefore treat their pupils more equally. School uniforms contribute to the sense of school unity Schools that have a uniform often say that they do so because wearing a uniform helps their students feel a sense of unity and pride in their school (e.g., Sacred Heart Catholic School, 2010)[15]. The headmistress of Fulham Cross School in London, England, has been quoted as saying that introducing a uniform at her school gave students \"an incredible sense of pride\"; after the introduction of a school uniform, GCSE passes at her school rose from 42 to 53 per cent[16]. This sense of unity is especially important on school trips, where teachers need to be able to tell which children belong to their school, so that no one gets lost. School uniforms encourage discipline Having to wear smart clothes encourages children to respect their school and their teachers and behave themselves. This is because of the association between smart clothes and work. Casual wear at school can also make students feel over-relaxed and 'at home,' meaning they don't focus as much on work. A lot of schools are bringing back school uniform because they want to improve discipline[21]. Moreover, school uniform can actively encourage students to enter into an adversarial relationship with the curriculum and their teachers. Exercising arbitrary control over children in the interests of \"discipline\" is likely to convince them that the very sensible, rational principles of learning and critical thought that they acquire during the school day are equally arbitrary and meaningless. By refusing to allow children to participate in enjoyable, beguiling processes of discovery and understanding unless they comply with unjustified and meaningless rules about dress, schools risk being seen as oppressive and capricious by their students.

In your first claim that uniforms save time, I have never seen or heard a student be late for school because I couldn't find anything to wear, or some other reason to be tardy. Also we must not infringe upon the rights of the student. The right to individuality is vital for academic development. Individuality boost self-confidence and if the student is self confident they can get focus on what is important, learning. We must embrace and celebrate individuality. If everyone clothes look similar a student may feel weak or worthless even since they are just another face in a indifferent crowd. You say that uniforms will reduce the ability of harming other students. This is just a simple band-aid that will not solve the problem of school violence therefore uniforms do not provide safety but only a false security. Uniforms are in fact a burden to families who are paying for a free education for there children. Uniforms may prove difficult to enforce in public schools. And a study showed buy the today show says that families pay 15% extra money for uniforms. These facts of my argument provide sufficient evidence that we should hold on to our freedom of choice and that uniforms should not be allowed in schools. Also my opponent filled to notice I did cite and have statics in my argument .",

This might not be directly linked to what they're wearing, but having a uniform can be a safety net for many students who might otherwise suffer from bullying. A strict uniform gives the impression that rules are strict too, perhaps helping maintain a sense of order at school.\"-The Guardian Sure, the bullies will pick on people for different reasons but this is one less reason for them to pick on people! There have also been many non-uniform days for charity here and everyone gets distracted when we have our own clothes, uniforms stop us from getting distracted. It's also great to clean as you can have it cleaned at the weekend ready for the week whereas with clothes you might not even find something you can wear and can't even go to school due to having no clothes to wear into school. That's when you could be bullied for many of the reasons Pro has posted. Additionally, wearing a school uniform identifies you with your school; it's really useful on field trips and other events where pupils may be lost!

A school uniform teaches students to dress smartly and take pride in their appearance... Perhaps most importantly, a uniform means students don't have to worry about peer pressure when it comes to their clothes. When everyone is dressed the same, worrying about what you look like isn't so important. There is no competition about being dressed in the latest trend, which would put a great deal of financial pressure on students and parents. Potential bullies have one less target for their insults; it's hard to make fun of what someone is wearing when you're dressed exactly the same... My uniform might not be what I would wear in my own time, but it gives me a sense of belonging, takes away the pressure of what to wear and deters the bullies. School uniform isn't fashionable, but that's exactly why I think it should be here to stay.\"",
