            "premise": "Just what is a sport? A sport is an activity or in some cases, a lifestyle, that requires a competitive drive, to be in top of your physical form, and to spend ample time studying your sport. Basketball requires months of conditioning, hours studying and practicing plays, and the desire to work with your team to be the on top of all your competition. Football and baseball require the same type of training and necessities. Even individual sports such as Cross-Country running require the desire to win, the countless hours of training to be on top of your physical form, the studying of different terrains. I'll even let NASCAR get in there; it requires the skill of being able to drive at high speeds without crashing, studying different racetracks, and definetely has that competitive edge. But golf? Come on. First of all, the only physical shape you need to be in is the ability to swing a golf club. Thats working a mere 2-3 muscles in your whole body. And you wont need to worry about walking all the way to your next spot after you hit that little white ball, because you've got your fancy golf cart to drive you there! Golf lacks the competitive drive that other sports have. Sure, you're playing against 18+ other people to get the lowest score, but you only have knowledge of one other person's score; your partners. You dont know when to come in the clutch, when to step it up, when to \"getcha head in the game\". Come on, people.",

            "premise": "People can consider anything but that doesn't make it right. For example, many people consider Great Britain to be a country when it isn't and some people consider the UK to be a country when it's really 3 and a half countries. Just because something is considered a certain way doesn't make it so. Just because it's in the Olympics doesn't mean it's a sport. They have concerts at the Olympics and they aren't sports. They are side attractions and that's all golf will be. Burning 800 calories doesn't make it a sport. You would burn 800 calories for sleeping for 9 days. Does that mean that sleeping for 9 days is a sport because you burn 800 calories? Now that I am done refuting, here is my argument. Please address each of these points in your next argument otherwise these points will all stand. Golf better matches the defintion of a game than a sport. Merriam-Webster defines a game as an 'activity engaged in for diversion or amusement.' Think about John Daly. If it can be done while drinking and smoking, then it is not a sport. Golf is not a sport. It is a skill. It's not a sport if you don't move. It isn't a sport if it can be played by a golfer with a broken leg (Tiger Woods in he 2008 U.S. Open). Mike Freeman, National Columnist at CBSSports.com, stated the following in his July 20, 2009 article titled \"Old-man Watson Proves Golf Is Far from Legitimate Sport,\" published on cbssports.com: \"Golf isn't a sport. The amount of athleticism required to play golf is about the same as it is to be a good bowler. How else do you explain that a man who is nearly 60 [Tom Watson] came extremely close to winning a golf major? This story might be inspirational but for the sport of golf it should also be mortifying. Actually, it's a tad embarrassing. What does it say about a sport when it takes a playoff round to finally beat Watson despite Watson's age? It says golf isn't a sport, that's what it says... There are no 59-year-old running backs, outfielders or point guards because the level of athleticism is so extreme in those sports that if someone Watson's age tried to play them they'd get broken into tiny pieces... The athleticism required to play golf is so minimal, it's negligible.\" Dave Hollander, JD, author and sports columnist, stated the following in his May 12, 2008 article titled \"Is Golf A Sport? Seriously.,\" published on the Huffington Post website: \"Golf does not even rise to the level of 'a good walk spoiled' [quote attributed t Mark Twain] because the primary action of walking is not required. So says PGA Tour v. Martin (2001) where the Supreme Court ordered the PGA to allow disabled golfer Casey Martin to use a golf cart in between holes rather than walk... How can you call something a sport where being ambulatory is not a basic minimum physical requirement? Think of the mythological gods and heroes who personified the highest physical virtues: Hermes (speed), Hercules (strength), Aphrodite (stamina). There's got to be at least some running to call it a sport. I'd prefer some contact, too. But \"no walking required\"? You call that a sport? Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's a sport. Computer programming and brain surgery are difficult. They are not sports. Just because you compete doesn't make it a sport either. Pretzel vendors compete. Art galleries compete. Hell, a spelling bee is a competition. Golf is recreation--something to pass the time. It is no more a sport than marbles or cat's cradle. That takes me to my final point: Golf is boring. You want to get a nap in on Sunday afternoon? Turn on golf. Looking for that TV show to help the kids get some shut-eye? Turn on golf. Do you want to see the least amount of physical prowess combined with the greatest dearth of raw emotion? Turn on golf.",

            "premise": "Jlconservative, for future reference I have no harsh feelings towards your favoring of conserative government; just a light jab to keep you on your toes. Before I tie up my argument i'd like to point out that when you stated, \"...we might as well remove Hunting, Fishing, Krokae, Polo,Archery,Marksmanship, even surfing...\" you made quite a noticeable spelling error. Please clarify with me in your response if you meant to reference the golf-like sport of \"Croquet\", rather than your spelling of \"Krokae\". Yes, I do agree. If, golf is not a sport, then most of these \"sports\" should be removed from the list as well, which I believe they should. These \"sports\", much like golf, require little physical strain, training, or duress. Some of them even lack the concept of competition (fishing, hunting). What burns me up the most about this \"sport\" is how the media overhypes it. You can't turn on the TV without seeing an ad for the PGA Tour, the triumphs and tragedies of Tiger Woods, and the ridiculous amounts of money they earn by knocking a white ball into a hole. I can tolerate (to a point) the \"sports\" you referenced being referred to as \"sports\" mainly because they are avoided by the media, for the purpose that some take these \"sports\" as low thrill, leading to little interest. What sickens me the most is that the media has allowed golf to stand out among these hobbies. And heaven forbid that the \"gentleman's sport\" of golf goes down in history, right in there with baseball, as a great American pastime. Golf is not a sport.",

I have had a few nasty ones on this site mostly personal attacks because I am a conservative, mind if we just keep it clean and about Golf? we can debate about politics some other time. First of all I want to say that every definition I can pull up on the internet and the two dictionaries I have here at the house all come up with the same definition, that a sport is something that has guidelines, and rules, and requires skill along with SOME physical extortion. It is my opinion Kenicks that your views on a sport is sort of arrogant ( no harm intended). I think that as Americans we get blinded on that a sport consists of body builders, or martial arts, or who can hit the hardest. However if we are going to characterize sports into these categories we must remember we are not the only country, if we try and remove golf from sporting we might as well remove Hunting, Fishing, Krokae, Polo,Archery,Marksmanship, even surfing the list can go on and on. These sporting competitions do not require much physical duress but they are a sport none the less. Now what you suggested chess, and poker, haha and beer pong would of course not be labeled as a sport. However Golfing that requires skill, and guidelines and rules, and SOME physical duress not nearly as much as tennis,football,or boxing but some fits the definition of a sport perfectly.",

Mind if i quote your closing statement? \"I think that we can all agree Golf is a game of rules and skill therefore it is a sport.\" Ok, so therefore, all games and activities which have rules and skill are sports. Take darts; this game requires the skill of throwing a pointed arrow up against a board (which i do enjoy very much), while following a set of rules: Dont throw 2 darts at once, only throw three per round, etc. Is this a sport? Take poker; this game requires the skill of, in the words of the great Kenny Rogers, \"knowing when to hold 'em and knowing when to fold 'em\", the witty intellect of knowing how much to bet at what time, keeping a poker face, and knowledge of rules and regulations of the cards and table settings. Is this a sport? Take checkers, take chess; these game also requires high intellect, planning out your next move, how to dethrone your opposition. Rules to follow are also present; where you can or cannot place your playing piece, whose turn goes in who's order, etc. Is this a sport? Take Scrabble; the skill of word-building is present, one must have a knack for piecing the english language together. Rules: they must be legitimate words. Is this a sport? Take Beer Pong; a game for the ages, in which one requires the skill of throwing a tiny plastic ball into a plastic cup filled with booze, the skill of being able to chug down incessant amounts of alcohol, the rules to be abided by of the proper conduct on defense, offense, shooting, rollbacking, recracking, etc. Is this a sport? You see, Jlconservative, these, along with golf, are not classified as sports, but merely hobbies. One thing they do have in common, however, is that they burn the same amount of calories as golf.",

As part of my training to be the best I include arm workouts, core workouts, and even lifting weights with my wrists. Many people who believe golf is not a sport have not done all of this preparation. Nor have they played 18 holes in the scorching sun while carrying an on average 20 pound bag. Then have to step up to the tee and give this shot your all. The truth is golf is a sport and that's final, so don't say how easy golf is without experiencing what I do, thank you.",

On the point that the Olympics is old and we should leave it alone: from the Wikipedia page of the Olympics: Two previously discontinued sports, Golf and rugby, Returned for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On August 13, 2009, The IOC Executive Board proposed that golf and rugby sevens be added to the Olympic program for the 2016 Games. [16] On 9 October 2009, During the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, The IOC voted to admit both sports as official Olympic sports and to include them in the 2016 Summer Olympics. [17] The IOC voted 81\"\"8 in favor of including rugby sevens and 63\"\"27 in favor of reinstating golf, Thus bringing the number of sports back to 28. [17] The games are constantly updated. New ones added and old ones removed. So no, We don't and should not leave the Olympics alone. If chess is considered an Olympic sport then why not other games?",

Sports commonly refer to activities where the physical capabilities of the competitor are the sole or primary determiner of the outcome (winning or losing), but the term is also used to include activities such as mind sports and motor sports where mental acuity or equipment quality are major factors. Sport: Physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively. Sport: An activity involving physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often undertaken competitively. I believe that these definitions prove my case all of these were taken from the Webster dictionary, the fact is a sport is something is an activity that involves skills be it throwing a ball 40 yards,running 100 miles, or hitting a tiny ball 400 yards into a hole. A sport is a competition involving rules and guidelines, and were skill comes into play. I think that we can all agree Golf is a game of rules and skill therefore it is a sport.",

No sport can be \"more of a sport\" than another sport. Arguing that one sport is \"more of a sport\" would be like arguing that one sentence is more of a sentence than another sentence. A sport is the definition of a sport, therefore nothing may be more of a sport than a sport. My opponent agrees that \"Ping Pong is a very physically demanding SPORT...\" and \"golf on the other hand is a SPORT\" then they agree that both Ping Pong and golf are sports. If both are sports, and nothing can be more of a sport than a sport, then they are equal sports. Contention two: Golf is a more difficult sport to consistently win at. a) Sports are \"often of a competitive nature\", which means that the goal of the sport is to win. b) Ping pong directly sets two opponents (or four) against each other, and 'points' are made when an opponent makes an error that include such things as: \"Allowing the ball to bounce on one's own side more than once. Double hitting the ball. Allowing the ball to strike anything other than the racket. Causing the ball not to bounce on the opponent's half.\"(4) The player (or team) that reaches a point threshold first in considered the winner. c) Golf also directly sets opponents against each other, however, the number of opponents is normally much higher than the number of opponents in Ping Pong. (5) Naturally, the more opponents there are, the harder it is for any one player to consistently win. Also, golf courses are not nearly as controlled as Ping Pong tables, and it is therefore easier for variables to randomly cause a loss/victory. Golfers must not only beat their opponents, as is the sole task of Ping Pong players, but they must also beat random variables. Affirmation's case: My opponent did not define any terms, so as of now my definitions are the only definitions usable in this debate. My opponent's first claim is that \"Ping Pong is a very physically demanding sport and takes more skill and endurance than golf.\" Golf takes more skill than Ping Pong because the distance that a golf ball must be hit far exceeds the distance that a Ping Pong ball must be hit, and the golf ball must not only be hit far, it must be hit far with great accuracy. Sending a ball of roughly equal shape and size a farther distance with the same accuracy is inherently more skillful. Golf also requires more endurance than Ping Pong. Golf requires more strength than Ping Pong and therefore requires more endurance on a second by second basis. My opponent's second claim is that \"Ping Pong takes Hand Eye coordination and is also physically stressful to the body where golf on the other hand is a sport that any one can accomplish with some what success. This is a comparison of two very unlike things. My opponent compares two requirements of Ping Pong to the level of accomplishment that \"any one\" can succeed in. \"any one\" could also succeed in Ping Pong, for example: I beat my 3 year old next door neighbor because she could not return any of my serves. Golf also requires Hand Eye coordination and golf is more physically stressful to the body. Golf requires more strength because the distance that the golf ball is forced to travel is greater than the distance that the Ping Pong ball is forced to travel, which requires more force. More force expenditure from a body=more physically stressful to the body. My opponent's last claim is that \" A golf Ball is a stationary object that you have to hit with an oversize club , where as in Ping Pong the ball is always moving.\" I concede that a golf ball is stationary until it is hit and that a Ping Pong ball is generally not stationary until it is hit. However, I do not see how hitting a moving object a very short distance is in any way more skillful, physically stressful or \"more of a sport\" (1)-http://dictionary.reference.com...

            "conclusion": "Golf is not a physical sport",
            "premise": "Many thanks to Merritt for accepting this debate! My apologies for taking so long to post my first argument. Time has not been on my side lately. Golf, according to sporteology.com, is the 8th most popular sport in the world. [1] It has about 400 million fans across Europe and the USA, which, thankfully, allows a wealth of information to be available about the intricacies and physics of the sport. The \u201cPhysicality\u201d of Golf Two of the things that golf fans will run to when trying to defend it as a physical sport are: 1. The fact that players have to tote heavy bags of clubs around all day, and 2. The force of the swing. Let\u2019s start with the bags of clubs. These can get pretty heavy, ranging from 30-50 pounds. [2] So this obviously appears to be a valid argument concerning golf being a physical sport. But is it really as physical as other popular games? CalorieLab.com has a great average calorie calculator that shows you how many calories will be burned for a person of any weight. Let\u2019s look at the calories that will be burned for a 200-pound man in various sports. Basketball game: 637 calories/hour Boxing, sparring: 728 calories/hour Baseball: 364 calories/hour Football: 728 calories/hour Ice hockey: 637 calories/hour Rugby: 819 calories/hour Soccer: 837 calories/hour Now for our oh-so-physical game of golf: 319 calories per hour. Not exactly how you would want to lose weight. In fact, one can burn exactly the same amount of calories just shooting hoops, and MORE by skateboarding and fishing out of a stream with waders! [3] As a matter of fact, one can make a very strong case that NASCAR is much more physical than golf (and a LOT of sports in general). NASCAR drivers experience cockpits that heat up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit while wearing a firesuit, helmet and gloves. This causes them, by sweating, to lose 10 or more pounds in a single race, to say nothing about calories burned! They can experience 2-3 Gs of force in turns on a fast racetrack, roughly the same amount that astronauts experience during space shuttle launches. Forget open-wheel drivers, who sometimes deal with 4-5 Gs! Shaquille O\u2019Neal, an accomplished basketball player, took a few laps in a NASCAR race car and said he can\u2019t remember a game or practice that was more demanding. Show me a golf player who\u2019s bigger and stronger than Shaq! [4] [5] [6] Golf swing Golf fans also seem to cry out that learning to swing a golf club correctly is very difficult. I would agree that it is difficult to master accuracy and precision, but impossible? No, and physical, definitely not. According to golfswing.com , a golfer can put up to 4000 pounds, or 18,000 Newtons, of force on the ball. But according to Patrick Drane of the Baseball Research Center, a baseball player, who, by the way, has to reverse a ball coming at him at about 90 miles per hour, can put up to 8000 pounds of force on the ball, which works out to over 35,000 Newtons!! [7] [8] Now we can look more in detail at the athletics involved. We can look all day at golf players that are in shape and compare them to other strong and fast athletes of other sports, but let\u2019s go the other way and look at the most out-of-shape players in professional sports. Perhaps the heaviest player in pro golf is Guy Boros. He weighs 265 pounds and is easily recognizable for his large girth. Boros has several parallels in pro baseball, namely Prince Fielder, who weighs 275, and David Ortiz, 250. But their weight doesn\u2019t limit their athletic ability. Prince Fielder has been called the \u201cstrongest man in baseball\u201d by his teammates, and David Ortiz bench presses 400 pounds. [9] [10] Now look at American football. Albert Haynesworth was one of the biggest and heaviest football players ever. But the 6\u20196, 350-pound monster ran a 4.82 second 40 yard dash at the combine (ok, he was 317 at the time) and could bench press 425 pounds. [11] [12] Can Guy Boros do any of this? He is overweight, and there\u2019s no indication he can bench press anything other than his bag of golf clubs. In other sports, however, athletes who have a lot of weight are also some of the strongest players in their respective sport. I might also point out that golf is a preferred sport among senior citizens, unlike baseball, basketball and football. Stewart Cink himself, a six-time PGA winner, has admitted that \u201cphysically, golf is not super-demanding.\u201d [13] So far, I am satisfied that I have shown that golf definitely is not \u201ccharacterized by especially rough and forceful physical activity.\u201d I do not deny that golf contains many skills that take a long time to master, but beyond that, it is not a physical sport. Carrying a bag of clubs around is not near as physical as a basketball game, a football game, a baseball game, or even driving through left turns for 3 hours. I look forward to Con\u2019s reply.Sources: [1] http://www.sporteology.com... [2]http://www.cleveland.com... [3]http://calorielab.com... [4]http://www.streetdirectory.com...

            "premise": "I can name so many more sports that are so mentally challenging than golf. First off, is golf even a sport?? Webster's Dictionary defines the noun of \"sport\" as: a : a source of diversion : recreation b : sexual play c (1) : physical activity engaged in for pleasure (2) : a particular activity (as an athletic game) so engaged in \"A source of diversion\" - meaning something that diverts your attention, distraction essentially. So by that definition basically anything you do can be defined as a sport. If I paint my toenails as a means to divert my attention from something else... that's a sport. If I masturbate a gibbon as a distraction I'm engaging in a sport. If I paint a gibbon's toenails after having masturbated him... it's a sport. The second definition, \"sexual play\" refers to the use of \"sport\" as a synonym for sex which isn't really widely used anymore and doesn't apply to what we're talking about... although it may apply to the aforementioned gibbon. The third definition \"physical activity engaged in for pleasure\" is likewise vague and could describe anything you physically do for enjoyment, and the fourth definition is essentially the same as well.... like jerking off the gibbon. The Rose Center for Health and Sports Sciences in Denver attempted to argue that golf is indeed a sport because of the level of energy expended and the amount of calories burned (721 per round). Considering that an average golf round is 4 1/2 hours (according to Golf Digest) that translates to 160 calories an hour. By comparison they also found that an hour of billiards burns 216 calories, an hour of fishing 302, and a \"relaxed canoe trip\" 345. An hour of curling? Also 345. When your comparison falls short because more energy is expended during a \"relaxed canoe trip\" you FAIL. The only argument made here is that 18 holes of golf is \"okay exercise.\" By the way, I burned almost half that amount of calories (350) by walking at a relaxed pace on a treadmill for 30 minutes today. Trust me- treadmill walking is most definitely not a sport. http://billytrouson.blogspot.com... Read this article as it rants on how golf is not even a sport. I will now state how boxing is one of the most mentally challenging sports there is. I'm pretty sure we've all had our fair fist fights or wrestling, but how hard was it mentally fighting that person I ask those who are reading this? The average punch for any person depending on weight, body type, etc, can vary from person to person. The average for a average person can come at 14 MPH at one punch. Your brain only has a second to react. I encourage you to watch my video I will post here, as it is quite entertaining. http://www.youtube.com... Already I state various reasons why golf cannot even be compared as a sport & is not mentally challenging.",

            "conclusion": "Ping Pong is More of a Sport than Golf",
            "premise": "Thanks again for the debate, it certainly has been fun. My opponent starts of his last round with a counter argument to my 450 tee offs argument. He calculates the number 21,168, which I will accept. 21,168 divided by 450 is 47.04, so there are 47.04 times as many swings in ping pong as there are in golf. I'll plug in both the force from swinging a ping pong paddle/golf club and ping pong ball/golf ball. Newtons are, as I quoted in my second round:\"the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared\" This means that we must plug in kilograms, not grams. Ping pong paddle: 77 GRAMS x 1.875 m/s2 which is equal to .077 KILOGRAMS x 1.875 m/s2. This is .144375 Newtons. Golf club:115 GRAMS x 78 m/s2 which is equal to .115 KILOGRAMS x 78 m/s2. This is 8.970 Newtons. If we divide the force to swing a golf club (8.970) by the force to swing a ping pong paddle (.144375) we get 62.129870. This is much larger than 47.04, so it requires more force to swing a golf club 450 times than to swing a ping pong paddle 21,168 times. I'll plug in the new numbers that my opponent got for a ping pong ball and golf ball, which I accept. .0050625 Newtons for the ping pong ball. 3.58254 Newtons for the golf ball. 3.58254 divided by .0050625 is 707.6622222. This is much larger than 47.04, so it requires more force to hit a golf ball 450 times than to hit a ping pong ball 21,168 times. (1), checked with (2) My opponent concedes that there are more variables affecting golf than ping pong, on top of the increased amount of force required to swing a golf club and hit a golf ball. I cannot assign a number value to these variables, because they are variables, but they do make it more difficult to consistently win golf. My opponent even says \" I will agree that variables lead to inaccuracy but once again no variables can affect the outcome of a tournament by that much.\" which shows that variables make it harder to play golf, but by a small/unknown amount. I agree that the hole in one \"is a rarity of golf\", but it was just an example to show that it requires more accuracy to hit a ball a farther distance with the same accuracy. I agree that \"this \"incredible accuracy\" is not complete skill as in all sports luck is involved\", but that means that luck is also involved in ping pong, so ping pong is not any more of a sport than golf. The statement \"in all sports luck is involved\" negates the resolution, and my opponent said it, not me. My opponent's next argument is about the math, which I went over above. My opponent's last argument is that \" ping pong balls move in different directions than just strait\", and I agree with this, but he has not given a number value, similar to how I could not give a number value to the variables affecting golf. It is not possible to show that ping pong is harder than golf when we have an unknown value making it more difficult on each side. We cannot weigh EITHER unknown value as greater than the other, so the resolution must be negated. Conclusion: My opponent has not offered any arguments against my first contention or my subpoints a) or b), as I stated in my second round. My first contention is very important because I defined a sport as a noun and argued that nouns could not be more of themselves than the same noun. In other words, as my opponent agreed with, \"If both are sports, and nothing can be more of a sport than a sport, then they are equal sports.\" This negates the resolution, if they are equal sports then ping pong cannot be more of a sport than golf, they are equal. My subpoints a) and b) were mainly for clarification, so it doesn't really matter that much that my opponent agreed with them. The voting issues in this debate (as I see them) should be: 1. A sport cannot be \"more of a sport\" than another sport because sport is a noun. My opponent agreed with this. 2. The Force associated with playing each sport, which sport puts more stress on the body due to the forces. 3. Which sport takes more accuracy. 4. The variables affecting golf make golf a harder sport to consistently win at, but by an unknown amount. 5. The moving ping pong ball makes ping pong a harder sport to consistently win at, but by an unknown amount. I believe that I have won on the majority of these arguments and I urge you to vote negative. (1)-http://www.ajdesigner.com... (2)-http://calculator.com...

As a wrestler for seven years and a golfer for five, i can promise you i speak the truth. I have won matches and lost matches because of a split second decision, but losing concentration in golf just means a bad shot.

            "conclusion": "Ping Pong is More of a Sport than Golf",
            "premise": "Thanks for the prompt response, this is also my first debate... on debate.org at least. Mr. Pote is my father. My opponent concedes to my definition of a sport and that \"If both are sports, and nothing can be more of a sport than a sport, then they are equal sports.\" This is found at the end of my first contention. The most important part of this quote is \"nothing can be more of a sport than a sport\". Since we have already agreed that both golf and Ping Pong are sports, then neither of them can be \"more of a sport\" than the other. The resolution is impossible to affirm. My opponent makes several arguments against my second contention, subpoint c). The first argument is that the majority of golf games are in tournaments, and that \"there can be just as many opponents in a ping pong tournament as a golf tournament\". I will concede this point, that there are EQUAL numbers of opponents in each of the tournaments. The second argument is that ping pong is more difficult to consistently win because each player must play multiple games in order to win. My opponent does not cite a specific number of games. In each golf tournament each player must play 18 holes. If we use the example of 25 competitors per tournament this comes out to 450 holes per tournament. Each hole is a competition that can literally cause a player to lose the entire tournament. The third and final attack on my case is that there are variables that affect ping pong, including \"paddles(size and weight of paddles), balls(weight of balls), table(what tables are made of), ect.\" My opponent agrees that there are more variables affecting golf though, so even if there are variables affecting ping pong they do not overpower the variables affecting golf. Thus, golf is more affected by variables and is therefore harder to consistently win at. My opponent asks \" Generally is golf not played on nice days with little wind?\", and the answer would be yes. The key word in his question is generally, which leaves room for golf to be played on not so nice days and/or with a lot of wind. Ping pong does not have any of these variables ever because it is played indoors or under controlled circumstances. I would like to note that my opponent does not offer any arguments against my first contention, or my subpoints a) or b). I will try to show the importance of these points in my next round. My opponent then goes on to defend his case. He defines Skill as \"competent excellence in performance; expertness; dexterity\" I accept this definition. He says that \"Skill is not defined by the distance hit but the accuracy of the ball hit\" I do not see accuracy anywhere in the agreed upon definition of skill, but I will argue that golf requires more accuracy than Ping Pong. My opponent fails to recognize that in a larger area there are more points that can be the possible landing spots of a ball. It requires more accuracy to hit a single point 100 yards away than to hit a single point 1 yard away because of all the variables affecting the ball while it is in the air. This can be cross applied to my variables argument in subpoint c) of my contention 2. A golf ball stays in the air for a much longer period of time and therefore variables have more of an effect on its final stopping point. Variables lead to inaccuracy, which means that golf requires more accuracy to compensate for the variables affecting the golf ball. My opponent argues that \"It takes more skill to hit a ping pong ball in the exact spot that will make your opponent to miss than it does to hit a golf ball in the general vicinity of something on a huge golf course\" but the golf tournament victors do not simply hit a golf ball in any \"general vicinity\". There are many examples of incredible accuracy including the above video. http://www.youtube.com... My opponent also argues that \"the distance is irrelevant.\", which would mean that golf and ping pong require the same level of accuracy, which would negate the resolution. My opponent agrees that he was comparing two very unlike things and that means that they cannot be accurately used to compare golf and ping pong, so the comparison he made in his first case is moot. My opponent then argues that the force required to hit a ping pong ball across the table is greater than the force required to hit a golf ball across the course. He cites that Force=Mass x Acceleration and plugs in a few numbers to calculate the force for each sport. His math is incorrect. 115 grams x 78 m = 8.970 Newtons is correct.(m is actually the incorrect unit for acceleration, but I assume he means m/s2, that is, meters divided by seconds squared)(1) However, 77 grams x 1.875 m would actually be .144375 Newtons. It's .077 x 1.875. I hope that this was a simple decimal error and not a deliberate attempt to skew facts by not converting the 77 grams that a ping pong ball weighs into .077 kilograms. The weight of a golf ball was properly converted into kilograms. Newtons are \"the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared\"(2) This means that the force required to send a golf ball the distance that golf balls are sent is much greater than the force required to send a ping pong ball the distance that ping pong balls are sent. This does not take into account constant motion however, but there have been no calculations done as to the force required for constant motion and thus it cannot be proved that constant motion is more stressful than the difference in force between golf and ping pong. My opponent's last argument includes is that \"In every type of action it is harder to hit a moving object\". This is actually false. The direction of movement is what matters. My opponent brings up the example of hunting deer and how it is more difficult \" to kill it as it is running away\", but this is only based on the direction of the movement of the deer. If the deer were running in a straight line in the same direction as the hunter fires the bullet in, the deer will be hit. Likewise, if a ping pong ball is sent towards your paddle, it requires no effort on your part to hit it. It does require some effort to hit a golf ball and some effort is more than no effort. I realise that professional ping pong players do not send the ball directly into their opponent's paddle, but so far I have no reason to think that the effort required to hit a moving ping pong ball a short distance is greater than the effort required to hit a stationary golf ball a very large distance, especially when the golf ball has so many variables affecting it.

However your debate topic was not that golfers get over paid, or that golfers should not make as much money as baseball players, the point you started was that Golf is not a sport when in fact it is. Again your vendetta against the sport is based purely on your opinion. I have personal experience that golf is a game of extreme skill, and mental duress with some physical extortion. The fact is Golf meets the criteria according to every definition of \"sport\" available. Therefore in the minds of myself and the common English language golf is and should be considered a sport.",

Us golfers work out and have to watch what we eat. We can not eat unhealthy and go play golf afterwards. The definition of a sport is: an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment. Which golf does apply. It takes skill, hard work and dedication to be good, just like any other sport.

Here is the definition of \"physical\" that I will be using in this debate: \"characterized by especially rough and forceful physical activity.\" Golf does not meet this definition.

            "conclusion": "Ping Pong is More of a Sport than Golf",
            "premise": "Mr. Pote I am an eighth grader from Kansas and have had no formal debate class or any class for that matter so I will try my hardest to be formal and give you an opposing case (this is also my first debate ever) so here we go. My opponent gives the definition of a sport and says that \"If both are sports, and nothing can be more of a sport than a sport, then they are equal sports.\" I agree with this and will not oppose this statement. Contention two:(c) \"Golf also directly sets opponents against each other, however, the number of opponents is normally much higher than the number of opponents in Ping Pong.\" (5) \"Naturally, the more opponents there are, the harder it is for any one player to consistently win.\" Golf is a game played in tournaments most of the time (unless you are playing a single game which is not how the professionals play) Ping Pong is also a sport that is played in tournaments so therefore there can be just as many opponents in a ping pong tournament as a golf tournament. if a tournament in golf consists of 25 people and a ping pong tournament consists of 25 people, ping pong is actually the harder game to consistently when at because there are more chances for mistakes because you will have to play more than just one game but multiple games to be the winner of the tournament. \"Also, golf courses are not nearly as controlled as Ping Pong tables, and it is therefore easier for variables to randomly cause a loss/victory. Golfers must not only beat their opponents, as is the sole task of Ping Pong players, but they must also beat random variables.\" golf does have more variables than ping pong but there are also variables in ping pong such as paddles(size and weight of paddles), balls(weight of balls), table(what tables are made of), ect. Generally is golf not played on nice days with little wind? http://www.golflink.com... http://www.usatt.org... \"Golf takes more skill than Ping Pong because the distance that a golf ball must be hit far exceeds the distance that a Ping Pong ball must be hit, and the golf ball must not only be hit far, it must be hit far with great accuracy. Sending a ball of roughly equal shape and size a farther distance with the same accuracy is inherently more skillful.\" SKILL-competent excellence in performance; expertness; dexterity Skill is not defined by the distance hit but the accuracy of the ball hit so that is what I would like to zero in on. It takes more skill to hit a ping pong ball in the exact spot that will make your opponent to miss than it does to hit a golf ball in the general vicinity of something on a huge golf course. Lets compare the size of one hole to the size of a tennis table. My opponent states that the balls are of about the same size and equal in shape. That just means that you have to hit a bigger ball (in comparison to the playing space) in a smaller space and more accurate at that. Also you have to hit a heavier ball with a heavier club so the distance is irrelevant. \"This is a comparison of two very unlike things. My opponent compares two requirements of Ping Pong to the level of accomplishment that \"any one\" can succeed in. \"any one\" could also succeed in Ping Pong, for example: I beat my 3 year old next door neighbor because she could not return any of my serves\" I agree these are two different things \"Golf also requires Hand Eye coordination and golf is more physically stressful to the body. Golf requires more strength because the distance that the golf ball is forced to travel is greater than the distance that the Ping Pong ball is forced to travel, which requires more force. More force expenditure from a body=more physically stressful to the body.\" In ping pong you must move around constantly to keep a ball in play in golf on the other hand you move to the tee and swing then jump in the golf court and ride to where the ball is that is not very physical at all. I disagree you must hit a golf ball with equal force as you do a ping pong ball because. F=M*A M=115 grams A=78 m times a equals 8.97 Newton's - this is for a golf ball F=M*A M= 77 grams A=1.875 m times a equals 144.375 - this is for ping pong scientifically by your standards more force is required for ping pong so the statement of mine saying \"Ping Pong takes Hand Eye coordination and is also physically stressful to the body\" is correct! That does not include the constant motion either. http://www.streetdirectory.com... http://www.ajdesigner.com... http://golf.about.com... http://hypertextbook.com... http://www.jayandwanda.com... \"I concede that a golf ball is stationary until it is hit and that a Ping Pong ball is generally not stationary until it is hit. However, I do not see how hitting a moving object a very short distance is in any way more skillful, physically stressful or \"more of a sport\"\" Once again I agree that is no more of a sport than golf but also once again the size of the playing field determines accuracy which is the definition of skill. In every type of action it is harder to hit a moving object. take hunting for example it is easier to hit a deer that does not know you are there to shoot him than it does to kill it as it is running away. http://dictionary.reference.com...",

I will argue in favor of Chess Chess is a sport It is even recognized as a sport by the Olympics [1] Reasons chest is more difficult It makes you think minuets and moves in advance. While golf requires you to be skilled and have precision, chess requires you just not think about the current move you are making but moves you have to make in the future. A move you make at the present turn can cause a butterfly effect for moves in later turns. It is all strategy and planning, making yourself think ahead and trying to bait your adversary into moves that could be turns in length. Chess all requires the knowledge of multiple roles and how to play them well. Each pieces has a certain way in which it is to be used, and knowing how to use the pieces, knowing how your opponent will use the pieces, and trying to figure out the best way to use them is mentally challenging as well. People even use chess as a way to improve their mental capacities. While it can improve their chess game chess also helps some people improve their mentally ability in other areas. It is often used as a training tool, and has been used in history for the same reasons [2]. It has been primarily used throughout history in military education and teaching people to read their opponents actions and moves. [3] While golf has its mentally challenging moments, it is no where near as mentally challenging as chess [1] http://www.olympic.org... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org... [3] http://uni-nke.hu...",

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting this debate Briannj17, I look forward to arguing this topic with you. For my first point I would like to define the noun sport. The definition by dictionary.com is, \"an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.\"[1]. Notice how it says an athletic activity requiring skill OR physical prowess. I bring this point because I find many people argue the point that eSports are not physical enough, and that anyone could do it. I can prove this false. Professional eSport players are not able to just jump in and be good. Many pros put in thousands of hours of work. They practice and scrim all day long to prepare for tournaments. Team Liquid claims to practice at least 50 hours a week, and team liquid isn't even great compared to some eSports legends. In the same article it is said two players (Known for being very good) often sleep only four hours a night and practice between 12 and 14 hours per day.[2] eSports players can also very easily lose jobs. Often esports are even watched more than large tournaments of what people consider, \"Real Sports\" as shown in this graph [3].When signed players are often given a gaming house to live in with the team while playing for them. They are expected to practice all day, only taking breaks to eat and sleep.[4] These teams can drop them at anytime. These players have to fight to stay on these favorable teams. Under performing can lose them a spot, lose them a tournament, lose them money, or even lose them a job. This is not even mentioning the constant flaming people get from sources of social media causing many players to leave the eSports scene from the constant berating. An example for this would be Dyrus from TSM (Team SoloMid). He underperformed a few games, got flamed by reddit, and eventually left because he felt he was letting people down. The same thing happened to TSM's old mid laner Reginald. This shows how stressful eSports can be. All of these elements together along with the competitive element and faithful community should show why eSports should be recognized as an actual sport. http://dictionary.reference.com...

            "premise": "Thank you for setting up this debate, I accept to argue that video games are not sports, that eSports are seperate from physical sports.Your definition of sport leaves out the bit about physical exertion that is prevalent in just about every online definition I've ever read, from Google to Merriam Webster to Dictionary.com. The definition of the noun \"sport\" according to Dictionary.com is:\"an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of acompetitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.\"The key word here is, of course, athletic. Video games are not an athletic activity, no matter how quickly you can move your fingers. You said in your argument that professional gamers are athletes but not physical athletes, and if we take a look at the definition of \"athlete\": Merriam Webster:\"a person who is trained or skilled in exercises, sports, or games requiring physical strength, agility, or stamina\" Dictionary.com:\"a person trained or gifted in exercises or contests involving physicalagility, stamina, or strength;a participant in a sport, exercise, or game requiring physical skill.\"Prize pools are impressive in eSports, but this does not contribute to the argument that eSports should be considered physical sports, I don't see how this helps your argument. Sports are competitions requiring physical exertion, and in the definition of \"sport\" listed above salary is not mentioned. How much professional gamers are paid has no bearing on whether or not video games are sports. eSports do appear on sports channels and sports news, but it is seperated from all of the other sports and addressed as \"eSports\". ESPN, the world's leading sports news source, has a section for eSports, but it is addressed just as eSports (http://www.espn.com...). This is because eSports are a subcategory of sports, they aren't the same thing, but they have a very similar competitive format.You brought up chess, saying that it is widely regarded as a sport. This is true, but there are good reasons for this. Chess requires peak mental condition, which requires one to also be in peak physical condition. To quote London Chess Conference: \"Peak mental condition requires being in good physical condition. Players need to concentrate totally for up to seven hours. As the stress and tension builds up, blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates all increase. Contenders for the world championships have nutritionists and fitness coaches.\"There are numerous other reasons chess is considered a sport on that website, for example chess has been recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Comittee since 2000.In conclusion, video games are not sports, they are eSports. This is a subcategory, not the same thing, different in ways that prohibit eSports from being sports. I feel like I should clarify that I have no problem with eSports, I love eSports. I follow CoD eSports (since it's the game I discovered eSports on) and right now I'm trying to get into CS:GO and Halo's professional scenes.Sources:http://www.dictionary.com...http://www.merriam-webster.com...http://www.dictionary.com...http://londonchessconference.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "Gaming is a sport",
            "conclusion": "Gaming is a sport",
            "premise": "Gaming or Esports by definition is considered a sport. (1) What are the requirements for something to be considered a sportTypically most sports share similar qualities. They require physical activity, strategy, are competitive based, require reflexes, require training to improve, etc. No sport is required to have all of these but can pull from a few of these in order to be classified as a sport. What my adversary is going to try and do is paint a picture where Esports does not require you to use much physical activity. Meaning he's going to lump sports like baseball, football, and wrestling and use that as an objective gauge for what should be used to be classified as a sport. Imagine this objective gauge as a bar. For him to do this he must show the exact measure and classifications for what should be considered a sport. Meaning if physical contact is a requirement, then why is running a sport? This extends throughout that line of logic for, however, he chooses to apply it. If just the use of physical activity is a requirement then why is pool, shooting, and other things that require primarily reflexes sports? For him to classify sports in that way he must show that all other sports that are considered sports fall under whatever categorical application that he is going to apply objectively across the board. (2) Why Esports are SportsOnce we dispell the notion that sports require physical contact or a great deal of physical activity, we can clearly see that Esports are sports. Sports that are objectively considered sports that work on reflexes and not much physical activity are pool, shooting, hunting, etc and so forth[1]. I could list a lot but it would be a waste of time, these are mostly obvious and shooting is an Olympic sport so we can assume it's universally considered to be a sport and the measure that this is gauged as a sport should be applied across the board.Esports require you to use strategy (which is one thing most sports have in common), reflexes (which is another thing most sports have in common) and even can require you to activate and practice with muscle memory (which most sports also require). Use this sample as a way to prove this as a fact [2]. The more you try to click on the dot the easier it gets. Over time your muscles recognize movements when you are trying to flick the cursor on the dot, and you are able to respond with faster movements with a motion called flicking. Gaming most certainly requires muscle memory and every shooter invokes this. Esports all requires a whole new level of strategy and critical thinking. Being able to make the right decisions on the spot when you are under pressure is also another common characteristic a lot of sports share in common. ConclusionWhile gaming and Esports are not a traditional physical contact sport, it does invoke muscle memory, critical thinking, strategizing, and meets requirements that would label it as a sport. Not all sports are bash or brute, some require timing, mental fortitude, and sheer reflexes and as I mentioned earlier some of these sports such as shooting are already classified as sports even on Olympic levels. So if we apply the same standard objectively, we must consider Esports an actual sport otherwise it's being biased. [1]https://en.wikipedia.org...[2] https://scratch.mit.edu...",

            "premise": "Colour guard is a sport The definition of a sport goes as follows: 1. competitive physical activity: an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill, governed by rules, and sometimes engaged in professionally ( often used in the plural ) Is color guard a competitive physical activity? Yes it is there are many competitions. Now there may not be a definite loser but that is because so many groups that compete. For sure the winner does get prestige just as if they had won a super bowl. Color guard is a group activity that is very physical and full of athleticism. Ever heard the annoyingly worn-out argument, \"Cheerleading is not a sport\"? The truth is that legally, North Augusta cheerleading is NOT a sport. In cheerleading however, you compete through the districts. Soccer and football does the same too. Therefore I believe that whatever sports argument they are cooking up falls. \"It is not recognized by the olympics\" Here is the issue with this. Golf is a sport. However it is not in the olympics. Does that mean Golf is no longer a sport? Just because it is not in the olympics does not define what really is a sport. Sure there are many non sports that aren't in the olympics. However we can still justify that golf is a sport and we can't exclude that from a sports. Therefore this argument is false. Not all competitions need a definitive scoring system. Numbers don't define what is right or wrong, likewise what is a sport or not. \"there is no clear interaction\" Their definition is very biased in my opinion. Their definition only indicates that there is a NEED to score points and show a clash among participants. However, this is only referring to his arguments and not the whole case in general. For that I believe this is more biased towrds his side. Here is my definition that refers to both sides: competitive physical activity: an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill, governed by rules, and sometimes engaged in professionally They have stated that they need to practice the same moves overtime. However this is still physical. It shows skills and physical exertion on how to achieve this. For that, their \"two side\" argument falls. Thanks",

My opponent stated that \"Swimming like many other competitive events is not a sport. A sport is something that you can play against some one else. Any event that you can compete against yourself should not be considered in the realm of sports.\" Swimming is an event that you can compete against others, when your swimming against someone else you are competing against them. You are competing against yourself and you are competing with the other teams as well. Second \"I myself am on a swim team in Rapid City, South Dakota. It is certainly a skill. A skill that many including myself don't have. I want to ask you a question.\" I also am on a swim team and I know that to win a swimming championships you need the best times, so you are always competing against yourself but you are also competing against others as well. Third \"Is speed skateboarding a sport? It is basically the same thing it has rules and the first one back wins. Yes for every one out there I don't consider track or golf a sport either. For a sport it needs to have to have multiple teams to be played. With that I am open to your refutations.\" By what you described speed skateboarding as yes it would be considered a sport, because you are competing against another person right? Then overall speed skateboarding is like nascar. Also golf and track are sports to because not only does the whole world consider them they both are competitions. In the PGA tours it is all about golf players COMPETING against each other so it is a sport, and for track runners we have a whole olympic event for this plus you are competing against other nations making it a sport. Thank you,",

One reason this is a sport is that Chess plays upon the mental toughness of the player similar to wrestling, cross country or other Sports. And yes I have participated in both of those sports so I do know what it means to physically exert yourself. Another reason that chess is a sport is that it is actually recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Committee. Also, It is recognized as a sport in multiple countries including Turkey, and over 100 countries. This is a huge amount of countries considering there are only 195 countries in the world. World chess champions have also won their national Sportsman of the Year competition including Magnus Carlsen (Norway), Vishy Anand (India) and Veselin Topalov (Bulgaria). the player ranking system was developed for chess in 1960 and has been adopted by many other sports including American football, baseball, basketball, hockey, korfball, rugby, and golf. Football and cricket use a related formula. Peak mental condition requires being in good physical condition. Players need to concentrate totally for up to seven hours. As the stress and tension build up, blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates all increase. Contenders for the world championships have nutritionists and fitness coaches. Thus concluding all of this compelling information. I believe that Chess is in fact a sport.",

            "premise": "Rule Updates - There is no sentence minimum or maximum - You must provide a Positive Criticism and a Negative Criticism - You don't have to re-state your thesis, but you can. If you're going to, you can provide some more detail to your thesis to make it clear. Well, I'm doing it just to clear things up. Notice I said \"you can\" meaning you have a choice to do it or not. So, either way, you're not going to be penalized depending on the voter. - You still have to state your goodbyes - You can rebut if you still want to. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Con has forfeited Round 4, therefore my rebuttals has been left undisputed. Also, Con can't state any further rebuttals and I have proven his statements fallacious. Thesis Restatements Yes, I can agree that Marching Band is not a \"professional\" sport, but what people don't realize is that a sport does not to be in the professional league. You see, when people think about sports, they think of Soccer, Basketball, Football, Baseball, and sometimes Hockey. It's those sports that they see on TV that they perceive as a sport. This sort of thing obscures the true definition of a sport which is \" an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\" I've already clarifed that a sport must have: 1. Competition 2. The involvement of physical exertion. Now, notice I said involvment. That means it's associated with it in general. I didn't say that the scale of physical exertion taking place had to be very significant, apparent, and extreme. I didn't say that. So, don't just take this notion of just because it doesn't have a certain piece of this, it doesn't make it a sport. These certain pieces don't exist. I mean, Golf is a sport. All you do is swing and walk. You don't even have to walk, you can just bring a golf cart. The only physical activity that's taking place is when you swing. The key thing that makes golf a sport is precision. You have Polo which is an Equestrian sport (usage of horses). The horse is doing all of the physical activity, but did it say in the defintion that a human being had to do physical activity? 3. Governed by a set of rules I've already clarified that Marching Band has rules that every band should follow did I not? 4. Has to have skill Everyone knows that you must have knowledge and skill in music to march and play at the same time. Also, look at all of the sources I have that further proves my case. I haven't even used the YouTube videos that proves Marching Band being a sport. I'll paste them at the end of my conclusion. Positive Criticism Even though, your arguments were erreneous, I have to give you credit. You are probably the most surprising opponent I've met. I honestly didn't expect some validity to come from your arguments. Before I started the debate, I originally thought it was nearly impossible to oppose me, but you proved me wrong about that. But..... Negative Criticism Your biggest downfall of the debate is you didn't really follow the definition of what a sport is. Also, you didn't take in the generalization of the definition of \"physical exertion.\" Your connotation of \"sport\" was kind of unclear because you kept adding fundamentals that you declare defines a sport when it really doesn't. You said that a sport must have intermission which are timeouts and breaks. Where, in the definition of sport, says that sports must have intermission? It's like your insight of sports are professional sports. Yes, Marching Band is not a professional sport, but that's not what we're debating about. We are debating if Marching Band is just a sport. There are different kinds of sports. Electronic sports, Equestrian sports, Mind sports, Shooting sports, etc. Every sport is different. Physical exertion means just using and improving your muscles. Like I said earlier, cardiovascular fitness falls into this category and there's a lot of cardiovascular activity going on in Marching Band. All of that being said, you were a good opponent. I wish you good day, and a thank you for participating in this debate. It was nice debating with you. To all of the voters, please vote on a winner based on who made the better argument because I know some of you will vote on the person you just agree with. That is an absurd way of voting.

I would also use what my Physical Science teacher and my mother said about Marching Band being a sport. I will not directly quote them because I don't remember exactly what they said. My physical science teacher is a Golf coach and she is well-informed of the definition of sport. My mother knows about my school district. 38.

            "discussionTitle": "Video games are a sport",
            "conclusion": "Video games are a sport",
            "premise": "Sounds like this will be an interesting discussion. My opponent brings up the argument that video games are not a sport due to lack of physical activity. Pro argues that other activities with little physical activity are considered sports, but he does not challenge the fact that video games lack physical activity. Since we are agreed on this, I will use it as my Contention 1: Video games lack physical activity. Video games, such as Star Craft, which Pro mentioned, can require a variety of mental skills, as well as good vision and hand-eye coordination. However, one thing they do not require is physical activity, which is something Pro confirms. My opponent uses dictionary.com, which is not at all a problem in the context of this debate. However, if we dig deeper, we can find that Pro trunucated his definition of \"sport\". Normally, this is not a problem, and such an action can often be justified for the sake of brevity, but in this case, the full definition has more useful information to consider: \"an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.\" This definition provides not only criteria for inclusion, but a variety of examples, including racing, (maybe not auto racing, but this works just as well) which is considered a sport due to the physical stamina that is necessary on account of the moderate G-forces that riders experience, and golf, which requires physical skill to control the ball with a wide variety of clubs and in many circumstances. This can be expressed as Contention 2: Sports require physical activity. I could stop right here, but it might also be very useful to return to dictionary.com. If a sport is an \"athletic activity...\" the definition of \"athletic\" might be useful here: \"of or relating to athletes; involving the use of physical skills or capabilities, as strength, agility, or stamina\" These are our established criteria for a sport. Sports involve physical activities or capabilities. We could discuss why video games do not meet these criteria, but that is unnecessary, since Pro argues that they do not, and we are in agreement on this. To conclude, let me explain my stance on the other four activities my opponent mentioned: Curling, chess, competitive eating, and poker. Curling involves the physical abilities to release a stone with vital accuracy in speed and direction, and to manipulate its trajectory by shaving the ice with technique and accuracy. These are physical activities. Conclusion: Sport. Chess is said by some to be a sport because professional games, which can last for six or even seven hours, require stamina and endurance. However, chess has always been a primarily mental activity, and it can be enjoyed just as well at faster time controls, in which games can be done in under two hours. The physical aspect does not play a role in most contexts. Conclusion: Not a sport. Competitive eating involves at its core a physical skill, the ability to ingest large amounts of food in a short time. Conclusion: Sport. Poker, like chess, involves mental skill and decisions. One could argue that it also involves the ability to psychologically interpret opponents, and keep them from doing the same to you. However, this again is a mental activity, not a physical one. Conclusion: Not a sport. The word \"sport\" can mean a wide variety of things. It does not only involve brute force, as in American football or wrestling, or endurance, as in long-distance running or soccer, but more subtle physical abilities, as in archery or golf. Video games are not a sport, since they primarily involve mental and not physical abilities.",

            "conclusion": "why is esports is a sport",
            "premise": "I\"d like to thank my opponent, and I will debate from the Pro side which stands that E-Sport is a sport. First, I\"d like to assert that \"sport\" is a recreational activity whereby a person partakes as an individual or a team to compete against an opposition, in a match of skill, speed, strength, strategy, and tactics. Now let me highlight some characteristics of E-sports which bear some resemblance to real-life sports. Competition: E-sport players have to compete with their opponents to win a match, just like football, racing etc. Skills and activities: E-sport players need a high level of tactical understanding and constant practice to win a match, especially in strategy games like League of Legends and DOTA. And scientists at the German Sports University have conducted a study of E-Sport players and it demonstrates that players are exposed to physical strains similar to those of normal athletes (1). Another study has shown that video game players did significantly better in basic motor skills, such as precision, aiming, speed, dexterity and movement coordination (2). So it's safe to assume that many E-sport players are exposed to physical activities to some extent in training and competitions. Trianing: Players work as part of a team and have tough training regimes. They also worked on things like healthy eating, sleeping enough and daily physical exercises (3). Some teams are trained by sports coaches, and sports psychologists. Rules and Regulations: Just like normal sports, E-sports have its own rules and regulations developed by World Esports Association or WESA. The association brings traditional sports rulings to E-sport. So in conclusion, I believe that E-Sport is a form of sport which shares many characteristics of real-life sports. I hope to see my opponent\"s arguments in the next round. (1) http://www.dw.com... (2) https://link.springer.com... (3) https://www.redbull.com...",

A skill that many including myself don't have. I want to ask you a question. Is speed skateboarding a sport? It is basically the same thing it has rules and the first one back wins. Yes for every one out there I don't consider track or golf a sport either. For a sport it needs to have to have multiple teams to be played. With that I am open to your refutations.",

            "discussionTitle": "Ping Pong is More of a Sport than Golf",
            "conclusion": "Ping Pong is More of a Sport than Golf",
            "premise": "Dear Sir, I also would like to thank you for accepting this debate it has been fun. \"The second argument is that ping pong is more difficult to consistently win because each player must play multiple games in order to win. My opponent does not cite a specific number of games. In each golf tournament each player must play 18 holes. If we use the example of 25 competitors per tournament this comes out to 450 holes per tournament. Each hole is a competition that can literally cause a player to lose the entire tournament.\" 450 holes looks meager compared to the number of serves that would have to happen to win a Ping Pong tournament, \"winning consistently\". 21 points= 1 game 7 games= 1match there are 3 matches in a round. And if it is a double elimination like some are, 48 rounds would be played to find a grand champion. So lets figure this up. There are 441 points in a round times 48 rounds, equals 21,168 serves in all. A serve would be compared to teeing off, in golf. This would make ping pong harder to \"consistently win\" at. \"The third and final attack on my case is that there are variables that affect ping pong, including \"paddles(size and weight of paddles), balls(weight of balls), table(what tables are made of), ect.\" My opponent agrees that there are more variables affecting golf though, so even if there are variables affecting ping pong they do not overpower the variables affecting golf. Thus, golf is more affected by variables and is therefore harder to consistently win at.\" This is true but the variables do not out weigh the win factor if it is 450 holes to 21,168 serves. Variables can not affect a game by that much it is physically impossible. the variables would have to make up 20,718 holes. \"My opponent asks \" Generally is golf not played on nice days with little wind?\", and the answer would be yes. The key word in his question is generally, which leaves room for golf to be played on not so nice days and/or with a lot of wind. Ping pong does not have any of these variables ever because it is played indoors or under controlled circumstances. I concede to this statement. http://tabletennis.about.com... http://www.ehow.com... \" It requires more accuracy to hit a single point 100 yards away than to hit a single point 1 yard away because of all the variables affecting the ball while it is in the air. A golf ball stays in the air for a much longer period of time and therefore variables have more of an effect on its final stopping point. Variables lead to inaccuracy, which means that golf requires more accuracy to compensate for the variables affecting the golf ball.\" Ping pong balls are hit from farther away than one yard see the video (also notice the movement of the players, if I have enough room I will get back to that). I will agree that variables lead to inaccuracy but once again no variables can affect the outcome of a tournament by that much. \"My opponent argues that \"It takes more skill to hit a ping pong ball in the exact spot that will make your opponent to miss than it does to hit a golf ball in the general vicinity of something on a huge golf course\" but the golf tournament victors do not simply hit a golf ball in any \"general vicinity\". There are many examples of incredible accuracy including the above video.\" Firstly I am aware of the magnificent shot of tiger woods and also I know that he is not the only person to do so, but the thing is that this ideal shot happens almost never it is a rarity of golf. Secondly the distance you have to hit a golf ball (on some holes) to get it in the hole is above human capability. \"My opponent also argues that \"the distance is irrelevant.\", which would mean that golf and ping pong require the same level of accuracy, which would negate the resolution.\" this comment is not true and I will agree that what I said is incorrect. Stating that, I would like to mention that this \"incredible accuracy\" is not complete skill as in all sports luck is involved. The conditions or the variables where just right to help this next to impossible shot. \"My opponent then argues that the force required to hit a ping pong ball across the table is greater than the force required to hit a golf ball across the course. He cites that Force=Mass x Acceleration and plugs in a few numbers to calculate the force for each sport. His math is incorrect. 115 grams x 78 m = 8.970 Newtons is correct.(m is actually the incorrect unit for acceleration, but I assume he means m/s2, that is, meters divided by seconds squared)(1) However, 77 grams x 1.875 m would actually be .144375 Newtons. It's .077 x 1.875.\" This incorrect math is not really incorrect. The miss understanding is partially my fault for these reasons. 1) I said \"F=M*A M=115 grams A=78 m times a equals 8.97 Newton's - this is for a golf ball F=M*A M= 77 grams A=1.875 m times a equals 144.375 - this is for ping pong\" this was in correct. 2) the first reason it was in correct is that I did not mention m/s2 as the unit. 3) The mass of the object was for the paddles and clubs, I took the average weight of each (using the same unit of weight(grams)) I multiplied this by the acceleration (both using the same standard unit (m/s2)) the reason my opponent is confused is that I said \"this is for a golf ball\" when it should have read this is for a golf club. I then put this in unit converter/force formula (http://www.ajdesigner.com...) and I got 8.97 newtons for the golf club and 144.375 for the Ping Pong paddle. \"I hope that this was a simple decimal error and not a deliberate attempt to skew facts by not converting the 77 grams that a ping pong ball weighs into .077 kilograms. The weight of a golf ball was properly converted into kilograms.Newtons are \"the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared\"(2)This means that the force required to send a golf ball the distance that golf balls are sent is much greater than the force required to send a ping pong ball the distance that ping pong balls are sent.\" I put this in the formula converter and it takes care of converting. it was not a decimal error and I am going to do A golf ball compared to a pong ball right now A PONG BALL WEIGHTS 2.7 GRAMS AND THE ACCELERATION IS 1.875 M/S2 THIS EQUALS FORCE = 0.0050625 NEWTONS NOW A GOLF BALL 45.93 GRAMS X ACCELERATION WHICH IS 78 M/S2 =3.58254 NEWTONS a golf ball has more force when hit than a ping pong ball but the ball is not stressing the body physically but the swing of the paddle/club is so this proves that ping pong is more physically stressful to the body. http://answers.yahoo.com... to address the hunting issue first ping pong balls move in different directions than just strait,like an arrow, they curve so a deer running is harder to hit because you must have the ball come down on the deer Pote I've enjoyed",

Basketball is popular world wide and is suitable for all ages http://channels.isp.netscape.com.... Golf and basketball are similar in few ways according to http://thegratefulgolfer.com..., but how good are they in terms of your health? Basketball is definitely a faster running game compared to golf. To play golf though, you have to have patience and good eye sight, which could fail some people. Basketball is definitely much better than golf for the fitness reasons of (http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au...): -burn calories (an hour of basketball can burn 630\u2013750 calories)-build endurance-improve balance and coordination-develop concentration and self-discipline-build up muscle-take care of your body more (stretches/warmup/warm down)Basketball is a more competitive sport compared to golf. Making you work towards something, and hopefully achieving it. This might be as simple as wining a game or be a fluent shooter. People at all ages can play it, and all you need to practice is a ball and a hoop. Basketball is played by people of all ages and all abilities, meaning you can challenge yourself. If you want to be the best at basketball, you do specialised training. This evolves sprints, jumping, core, strength and conditioning and more. As basketball is played all year round and is mainly an indoor sport, so you can aim to be fit all year.Children at all levels can enjoy the game too whilst making friends. As golf only evolves a small amount of people, basketball has at least 10 players each game. http://www.livestrong.com....Wheel chair basketball is also an option for people who have disabilities or have had an accident. However, it stops you from being able to play golf. Wheel chair basketball is most likely one of the best sports for people who have disabilities.In addition, basketball is much more preferable than golf. Linking it to higher fitness levels, more people to socialise with, get to be more motivated and everyone can participate in basketball.",

I see eSports as the same way, and some others do too. I could argue Poker is a competition, but it is respected as a sport. ESPN even recognizes it as a sport and there is not much a physical aspect to it. Poker is a mental sport, you must be focused and smart, much like eSports. Going on with the topic of ESPN, and what the John Skipper said. He may say that eSports are not sports. He can have his opinions, but officially the U.S does recognize eSports as Sports, and Foreign players from places as far as Asia, Europe, and even Africa coming to the U.S for gaming tournaments can get Visas with the identifier, \"Professional Athlete\"[1] For my last point this round I would like to bring Razer's eSports associate manager Drew Holt-Kentwell's words on this matter into it. He says,\"According to Merriam Webster, a 'sport' is 'a contest or game in which people do certain physical activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other, eSports is a competition, absolutely. Moreover, gaming athletes have to train bodily and mentally to be competitive or they lose. eSports requires extraordinary coordination, hyper-fast reflex responses, teamwork, and physical and mental dexterity and endurance \" often for extended periods of time under the pressure of strictly enforced game rules.\" He then goes on to say, \"The legitimacy of a sport really comes down to its cultural impact, adding that professional gamers are already recognized for work visa purposes for competitive events just like real-world athletes.\" [2] If these players are being recognized on this level by governments, then why should they not be recognized by networks such as ESPN, and the people of the U.S. http://www.forbes.com...[1] http://www.polygon.com...[2]",

That being said, this argument will hardly need much content to win. What Exactly is the \"Best Sport?\" Here is the definition of best: Best: of the highest quality, excellence, or standing[1] Here is the definition of sport: Sport: an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.[2] From these definitions, it can be concluded that the \"best sport\" is the one that requires more skill and physical prowess than the others. However, it is virtually impossible to compare different sports due to their diverse gameplay, equipment, and setting for playing. Therefore, there is no \"best sport,\" and people who do claim that it is are prejudiced since they don't have evidence that their sport (or hockey in this case) has the highest requirement of skill or physical prowess. Pro has failed to provide evidence for this, and his entire argument is heavily opinionated. In addition, he failed to accept full BoP. The outcome of this debate favors Con.

If those were required to become a sport half of the major sports would be eliminated like basketball or badminton. Also, many gaming tournaments are held outside. Video games represent things we do every day? No way! In your everyday lives, very few jobs require the mouse control or reflexes video games need. If chess, the 1500 year old game, developed over centuries is not a \"traditional sport\", than what is? Besides, in the modern era, a lot of tradition is dead. Christmas is no longer a celebration of Christ, but it is more of a time to spend with friends and family. Also, you pointed out that esports do not have mental exertion, and due to one wrong reason, esports are disqualified. Is wrestling a sport? Is boxing a sport? Both named do not require strategy, or minimal strategy. If minimal strategy, AKA throwing punches at each other's face is enough to qualify, the wrist movement from the mouse or buttons is enough to deem it as physical exertion.

            "discussionTitle": "Women and Contact Sports",
            "conclusion": "Women and Contact Sports",
            "premise": "Thanks to Pro for a good debate. The Resolution The resolution could be implemented right away. Schools could \u201cestablish and promote\u201d contact sports for women. The way they could do it is to take funds away from sports currently in the athletic program and use them to hire coaches and buy equipment for women's contact sports. The debate question is, should that be done? It should be done only if the advantages of doing so outweigh the disadvantages. . Pro contends that the resolution is really some sort of question of principle, and not a call for actual implementation.\u201d One reason we know that the resolution is not a question of principle is that it calls for schools to \u201cestablish contact sports, including football and wrestling.\u201d That goes way beyond saying that women should not be denied contact sports, it says that it should be done, regardless of tradition (e.g., the school has a tradition of strong women's basketball) or the desires of the schools athletes (e.g., for some reason curling has become a hot sport locally). . I used language studies as an example of the meaning of the resolution. Pro claim that my example could be interpreted as a matter of principle, not practice. Compare two possible resolutions: . R1. High schools and colleges in the United States should establish and promote the study of the Serbo-Croation language. . R2. High schools and colleges in the United States should establish and promote the study of the Mandarin Chinese language. . I claim R1 certainly fails, but R2 could be affirmed. There is nothing wrong with the Serbo-Croation language, but schools schools should not \u201cestablish and promote\u201d it, because the advantages are not persuasive. R2 is different, Chinese is an important language in modern commerce and is rapidly rising in importance. Arguably it should displace French and some other languages in most curricula. R2 is logically taken as a practical resolution: the argument is that it can be done and schools should do it. Argument One: Benefits to Women If any new sport is established, there will a benefit to those who wish to participate. However, there is a disadvantage to those who are denied participation in the sports cut to establish the new one. Under the current system, new sports are adopted and dropped locally, based upon the school tradition and the interests of the athletes. Pro claims that women's wrestling is growing rapidly under the present system. He offers no evidence whatsoever that women who want wrestling are systematically denied. He has provided no evidence that even one women's football team was desired by athletes, let alone denied. Yet the resolution demands that women's football and wresting teams be established, whether anyone wants them or not. Argument Two: Sexism Pro's primary example of sexism was cheerleaders in football. Pro grants that the advent of male cheerleaders has done nothing to change the perception of cheerleading as a female sport. He introduces two new arguments in this final round that it's a matter of time and that some sports like track and field are inherently gender neutral. So not only running, but discus a shot put are gender neutral? Pro's contention is unsupported. I think the fundamental mistake is at this point being concern with sexism, I would ca it political correctness, in sports. At the time title IX was passed, c. 1970, it was a valid concern that women were not participating in sports. But there has been equal funding for 40 years, and four of the five most popular sports are enjoyed equally y men and women. the exceptions are football for men, and volleyball for women. I say, let the athletes do what they want to do. I argued cheerleaders are really entertaining the crowd, just as football players are entertaining the crowd. Cheerleading is not sexist, even though it appears so to Pro. Pro did not respond. Argument Three: Participation Con argues that many ore women are participating in contact sports, despite the barriers. What barriers? Pro provided no evidence that polar demand to establish a women's wresting team was denied due to the reasons he imagines. challenged Pro to provide evidence of demands for women's football, which he specifically says should be established. He d not cite any demand. Teams are not established solely because there is no demand. Suppose I claimed \"Curling teams should be promoted and established by schools in the US.\" Further suppose that I then claimed this would overcome hared of everything Canadian, and the proof is that curling is growing rapidly despite the barrier of Canadian hatred. Clearly, the argument fails because \"hatred of everything Canadian\" was never prove to be the barrier. The barrier as lack of interest, no more. Interest rises as those who participate raise enthusiasm. that's the way contact sports for women will progress or not, depending on the enthusiasm of part cants. Counterargument One: There Is No Reason To Prefer Contact Sports Pro invokes Rule 2, that I cannot propose banning all contact sports. At no time did I say or imply that men's contact sports should be banned. I did not propose that women's contact sports be banned. Had the resolution been \u201cMen's contact sports should be further established and promoted ...\u201d I would have had the same objection as with women's contact sports. My argument is that if some extra money is made available for sports, then it ought to be put towards life sports rather than contact sports. Life sports are better because they promote good health over a lifetime. Therefore, a disadvantage of the resolution is that it takes athletics in the wrong direction. Counterargument Two: Existing Sports Would Have To Be Cut This was discussed under The Resolution. Counterargument Three: Life Sports Are Better n R2, Pro seemed to mostly agree that life sports were athletically equivalent, with the reservation that life sports did not tech team play. I pointed out that life sports included soft ball and doubles tennis. In R3, Pro introduced the new argument that contact sports were athletically superior. He cited football as being more intense than golf or biking. Life sports, however, include intense sports like tennis. How intense life sports running, swimming, and biking are is adjustable for age and ability. Those are the triathlon sports, clearly intense. Golf when practiced is more intense than football when not practiced. An advantage of life sports is that they are practiced after the school years. Pro's R3.7 says that golf is declining in popularity with young people, while tennis is increasing in popularity. That's fine, both are life sports. Pro then argues that women's football ought to therefore displace golf as a priority in school sports. The reason given for golf's decline is the high cost of golf courses and failure to develop a version of the sport for very young players. Tennis developed a low cost version for very young players. Despite the decline 1.8 million will take up golf in elementary school alone. Women's football remain close to zero in popularity. Pro offered no data women's football is even growing in popularity. It shouldn't displace golf unless it grows substantially in popularity. The data argues for tennis displacing golf, which it is doing on it's own. . Summary I have no objection to either men or women participating in contact sports. The present system allows that to happen. However, schools should not establish and promote contact sports for women, because doing so necessarily harms existing sports and provides no significant compensating advantages. Pro introduced new arguments and evidence in the final round. that's not a crime against nature, but it's a debate conduct violation. the claim I violated rule 2 was clrly invalid. The resolution is negated.",

Some people play sports for entertainment as well. There are different types of video games. Not all of them are sports- RPG games cannot, but playing Esports competitively can. As someone mentioned in the comments, there are plenty of sports that require little physical conduct, like Go! or Chess, which, as I said before, is recognized as a sport in over 100 countries. You need to practice strategy and hone your skills to be able to stand a chance in a competition for these things, especially chess. Physical sports also require strategy, I got the definition from Dictionary.com. Also, I'm fairly sure that the definition of sport is not for entertainment. I mean, it could be, but many people play them professionally. There are also several other similar definitions that you can look at by scrolling down the list on this link: https://www.google.com... As Yos said, and I and many others have experienced, playing the games considered as Esports require incredible reflexes- pro gamers can even make as many as 400 moves on a keyboard per second, which is more than four times the average person. I may have been incorrect in my definition, but having good reflexes can certainly be counted as physical prowess. ESPN showcasing a gaming match further proves that it should be considered a sport. Esports teams are coached, like and pro athletic team would be, and some teams are even owned by people in the way football teams are. http://www.dailymail.co.uk... https://www.forbes.com...

Your argument is now based on the fact that there are other less physical competitions that are considered sports however there is some problems with that. Should we start drawing the line on what a sport is? By definition there are already games that are considered sports that shouldn't be. Such as pokers, chess, and the only one important in this debate videogames. Let's examine virtual verses reality. Every sport that is a sport has interactions between two or more people. Someone you can touch and interact face to face with. Egames does not have such teamwork as hockey, basketball, Soccer or any other \"classic\" or real sports. Stressful situations does not make something a sport. If you can make a good comparison between a classic sport and egames we may have something. However all we have is people glued to monitors. If esports is going to be considered a sport all videogames will become a sport. Rough and tumble interactive skilled sports is what has been the sports since the beginning. From the stoneware when ancient hunters would hunt wooly mammoths, sports have been around since ancient times. It is not time to make a virtual reality where what I watch on TV is other people watching a screen. For the definition of sports and the difference between reality and virtual it is clear that now is not the time to confuse the two. http://mp1st.com...",

The main argument against this is always the physical aspect, but u fail to see is the amount of energy exerted doesn't determine whether or not an activity is a sport. Your definitions proved golf is a sport because it is a physical activity, although it is not intense and by saying the definitions are vague, they are still the definitions, therefore your argument that golf is not a sport is pointless. Boxing can never be compared to golf in a mental aspect because in boxing there is no time to think. With your opponent constantly throwing punches at you, you can't think, u just react. In golf u actually have that time to think, if you just hit your ball in the trees, that whole walk u are thinking, \"I just lost the tournament\", or \"I'm such an idiot\". It is absurd to even compare the two, there is no other sport where a mental breakdown, can kill your entire game. You don't have any subs or anyone to relieve you, you have to power through your round. Your mind is pretty much your only asset and with the obstacles surrounding golf, it is constantly being attacked.",

            "premise": "Sport: An activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others. 1.The reason cheerleading is sport is because of the definition of sport. Competitive cheerleaders go to regionals, sectionals, state, and even nationals. They compete against teams, follow rules, and judges decide who win. That is the exact definition of sport. And if you've been to even one cheerleading practice, you know it's hard core, very unlike a golf or bowling practice, which are both considered sports. 2. Gymnastics is a sport, no one can argue that. The best gymnasts go to the Olympics. And gymnastics is a part of every good cheerleading routine. At junior high cheerleading competitions, I have seen many full twists, an extremely hard gymnastics skill. Gymnastics is a huge part of cheerleading. 3. Dancing is a sport. And as we all know, it can be very tiring. In every cheerleading routine, they dance, a lot. And not slow dances at all, they are extremely fast and difficult. So with two sports combined in cheerleading, how can it not be a sport? 4. Furthermore, it makes no sense at the junior high level to consider Scholastic Bowl, where you answer questions, a sport over cheerleading, with much physical exertion. There is a saying \"Athletes lift weights, cheerleaders lift people,\" that should speak a lot about cheerleading. Lifting people up, or mounting, is very difficult, especially the advanced mounts. I doubt anyone but the cheerleaders, who are arguably the best athletes, could do this. http://www.aacca.org... http://www.varsity.com... Finally, according to IHSA, cheerleading is a sport. http://ihsa.org...",

            "premise": "What is a sport? According to many resources (listed below), qualifications of a \"sport\" includes:1. An element of competition2. Requiring physical and mental concentration and exertion (Athletic and mental ability)3. Should not rely on factors of luck, almost all skill4. There has to be some form of strategy, not relied on pure strengthLeague of Legends and Counter Strike Global Offensive are two examples of popular, competitive esports. Both games implement a competitve scene with rows of bleachers for faithful fans, hardworking teammates, and two teams fighting for victory. In League of Legends, two teams aim to destroy each other's \"nexus\", a large crystal much like a base. For CSGO, Terrorists plant a bomb and defend it, while the opposition aspires to defuse it. Although video games do not require physical capability (the main arguement against esports), the amount of decision making, mouse and keyboard coordination, focus on the game, and prediction is a huge factor. Also, I believe this is the most faded rule listed. Chess, a game that most people consider a sport due to its competition, strategy, and cognition, does not involve physical exertion, much like League and Counter Strike. In fact, chess is a remarkably close cousin tp these two video games, sharing multiple properties, even the elo system to rank players. When one examines the vast ocean of sports, he will see skill in every game. Professional basketball, football, baseball players and many more dedicate hours upon hours on their sport, refining their skill. If sports were based on luck, why would they practice? Like Adrian Petersen, Stephen Curry, or Alex Rodriguez, professional players from esports spend most of their day parcticing their mechanics. Professional League player Yi Liang Peng from TSM spends most of his hours playing LoL at his team's gaming house. Esports outrank and sport in terms of strategy. Why do people enjoy video games? It is because one can do unlimited things behind a screen, unable to accomplish in real life. Because of this, the strategy, communication, and synergy of one team can decide a win or loss. Afterall, video games are designed to give an equal opportunity for each player to outplay each other.Esports like League of Legends and CSGO fit almost all expectations and qualifications of becoming a sport. The competition between teams is just as concentrated as other classic sports, the mental focus on the game is great, there is no luck involved due to damages being an exact number, rather than a dice roll, and Esports are the kings of strategy and playstyle.",

            "premise": "\"Yet track is still a sport. A similar situation occurs with other individualized sports such as swimming, golf, field events such as discus or shot put, etc.\" Track and the other activities are not sports. \"Also, tournament bowling often includes what is referred to as \u201cBaker games\u201d which require teams, not individuals (http://bowling.about.com......). New aspects come into play in this format, such as lineups, less frames bowled, and teamwork. Therefore, you can\u2019t receive a full experience of bowling by yourself.\" Changing the format of a game does not change the basic elements of that game. \"Also, there is a major difference between those \u201cbowling for fun\u201d and those who are bowling competitively. You claim that they are the same when you say \u201cIf, as you state, drinking beer while throwing the ball at the pins for fun does not constitute enough competition to qualify bowling as a sport; adding higher-skill level players and monetary rewards for winning doesn't change this. \u201c First, you don\u2019t require direct competition 100% of the time, as referred to in the previous argument. Next, there is such a big difference between the two such that they can be considered two separate activities.\" This debate is on whether bowling is a sport; not whether professional bowling is a different activity than recreational bowling.\"A sport is a sport if and only if it meets all the requirements: physical and mental skill, athleticism (training yourself physically and mentally to perform more capably and to improve your skill), competition, and strategy. All the other activities you mentioned are not sports because they do not meet all the requirements.\" In your first argument you had failed to mention a sport needed to meet all those requirements; you just listed attributes of bowling and said it was a sport. I wasn't trying to imply that any of those activities were sports. All your attributes referring to bowlers are irrelevant. I reiterate: A sport is able to be played by anyone who; knows the rules, has the equipment, access to the proper setting, and the requisite amount of participants. Skill doesn't come into play. Even at the highest level of any sport there are players of different skill levels. You wouldn't say that two professional baseball players are playing games of different \u2018degrees of sport\u2019 because they have different batting averages. An activity either is or isn\u2019t a sport. If recreational bowling was fundamentally different from professional bowling, they would have different names, not different qualifiers. We can see that the participants of an activity don't decide if it is a sport or not. It is only the elements of an activity that determine if it is a sport. Here, in turn, I must apologize to my opponent; I went back and reread my previous round, and I seem to have left off an aspect of a sport. A sport requires both offensive and defensive strategy, which is why all the activities you mention in your first paragraph aren't sports either. Football, baseball, soccer, cricket, hockey, tennis, lacrosse, and polo are all sports because they have athletes competing directly against each other with both offensive and defensive strategies. The participants of sports can physically affect their opponetnt's performances. Activities like golf, swimming, track and field events, and bowling are games of compared performances. \"I will use the common phrase, \u201cIf it looks like a duck and flies like a duck, it is a duck.\u201d Bowling has all the requirements to be considered a sport. Therefore, how can it be considered that it isn\u2019t a sport?\" I think the reason for your confusion about what bowling is can be illustrated by looking at your closing statement. The problem with that phrase is that, it is a 'common phrase'. The quote that that phrase is based on is: \"I can\u2019t prove you are a Communist. But when I see a bird that quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, has feathers and webbed feet and associates with ducks\u2014I\u2019m certainly going to assume that he IS a duck.\" -Emil Mazey, the secretary-treasurer of the United Automobile Workers for 33 years, said at a labor meeting in 1946 http://en.wikipedia.org... People take an actual quote, or meaning of a word, and simplify it, making it more general. It is a problem of discarding precision for ease. This results in common phrases and common definitions. They are close enough to get a general idea across, but lack the specificity of their actual meaning.I would like to, once again, thank my opponent for posting this debate.I will say, in closing, although many might assume bowling is a sport; if you take the time to look beyond the common concept, you will see bowling, while a fine game, is not a sport.",

It does not push the physical limits of the human body, and there is no frequent movement of each muscle in the human body. Also from one of the staff members blogs saying himself that it is not a sport. \"No, professional gaming is not a sport. While it's a viable form of competition and, according to some definitions of the word sport, it's easy to define pro gaming as such, the key to distinguishing viable forms of competition, such as competitive gaming and basketball, from sports is athletic activity. While poker, chess and gaming are viable professional, competitive activities they are dissimilar to sports such as basketball and tennis that require physical exertion. By adding this requirement we make the way we talk about things more clearly defined. The fact that gaming is not a \"traditional\" sport defines it as something else while not taking away at all from what is has in common with a sport.

            "conclusion": "Color guard is not a sport.",
            "premise": "The Dictionary.com definition of a sport goes as follows: competitive physical activity: an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill, governed by rules, and sometimes engaged in professionally. That is undeniable. But it is also undeniable that for an activity to be LEGALLY classified as a sport, the sport must meet the qualifications for Title IX, which has been supported over and over again, especially in the 2009 lawsuits. Title IX goes: \"...[For the activity to be a sport, it] must have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, a governing organization, a clearly defined scoring system, as well as a high degree of athleticism. The activity also must have competition as its primary goal -- not merely the support of other athletic teams...\" I feel when debating the legality of whether or not something is a sport, this should be the definition on which we argue, not a wishy-washy definition from Dictionary.com. Color guard is notorious to be those \"flag twirlers\" that play with the marching band during half time shows, much like cheerleaders. Just because an activity \"competes through districts\" and some parts of it are similar to a sport does NOT make the activity a sport. Until Title IX is repealed by the Supreme Court or an Appeals Circuit, color guard will not be accepted as a sport. Now I would like to go into my rather short rebuttals, owing to the fact that the Pro had a pathetic excuse for a constructive case. A. Competitive physical activity The opponent believes that because color guard has competitions and if they win, they get similar prestige to that of a Super Bowl winner, it defines guard as a sport. This is far from true-- I even daresay color guard is closer to a circus than to a football team. Color guard is more about simple flourishes and mildly difficult gymnastics that are coordinated and staggered to make a play or a show. I say this with personal experience, experience my opponent doesn't seem to have. Guard is not even COMPARABLE to the amount of skill and effort an average professional soccer player or a football player puts in. Let's not avoid the obvious; it's much easier to learn how to do a backflip and a quad than to make a goal in soccer (you'll be lucky to find a total of 4 goals in a soccer game) or a touchdown. I hope this proves my point. It's time for some extensions. 1. Counter to: \"It is not recognized by the Olympics\" As I have mentioned in my third argument, although the Olympics does not allow all sorts of sports to be played on the Olympics, they still recognize sports that are sports. For example, even though tug-of-war is clearly not something we see in the Olympics today, the International Olympics Committee did however give official recognition declaring \"tug-of-war\" a sport in 1920. The same holds true for American football, baseball, golf, etc., but not for color guard. 2. Counter to: \"Not all competitions need a definitive scoring system\" I'm going to go out on a limb here and be a kid-- I TRIPLE DOG DARE YOU TO FIND A SPORT WITHOUT A DEFINITIVE SCORING SYSTEM. A relationship between all sports is that definitive points are earned for certain actions, like scoring a goal, and that the points earned by each team is a relative indicator of skill over the other. If my opponent is unable to find a solid example of a sport without a definitive scoring system-- something color guard doesn't have (of course, when they're not too busy spinning rifles for the football team)-- my definition of a sport needing a scoring system holds true and steady. 3. Counter to: \"there is no clear interaction\" Yes, some may see how my definition is a tad biased. But as I have proven (above), my definition is solid, supported by evidence, and shows a clear relationship between all sports--to requote-- they MUST have coaches, practices, competitions during a defined season, a governing organization, a clearly defined scoring system, as well as a high degree of athleticism. The activity also must have competition as its primary goal -- not merely the support of other athletic teams. This is undoubtedly better that a ripped off definition from an online dictionary, which ironically is the closest thing the Proposition has to evidence. Overall, the CON side provided you with a logical definition of a \"sport\" backed by the Supreme Court, three clear arguments, a strong rebuttal to PRO's poorly scrambled constructive case, and three hard extensions to our arguments in counter to three casual rebuttals. Whether they like it or not, we are winning this debate. Thank you.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his response and will see what I can do against it. Pro has agreed that we are talking about the possibility of chess in the near future (within the next few Olympics). He has also agreed that any radical changes (such as boxing chess, might be fun) would cause a divide in the sport that would make it entirely different from the original, and so not popular enough to qualify it as an olympic sport. What the debate really comes down to, is if the current model of chess is 1) physical enough as is to be an olympic sport or 2) can be altered to be physical enough to be an olympic sport without becoming something entirely different (such as boxing chess) to where it loses too many followers to count. 1) Currently, chess (at the common level, not the Grandmaster level with all their rules for them) is no more physical then watching a movie (a few hours of sitting there). While that does take a certain level of stamina, it is certainly not an olympic level of stamina. On that point, one could argue that it does take some physical capabilities to play, it does not take enough physical capabilities to merit a spot in the olympics. 2) I, personally, cannot see any potential changes that could make chess much more physical, to an olympic level, that will not cause it to split from classical chess and form a new branch that does not have the large backing. \"I submit that due to its violence, MMA would not make it as an Olympic sport although it is arguably one of the most physical sports in the world. Also, golf does not make it but mainly because of the burden building an 18 hole course. Countries are having trouble accommodating more and more.\" We can see that many sports do not make it to the olympics even though they are very physical indeed, Nascar could be added to that list, or drag racing, even though the precision skill of driving is extremely difficult. But I would like us to remember golf in particular. Golf is another sport that technically meets all the points of the IOC's missions, yet it is not chosen, simply because of its economical and logistical issues. This shows, that by simply meeting the IOC's mission points, is not enough to merit any activity from getting into the olympics. It is completely up to the IOC and their preferences.",

Everyone knows a person who is into video games or you just might be into video games and it is very well to know if these games are worthwhile. Although something might be a sport, it doesn\"t mean it\"s productive. Video games could be a sport in a way. Many people say that video games aren\"t a sport for its lack of physical activity. There are many games that are considered to be a sport but have no physical activity in them; some of these sports include curling, chess, auto racing, golf, competitive eating, and poker. You would think that most of these sports include mental productivity but so do video games because many them challenge the gamer to make tough decisions, take risks, and work as a team. Games such as \"Star Craft\" can increase a player\"s brain flexibility (This was found out by British researchers Brian Glass, Todd Maddox, and Bradley Love). Although video games could be a sport they also could not be considered a sport. \"Sport\" is defined as \"an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature,\" by Dictionary.com. If you think about it most people play video games for entertainment and for doing nothing. Most people don\"t play virtual games thinking that they are going to become a professional gamer with mental skill in the game. Video games do have some productive games but are not used for productiveness and used as excuses to wasting time on a computer or console. In conclusion, I would say that video games are a sport. Even though they can be useless, they are a sport. Sports aren\"t always productive just like video games but it is a skill that is very challenging to earn. Video games can be very lazy, sluggish, and idle but it\"s still a skill that can be a competitive and worldwide.",

In order to succeed I must provide reasonable evidence that any sport in the world is better than track and field. Because \u201cbest\u201d is a very vague term I will provide evidence that there are sports that require more athleticism, more skill, are more popular, and are more difficult overall. Athleticism and Skill While it takes great athleticism to be a track and field player it is questionable whether it takes more than other sports. A variety of reliable websites have compiled lists of the greatest athletes of all time. Unfortunately the only two track and field athletes to make it into the top ten were Usain Bolt and a man named Rafer Johnson. They were each only on one of the lists once and neither placed better than sixth. (http://bleacherreport.com...) (http://bleacherreport.com...) (http://www.thetoptens.com...) Compare to\u2026 And according to ESPN the toughest sport in the world is boxing. (http://sports.espn.go.com...)-may have to copy and paste this link This shows that when comparing the best athletes of each sport Track and Field athletes just can\u2019t win. It is extremely difficult to compare training and practices as they vary when it comes to team and athlete. Basically track and field athletes spend years mastering one skill whether it is sprinting, hurdling, or discus. Other more popular sports all take years to master as well but they require the athlete to become familiar with hundreds of facets of each sport to truly be successful at it. Popularity In terms of viewers \u201cThe FIFA World Cup is the world's most widely viewed sporting event\u201d. (http://www.fifa.com...) \u201cSuper Bowl XLVIII was the largest television audience in American history\u201d (http://www.businessinsider.com...) My opponent is claiming that track and field is better than every other sport. Soccer football hockey basketball cricket rugby baseball softball volleyball tennis golf surfing biking martial arts wrestling MMA boxing horse riding fishing gymnastics skiing and literally hundreds more. Seriously. Look up list of sports on Wikipedia. Or use this link. (http://en.wikipedia.org...)-may have to copy and paste this link Several of these are better than track and field and many are equal to it, but that is irrelevant. All it takes is one sport being equal to track and field, or greater, and pro\u2019s contention that track and field is the best sport is false. Back to you pro.",

My opponent then claims that Battlefront is a casual game and therefore does not count as part of the video games that should count as sports. So just because golf seems like a casual sport, it isn't a sport? You cannot just kick out some games just because they do not fit the definition of what you're trying to say. That's like saying \"I don't like the A in Fur Elise so in not going to include it in the song.\" Suddenly because Battlefront is not a hardcore game it cannot be in the circle. Just because soccer is not a contact sport does not mean that it's not a sport. If you're going to try and make video games a sport you have to include all video games. My opponent then asks me a question. \"You imply that button mashing is all it takes to play video games, and I ask you, how many competitive matches of CS:GO have you played?\" Well isn't button mashing exactly what it takes to play a video game? Or do you not press the buttons on your mouse or controller? You probably see my logic now. Button mashing is all it takes to play a video game otherwise your game wouldn't work. Now I will pose a question to my opponent. How many games of competitive rugby have you played? If you have played rugby then you must realize that button mashing is a whole lot more easier than actual real rugby. In rugby you need to react fast or else you will be shoved into the dirt every time you get the ball. And by react, I mean actually reacting with your whole body. Not just by pulling a trigger that's been conveniently placed on your controller. If I pit you against a team of professional rugby players, you would be killed literally. (Unless your 6.5 tall and 350 pound, not in fat but in muscle) The skill that professional CSGO players have is quite laughable. Let see them do it in real life where they actually have to hold a gun, they actually have to hit a moving target, they actually have to reload their gun all the while trying not to get killed in real life. Now lets see the professional rugby players sitting down to a game of rugby on video games. They could easily learn how to play in under a minute. See the difference between real sports and video games. Like I said before video games bring the skill level of sports down. As a side note, try not to exaggerate something that you didn't actually do. It's not fair in debates like these. Then my opponent goes on to explain how CSGO has strategy. I laugh at that. Do you really study your opponent to know what move he'll make? Do you use three pronged attacks to take down an enemy unit? Do you set up ambushes that the enemy will walk into? War related video games take out the strategy in war. Do you really examine the game as being like a chess board? Do you make moves thinking five steps ahead? I thought that like my opponent said before that video games were suppose to be fun. My opponent explains why CSGO has strategy but the examples are very vague. Then my opponent says that snooker is a sport. To that I say, yes so what? Then my opponent claims that I am not looking deep enough into video games and that they are more than just mashing buttons. Then he goes off to explain all the features of CSGO. Yes I too could say that I go to lengths to get the perfect golf driver. I too could say that I've had them all tailored to my size. I have studied golf balls and aero dynamics and have perfected how many grooves a golf ball should have. I too could say that I study the golf course to know which way to hit the ball. I too could say that I study wind patterns everyday when I train to know how they effect my swing. I practice my swing everyday until it is perfected, etc. I know how deep I have to look. And I know that some video games are very amazing with such detailed story lines but FPS are not exactly deep. The truth is does my opponent now how deep to look in sports? It is not sports that are trying to qualify as sports, its video games. The problem with stereotypes is that for the majority, its true. Otherwise they wouldn't exist. Just like the stereotype, Asians are good at math. I understand that games can be challenging. I play them myself. What I don't understand is how pressing buttons can be considered skillful. A piano is technically pressing buttons but your using all your fingers and playing piano required musical knowledge and actual skill. The buttons on a controller are placed conveniently for the users hand and usually you aren't pressing ten buttons all at the same time over and over in different positions like you are in piano. Not are you pressing them as fast as you would on a piano. I appreciate gaming and all but I don't think that it should be considered a sport. The reason I have such disdain is because gaming is the lazy version of sports. Imagine your in a class with the same lazy person for your whole life. You work your butt off to stand out and do well while the lazy person does nothing. You both end up with the same job because suddenly the curriculum changed and now grades and doing well doesn't matter anymore. How would you feel towards that person? This is the exact same as I feel towards video games being a sport. There is nothing physical about sitting on a couch or chair pressing buttons while your eyes are glued to a screen. It's insulting to say that, that's the same as waking up early in the morning to go on a mile long run and then to practice your butt off until you feel dead with exhaustion to be a pro at your sport. Video games just cheat the whole system of a sport.",

            "premise": "Anyone who has put on boxing gloves to do a class, workout, or even to hit the heavy bag can attest to the difficulty and stamina it takes to box. The standard three-minute round sounds like a short duration, but many of the longest moments of my life have occurred during those three minutes while boxing. Even thirty seconds can be a deceiving. Try punching with all-out speed and power on a heavy bag for a thirty second sprint and you\"ll know what I am talking about. Add in the variable of someone punching you while you\"re trying to punch and you\"ll understand why boxing is the most difficult sport. toughest sport, hardest sport, why boxing is hard, boxing is toughest sport In its analysis, ESPN took ten different athletic categories and ranked each category with a scale of zero to a hundred in degree of difficulty. The categories included every imaginable facet of athleticism from speed and power to hand-eye coordination. The aforementioned golf scored a respectable and understandable 6.38 on analytic aptitude, but a paltry 1.63 in the speed category. The big three were all in the top ten of the toughest sports - football at third, basketball at fourth, and baseball at ninth. But boxing took the cake with high scores across the board. From power to durability, boxing is one tough sport according to the experts. However, it isn\"t just the typical athletic variables that make boxing hard. Yes, it takes incredible endurance and strength to box, but more than anything, it takes nerve. According to ESPN, this was boxing\"s most pronounced athletic category - nerve, or the ability to overcome fear. When it comes to nerve, boxing scored an 8.88 average, among the top four of all sports. Fear and the Ability to Face It There are a lot of tough sports out there. Golf seems so hard that I have wanted to break every club in my bag while on the course. I remember football practices back in the day that made me want to throw up. Wrestling is as rigorous as it gets in terms of its grueling conditioning. Still, the sheer mental and physical exhaustion in a boxing ring is indescribable, even at the amateur level. It\"s not just physical exhaustion, but also the mental concentration required in boxing. It\"s the willingness to confront not only your opponent, but also your own fear. That reason, fear, as ESPN indirectly pointed out, is the reason more than any other that boxing is the most difficult sport. Nothing drains you and creates exhaustion like fear. Fear occurs in many sports. Skiing and surfing can be dangerous, but the mountain and ocean are not trying to destroy you on purpose. In football, a knockout may be a byproduct, but it isn\"t the goal. In boxing, your opponent has one objective - to hurt you. This makes boxing intoxicating, brutal, and barbaric, as well as one damn tough sport. toughest sport, hardest sport, why boxing is hard, boxing is toughest sport Boxing ain't for the faint of heart. Having coached boxing, I can tell you that boxing is not for most people. The only way to box with any proficiency is to face this fear - the fear of getting hit, hurt, or worse. Still, facing fear is why I love the sport so much. It is a metaphor for life. We all take hits and learning how to take them and fight back is a lesson we encounter in life many, many times. The Hardest Skill to Master, in Sport and Life As for which sport produces the best athletes, the debate rages on. I still think the big three are hard to beat on overall athletic ability. But an elite-level athlete in one of those sports does not necessarily translate to an elite boxer. USA Boxing was so desperate for talent in preparation for the last Olympic games that they chose former college football quarterback Dominic Breazeale to represent Team USA in the super heavyweight division. The experiment failed as Breazeale lost in the first round of the Olympics. A great athlete doesn\"t necessarily make a great boxer and vice versa. Ultimately, boxing is an incredible display of many athletic variables. Really though, boxing is about that ability to measure nerve or fear. That is the hardest skill to master in both sport and life. To ride the wave effortlessly with the knowledge that wave could potentially kill you is the most mysterious and intriguing athletic variable in any sport. Boxing is full of this intrigue, mystery, and raw competition. Boxing is also dangerous and detrimental to your health. Despite its flaws, boxing is the pinnacle when it comes to the true test of difficulty in athletic skill. This is why fighters fight for one word more than any other - respect.",

            "premise": "I can see how my aforementioned statements can be taken as me saying boxing takes no mental skill, that is not my opinion. Yes the pressure of a crowd, does a lot to a athlete mentally, but as u said, it can equally be said that no crowd can create the same mental strain. Without a crowd, there is no way to distract yourself from the millions of things going on in your mind. My opponent stated,\"Mayweather just got knocked out, through his mental state of mind how is he gonna come back? Does he come back swinging harder?...\". If mayweather was knocked out he doesn't have to think anymore because the fight is over. This brings me to my point, in Golf there is no premature end. Yes u can replace the ball that you hit in the water, but you have to continue your round thinking about what had just gone wrong. However there is not just the crowd there to add mental stress there are also elements such as weather to take into account, unlike in boxing. In golf, you constantly are at the mercy of mother nature and she is very unpredictable. Dealing with 20mph right to left winds is definitely mentally taxing, especially if u are one stroke back at a major championship. Remember u are trying to get a small ball into a slightly larger hole, up to around 600 yards away, there is a lot that can go wrong in that stretch. So I respond to you saying i'm not educated in the sport of boxing, with have u ever played 18 holes, let alone 72 holes, i doubt it because you would understand the constant mental stress. So you my dear sir are not educated in the sport of golf",

            "premise": "It is a controversial topic that sparks feuds from both sides of the coin; are video games really sports? However, many fail to note a plethora of points and concepts that more than confirm the idea that video games sports. The definition of sports, although varying with different diction and colloquialism across many textbooks, is \"a game played either as recreation or competition.\" The argument is not semantics. Just as you can hunt game for sport, you can play video games as a sport. Whether it is physically taxing or not is irrelevant - as an example, the game of chess is widely accepted as a sport, but the game is a battle of not physical, but mental stamina. Those who play the game are indeed \"athletes\" - just not physical athletes - these video game athletes are playing sports. Video games have been gradually becoming accepted as sports, making appearances on sports channels and news worldwide. The professional scene in what is now being referred to as \"eSports\" is no joke - the prize pools for games such as Dota 2 or Halo 5: Guardians have been large, from a wallet-pleasing two million USD to a bank-crushing twenty million USD. These prizes compete with what many professional baseball or basketball players can make in a year; to say that these eSports cannot qualify as \"true sports\" is ludicrous. All around the world, there are many arguing for or against the idea that video games are sports. Only one side is correct. Due to the nature of video games, their current professional standings, and the definition of what a sport really is, it is factual that video games are a sport.

            "premise": "The first round is for acceptance by the opponent, as well as rules and explanation by myself. Explation: eSports, and by extention, e-Athletes, is a rising, yet popular, sub-culture in America, and all across the world that involves either a single player against another single player, or a team against another team in which the objective is to win the game through teamwork, much like sports like Tennis, Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Football, Golf, Volleyball, and many more.eSports has been on the rise as a popular activity, more recently than not, and, like other sports seen on TV, makes a decent amount of money for it's teams, organizations, and various other involved people. It fact, it's gained enough attention that some developers make their games with the express intent to be competitive. Examples of this include DoTA, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, (particularly Global Offensive), and other games that are hinted at eventually getting competitive game-modes, like Team Fortress 2.This debate will center primarially around the consideration of eSports as a legitimate type of sport. Below I will provide some basic defintions to give my opponent an idea of just what kind of debate we will be dealing with.Definitions:Sport is defined as \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\"Skill is defined as \"the ability to do something well; expertise.\"Entertainment is defined as \"the action of providing or being provided with amusement or enjoyment.\"Exertion is defined as \"physical or mental effort.\"eSports is defined (by the gaming community) as \"a term for organized multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players.\"As I am pro and I carry the burden of proof, I must show that eSports contains all of these defintions in reasonable manners, however, Con must be able to disprove these as well, and must also show that eSports can not have these definitions fulfilled.Rule:1. Round one is for acceptance only. Round two is for arguments. Round three is for rebuttals. Round four is for thanks, congratulations, and asking for votes.2. All definitions set here are final and may not be changed, however, defintions for relavant words that I may have missed are allowed.3. New rules must be agreed upon before the debate begins and cannot be made mid-debate. Message me personally for discussion on rules and we can work out a more fair rule-set if you disagree with what I have given.4. Failure to follow any of these rules will result in a forfeit. They are not hard to follow, in fact, most are common sense, please have some and no issues will be had.",

Oh, and the batter knows the ball is coming. If any of these events are SURPRISES...

The combination of these feats and the penalty involved renders them far more difficult to properly perform than to hit a fastball.

            "premise": "The Definition of SportAlright, in order for this debate to take place, we may very well wind up spending a large portion of our time arguing as to what the definition of a sport is. My opponent, no doubt, will insist that sports require physical exertion; However, I will argue that that is not true. There are a selection of things that have been dubbed \"intellectual sports\", such as chess and poker. Both of these have been broadcast to ESPN before, and many consider them, albeit by loose definition, to be \"sports\".sources:(https://www.chess.com...)(http://londonchessconference.com...)Further, even if you do not believe these to be sports, a large number of people claim that golf is a sport. While golf does involve walking from one place to another, and thus physical exertion, there is no direct correlation between the player's fitness or physical exertion and the actual gameplay. Further, even though swinging a club does require physical activity, the goal is not to swing as hard as you can. Most times, I would assume, the game requires one to swing lightly or with a medium stroke, not exerting one's stamina or muscle to the extent that many others are. Skill and Strategy in Games I hope that my opponent's stance doesn't include \"Games require no/minimal skill/strategy, and therefore cannot be considered sports\", which, fortunately, I have no reason to believe that he or she will. This, quite simply, is false; If you are playing games that require no skill, then you are simply playing games that require no skill, which has no bearing on the gaming industry as a whole. Games can require large amounts of strategy and even certain skill sets, such as twitch reflexes and hand maneuverability(such as what you see in the youtube videos of Esports champions playing StarCraft. It is insane).Innocent Until Proven Guilty, Feasable Until Proven IllogicalThis next segment will not be proving my point, but simply stating that the only thing I can really say for why Esports deserve to be sports or not is \"why shouldn't they be?\". Both of my previous statements were premeditated counterpoints to points that may or may not even show up. I believe that, under the context of this debate, you need to prove why games cannot be a sport moreso than I need to prove that they can. I cannot easily counter your points until you make them. In other words: your move, con.",

            "premise": "Hello again,This continues to be an interesting debate, and I am intriguided to see where this ends up. :)Objection #1 You raised the sports, shooting, curling, and golf as not applicable to the criteria I set forth in my argument. This I believe is incorrect, all three of these sports require physical skills and therefore fall under the label of athletic sports.Shooting: This sport requires proficiency with the given fire-arm that involves a tremendous amount of physical accuracy and speed.Curling: This sport also much like shooting requires a great deal of physical skill and control, even including a team aspect. Golf: Golf involves physical strength and accuracy not uncommon to the existence of other sports invovlved in the Olympics.Objection #2You claim that my statemen regarding the Olympics being a historically athletic competition to be false. Your support for this objection is the short history of Cycling, BMX or Mountain biking.This to me appears to be a misunderstanding of my argument, my contention is that the Modern Day Olympic Games are an adaptation of the Olympic Games of ancient Greece,[1] which involve a series of athletic sporting events. Modern sports can and should be added if approriate to the nature of the competition, this is not so for Video Games as it is demonstrably not a athletic sport.Objection #3 You assert that the existence of trolls in every sport should not discount the inclusion of Video games from the Olympics. This still fails to realize the vast difference in levels of professionalism and sportsmanship between Olympic athletes, and E-Sport superstars. The players themselves are largely not to blame, but the overall volatile communities that foster avenues for online bullying due to the fact it is completely anoymous.Objection #4 Clarified my argument to show your \"disproving\" my primary argument as invalid and a misrepresentation of my assertion.Objection #5 Video games simply have no place in the summer or winter olympics, the viewership for all the events can be just about universally appreciated by the global audience, and this attempt to draw a comparision I believe fails in that I can enjoy the skill one evidently has in diving, without participating in that sport myself. Video games are a much more specific fan base and most importantly are NOT athletic sports and therefore should have their separate venues for competition where the struggling players actually make money.All I have time for, for now.Kindest Regards,TrueScotsman",
