            "premise": "Electric cars can be expensive to own (the price of the batteries). They won\"t go far without stopping to re-charge the battery. Except in London, there is almost nowhere you can go to charge them up. Most of the electricity in this country is made by burning coal, gas or oil, so this means that electric cars end up being as pollutants as the fossil burning cars. The batteries used to power electric cars are very heavy. This slows the cars. Battery costs will vary but may be several thousand pounds and they have to be replaced every 5 years. The batteries use lithium and other rare metals. Disposing of batteries causes real environment problems. In an accident it may be difficult to get you out of the car because of the dangers of electrocution. Chemicals spilled from the battery may also be dangerous. The average electric car available in the UK will reach 50-55 mph. this is lower than even a small 1.1L car. A kilogramme of petrol contains enough energy to propel a car about 15 miles. A kilo of fully-charged lithium-ion battery will drive your electric car 500 yards. And you only get about 100 miles to a fully-charged battery at best, compared with 1,000-plus miles from the most economical diesels. This leads to \"range anxiety\", or the fear you will be stranded miles away from a socket. The energy intensive manufacturing of EVs means that some cars make almost double the impact on global warming as conventional cars. This is mostly because of the raw materials and energy needed to build the lithium-ion batteries. In the UK, during 2012, electricity generation from coal-fired power stations actually increased to almost 40% of total production, as the price of gas soared, and gas-fired electricity generation was reduced. Electricity from coal, which is the most polluting way to generate power, drastically reduces the environmental advantage for EVs. Because China, for example, generates almost all its power from coal, life cycle analysis of EV cars in China shows they are far more polluting than conventional cars. This means that depending on the electricity produced based on coal, the impact of an electric car can vary. If the production of burning coal based electricity is really high, it means that the impact of an electric car can be even higher than a fuel powered car.",

            "premise": "Unlike what my opponent argues, there are many alternatives to fossil fuel. fossil fuel is just a way to draw energy from the earth. some of these alternatives are Nuclear fusion geothermal energy wind and solar power Going back to my first alternative, nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is a very effective way for one to create a mass amount of energy. The united states is a very complex nation so we must find a new and better alternative for our source of energy. an example of this complex method of drawing energy is as I mentioned earlier, Nuclear Fusion. Nuclear Fusion is generated through a Nuclear Reactor which does not contribute to any environmental plaque such as global warming, acid rain and air pollution. With our as knowledge of the composition of atomic structures, it would take us less than five years to create a nuclear fusion. The creation of Nuclear fusion will reduce the depiction rate of the ozone layer which Fossil fuels increase. If we keep on using this much amount of fossil fuel, we will end up like the citizens of Australia who are fused to were covered cloths and a face cap to protect them from the UV light which increase the chances and rate of skin cancer. One Nuclear reactor could power up half the united states meaning that we only need to make about two or three. We could find that not only will an alternative such as Nuclear Fusion be great for the environment but it will also meet our energy needs. Secondly we have geothermal energy which is basically a way to draw energy from the earth core. Surveys taken by utilities have found that homeowners using geothermal heat pumps rate them highly when compared to conventional systems. Figures indicate that more than 95 percent of all geothermal heat pump owners would recommend a similar system to their friends and family. No fuel is used to generate the power, which in return, means the running costs for the plants are very low as there are no costs for purchasing, transporting, or cleaning up of fuels you may consider purchasing to generate the power. this shows that geothermal energy is so much more effective than that of fossil fuel. lastly solar and wind power. In truth, many fossil and renewable energy sources ultimately come from solar energy. For all intents and purposes, this article refers to solar power as energy that is directly collected from the sun. Advantages: \u2022Zero emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases \u2022Easy to install \u2022Virtually no energy costs once installed \u2022The technology for solar power is constantly improving \u2022Sunlight is widely available Wind Power This alternative energy resource makes use of wind turbines for the conversion of wind energy. Advantages: \u2022No emissions, hence no greenhouse gas contributions \u2022Though tall, wind turbines only require a small plot of land \u2022The cost per watt is among the lowest of current energy options \u2022Their ideal locations tend to be on farms and ranches, which is a benefit to rural economies we could find that all these alternative are both efficient and cost effective.",

            "premise": "Contradicting to what my opponent argues, many of these alternatives are been used by many countries in the world. An example of this is Brazil who last year or two started using ethanol products such as sugar cane to manufacture most of their fuel and tend to their needs. Brazil have progressed a lot and in fact, they are the most improved country in the world since the resent years. My opponent mentions that Nuclear fission cases cancer however he failed to mention the fact that Magnetic reactor which are already in use is able to contain and transform these waste into useful materials thereby making Nuclear fission a safer product than that of fossil fuel. Fusion is not a chain reaction, therefore it can be stopped at anytime and there is no threat of a meltdown opponent also states that nuclear fission is more expensive than fossil fuel power but an article from thinkquest.org/ states that nuclear fission is The fuels that could be used are relatively inexpensive and readily available fusion would be a virtually inexhaustible energy supply that could eliminate most of the world's dependence on other fuels. giving all these facts we must see that Nuclear fission energy is a wise and a very good alternative to Fossil Fuel. Geothermal Energy: I agree that geothermal energy sources are: volcanoes, hot springs, and geysers but geothermal energy can also be drawn from the earths core as I mentioned in my previous debate. an article from darvil.clara.net states that Geothermal energy has been used for thousands of years in some countries for cooking and heating and these countries have progressed energy wise. geothermal energy is also an energy efficient alternative and could serve as more than 85 percent of the earths power need. my next point leads me to solar power. The production of energy from the use of fossil and some renewable fuels can be noisy, yet solar energy produces electricity very quietly. One of the great pros of solar energy is the ability to harness electricity in remote locations that are not linked to a national grid. A prime example of this is in space, where satellites are powered by high efficiency solar cells. The installation of solar panels in remote locations is usually much more cost effective than laying the required high voltage wires. Solar energy can be very efficient in a large area of the globe, and new technologies allow for a more efficient energy production on overcast/dull days. Solar panels can be installed on top of many rooftops, which eliminates the problem of finding the required space for solar panel placement. Another great pro of solar energy is the cost. Although the initial investment of solar cells may be high, once installed, they provide a free source of electricity, which will pay off over the coming years. The use of solar energy to produce electricity allows the user to become less dependent on the worlds fossil fuel supplies. Wind power: unlike what my opponent said, wind power is a cost efficient way and does not require the wind to blow as more renewable energy is developed, the nation's electricity supply will balance renewable energy supplies with regional demands. Studies have shown that significant investment in offshore wind on the Atlantic Coast would virtually always be producing electricity \u2013 so if the wind stops blowing in Massachusetts, South Carolina's offshore resource may supply power to the Northeast. comparison with other anthropogenic activities, the climate impact of wind power is negligible. The continued burning of fossil fuels and unsustainable development inflicts the greatest harm on the earth's climate. If wind energy generated enough electricity to meet current electricity usage, this would amount to about 6% of all other wind disturbances, like reforestation efforts and tall buildings. This would have no significant impact on global wind patterns. Additionally, wind turbines could have a side benefit of decreasing temperatures at higher latitudes, offsetting the anticipated warming caused by greenhouse gases. we could see that fossil fuel is not the answer but better alternatives are. http://na.oceana.org...",

            "premise": "I thank whoever accepts this debate. As the pro side, I define nuclear power as power generated as a result of nuclear fission and fossil fuels as coal, natural gas, and oil. The job of my opponent is to provide a suitable alternative that is more viable than nuclear in substituting fossil fuels. My first argument is nuclear power's ease of location. A nuclear plant can be built anywhere on land (and possibly sea) which could provide power for more desolate places or places which have temperature extremes. While the sun may be shining for the day, there are many places where solar panels are not cost effective. Geothermal energy is self explanatory as it can only be done where there is sufficient warmth in the ground. Wind energy has to be put in rather desolate places that have seasonal temperatures as the cost of maintaining wind farms in a blizzard is tremendous. Hydro has to be near water and cannot be inland without rivers. Nuclear plants can be built anywhere and the energy can be generated at a rather low cost which will later tie into my second point. Nuclear power can be in all temperatures and can be provided to every place in the world. Even coal, oil and natural gas have to be reasonably to a mine or well or the transportation cost would be too high. As shown in the following website, the cost of uranium needed for nuclear does not really affect the price. Logically following, the location of the uranium that it uses does not have to close to the plant. http://www.world-nuclear.org... (chart is about 1/3 of the way down) I look forward to anyone accepting this debate and presenting an alternative that can replace fossil fuels and is more viable than nuclear, which I currently believe is easily the most viable.",

            "conclusion": "fossil fuel",
            "premise": "Since the topic is unclear, I'd like to interpret the topic to be: \"the world should stop using fossil fuel.\" My opponent is pro and I am con, so this topic interpretation makes sense. 1. No alternative We need gasoline for the foreseeable future. Most people who currently own cars in the world own a car that runs primarily on gasoline. Cars are expensive products and most people are not too keen on purchasing a new one right now, considering the global recession. Other options are not viable anyway. Ethanol Normal cars can run on a blend of ethanol/gasoline, but ethanol cannot comprise more than 15% of the concoction, or else it will corrode the engine parts. In addition, ethanol does not yield a net positive amount of energy because it takes gasoline to create the fertilizer used to grow the crop (usually corn) and to harvest it (picture tractors). \"UC Berkeley geoengineering professor Tad Patzek argued that up to six times more energy is used to make ethanol than the finished fuel actually contains.\" [1] So it essentially takes 6 gallons of gasoline to produce one gallon of ethanol. In addition, we don't have enough crops in the world to turn into ethanol. According to Energy Bullet, \"if the entire US corn crop were used for fuel, it would only replace 20 percent of US gasoline consumption.\" [2] Lastly, food to fuel increases world food prices and results in starvation. Environment News Service explains, \"The United States, in a misguided effort to reduce its oil insecurity by converting grain into fuel for cars, is generating global food insecurity on a scale never seen before. The world is facing the most severe food price inflation in history as grain and soybean prices climb to all-time highs. . . . The World Bank reports that for each 1 percent rise in food prices, caloric intake among the poor drops 0.5 percent. Millions of those living on the lower rungs of the global economic ladder, people who are barely hanging on, will lose their grip and begin to fall off.\" [3] Cellulosic ethanol is not yet commercially viable and may never be because the enzymes to break down cellulose are far too expensive to produce. Electric Since 80% of power that is generated in the United States is from fossil fuel (coal and natural gas), if we stop using fossil fuels, we won't be able to charge our cars. Electric cars are also much more expensive than normal cars and cannot travel very far on a single charge. Hydrogen fuel cell The fuel cells are ridiculously expensive. Prototypes running solely on fuel cells have not even been made. There are no refilling stations. Hydrogen is not energy-dense enough to be a viable transportation fuel because the fuel tank would be too heavy. Power 80% of U.S. power comes from coal and natural gas. Less than 1% comes from solar and wind. Around 20% comes from nuclear power. However, the nuclear plants in the U.S. are approaching the end of their life cycles, meaning we will rely more on fossil fuels in the future. Solar and wind are not yet viable to provide all our energy because they rely on intermittent energy sources (wind is not always blowing, sun is not always shining), and we do not have a reliable way to store the energy, meaning we need fossil fuels to act as a back-up for power generation if these intermittent sources are not available. The Energy Information Agency did projection forecasts on alternative energy development to 2030, based on current incentives/tax breaks and rates of investment, and found that in the best case scenario, renewable energy can provide 10% of the United State's energy needs by 2030. [4] If we stopped using fossil fuels now, the global economy would come to a standstill. 2. Clean fossil fuels Clean diesel cars have been manufactured that emit absolutely no particulates from their tailpipes, such as a model highly touted by Volkswagen. In addition, carbon capture and sequestration promises to create coal power plants that no longer emit any carbon dioxide. 3. World economy Fossil fuel jobs employ tens of millions of people worldwide in the oil exploration/drilling industry, the coal mining industry, and in electricity generation. These people would all lose their jobs. Oil/natural gas exporting countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia would have their economies devastated if they could not sell fossil fuels. A collapse of demand in many fossil fuel exporting-dependent countries would further exacerbate the global recession. Responding to my opponent's case: 1. Ozone layer holes Most of the holes in the ozone layer were caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), which international agreements have since banned. Science Daily reports that currently, one of the most promising new ways to decrease ozone depletion is newly discovered devices to detect rogue CFC emissions. [5] There are two ways that fossil fuels directly decrease ozone, but both ways only have a \"weak\" effect on ozone. [6] 2. Global warming Many countries are attempting to implement emissions reduction strategies, but these will likely be very expensive to consumers of energy and will have only a marginal impact on global warming. The International Panel on Climate Change, the United Nation's consortium of the smartest scientists on the global warming issue across the world, recently ranked the best solutions to global warming, and a number of geo-engineering projects (engineering projects that would cool the globe) were ranked higher than emissions reduction. Solutions include the one described in Super-Freakonomics, essentially simulating a volcanic burst in the troposphere, during which particles decrease sunlight penetration to the Earth's surface and decrease atmospheric temperature, and putting sunlight shields in outer space. No matter how costly these engineering solutions are, they will be cheaper and more effective than drastic emissions reduction programs, like cap and trade. In addition, some of the renewable energy solutions aren't much better for global warming. Stanford University published a study in 2007 on the ways that shifting to a hydrogen economy would increase global warming. [7] 3. Peak oil Many different experts disagree on the date when peak oil production will occur, but few experts still believe that it will be as soon as 2020, as my opponent suggests. In fact, the Energy Information Agency recently did projections until 2035 and found that due to technology improvements, peak oil will not occur between now and then. [8] One such improvement is EOR \u2013 enhanced oil recovery. Carbon dioxide (usually captured from a coal power plant using carbon capture and sequestration) is pumped into oil wells and makes the yields of oil from the well jump from 20-40% (under traditional techniques) to 40-60% by increasing the pressure inside the well-head and forcing more oil to come out. We need oil for the foreseeable future \u2013 alternatives are just not available yet on a large enough scale and are not yet affordable for the average person. [1] http://www.sfgate.com...

I define the United States to mean the public as a whole and not just the government. Alternative fuels are fuels that are other substances other than the conventional fossil fuels that can be made and used as fuels; renewable energy source. Fossil fuels can be defined as a non-renewable energy source that is formed by the decomposition of organic matter under a layer of sand and silt which produce the heat and pressure that change its chemical structure over a time period of millions of years. From these definitions, the primary inference is that the American people and government should use renewable energy sources more and non-renewable energy sources less. The presumption is that the United States uses fossil fuels more than alternative fuels such as fuels made from yellow grease, a used frying oil from deep fryers. The formation of fossil fuels was done within a process of millions of years as the plant and animal organic material was covered by layers of sand and silt and forced to decompose under such pressure and heat. Today we are using such natural resources faster than it can be reproduced. The real debate will start in round 2, once there is an understanding as to whether the opponent agrees or disagrees with the above definitions and presumption.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels.",
            "premise": "I will adopt my opponents format and address his points with the appropriate numerals: 1) \"As of 2004, the total world reserves were estimated to be 1.25 trillion barrels with a daily consumption of about 85 million barrels. With this we can make an estimation of when to experience the oil depletion, which it to be around the year 2057.\" I agree with my opponents assertion that fossil fuels are indeed finite in supply. Where I disagree with him however is in the amount he estimates the world to currently hold within its depths. Take for instance the recent discovery of the largest ever oil field found in the Gulf of Mexico by BP - a well containing 4 to 6 billion barrels of oil and natural gas (1). Indeed not only have huge oil deposits recently been discovered, there have also been vast numbers uncovered - 200 fields this year alone (1). With these recent discoveries, it would now appear that our estimations of world oil supplies are in need of serious revisions. For truly it seems scientifically dishonest to state that the world will run out of oil in 2057 when we have no idea how much oil the world actually holds. Therefore this point of contention you hold - that the supply of oil will run out sometime in the near future - is misleading in its assertions and rather invalid for the purposes of this debate. 2) \"We are too dependent on other nations for our energy sources, which could hurt us in the future.\" As noted earlier, the oil reserves in the United States more than adequately meet our own consumption requirements - roughly 21 billion barrels (2). We also must keep in mind that this figure is from 2007 - discounting the monumental recent findings addressed in 1 - and that it also discounts \"unproven\" oil reserves such as shale deposits and deep ocean wells. Therefore, your point that the U.S. doesn't have enough oil and has to import it is rather a moot point - we have the oil necessary to meet our own demand, we have simply chosen not to use it. 3) \"From an environmentalist's perspective, the obtaining, refining, and usage of fossil fuels are harmful to the environment.\" I find it curious that some environmentalists - for I consider myself an \"environmentalist\" too - always point to the \"unhealthy\" nature of drilling for oil, when in reality the damage it does pales in comparison to the damage done by \"alternative\" methods of energy production. Take for instance solar panels. If we were to produce these on a commercial scale we would need to mine extensively for silicon and phosphorus. One could easily argue that the environmental damage done by mining for these minerals greatly outweighs both the damage done by gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels and the established mining for ores necessary for coal production. Another common alternative energy source offered is hydrothermal dams. However the environmental impact of building a dam is inarguably worse than burning fossil fuels (3). Indeed the building of dams is the single greatest contributor of methane to the atmosphere, which traps heat 25x more effectively than CO2 - making dams less environmentally efficient than the burning of fossil fuels (3). Furthermore recent advances in fossil fuel technology have reduced that amount of C02 produced by modern coal plants by 40% (4). Therefore coal - despite all the connotations and taboos associated with it - is actually not a very \"dirty\" energy production method, negating your point. \"Oil spills have been known to damage natural ecosystems. It is much more damaging at sea since it can spread for hundreds of nautical miles killing sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms that it coats.\" This is problem with the shipping of oil, not its production. The problems of transporting oil have little to do with whether or not the United States should continue to use. Indeed, the prospects of transporting alternative energy sources - say nuclear waste - are much more environmentally dangerous than shipping oil. \"Fossil Fuels also contain radioactive material (uranium and thorium), which are released into the atmosphere. The burning of coal in 1982 released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident.\" This is the full quote from your source, since you decided not to show it: \"Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly uranium and thorium, which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 tonnes of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. However, this radioactivity from coal burning is minuscule at each source and has not shown to have any adverse effect on human physiology.\" Plagiarizing Wikipedia and deliberately editing quotes is not acceptable in a debate. Furthermore, your own sources are contradicting your arguments which is usually not a strategy employed by people interested in being taken seriously. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'd also like to take some space to offer forth a point my opponent neglected to address: cost. The average cost of alternative energies is much higher when compared with fossil fuels - in the case of wind its close to a 50% increase in cost per kilowatt per hour (5). This is due mainly to the fact that alternative energies are as of now unproven, contain inefficiencies of design, and have no infrastructure which can harness the energy they create. Furthermore I'd like to state that I fully support developing alternative energy sources, but I am steadfastly against the sort of panic-driven hysteria that my opponent has offered as a reason to adopt alternative energy sources in their entirety. Because the truth is the sources we have now are rather infeasible and forcibly adopting them would do much more harm than good - the technology simply isn't ready. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conclusion: My opponent offered relatively weak reasons for why the United States should change energy production sources. Furthermore I offered evidence that forcing an artificial movement towards alternative energy sources would be economically disastrous and infeasible as the technology is not ready for commercialization.

            "premise": "Cars are the biggest source of air pollution, all the exhaust emissions that come from these vehicles destroy the ozone layer. \"Fossil fuel combustion, particularly as it occurs in motor vehicles, has been identified as the LARGEST contributor to air pollution in the WORLD.\" http://www.epa.vic.gov.au.... These cars run on oil and this has been a huge problem for the environment, not coal. There are two types of pollutions that come from them, exhaustive emissions and evaporative emissions. Exhaustive emissions come from the tailpipe of the cars while evaporative emissions is any fuel vapor that isn't burnt and is released into the atmosphere. There are approximately 1 billion cars in the world, if there's 1 billion cars emitting hazardous gases, that's the main cause of air pollution. http://www.huffingtonpost.ca... Clean coal energy is a very realistic possibility for society. Ohio State University worked with only 5 million dollars to develop this technique. http://www.foxnews.com..., There is no way to transition from coal to any other energy source if it provides for almost half our energy production. It is just too much of a leap for society and the country to take. Despite all the talks about alternative energy sources, solar and wind energy only make up 4% of our energy source. That alone costs tax payers and funders millions of dollars. There is no economic benefit either by replacing coal with another source of energy. If coal continues to save the country a large amount of money, why should we throw that away to experiment with other alternatives that are costly and aren't nearly as effective. For example, \"That means that from a pure economic standpoint, the upside of replacing coal with natural gas is zero, while that of replacing oil with natural gas is $12.7 per mmbtu\" We lose by switching from coal to an alternative energy source, instead of replacing oil (in cars). Conclusion: We shouldn't ban the use of coal in energy production. Read more: http://www.politico.com...",

            "conclusion": "fossil fuel",
            "premise": "I'd like to remind everyone of the resolution my opponent has agreed to, considering his silence on the issue and the fact that it seems to be what he is arguing: \"The world should stop using fossil fuels.\" He is pro; I am con. Brazil's sugar ethanol: While Brazil does use a great deal of sugar ethanol, they only export 14% of their sugar ethanol because they use most of it domestically. They do not produce enough sugar ethanol for the entire world. Jack Chang of the Knight Ridder explains, \"Brazilian ethanol producers are struggling to keep up with domestic demand for ethanol, which is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next five years . . . suppliers are struggling to plant enough fields of new sugar cane, from which ethanol is produced here, to keep up with the anticipated growth in demand. Some energy experts say this has revealed the limits of Brazil's ethanol program and that it is an unreliable energy source, one that can't be depended on to make much of a dent in worldwide use of fossil fuels.\" [1] In addition, it still takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of sugar ethanol. [2] For that reason, \"A study by Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen found ethanol produced from corn, and sugarcane had a \u2018net climate warming' effect when compared to oil.\" [3] Lastly, stepped up Brazilian sugar production will increase deforestation. The Huffington Post reports that \"Brazil is already the world leader in annual deforestation, even without a huge leap in biofuel production.\" [4] Increased Brazilian sugar ethanol production would increase deforestation because \"the Amazon forest is attractive to sugar farmers because its warm climate produces two growing cycles per year, double the single harvest found in cooler, southern states.\" [5] Brazil's sugar ethanol is great for Brazil, but it cannot supply the world. Nuclear: My opponent keeps confusing the terms fission and fusion. Yes, fusion would be a nearly inexhaustible energy supply (it could theoretically turn water into energy), but fission is not. If the whole world used nuclear fission power, uranium would run out relatively quickly. I don't know what \"magnetic reactor\" my opponent is referring to (I've heard of a fusion magnetic reactor but not a fission one), but this doesn't answer my argument that routine normal operation of nuclear power plants causes cancer, based on numerous studies in the U.S. and Germany. It also does not answer that nuclear is much more expensive than natural gas/coal, that the world cannot build enough reactors because of the bottleneck of the Japan Steel plant that can produce only 5 containment vessels per year, that there is nowhere good to store the spent fuel (the U.S. does not allow reprocessing), and that creating a global uranium/plutonium trade makes these substances much easier to obtain by a terrorist organization. Geothermal: When my opponent's sources say \"geothermal energy may be drawn from the Earth's core,\" those sources mean that the temperature from the Earth's core is what causes volcanoes, hot springs, and geysers and in turn these sources may be tapped for geothermal power. There are three types of geothermal power plants (dry steam, flash, and binary) and all three require \"suitable sites,\" i.e. hot springs. [6] The largest geothermal plant in the world uses The Geysers in California. Geothermal power does not mean that we drill into the Earth's core and tap its energy. Note: I googled my opponent's claim that geothermal could provide 85% of the world's energy needs, but failed to find any source saying as much. Ignore this statistic because there is no citation for it. It cannot possibly be true. Solar: Solar panels on roofs are not the solution to the world's power needs. The North County Times reports that \"solar generation is at its most efficient from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. . . . when most homeowners are at work, not using their home's solar power.\" [7] And since solar cannot store energy, it is not yet a viable fossil fuel replacement. We still need power at night. Wind: My opponent claims \"wind power . . . does not require the wind to blow.\" I'd like a citation for this. I don't really understand what he means. Wind power only generates electricity when the wind blows and turns the wind turbines. My opponent may be correct that offshore wind farms are more effective than on-shore farms, but offshore farms must be built in specific locations (offshore) and cannot power entire countries. People still need power on non-windy days. At the end of the day, my opponent has no response to the Energy Information Agency evidence that at most, the U.S. could generate 10% of its power from renewable sources by 2035. Alternative energy simply cannot replace fossil fuels completely any time in the near future. In addition, my opponent has no response to the tens of millions of jobs that are generated by fossil fuel and related industry, and the fact that many economies rely on exporting fossil fuels and that if the world stopped using fossil fuels, these economies would collapse. A collapse in many regional economies (such as Russia, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia) would cause a dramatic downturn in global aggregate demand, further sinking the global economy into recession. Therefore, you should negate the resolution that \"the world should stop using fossil fuels.\" Since the world is still so dependent on fossil fuels for its energy needs, a cessation of fossil fuel use would immediately bring the entire world and its economy to a grinding halt.

Are you arguing on moral grounds (i.e. the public as a whole) that we should change, or upon policy grounds (i.e. the government)? 2) \"Alternative fuels are fuels that are other substances other than the conventional fossil fuels that can be made and used as fuels; renewable energy source. Fossil fuels can be defined as a non-renewable energy source that is formed by the decomposition of organic matter under a layer of sand and silt which produce the heat and pressure that change its chemical structure over a time period of millions of years.\" I agree with these definitions more or less, except for the part about it taking millions of years to produce coal (1). Furthermore according to your own definition, artificial coal could be considered an alternative fuel when compared with natural coal (1). \"From these definitions, the primary inference is that the American people and government should use renewable energy sources more and non-renewable energy sources less.\" This is less an inference and more your opinion, which I believe belongs in Round 2. --------------------------------------------------------------- I look forward to your attempt at proving the United States \"should\" progress away from the use of fossil fuels, though from your Round 1 arguments it would appear that you have your work cut out for you in terms of providing the necessary evidence.

We will combine the question asking in the comments and the answers and closing statements can be in round 3. Sorry for that. Intro: We all know about water wheels, solar panels, wind farms, etc . . Let's talk about fossil fuels and alternate energy. 1: Why fossil fuel is bad for the atmosphere. Tons of CO2 is burned every year. CO2now.org says, \"he 2014 average annual concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (Mauna Loa Observatory) is 398.55 parts per million (ppm). The 2013 average is 396.48 ppm. For the past decade (2005-2014) the average annual increase is 2.1 ppm per year.\" 2: What are our alternatives. These alternative energies do us no harm. In fact outside Evanston, Wy we have tons of wind farms and it generates over 1/4 of our energy. 3: How these will help us. BBC news says, \"Ozone layer 'shows signs of recovery', say scientists. The Earth's protective ozone layer is starting to repair itself, according to a panel of United Nations scientists. The main reason behind its recovery, they say, is the fact that certain chemicals, such as those used in aerosol cans, were phased out in the 1980s.Sep 10, 2014\" This will help us by slowing emissions into the air and letting the ozone layer heal itself.

            "premise": "Fossil fuels are not just dangerous because of the co2 released into the atmosphere causing climate change. When fossil fuels like gas and oil are spilled, destruction follows. Thousands of animals have been tortured and killed from an oil spill or leakage in their environment. This usually happens in oceans, but can also happen on land. Fossil fuels also release toxic chemicals that cause lung disease to humans. When these fine particle emissions are inhaled, they can enter the blood stream and can cause diseases or problems almost anywhere in the body. If Renewable sources of energy are utilized, there is no chance of harm to the environment or people. Exploring new renewable energy resources will not only benefit our environment and communities, but will also benefit generations to come because of new innovative ways of the mass production of energy. Our current rate of fossil fuel usage will eventually lead to an energy crisis. To overcome this crisis, renewable energy research and production will grow in awareness and the government will rely on this innovative new source to power our country and eventually our entire world. 1) http://www.ehow.com... 2) http://www.alternativeenergysecret.com... 3) http://www.alternative-energy-news.info...",

The construction cost for more renewable energy machines and resources costs millions, but still not close to the construction and operating cost of Non renewable energy resources like fossil fuels. Jobs will be created from supporting renewable energy operations, and this will benefit the economy substancially.

            "conclusion": "Establishing a $15 per ton carbon tax that increases by 3.5% each year until capped at $80 per ton",
            "premise": "Let's talk about your first point, that carbon emissions will depend on several factors, and new cost-effective technologies may cut our carbon emissions. However, I am confused on why you are asserting this, as it is a point that favors my argument. If companies are already creating cost-effective innovations and switching to renewable energies, such as wind or photovoltaic, then why is there the need for a carbon tax? As time goes on, the United States will emit a smaller and smaller share of the world\"s total greenhouse gas emissions, which makes unilateral efforts\" such as a domestic carbon tax\"an ineffective way to influence climate. If the United States were to completely cease using fossil fuels, the increase from the rest of the world would replace U.S. emissions in less than eight years. If we reduced the carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector to zero, the rest of the world would replace those emissions in less than two years. Increases in worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are driven by developing economies, not the United States. In fact, a carbon tax would lead to lower energy use and lower economic output because low-carbon replacement technologies simply do not exist. Carbon taxes effectively increase the cost of fossil fuels in an effort to make non-fossil fuels more economically attractive. But contrary to what my opponent stated, the technologies to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are decades away and extremely costly. Instead, the only real way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short run is to reduce energy use and economic output. Consider automobile use and gas prices. People have begun to transition toward fuel-efficient cars, but the real impact of high gasoline prices in 2008 was to reduce vehicle miles traveled. Just as higher fuel prices led to less driving, higher energy prices will lead to reduced energy consumption. That will lead to a corresponding drop in our ability to make economic choices. My opponent also chose to ignore the plethora of repercussions that establishing a carbon tax would generate. While he is correct when he says that it will force U.S. companies to find new ways to utilize energy, what he completely disregarded is that a carbon tax disproportionately targets the low-income in our communities. This is because low-income communities rely on cheap fossil fuels, to heat their homes, power their cars, and live their lives. But when we establish a carbon tax, what we do is we pass that on to the consumers, and that directly increases the amount of money that low-income families have to spend on energy. According to U.C. S. B. Malin Milinger, \"reforms to discourage climate pollution hurt low-income Americans.\" And that is exactly what we saw in Ireland when it passed a carbon tax. In fact, gas and heating bills went up 5 to 10 percent, and it directly affected the poor in Ireland. According to a study done by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, households in the lowest income group pay as a percent of income more than twice what households in the 10% distribution pay. Hence, these low-income families who are already struggling to pay for cheap energy will be hit the hardest and left in the dust from a carbon tax. However, there is an alternative, and that alternative is dividends, where the money is recycled back into the government. But that is something that is not addressed in this tax. Second, I would like to explain again why outsourcing hurts the U.S. Now, you argued in your second rebuttal that if a large company were to remain in a country without a carbon tax, it would greatly benefit the consumers in these countries. But you fail to recognize that while this consumer in another country is reaping cheaper goods and services, our economy, as well as millions of jobs, would suffer and be lost. This is true because when fossil fuel companies have to pay higher taxes, they end up letting go many workers. While the clean energy industry creates many jobs, this is offset by the amount of unemployment that would be created during the transition to renewable energy sources. Stanford professor Mark Jacobson wrote a recent study that found of the 2.5 million jobs added by using 100% renewables, 3.9 million were lost. Clearly, while a new workforce would emerge, it would greatly impact current jobs in the United States. The business that can move to renewable energy will move to renewable energy, like you said, but will take years to build up to levels where they can hire thousands of people for new positions. Additionally, the economy would plummet due to the loss of jobs and the decreased competitiveness of America's global exports. Because a carbon tax leads to increases in prices for energy goods and services, it reduces demand, thus stultifying the economy. You requested some type of statistic to display how the economy would be affected, but a statistic is not necessary here when knowing that a carbon tax would reduce American jobs and decrease global competitiveness because that is going to smash our economy.",

            "conclusion": "Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)",
            "premise": "Since my last alternative energy debate was so interesting, I thought I'd keep it up by starting another one, with more specific wording to avoid the meta-debates that occurred in my last debate. This topic is: \"The United States federal government should increase funding for the Department of Energy's Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) to give grants for micropower.\" 1. My first argument is that the status quo is unacceptable: a. According to the Department of Energy, the current electricity generation and distribution model in the United States is based on a centralized grid. b. There are (at least) five problems with the centralized grid model: i. Sabotage: According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the because much of the grid is unprotected, our energy infrastructure is one of the most vulnerable targets to terrorists. A terrorist strike would cause nationwide blackouts. ii. Global Warming: The centralized grid promotes fossil fuel based energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Fossil fuels have caused global warming, which threaten to destroy the planet. iii. Economic Competitiveness: The ITP program is vital to nine key energy intensive industries, supply 90% of the materials to the U.S., produce $1 trillion in revenue, directly employ 3 million people, and indirectly employ 12 million people. iv. Spillover: Micropower can be used to aid developing countries. According to Seth Dunn, an energy specialist at the WorldWatch Institute, providing micropower to North Korea can reduce the chance of nuclear proliferation. v. Oil dependence: Currently, the U.S. imports more than 60% of the oil it consumes. According to Dr. Martin Feldstein, our dependence on oil is a security threat. Iran has declared that any hostile actions taken by the United States would cause them to destroy the Straits of Hormuz, cutting off 20% of the U.S. oil supply. c. Current subsidies for non-alternative forms of energy prevent micropower from becoming mainstream. According to Bioenergy Update, the $120 billion in subsidies for fossil fuels prevents a shift away from the centralized system. 2. My second argument is that the ITP/micropower program can solve these problems: a. First, micropower is a system of distributed generation of electricity, using solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, and other forms of renewable energy. Essentially, a business would generate its own electricity on-site, based on the most appropriate renewable source, thus bypassing the need for a centralized electric grid based on fossil fuels. Although it has become more popular in recent years, there are still barriers to widespread adoption. b. The ITP program currently gives out $175 million in grants for micropower projects. However, this amount is tiny compared to the $120 billion in annual subsidies for fossil fuels. c. Micropower can solve the five harms I outlined above: i. Sabotage: A decentralized grid means that there would be no place for the terrorists to strike if they wanted to disable the electricity supply. Since each business would generate their own electricity, there would be no supply to interrupt. ii. Global Warming: According to Bioenergy Update, if the U.S. switched to a micropower based system, we could cut carbon emissions by 50%, much more than our current targets. iii. Economic Competitiveness: The ITP program funds projects in nine key industries, several of which are struggling for global competitiveness. If they were able to access low cost renewable energy, they could better compete with their foreign rivals. iv. Spillover: As stated above, micropower gives countries an opportunity to work together and increase international cooperation. According to Mr. Dunn, this lessens the risk of North Korea becoming belligerent. v. Oil Dependence: According to NPR, developing alternative fuels has the ability to shift us away from oil dependence to a form of domestically generated renewable energy. d. The ITP program actually works. According to the Department of Energy, more than 140 new technologies have been created by ITP-private firm cooperation. e. The plan can be accomplished without adding to the deficit if fossil fuel subsidies were ended. With the $140 billion in money that goes to oil and coal companies, the ITP program can develop and spread micropower technology to businesses, which can then spread it to consumer use, all without adding a dime to our budget deficit. Hopefully, someone will pick up the gauntlet for this debate, and it will be an interesting discussion!",

            "conclusion": "The United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels.",
            "premise": "1) First we debated about the finite supply of fossil fuels. You argued that there were recent discoveries of new oil fields. One example being the Gulf of Mexico which contains from 4-6 bil. barrels of oil and natural gas. You continue to argue that due to such discoveries the estimation of world oil supplies need to be revised leading to the inability to make statistical hypothesis of when we expect the world to \"run out of oil\". I did not argue that the world would run out of oil at the year 2057. I argued that there would be an oil depletion at the year 2057 based off of the Hubbert Peak Theory. Imagine a bell curved graph of year (x-axis) vs production (y-axis), to the right side of the peak there will be an exponential decline in production. It is true that we have no true idea of how much crude oil the world holds, but it is very important to at least attempt a statistical estimation of known oil reserves to compare with daily consumption. I can use this statistic with daily production specifically for one reserve vs its estimated oil supply to calculate how longevity of oil site, which could reflect on the company's decisions for on funding for the discovery of new oil sites. One of your sources mentioned that \"since the early 1980s, discoveries have failed to keep up with the global rate of oil consumption, which last year [2008] reached 31 billion barrels of oil. Instead, companies have managed to expand production by finding new ways of getting more oil out of existing fields, or producing oil through unconventional sources\" Recently we have made a large number of discoveries but we will at one point reach our production peak (Hubbert) in which we will no longer be able to produce as much as demanded. 2) The second reasoning stated that we are too dependent on other nations for our energy sources, which could hurt us in the end. I used the example of the 1973 oil crisis. You noted that \"we [currently] have the oil to necessary to meet our own demands\" and that we just choose not to use it. With enough oil reserves to meet our demands, we would still be dependent on other nations through the refining process. The US does not refine enough crude oil to meet our daily needs and therefore we send it mainly to Canada to be refined and imported back to us. It is cheaper to send to Canada then to ship it 1500 miles to the next US refinery. As for the claim that we have enough oil reserves to meet our own demands, we do we not currently use them? Are we talking about emergency reserves and reserves found on land that we currently are not allowed to drill? If we are once again cut off from a source of fuel like we were in the 1973 oil crisis, the preparation and drilling of these reserves would take a lot of time and money. Assuming the reserves were not set up for the commercial pumping of oil. As time goes by, the demand would increase and would witness the affects of a lower oil supply on the economy. 3) Within this third reasoning, I stated that the obtaining, refining, and usage of fossil fuels are harmful to the environment. The opponent states that alternative method does more damage to the environment. One example was the solar panels and that \"we would need to mine extensively for silicon and phosphorus\". There is a problem with this statement because silicon is not mined, but manufactured from silica, wood, charcoal, and coal. Silica on the other hand one of the most abundant mineral found on the Earth's crust. It is commonly found as sand or quartz. Coal on the other hand is mined, but is a fossil fuel. We earlier defined; \"Alternative fuels are fuels that are other substances other than the conventional fossil fuels\". Coal which is an ingredient of silicone used to make solar panels is a conventional fossil fuel and therefore this example does not apply. Solar panels contribute to the mining of coal. Your second example was hydrothermal dams. The source you received this information on was mainly talking about China and how they are irrationally, planned poorly and in need of more safeguards for affected people. Their goal for building so many dams is not to combat climate change or the fostering of development, but as a bargaining tool to have access to natural resources such as metals, fossil fuels, and farmland in exchange (Scudder). \"Building of the dams is the single greatest contributor of methane to the atmosphere, which traps heat 25x more effectively than CO2\". The direct quote from your source is \"Dam building creates other significant impacts as well. Drowned trees and vegetation burp methane \u2014 which traps heat at 25-times the rate of CO2 \u2014 out of the reservoirs, particularly in tropical regions like Brazil. In fact, scientists at Brazil's National Institute for Space Research calculate that the world's large dams are responsible for producing 104 million metric tons of methane a year \u2014 making dams the single largest source of human-caused methane.\" Failing to mention that the methane was due to drowned trees and vegetation. Though it is impossible to remove all vegetation within the dam's path, this methane by product can be decreased by better planning of the water flow path and clearing of flood areas. Also this describes \"particularly in topical regions like Brazil\". This debate specifically argues for the United States which is a different type of region. Before a hydroelectric dam can be constructed a study of the area is required to be studied and have federal and state licenses. These studies include site studies, hydrological studies and environmental impact assessment with required hydrological data of up to at least 50 years. Though there are some disadvantages there are also some advantages of hydroelectricity such as that it produces no waste, has a considerably lower output level of CO2 and eliminates the cost of fuel. The cost of operation is almost unaffected by the increase cost of fossil fuels, require no imports and usually have a low labor cost. Hydroelectric plants also have longer life spans than fuel-fired generation, currently have some built 100 years ago and still in service. 4) Last of all was cost. \"The average cost of alternative energies is much higher when compared with fossil fuels\", this is a fallacy of division. What is true of the whole is not true of its parts. For example, bio diesel is a cheap alternative fuel and we have efficient technology to use it. Diesel powered cars tend to have a better fuel economy by 20-40% and produce less greenhouse gases. Bio diesel-powered diesel engines offer substantially improved emission reductions compared to petro-diesel or gasoline. Bio diesel average $0.28 per gallon with the assumption that the used oil was free. This figure was calculated using today's chemical prices and a bio diesel experiment provided by NC State University. Conclusion my opponent states that I offer evidence that is forcing an artificial movement towards alternative energy sources. United States was defined as \"both moral and government policy grounds\" with no further opposition. I argued for both grounds, meaning that there should be a behavioral change from the public and government policy change. Would it still be considered forcing if the public wants it? The presumption states \"that the United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels\". This does not mean that we should create sides and drastically change from the fossil fuel side to the alternative side. The key word \"toward\" could also mean a shift in a particular direction over time. If I was to find definitions they would be with a view to obtaining or having, In the area or vicinity of. Yes, we do have a form of time limit due to our finite supply of fossil fuels, but we do have the ability to use our time now to make efficient ways to use alternative fuels so that when we do need to change we can do so without disaster.",

[[http://www.ieer.org/ensec/no-1/glbnrg.html]] Nuclear power plants are far more gross-land efficient than both fossil-fuel plants and hydro-electric plants and have much potential to expand throughout the world. Moreover, experts predict that nuclear energy will be a sustainable source for 30,000-60,000 years. It is also expected that energy security will be considerably reliable considering the widely available 16million metric tons of uranium. [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last]] While being the only feasible large-scale alternative to fossil-fuels, nuclear energy is also an excellent method in curbing carbon emissions.

Carbon emissions are inevitable and will happen regardless of our contributions at the same speed. Renewable energies produce carbon emissions as well. in fact, a single running wind turbine can create more c02 emissions than that of the most efficient gas turbines.

These resources are being constantly depleted.``(www. renewable- energysources.com) Without oil, we can not drive and produce electricity. Using fossile energies has contributed to building mass-produced and mass-consumption Affluent Society since the end of the War for many countries of the world. These days newly emerging countries like China and India are catching up with the U.S. and Japan in the GDP(gross domestic product) based on the economic model of highly developed countries. Both countries are using fossile energies too much. On the other hand economy and industry which are dependent on fossile energies have produced global warming. And as I mentioned earlier, natural resources are decreasing every year. Shortage of those resources and global warming are threatening human survival and are contributing to making an impasse for attaining stable economic development. To coping with these serious problems facing us today many governments, local cities and communities are tackling with developing of new alternative energy sources. However, unfortunately there are number of hurdles to promote the project. What kinds of difficult factors lie ahead for developing of new energy sources like solar, wind and nuclear power?

            "discussionTitle": "fossil fuel",
            "conclusion": "fossil fuel",
            "premise": "Responding to my opponent: I know that alternatives to fossil fuel exist \u2013 the fact that I named most of them in the previous round proves I know of their existence. The problem is that none of them are yet viable as a complete fossil fuel replacement in electricity generation or in car locomotion because they are either too expensive, are not capable of being produced on a large enough scale, or are not a reliable/consistent enough form of power. Nuclear power I think my opponent means nuclear fission. Fission is a reaction that breaks apart an atom (usually Uranium-235) to generate energy. Fusion is the process the sun uses of fusing together protons to generate energy. Scientists have yet to produce a commercially viable fusion power plant, and many people still consider fusion power a pipe dream. Nuclear power, in contrast, is not a good fossil fuel replacement. The Huffington Post reports that nuclear power plants, even when operated correctly, cause cancer. \"Every day, reactors must routinely release a portion of radioactive chemicals into local air and water -- the same chemicals found in atomic bomb tests. They enter human bodies through breathing and the food chain. . . . after half a century of a large-scale experiment with nuclear power, the verdict is in: nuclear reactors cause cancer.\" [1] The Huffington post cites a number of studies proving the link between nuclear power and cancer: \"Joseph Mangano, MPH, MBA, Executive Director of the Radiation and Public Health Project, has authored 23 scientific articles since the mid-1990s documenting high local cancer rates near [nuclear power plants]. One study showed child cancer exceeded the national rate near 14 of 14 plants in the eastern U.S. Another showed that when U.S. nuclear plants closed, local infant deaths and child cancer cases plunged immediately after shutdown . . . A November 2007 article on U.S. child leukemia deaths updated the 1990 National Cancer Institute study and showed local rates rose as nuclear plants aged -- except near plants that shut down.\" [2] Studies in Germany have also proved the link between nuclear power plants and cancer. [3] The fear of cancer sparks a \"not-in-my-backyard\" (NIMBY) attitude towards nuclear power plants, whereby locals and politicians protest the location of nuclear power plants near their homes, thereby making it impossible to build nuclear power plants anywhere. If countries all decided to pursue nuclear power, it would take well over a hundred years to build all the power plants. There is only one steel plant in the world, Japan Steel, that has a forge big enough to make the containment vessel for nuclear power plants. They are only capable of forging 5 such containment vessels per year. [4] The Star continues that the waiting list is filled up until at least 2018, even though demand for nuclear power is relatively low right now. Building enough nuclear power plants is infeasible. Other arguments against nuclear include: it is more expensive than fossil fuel power. The Post-Gazette reports that \"A gas-fired plant can be built for $350 per kilowatt (kW) . . . A nuclear plant costs $3,000 to $4,000 per kw to build.\" [5] Nuclear power reliance worldwide would create a spent fuel storage problem \u2013 where does all the radioactive waste go? Nevada has been unwilling to allow the U.S. to store the waste at the Yucca Mountain site. In addition, nuclear is non-renewable: uranium sources will run out. And lastly, a global trade in uranium/plutonium makes it easier for a terrorist to get their hands on one of these substances. Nuclear power as a replacement source is negated. Geothermal: The Energy Information Agency explains that geothermal energy sources are: volcanoes, hot springs, and geysers, most of which are located on the west coast of the Americas and the east coast of Asia. [6] These energy sources are not widely available, which is why geothermal has the potential to provide far less than 1% of the world's power. Geothermal as a fossil fuel replacement is negated. Solar/wind: My opponent does not answer my analysis that these are intermittent power sources with no way to store their energy. When the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, we must get our power from coal or natural gas. Studies show that wind power in particular does not replace fossil fuel power because electric utility companies are forced to keep natural gas power plants readily available in case the wind is not blowing and since power plants cannot be easily turned on and off, the natural gas plants are constantly on. In addition, my opponent does not answer the evidence from the Energy Information Agency that in the best case scenario, the United States could only generate 10% of its power from renewable sources by 2035. In addition, wind and solar plants are very expensive because they need to built in specific locations (where wind blows or where cloud cover is rare) and necessitate new power grids to be built. Power grids typically cost $3 million per mile to build. In addition, the further the power plants are located away from the houses that need them, the more energy that will be lost due to \"line loss.\" The friction caused by electrons moving through the wires causes lost electricity due to heat. This is another of the many challenges facing solar/wind. Wind has further challenges. The annoying noise from the rotor blades and the blinking lights to warn airplanes/helicopters of their presence decrease property values near wind farms. According to Mountain Communities for Responsible Energy, \"Large wind turbines in concert with each other, especially those sited on ridgetops with side slopes shaped like a parabolic reflector, create profound, relentless noise reverberations extending out for more than a mile, sounding like \"a boot tumbling in a dryer\" or the revving of jet engines on a runway.\" [7]. Wind farms thus generate the same NIMBY attitude that nuclear power plants generate. For all of the above reasons, solar and wind power are not viable replacements for fossil fuels. If we like to have electricity and to drive our cars, fossil fuels are the only option for the foreseeable future. UV light: As someone who is extremely fair skinned, the lives of Australians sound extremely similar to my own. I cannot leave the house without sunscreen and protective coverings or else I will develop a sunburn within a matter of 15-20 minutes of sun exposure. Even ozone-shielded UV radiation can be highly damaging, and doctors recommend that even dark-skinned individuals wear sunscreen. In addition, my opponent never answers my analysis that the particular ozone hole he is talking about over Australia is widely acknowledged as being caused by the emission of CFC's, not of fossil fuels. Lastly, my opponent has no response to the tens of millions of jobs that are generated worldwide by fossil fuels and related industries, and the fact that fossil fuel-exporting dependent countries would have their economies collapse without fossil fuels, causing a massive drop in global demand for good and services, sinking all countries further into the global recession.

            "premise": "Though it may be true that most alternative energy sources are duds/inefficient, this does not necessarily prove your point. You have spent the vast majority of this debate condemning the use and efficiency of alternative fuels, which I do not entirely disagree, but then again, it has little to do with your topic. Here are all your statements that support your claim, \"Steps to stop Global Warming will kill far more people than it will save\": \"Since there are no cost effective energy sources available to prosperous countries and environmentalists are demanding reductions of all energy sources that pollute in order to save the planet all the impoverished third world populations who could not even begin to afford these ridiculous ineffective alternatives to oil will surely perish by the millions from famine and wars caused by food shortages and regulations instituted by the U.N. the IPCC and the environmentalists who support them.\" Third world populations will not necessarily be affected, as our global warming measures cannot be forced upon other nations. We make our own rules. \"The consumption and production of fossil fuels is going to be reduced as the population grows and there are no cost effective viable energy sources available to replace fossil fuels. This means only one thing, that the poorest of the poor are going to suffer the most as the price of fossil fuels sky rocket and they will be unable to buy fuel to put in their old polluting farm equipment that will also be regulated out of existence to grow crops and feed them selves . . . The result is clear as I see it, the poorest of the poor are going to die by the millions if they are restricted from using fossil fuels and the old antiquated pollution producing cars and trucks and farm equipment they also use to feed them selves.\" As I stated above, only the poorest of the poor in this country will suffer. There is also such a thing as a water-powered mill. This can easily provide work and energy for those who use agricultural support. \"Fossil fuels are and will continue to be the major fuel source for this planet for at least the next 50 years as I have proven with all of my evidence.\" It this is true, then the plan for action against global warming will not be a major problem until fossil fuels expire. The plan is to reduce carbon emissions in the U.S. by 80% by the year 2050.",

            "discussionTitle": "shoud we turn to nuclar energy rather then fossil fuels",
            "conclusion": "shoud we turn to nuclar energy rather then fossil fuels",
            "premise": "When people think nuclear power, what usually comes to mind is giant funnels spewing some sort of mystery gas (which by the way, is water vapor) and nuclear accidents such as the Chernobyl incident and the Fukushima disaster. However, nuclear power is so much more than this, and there is an untold story of nuclear energy behind all that bad PR. Here are the benefits of nuclear energy: 1. Nuclear Energy is Relatively Cheap There are a lot of components to the pricing of nuclear power in relation to that of coal, but when you add up all the costs, Nuclear energy is significantly cheaper. In 2012 it costed around 2.3 cents/kWh(cents per kilowatt hour) to operate and maintain a nuclear power plant. Coal and natural gas mining facilities, on the other hand, costed around 3.8 cents/kWh to operate and maintain. Oil was the worst, coming in at around 23 cents/kWh to operate and maintain. Nuclear power plants are, admittedly more expensive to build, but the cheaper cost to run them will more than pay for itself. 2. Nuclear Energy is More Eco-Friendly When you see this, you are probably again thinking about the devastating effects of Chernobyl and Fukushima. However, these catastrophic events don't actually happen that often. There is still an issue of radioactive wastes, but waste products can be easily disposed of in waste facilities to minimize environmental damage. As mentioned earlier, what billows out of nuclear power plants is steam, which is far less damaging to the environment than say, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and the other hundreds of gases that are clogging up our environment, all of which are byproducts of burning fossil fuels. Speaking of the effects of burning fossil fuels, lets look at some. a) Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen. When fossil fuels are burned, the nitrogen in the air is combusted along with the fuel and nitrous oxide or nitric dioxide is produced. Nitric dioxide is a reddish brownish gas that is highly toxic. Nitrous oxide is a colorless, sweet smelling toxic gas that is more commonly known as laughing gas. b) When fossil fuels are burned, carbon based gases are released, most notably carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, making the atmosphere thicker and thus trapping more sunlight, leading to the warming of the Earth. One only has to look at Jupiter to see a planet that is heavy with greenhouse gases, and I can tell you, even without the extreme levels of gravity, living on Jupiter would not be the most pleasant experience c) Burning fossil fuels also release sulphur dioxide as well as nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere. These two gases react with water molecules in the atmosphere to form acid. So when it rains, it rains acid. Acid rain has a number of detrimental effects on biological life, habitats, as well as man-made structures. Acid in lakes can cause some fish eggs to not hatch, and higher levels can cause adult fish to die. As such, biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain in soil kills many microbes who cannot tolerate low pH, and also changes the chemical composition of soil by reacting with calcium and magnesium, rendering plants such as the sugar maple unable to grow. When acid rain falls over forests, it can leech calcium out of the trees such as the red maple, rendering them weak to cold, which can lead to death during the winter. Acid rain can also corrode structural support such as steel beams and cables that hold up buildings and bridges, both of which have very predictable results. 3. Nuclear energy has a higher energy density The energy released from nuclear fission is 10 million times more than from burning atoms in fossil fuels. Because of this, less fuel is needed to make more energy in terms of nuclear power. 4. Nuclear energy has a lower death toll Again, you might be thinking back to a plethora of nuclear meltdowns. However, I will re-emphasize, these accidents don\u2019t occur all that often, at least not as often as gas explosions, coal mine collapses, and oil spills. A recent study found that for every one person that dies for nuclear related reasons, 4000 die for coal related reasons. Fossil Fuel mining clearly has a higher mortality rate. 5. Thorium Thorium is a relatively new alternative to uranium, and it already is found to be better than its older counterpart. It\u2019s greener, more energy dense, and decreases the likelihood of meltdowns to practically zero. Essentially, it addresses all the main problems people have with nuclear power plants, that is, uranium based power plants. http://www.popularmechanics.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... https://courses.engr.illinois.edu... http://www.world-nuclear.org... http://www.the9billion.com... http://energyinformative.org...",

            "conclusion": "The United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels.",
            "premise": "I agree that my definition of the United States was a little too ambiguous. You are right that I am arguing on both moral and government policy grounds. As for the definition of fossil fuels, artificial coal would be considered an alternate fuel if the definition of artificial coal is coal created by rapidly applying vibrating pressures to wood (Karweil) and/or rapid application of intense heat (Hill). In Illinois, USA artificial coals are created by heating the lignin to about 150\u02daC in the presence of montmorillonite or illite clays (catalysts). <http://www.answersingenesis.org...;. With this debate, I would like to prove that we should move away from fossil fuels and move toward renewable energy sources such as biodiesel because: (1)Fossil Fuels such as oil has a finite amount in this world and is not being naturally formed as fast as we are using it. Based off of the Hubbert Peak Theory, once we have reached the point of maximum production, we will experience an exponential decline. As of 2004, the total world reserves were estimated to be 1.25 trillion barrels with a daily consumption of about 85 million barrels. With this we can make an estimation of when to experience the oil depletion, which it to be around the year 2057. < http://en.wikipedia.org... >. <http://en.wikipedia.org... >. (2) Oil, coal and natural gas make up of more than 85% of the energy consumed in the United States. Using oil as an example the US in 2004 imported 61% of consumption (13.12 million barrels per day). By 2005, the US imported 67% of consumption (16.54 million barrels per day). We are too dependent on other nations for our energy sources, which could hurt us in the future. An example would be the 1973 oil crisis, when the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries declared an oil embargo because the United States resupplied the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. October 16, 1973, OPEC raised the price of oil by 70%. October 19, 1973, President Nixon didn't back down and appropriated $2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel, which created a negative effect by other Arab states and joined the embargo on October 20, 1973. Since there was a low supply of oil in countries under the embargo, oil had to be increased in price to decrease the demand. Market price for oil rose from $3 to $12. The Middle East has control of a vital commodity, which became known as the \"oil weapon\". The United States needs to not allow room for such vulnerability, by depending less on imported fossil fuels. < http://www.quoteoil.com... >. <http://en.wikipedia.org... >. (3)From an environmentalist's perspective, the obtaining, refining, and usage of fossil fuels are harmful to the environment. In the extraction of oil in cases of offshore exploration, sea beds have been disturbed, which have killed the sea plants that many of the marine creatures need to survive due to the dredging process. In the extraction of coal, there are two methods; opencast mining and Underground mines. The Opencast mining tends to disfigure the country side and produces a large amount of atmosphere pollution due to the surface activity. If the Opencast mining is refilled after the mining project, the soil is usually a mixture of layers which mean that harder elements are exposed on the surface leaving the land almost barren. With Underground mines, roof collapsing of the mines can be felt on the surface level leaving buildings and roadways susceptible to cracks and sometimes disappearing into a hole. Oil spills have been known to damage natural ecosystems. It is much more damaging at sea since it can spread for hundreds of nautical miles killing sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms that it coats. The combustion of fossil fuels has contributed to more than 90% of the United States greenhouse gas emissions. It produces air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and heavy metals. Such air pollutants can contribute to smog, acid rain, climate change, which can affect habitats and wildlife. Fossil Fuels also contain radioactive material (uranium and thorium), which are released into the atmosphere. The burning of coal in 1982 released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. < http://www.planete-energies.com... >. <http://en.wikipedia.org... >. <http://en.wikipedia.org... >. I hope I have provided enough information to prove why I believe that the United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels. I look forward to seeing the response from my opponent, and would like to thank him for debating with me.",

            "premise": "The proposition lists a number of problems with alternative energy. It is perfectly true that alternative energy is not efficient enough to serve the energy needs of the world's population today. However, with investment all these methods could be made efficient enough to serve mankind. It is also true that initiation of alternative energy schemes, such as the Aswan dam, have caused problems. But the opposition are not advocating a blanket solution to every problem. Many dam projects, for example, could have been replaced by solar power had the technology been available, without the downside to the dams. In addition, there is almost always one renewable resource that a given country can exploit; tides for islands, the sun for equatorial countries, hot rocks for volcanic regions etc. and so any given country can in principle become self-sufficient with renewable energy. The global distribution of uranium is hugely uneven (much more so than fossil fuels) and the use of nuclear power therefore gives countries with uranium deposits disproportionate economic power. It is far from inconceivable that uranium could be subject to the same kind of monopoly that the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) places on oil. Indeed, if the whole world went over to nuclear power, supplies of usable uranium ore would run out within a few short decades. This prevents countries from achieving self-sufficiency in energy production.",

            "conclusion": "Are Renewable Energy Sources Better than Fossil Fuels",
            "premise": "With the non-stop hype about blaming CO2 for the warming of the Earth, Renewable resources such as solar and wind have risen as potential substitutes for fossil fuels. However, the renewable energy sources are unreliable and much more expensive. \"While raw forms of energy are both free and practically infinite, the equipment and materials needed to collect, process, and transport the energy to the users are neither one. Currently, the RE costs are generally higher than that of fossil-based and nuclear energy. In addition to this, unlike well-established conventional designs, the advancement in different RE technologies still requires substantial investments. \" [1]. It is also fair to point out something important to this debate: the most common sources of renewable energy are solar and wind. The problem with this is that the Sun won't always be out, and the wind doesn't always blow. This means that you won't always be able to get energy if you rely on solar and wind, as there is no areas that wind and solar energy are stored to be distributed; they must be used right away. So during winter, when the sun isn't always out, it would be much harder to get energy. You would have to place more solar panels to get enough energy to power a country through winter months, which would be very costly. And in order for wind turbines to be useful, the wind would have to constantly be blowing, which is hard to do, since wind speeds are unpredictable. Germany, who's currently leading the world in use of natural resources, spends lots of money because they still need to rely on fossil fuels when natural resources don't come through, which is why their energy poverty rates (people who can't pay electric bills due to a price increase) have rose. [2] \"Wind power is unpredictable and unreliable as it often produces either too much or too little power. This damages a power grid that can\"t function unless demand for electricity exactly matches supply. With conventional power plants, like nuclear or natural gas, having demand match supply isn\"t difficult because they can easily adjust output far in advance of predicted demand for electricity. Solar and wind power, however, cannot easily adjust output because especially cloudy or windless day can\"t be predicted in advanced.\" [3] Fossil fuels came a long way, and thanks to fossil fuels, we have much better air [4] and water quality [5] . In fact we are on the road to obtaining energy from fossil fuels that don't emit as much pollutants. [6]. Fossil fuels currently supply 2/3 (67%) of America's energy [7], roughly the same for the world [8]. Its job is too big to be taken by something as inefficient as renewable resources now.

Ultimately, we are the most corrosive being on this planet--and this is a fact no one can deny. We distroy forests so we can have buildings.Fossil fuel is the major factor in climate change and global societal unrest. Deforestation is a result of the developments that demand additiona resources fueled (if you will) by fossil fuel.Fossil fuel is not irreplaceable. It is just that we (the powers to be) have chosen not to develop other forms of energy, such as sun, water, corn, etc. There is nothing natural about sending millions of tons of toxic gas into the ozone. Let us stop the usage of fossil fuel and allow our bright minds to develop new ways to sustain our planet. People are not inately dependent on fossil fuel, we made ourselves dependent. Untimately, as creatures of survival, we would find alternatives if fossil fuel is no longer available. Common people are not dependent on fossil fuel (for their transportation) they are dependent on our technological advances. If cars are not affordable due to the cost of fuel, then bikes would easily become the new form of transportation. Thousand of of employers who cannot afford to have their employees miss work would develop new ways of completing projects possibly those involving remote video and virtual networks so that transportation is not necessary.80% of world energy can easily become something else. All it takes is the majority of people choosing a different direction. That is all. We as a society do this all the time. Example, the world trade center, farming, Gold standard",

            "discussionTitle": "Alternative energy methods should be proposed with total costs",
            "conclusion": "Alternative energy methods should be proposed with total costs",
            "premise": "For this debate, \"alternative energy\" means a fuel, method, or apparatus designed to reduce or eliminate consumption of traditional fossil fuels as they are now employed. http://www.thefreedictionary.com... \"Total costs\" includes all the costs associated with producing, shipping, storing, and using the alternative energy. Costs include dollar costs and environmental impact. Dollar costs include capital costs, indirect induced costs, and operating costs. The resolution is largely moot for private investment in alternative energy, because investors make it their business to understand costs. For private investment, the laws governing environmental impact apply. The resolution has it's primary impact for proposed government funding, subsidies, and regulations. Citizens have a right to know the true costs of government actions not only in terms of what the government is spending, but including the indirect costs on society. An example of the principle of the resolution being applied is the accounting of nuclear power plant decommissioning costs. When a nuclear power plant is ultimately taken out of service, there are significant costs in making the plant site safe. Those are figured into the costs of the plant, disclosed, and accounted for by setting up a fund to pay for the plant decommissioning. (A quirky California law requires decommissioning costs to be disclosed on electric bills; it's about four cents on a $200 electric bill.) Examples of the principle of the resolution being ignored are plentiful. Solar and wind power are generally unreliable. The sun is absent every night. Even in windy locations the wind may cease for many days at a time, or the winds may be seasonal. Consequently, usually a backup power source, like a gas-driven power plant must be added to the grid to pick up the load when the alternative energy source is unavailable. The capital costs of the backup are generally about 70% of the cost of running the plant full time. In other words, the fossil fuel is about 30% of the cost of the power, including the delivery system. Here is an example of wind power being touted as cheaper, while totally ignoring the costs of a backup energy system: http://www.ucsusa.org... The article says that farmers can make money from selling wind energy, but ignores the extra cost to the public. The wind turbine operator is getting a substantial subsidy from ratepayers who must pay the capital costs for two systems. In some applications, no backup system will be required. For example, if solar power is used to supply peak loads to Las Vegas or Phoenix in the summer, it is probably a good assumption that the sun will be shining when the power is needed. If it happens to be cloudy, then the weather is probably cooler so than the air conditioning load will be less, so that seems like a very good application for solar power. However, if the costs are analyzed for Chicago or New York, it's likely that a full accounting would reveal a different story. Failure to perform and disclose total costs has lead to a major policy error in the government subsidies for ethanol. Ethanol production from corn requires lots of energy-intensive fertilizer, an expensive delivery system, and high costs of taking land out of food production. http://www.thefreedictionary.com... That was not disclosed or even a thought through before the policy was committed. The U.S. government is now adopting policies that favor electric cars. The energy and environmental costs http://green.yahoo.com... of making the batteries are generally ignored, and the very high capital costs of the cars is downplayed. An electric car that will run for 40 miles may cost $40,000. http://www.cbsnews.com... To make that widely salable, large government subsidies would be required. Total cost accounting amounts to honesty in developing energy policy. It does not preclude adopting more expensive alternatives. For example, a case could be argued that ethanol and electric cars effective consume coal (to produce fertilizer and batteries) in favor of imported oil. If costs are disclosed, that case can be argued on the merits. The resolution would avoid bogus claims that, for example, if a kilowatt hour of wind power is the same or lower than coal, the wind power is obviously preferable. The wind power costs may be double when the backup generator is taken into account. How much the backup costs is site dependent. In some circumstances, wind power might be used to pump water uphill into an existing hydroelectric project. That's probably much cheaper than having to build a gas-turbine plant. My point is only that full costs should be disclosed. This is a \"should\" resolution. It means that environmental activists and government officials should honestly perform the total cost analysis and disclose the numbers to the public. This is now rarely done, so it would greatly improve the quality of public policy decisions. Con may argue that government should not provide any subsidies. If so, that does not dispute the resolution. Investors should be fully informed of costs even if government is not involved. Con may argue that even when total costs are disclosed, there is economically sound alternative energy. If so, that does not dispute the resolution either. The resolution will nonetheless favor the best solutions. The resolution is affirmed.",

There is two main points that I would like to make in reference to my claim. 1.) Creating a wind/solar infrastructure is very expensive. Although there is a massive movement towards the 50/50 ratio of wind/solar vs fossil fuel energy, humans haven't actually reached 15% yet. That is, 15% of all energy created by ALL renewable energy sources.. The IEA, international Energy Agence, claims that in \"2012, the world relied on renewable sources for around 13.2% of its total primary energy supply.\" http://www.iea.org... 2.) Big businesses and governments will do everything that they can to prolong and preserve the market for energy created by fossil fuels. Companies such as ExxonMobile, which is worth 412 billion dollars, have political power and will do everything in their power to not only keep the production of fossil fuels but also to slow the expansion of renewable energy. http://mashable.com... http://energyrealityproject.com... I have viewed you're sources and I cannot find any information that leads to the conclusion that we will ever be at a 50/50 ratio of fossil vs renewable.

            "premise": "I accept the challenge. Hopefully this will be fun. I wish there were good alternatives to gasoline but there are not any good alternatives here right now that can replace it. Electricity is not unlimited source. The biggest sources of electricity is coal. It is cleaner but is still fossil fuel and still produces a lot of CO2. Coal is also limited. People can argue that solar and wind power are not limited but the technology use to harness the electricity is not advanced enough yet. A lot of fossil fuel are needed to make solar panels and wind mills. There is also no good way to store of this energy. When night comes the solar panel doesn't produce electricity. Right now engineers are trying to develope a storage for electricity during the day but it isn't efficient and cheap enough at this time. \"If we used Vegetable oil for our vehicles then not only will the enviroment will be better but also, it would help farmers make more money and there would be more farmers which would help this country have more food production and less people starving.\" This statement is false for many reasons. 1) The environment will not be better off. Vegetable oil burns less CO2 but that isn't the only thing that concerns the environment. In order to use vegetable oil to replace even 50% of gasoline it will have to take all the farm land of the United States of America and none will be used for food. This makes the environmental impact a disaster. 2) Farmers will make more money but starvation will increase. During the gas price boom last year ethanol (in which is more efficient than vegetable oil) use skyrocket. As a result a corn shortage happened and prices went up for food that had relation with corn. This shortage wasn't a problem in United States as much in poor countries. 3) Obesity is the problem in the United States not really starvation. Going hungry in the United States is nothing like going hungry in Africa. There is enough food production and food is profitable. More farmers live in Beverly Hills than movie stars. Food is a good enough reason to farm.",

            "conclusion": "There is no such thing as totally RENEWABLE energy.",
            "premise": "== Definitions == My opponent focuses the entire debate on what the term \"renewable\" means, so this is fundamentally going to be a semantics debate. American Heritage defines \"renewable\" as: \"Relating to a natural resource, such as solar energy, water, or wood, that is never used up or that can be replaced by new growth.\" [1] Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines \"renewable\" as: \"restored or replaced by natural processes : able to be replaced by nature.\" [2] Google defines \"renewable\" as: \"(of a natural resource or source of energy) not depleted when used.\" The Texas Legislature has defined \"renewable energy\" as: \"Any energy resource that is naturally regenerated over a short time scale and derived directly from the sun (such as thermal, photochemical, and photoelectric), indirectly from the sun (such as wind, hydropower, and photosynthetic energy stored in biomass), or from other natural movements and mechanisms of the environment (such as geothermal and tidal energy). Renewable energy does not include energy resources derived from fossil fuels, waste products from fossil sources, or waste products from inorganic sources.\" [3] The common theme here is that \"renewable\" means something that either (a) we can create more of (like biofuels derived from algae) or (b) something that derives from natural processes, so our use of its does not deplete it. Contention 1: solar, wind, etc. meets my definition of renewable The Google definition is the most clear: that renewable means something that is not depleted by our use of it. My opponent says the sun is not renewable because it will some day run out of energy and supernova. However, I have three responses to this. First, that's not the definition of \"renewable.\" Our *use* of sunlight does not actually deplete the sun. The sun was going to emit that sunlight anyway. We are merely tapping into a natural process that was going to happen anyway. Similarly, wind energy comes from the uneven heating of the Earth by the sun, causing air to move from colder areas to warmer areas. Wind energy will continue to exist as long as the sun exists, and our use of it does not deplete the total amount of wind that there is. Second, when the sun supernovas, we will either (a) all die from the supernova, or (b) travel to another solar system that has its own sun. Therefore, either we all die, so we won't need an energy source, or we can find another sun. We will never be in a scenario where we are alive and without sunlight. This particular form of power, therefore, will always be viable for all practical purposes. Third, there are types of energy that meet even my opponent's absurd definition of \"renewable.\" Biofuels can be made by growing algae. We can literally \"renew\" our supply of algae whenever we went. Obviously, this is in sharp contrast to fossil fuels, which require so much time and pressure that we can never practically renew the Earth's supply of them. Lastly, I'll note that words are an artificial construct and are only useful to us in distinguishing things from each other. The words \"renewable energy\" is only useful as a concept to distinguish sustainable sources of energy from unsustainable ones. To define \"renewable\" the way my opponent does would mean that there would be no word in the English language to distinguish (solar, wind, geothermal, and biofuel) from (fossil fuels). There's no point in defining \"renewable\" in such a way so as to rob the word of any usefulness. Furthermore, given that language is an artificial construct that dies with us, it seems safe to define renewable as including sunlight because if there is no sunlight, we are all dead and there will be no language. So any problems with the word \"renewable\" and the sun eventually dying pretty much solve themselves, because the word \"renewable\" will die with us when the sun does.

            "discussionTitle": "Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)",
            "conclusion": "Increasing Funding for Micropower (Alternative Energy)",
            "premise": "Pro has selected a timely topic. In this debate we will try to sort out sense from nonsense as it relates to government subsidy of energy alternatives. Micropower has virtues in certain applications. The issue is whether government ought to pour in subsidies or let the technology advance according to its usefulness and economic viability. The main thing the government can do to support the technology is to get rid of the state and local laws that forbid it by zoning and siting controls. Government should not subsidize it, because the claims for non-economic benefits are false, and government should not attempt to pick winners in economic viability. The market sorts out what is economic far better than any bureaucrat. Note that Pro did not cite a single reference supporting his assertions about the technology or our need for it. As a starting point, the Industrial Technologies Program web site is http://www1.eere.energy.gov..., but none of their claims are supported either. Pro says the status quo is unacceptable. The status quo is s successfully providing electric power to consumers. That's acceptable. If we were not getting electricity, it would be unacceptable. As with virtually anything that exists, improvements are possible. The questions have to do with the expense of improvements versus the benefits. Subsidizing micropower makes no sense in that context. Insofar as it makes economic sense, it is getting plenty of private funding. 1.a We operate on a grid system. The virtue of the grid system is that power plants can go off line, usually for maintenance, while power is continues to flow to users. 1.b.i A terrorist might take out a major transmission line, but if the grid is properly designed it will only affect a limited number of customers. The reason large areas are taken out is antiquated design so that fails to isolate transmission failures, so that power is shut down in a domino effect, rather than routed around the failure. The reason the grid is antiquated is that the regulatory structure of utilities makes it difficult to profit from upgrades on either transmission lines or improvements in control systems. Texas, for example, operates a grid that is not connected to rest of the country. They can thereby manage improvements in grid technology without the Feds stopping them. Their electricity is cheaper and more reliable than the national average. http://www.slate.com... 1.b.ii Pro cites concerns over global warming. Global warming crisis theory is now proved to be false, because measured climate data is falling below the 95% probability bounds for the models that predict climate crisis. There is warming, but it presents to substantial problem. In any case, micropower is almost entirely implemented with gas turbines, so there is no appreciable effect on CO2 emission other than the efficiency of new power plants over old. 1.b.iii Economic competitiveness requires that we not waste money on non-competitive technologies. Insofar as micropower is economically competitive or even promises to be competitive, it doesn't need government subsidy. Saying that large industries are effective is irrelevant; it's like saying we ought to subsidize the construction of stone pyramids, because the construction industry is huge and vital. 1.b.iv Micropower is readily available on the market. If the U.S. wants to buy some and give them to developing countries, our government can do that now. North Korea wants nuclear for bombs, not power generation. 1.b.v Micropower is used exclusively to generate electricity, which in the US comes from, coal, nuclear, and natural gas. There is no dependence whatsoever on foreign oil to generate electricity. We do import a little natural gas, but horizontal drilling has opened up vast new reserves of domestic natural gas, so imports will be phased out anyway. 1.c Pro provided no reference or argument to support his assertion that subsidies of fossil fuels prevents micropower from being competitive. I don't believe the claim. Since micropower is almost entirely based upon fossil fuels, natural gas in particular, the claim makes no sense. The fossil fuel industry pays way more in taxes than it receives in subsidies, so there is no net loss to the taxpayer to be remedied. 2.a As alternatives to fossil fuels, solar power requires conventional backup at night and, in many places, in winter. The backup comes from the grid. If the grid is abolished then every user will need both a conventional power generator and wind or solar, with the conventional generator idle half the time. About two-thirds of the cost of conventional power is the capital cost of the generator of the generator, not the fuel to run it. The net effect is that costs to user will at the very least double. Pro cites geothermal and hydroelectric power. Very few individuals can implement their own dam or geothermal wells. Those are inherently centralized. Consequently, if the grid is abolished hydro and thermal will be replaced with fossil fuel generators. 2.b. Pro claims subsidies to fossil fuels of $120 billion, but even biased Greenpeace \"thinks the American oil and gas industry might receive anywhere between $15 billion and $35 billion a year in subsidies from taxpayers.\" In 2006, the oil companies paid $138 billion in Federal corporate tax alone. http://mjperry.blogspot.com... They pay three times their profits in taxes. Of course, coal and natural gas industries pay taxes as well, and all pay sate and local taxes in addition. Consequently, any subsidies are more than paid for. If micropower starts paying huge taxes, they might merit some subsidy, but that hasn't happened. Micropower is getting plenty of private money, so it doesn't need government subsidy. \"...serious money has come to the micropower table. Nth Power, a venture capital firm devoted to innovative energy technologies, estimates that venture capital funding for micropower and related businesses climbed from less than $30 million in 1995 to over $1 billion in 2000. Major corporations including GE, Siemens Westinghouse and the European giant, ABB, have launched efforts to develop their micropower potential...\" http://www.minneapolisfed.org... Micropower makes the most economic sense when there is a cheap source of natural gas locally. Also, semiconductor manufacturing cannot tolerate brownout or interruptions of power, so micropower makes economic sense for them. 2.c See 1.c, above. 2.d. The DOE claims that it's ITR program works. All government programs are claimed to work, no matter how much they waste. Eve so, ITR does not equate to micropower. Their projects are a hodge podge of small energy conservation projects. http://www1.eere.energy.gov... I can find no evidence of any innovation related to micropower that was sponsored by DOE. DOE is competing with venture capitalists, and VCs are going to find and push he good stuff, not DOE. 2.e. Pro claims that the subsidies could be paid by ending fossil fuel subsidies. He has provided no evidence as to what those subsidies are. Since micropower has nothing to do with oil imports, ending subsidies of domestic oil would simply increase prices and make domestic oil less competitive with foreign oil. t would result in increasing imports, something Pro agreed we do not want. Besides, any money raised could also be used to subsidize health care or reduce the federal deficit. That makes more sense than trying to compete with VCs by picking winners in micropower development. With selective subsidies by project, ITR is far more likely to screw up micropower than to help it. Pro's affirming claims are unsupported by evidence. It will have no effect on oil dependence or CO2. The resolution is negated.",

            "premise": "This is a peer reviewed report on the costs of producing ethanol using corn, switch grass and wood. It is also the most comprehensive report done so far. There are many reports out there that are used by the proponents of ethanol but most are not peer reviewed and leave out many aspects relating to the actual production and distribution of ethanol. Again this is a peer revived report by David Pimentel and Tad W. Patzek. Both are peer reviewed scientists http://petroleum.berkeley.edu... This is a peer reviewed report on yucca mountain repository. It describes every aspect of the repository and a final conclusion statement made by the scientists who conducted the study. It is clearly stated that it passes all of their minimum requirements to store nuclear waste for ten thousand years. But goes on to say that more should be done to make it even safer and that more reviews are necessary even though it passes inspection. That means it will never get a license to operate as all of the other recommendations will never ever be able to be met. Scroll to page 63 for the conclusion and recommendation statement. http://www.nea.fr... This blog link will be all of the arguments that will prohibit it from ever being opened yet the repository has passed all of the requirements for theses arguments. I find this to be an acceptable link as I am only using it as an example for arguments against the repository, not as facts about the repository. http://ag.state.nv.us... As I stated before Nuclear Energy is a waste of everyone's time and money and effort. It will never be allowed on a large scale to provide power where it is needed. It is a very cheap and clean source of fuel but is made artificially cost prohibitive be endless regulation and protests and lawsuit injunctions that make it not even worth trying. Hydro and wind power are only useful to the surrounding area within a 100 or 200 mile radius. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with these energy sources. The initial start up cost is astronomical and third world countries will not invest in them and are unsuitable for the locations that most third world countries are situated. All electric and hybrid battery cars: The battery life is only guaranteed for 8 years or 80,000 miles and that is prorated. It can cost anywhere from 3,000 to 7,000 dollars to replace the battery in one of these cars. I used car dealer information and I know you don't like them but forums and blogs about people who own or have owned ether type of these vehicles. I found no discrepancies between the dealer information and these blogs when it comes to the price of these batteries. These batteries are filled with the same hazardous acid that is in regular lead acid batteries but ten to 20 times as much. If these cars end up being massed produced there will be hundreds of thousands of these batteries sitting around and many people who would recycle them for metal content will just dump the acid on the ground to get at the metal to make a few bucks. You have to pay a mechanic to remove it and a disposal fee to get rid of it. Many people will not be willing to pay these fees and just dump the battery some where and sell the car as scrap. When these cars get older they will make their way over seas into the third world countries where the only thing people care about over there is having a job and feeding them selves, They will most assuredly drive these cars until they die and dump the battery acid and scrap the battery and car for metal content. \"Environmentalists say that if we don't eliminate fossil fuels now the planet is doomed to flooded by all of the glaciers melting and rising the sea level by 20 or more feet in as little as 30 to 50 years. And that all the remaining land will become vast desert waste lands unable to sustain life.\" I don't believe any of the prediction made by global warming alarmists. But this statement proves a very important point. The consumption and production of fossil fuels is going to be reduced as the population grows and there are no cost effective viable energy sources available to replace fossil fuels. This means only one thing, that the poorest of the poor are going to suffer the most as the price of fossil fuels sky rocket and they will be unable to buy fuel to put in their old polluting farm equipment that will also be regulated out of existence to grow crops and feed them selves. There is nothing on the horizon that is going to replace fossil fuels in the next 20 years. But the world is going to be flooded and the reaming land will be deserts by then. I use the movie An Inconvenient truth as my source for this coming calamity. It is an acceptable source as it won a Pulitzer Prize but is not peer reviewed. The result is clear as I see it, the poorest of the poor are going to die by the millions if they are restricted from using fossil fuels and the old antiquated pollution producing cars and trucks and farm equipment they also use to feed them selves. It is the Environmentalists goal to eliminate these things from the planet in 20 to 50 years or they say the planet is doomed and they must start now!! If they do this millions will die of starvation. Whether or not I believe in global warring being caused by man or not is irrelevant to this debate. What is relevant is the environmentalists movement to eliminate fossil fuel consumption without having a cost effective alternative fuel source in place and a infrastructure to deliver it. Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon power? All of these energy sources are experimental and decades from viable development and then infrastructures will have to be built to deliver it which will take decades more. They are worthless as alternative fuel sources if fossil fuels are to be eliminated in the next 20 years if we are going to save this planet from the coming calamity predicted by the environmental movement. People are going to start dying by the millions if restrictions on fossil fuel production aren't lifted.",

October 4, 2009: \"Professor David MacKay, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser on climate change, has said what many people have long believed. You cannot meet Britain\u2019s future energy needs and reduced carbon emissions without a big expansion of nuclear power. [...] As we report today, he believes we should aim to be producing four times the amount of electricity from nuclear as now. Alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and wavepower will never provide more than a fraction of the country\u2019s energy needs. Relying on gas, coal and oil, with an increasing proportion imported, does not square with Britain\u2019s international climate commitments.\"",

            "conclusion": "Alternative energy methods should be proposed with total costs",
            "premise": "My opponent did not present direct responses to my points. His first argument seem to be that: 1) It does not facilitate public policy debate, and that it avoids real issues. I answer with a simple, so what? This may sound harsh but the risks of extinction which have gone un-responded too outweigh the need for honesty, which is where I will deal with my opponent's should analysis. He claims should implies a moral issue and thus we debate fairness or \"deontological\" issues. However I see no reason why utilitarian values are not just as moral. Utilitarianism, the ends based system of measuring morality, is far superior then this general, \"people should ACT according to some abstract moral standard\", because: 1) there are no 'universal moral truths.' Such truths are difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain. On the other hand, the benefits and disadvantages of actions are much more easily calculated. Thus, rather than relying on amorphous, vague moral truths to guide action we should look to more concrete ways of determining the ethics of a particular act to allow us to actually weigh actions and understand what impacts could be in the first place. 2) What do we do when absolute moral principles in deontology conflict? For example if we say retributive justice is an absolute moral principle, then we cannot do a plea bargain as then the one receiving the bargain would not be getting their full due of punishment. However what if that plea bargain could result in 10 more criminals getting their due of punishment? So we must look to and ends based system of morality and in this system I have showed in my counter plan that we risk extinction without global warming. Colder temperatures support war and in a nuclear world we cannot risk this. And as I showed with bearden any nuclear war is by necessity unlimited in scope. Extinction or even the probability thereof outweighs all else as it ends all life forever, it takes away all the future lives also. No matter the probability it outweighs all else as a fraction of infinity is still infinity. My opponents second point was that alternative energy sources are sought to reduce dependence on foreign oil and that it is inevitable that fossil fuels will run out. I would say this is simply not true, lets be honest here, the main support or at least one of the main supports for alternatives is global warming. Causing people to be afraid of alternatives will make us use fossil fuels here especially at 3545467.5 times at much. And on the point that fossil fuels will run out eventually anyway I would say that 1)If we can use enough, and if we use enough that it's actually gone, we would of put enough out to warm the planet more. This means you should compare which planet will be warmer and since mine would be because of the outpouring of fossil fuels there is: A) Reduced chance of nuclear war and extinction B) Reduced chance of famine, we need more c02 in the air not to have a famine in grains. A famine would cause massive harms to human life and also decimate our chances of stopping poverty a leading killer in the world. My opponent last point-like thing about how, If there were no global warming and no foreign dependence on oil, we would still be concerned with obtaining energy at the lowest cost and with minimizing pollution, is irrelevant. At the very least making alternatives appear more expensive will cause MORE fossil fuel output then there is on his side and thus maximizing global warming. Resolution, consider yourself negated.",

            "premise": "Firstly, so you're aware, your argument was stated as a question ergo it'll be very difficult to debate on this topic, but I'll try and answer your question as best I can. 1 - Infrastructure. Currently the entire planet has developed a multi billion pound petroleum refinement, supply and distribution chain, currently no single car manufacturer wants to take the leap and change fuels because they know that making that change would limit their customer base and in turn seriously damage sales. If EVERY car manufacturer changed fuel supply then the big fuel giants such as BP would then be forced to change there market in order to survive but as it stands nobody wants to be the first. 2 - Energy content, The advantage conventional fuels have over many other energy storage methods is the huge amounts of energy contained within petroleum. In fact it's several dozens of times more than can be stored in an lead acid battery of an equal weight. So petroleum is a better storage vessel for energy. 3 - Habits, car makers have become very good at making progressively more and more efficient engines, To make something they know little about would be like starting from scratch. 4 - Speed of refueling, Filling a car with petroleum takes 5 minutes, charging a battery powered car takes several hours if not all night. 5 - Price, the cost of using petrol engines is never going to cost more than it does right now (for the car manufacturers) but changing to an alternative would cost them billions. 6 - Its all the same energy. Asides from nuclear and renewable energy supplies, all other power on earth is produced from the burning of fossil fuels. If you're recharging your new electric car on a night, the chances are you're using power made from burning fossil fuels, for this reason car companies don't see the environmental benefits of switching to an alternative (even hydrogen fuel cells take huge amounts of conventionally produced energy to make) 7 - Safety, You might thinks that petroleum is dangerous but compared with some of the alternatives its really quite safe. for instance its not an oxidizer so it'll only burn with direct exposure to the air. some of the chemicals in modern batteries can burn for a short while, even in a sealed environment The solution. Petroleum companies need to work on a biofuel which needs to fit the following criteria. - It needs to be able to operate on conventional infrastructure and in conventional vehicles (possibly with some slight modifications) - It need to be made from renewable biomass, so perhaps from some kind of fast growing reeds or something (as the plant grows it absorbs the CO2 from the atmosphere which is released as it burns so it'll be CO2 neutral) - it needs to have the same energy content as current fuels Until such a fuel is able to be produced in sufficient quantities to supply the world, we are stuck with rising fuel bills and dangerous pollutants.",

            "discussionTitle": "Nuclear Energy",
            "conclusion": "Nuclear Energy",
            "premise": "I will begin with my opponent's case and then present an alternative to nuclear energy. Opening statement: My opponent has produced some very impressive data on the efficiency of nuclear energy. Prima facie or first glance could easily sway a person to support nuclear energy. I vaguely recall having done rudimentary research on nuclear energy for a Lincoln-Douglas topic last fall. In fact, a conversation I had with our science department head revealed only one significant pitfall, what to do with the waste? My opponent has even identified dis-ads of nuclear waste and offered suggestions on the very subject of nuclear waste. If we dig deeper though, what are other concerns? Let's explore! 1) Effectiveness. At first glance the only disagreements I could identify were really nitpicky stuff. I could say that some of the water which became steam would inevitably evaporate and have to be replaced. I could even strengthen my opponent's defense by saying that the moving parts replacement schedule is likely very minimal. There is no shame in expanding Robert Fulton's use of steam even if it is an old idea. We still use wheels right? :o) There is no doubt that nuclear energy can offer power to communities. I, and the judges, are likely tired of semantical battles of topicality, that being said; much of my opponent's first point are stipulated and conceded. 2) Safety. This is a cause for concern. While technologically developed nations such as the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have operated plants for upwards of 60 years without serious incident, that does not make them immune to trouble. Many safeguards have been implemented since the 1950's to improve and upgrade the facilities. Yet, even superpowers such as the U.S. (3 mile island) and the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl) have had their share of growing pains. Most recently, another developed nation, Japan, experienced a calamity of catastrophic proportion. Are nuclear power plants compeletly safe? No. Now consider lesser developed nations that are seeking nuclear power, Iran and North Korea for example. Both are suspect for being politically unstable as well as using nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons. Oversight can be a tricky thing when a more radical nation prefers not to be inspected or have other's watching over their shoulders as they attempt to develop energy, or secretly weaponry. This forces them to be sneaky, which may lead to shortcuts, which may lead to disaster. Security of nuclear facilities. There are high protocol, likely classified, to protect the integrity of nuclear facilities in developed nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for less stable nations. Can anyone, with any certainty, verify the count of every spent rod or piece of weaponry from the the Former Soviet Union, especially after the breakup of the former into 15 separate and independent nations? I would have to say no. Further, what would prevent well organized and well funded terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials in lesser developed nations? This too eats away at the safety argument. An article I discovered addresses nuclear waste in a different light than that of my opponent. Like my opponent, it identfied waste that was short term and had reduced effects with proper handling and recycling. Also, like my opponent it identified longer term waste. However; the safety of the longer term waste was the compelling factor. It is quite dangerous, ecologically unfriendly, and can take an estimated 1000 years to decay. http://www.scienceclarified.com... These are a few \"what if\" or otherwise hypothetical scenarios that challenge nuclear energy safety as well as historical examples such as 3 mile island, Chernobyl, and Japan. While precautions and protocol do exist, they are far from foolproof, and are not necessarily as safe as my opponent would have us believe. http://www.nirs.org... 3) Costs. My opponent has demonstrated that nuclear energy does indeed exceed the effectiveness of fossil fuels. It's common knowledge and widely accepted that once established, nuclear is more logical than fossil. It appears to be cleaner in emissions, and uses fewer resources in producing more energy. At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense. This leads me to ask a question. Why then isn't everyone using nuclear energy then? A Smithsonian study showed that only approximately 16% of the worl'd energy is nuclear based. Since it is demonstrably more effective as shown by my opponent's CBA, why aren't most nations using it? Simply put, the necessary precautions make it cost prohibitive. Many African and Central American nations struggle to even provide basic necessities to their citizens. Citizens in African nations do not enjoy clean water, adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Haiti and Honduras don't even have a pot to piss in. In fact, many nations have substandard living conditions to include plumbing and basic sanitation. Constructing a nuclear power plant is not in their foreseeable future. My case: At first glance my alternative seems to be a reinvention of the wheel. There are alternatives to nuclear energy though. All of which can be done at a fraction of the cost of nuclear energy, and boast a much better safety record. HYDRO: Every nation does have rivers. Dams can be constructed, and power can be retrieved via hydro energy. SOLAR: Especially with so many \"experts\" verifying the existence of greenhouse gases and global warming, you would think that would open the door even wider for good ol' solar power. Yes the sun shines all over the earth! Yes, solar panels are expensive, and yes, at present they need to be rather large to capture this energy. Why can't every roof be a solar panel? This is worth research and development money! Opportunity is knocking! (For my beloved Israelis, I am offering triple mitzvah points if you discover it first) Who among us on this earth will be the first to develop more efficient solar power for all to enjoy? WIND: The wind blows. Meterologists have ways to track weather and determine the most strategic locations to place wind energy generators. KINETIC GENERATORS: Quite possibly the world's best kept secret! These puppies are built at a nominal cost, and run virtually clean, quiet, and very efficient. This is probably the better answer to the energy crisis. We (Collectively) have put boo-koodles of investment money into so many things. It makes sense to look into research for the large scale, big picture. http://www.homestandbygeneratorsystems.com... In closing: While nuclear energy is a better alternative than fossil fuels, it has yet to replace them. Why? It is both dangerous, and cost prohibitive. I am suggesting that nuclear energy research monies be diverted toward large scale research of kinetic generators. Thank you!",

Oil spills can be avoided and since we aren't attempting to greatly raise our level of fossil fuels, as well as not having a hard time producing our current requirements, the needs versus safety factor is not a factor. C. Carbon emissions are a gradual effect that is focused mostly in highly populated areas, but have less affects on areas where little to no oil/gasoline/natural gas is used. D. Where use is high, native animals aren't greatly affected, where as nuclear waste areas can't be inhabited within some area and it destroys most wild life in the immediate area. E. Fossil fuels are easier to acquire whereas nuclear elements such as Plutonium and Uranium need high levels of care and can't be relied on to drastically increase output without a sharp rise in death in those mining areas.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should fund alternative energy research",
            "premise": "\"This solution still stands on the con side because it counters pros method to the topic.\" Don't worry, I completely agree with the eligibility of your stance as Con. First, to address the comment by \"the instigators opening statement seems unclear as to if the government should just fund the initial research or if it should continue to make it viable (eg.Further research, or funding of Infastructure.\", I will present a case that supports the current infrastructure of alternative energies, and the main factor on why they are not more technologically advanced today is a lack of funding. The most efficient manner of researching alternative energy is through the private sector. Directly funding companies instead of government agencies will grant growth in both the economic and technological sectors. \"This method is better than through the private sector because the private sector is out for profit, quick solutions. While the government would not have any motives but the ends goal.\" This is only the case when the government restricts the contracts to one or a few companies, typically known as no-bid contracts. Before granting a contract to the private sector, the companies must compete for the contract not only by giving the government the best deal but also by having the strongest business proposal. There are risks involved in funding the private sector, but if the companies begin to work out of line and diverge away from the desired goal that the government seeks, then the government can pull its funding as a breach of contract. It seems that the both of us agree on the potential of alternative energy reducing oil dependence and rectifying America's long-term future. The solution to alternative energy has been found, however it has not yet been implemented because of a large gap in technology. Solar voltaic cells and nanotechnology are the future of the United States. Professor Nate Lewis of California Institute of Technology presents a lecture series evaluating and assessing both the theoretical and practical yield of power output for several forms of alternative energy including geothermal, solar, nuclear, and wind. He states that the most efficient manner is solar power, which holds the potential of harvesting 600 Terawatts, but can practically yield 60 TW. This is enough power to solve the world's energy for over a century. Dr. Lewis goes so far as to even provide geographical positions where the solar panels may be placed to successfully provide this much power. Once solar power is instituted, it will lower the cost to all consumers worldwide, emit no pollution, and solve the obvious problem of a limited supply of fossil fuels on earth. The annual consumption for the world is 13 TW annually, 10 of which are fossil fuels, and by the year 2050 it is estimated that the earth will consume almost 25 TW per year. At this rate, unless there is significant alternative energy source, the world will not be able to power itself by 2050. The main flaws with solar power are: 1)Perfecting the nanotechnology of voltaic cells 2)Perfecting the preservation of energy 3)Lowering the cost of the cells by improving technology These projects are a main focus for many engineers, businessmen, and corporations in America, as their production capabilities are limited by their available funds to spend on such projects. These projects need not to be started by the government, but provided additional funding. This eliminates a strong possibility of government spending being inappropriately allocated. Your solution, of government funding its own projects, is inefficient because: 1)Current projects already exist, and merely need funding 2)Less economic benefits 3)Less options for success The solution to alternative energy is an increase in funding, a realistic goal that can be accomplished more subsidizing and government spending.",

Our dependence on foreign oil has negatively affected both our foreign policy and our economy. We must break free of the vice that the middle east has put us in! To do so, we must find our energy hear, in America. There are several plausible and practical solutions. They range from drilling in ANWR to providing more subsidies for alternative fuels. Within that spectrum there are many other options. Coal is a good one. Clean coal technology is making coal much more environmentally friendly. Yes, I know it is a fossil fuel, but until alternative energy becomes more effective, it is a legitimate way to break free of oil in the short term. And the most effective way to get coal is mountain top removal. If we limit the number of mountains it can be done on, this will not ruin the beauty of the region. I agree, it is a sacrifice, but things like this occasionally have to be done if only to provide people with energy.",

            "premise": "First I would just like to thank you for creating this debate topic. So, thank you! I will begin my argumentation by referencing one of the most political and economic minds of all times. Adam Smith. His ideas were the basis for the world economy and the United States' government. He claimed that a government has 3 duties to its people, and no more. 1) Public Institutions 2) Domestic Security 3) Protection from foreign invasion Alternative energy does not fall under any of these three duties that the government holds and should therefore the government shoud not act. Next, you advocate that the market cannot take care of the 'problem' (I will talk about this 'problem' later on.) itself. You only contention for this is that biodiesel is an effective energy source. There is a major problem with this though. BIODIESEL REQUIRES MORE CHEMICAL ENERGY TO MAKE THAN IT CAN PRODUCE MAKING IT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO ITS CAUSE. But you go on further to note that biodiesel is too expensive and is the only reason why it isn't being used. I answer this back with two responses. Biodiesel is cheaper than regular diesel fuel (which is the only thing that biodiesel replaces) meaning that money isn't the problem so that automatically deteriorates your argumentation. But furthermore, biodiesel is ineffective, it clogs up cars, and it takes away from agriculture raising the price of food which would effect the poor and the economy even more. Next with your 'conventioanl wisdom' aruments, they have no basis and there is no analysis on how this 'wisdom' even exists. It does not exist because the rich would not invest money in a risky area. It is the middle class that would make this technological advancement simply for the emperical support that comes along with it. It was the middle class that lead the textile, industrial, and technological advancements of the past, therefore it should be left to these people to do it again. And, you advocate that the government would be the best operative to change the current status quo of oil consumption to alternative fuels, ummmmm..... the government has strong ties to OPEC and other oil agencies that make them the worst possible advocacy group. No matter how much they call for a change in the current energy 'crisis' they never will make this change. This is reason enough to deny the use of the USFG. Next, LEAVE IT UP TO THE MARKET! Smith also created the concept of the 'invisible hand' that drives prices of goods down and creates the highest amount of techonological innovations. A free market also weeds out the bad ideas and further iterates the good ones because people look to what works and buy it. Basic consumer/producer relationship. This is the only way that we would ever be able to find the best source of energy. Finally, you make the assumption that we should divest away from oil and to alternative energy sources. I ask you why? Oil provides more CO2 for plants increasing crop production around the world, it has shown no signs of 'global warming'. We have not seen the effects of burning oil and we will not see them in the future. Thank you! Matt",

You can't have a car run on nuclear power, unless it is from the electrical by-product, which still isn't portable since we have no way to charge a car off of the electrical by-product without an outlet. On the contrary, you can have spare gasoline and a 5 gallon container can fuel a car for 100 miles, even if it is a truck that has horrible mpg. On the area of economic efficiency, a South Carolina estimate showed that the cost to build 2 nuclear reactors would be $9.8 million dollars, as seen in this link, http://www.psr.org.... A 2003 estimate, states that an oil rig would cost $650,000,000. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $838,400,000. If we made 2 of these off shore oil rigs, the price would be $1,676,800,000, that is nearly 1/6 of the price.",

            "premise": "With no arguments to combat, I guess I'll use this speech to basically recap all of my arguments and explaining why I feel I have won this round. I'd like to pull all my arguments through to the last round... For a summation of my arguments: On solar * Silicon (the material used in solar panels) is becoming expensive. This is because the supply is dwindling. When we take this into consideration, we won't be able to make enough solar panels unless we find several more deposits of silicon. I'd also like to bring up that silicon is a main component in many computer chips, forcing any technology (computers, cell phones, video game systems, etc.) to increase in price as well. * Coal is really cheap. Plus, the U.S. has lots of coal deposits; we're actually a leading exporter of coal. Using coal provides no further harm to the economy, as it's status quo. * Solar is excessively expensive. In fact, it's 14 times more expensive, meaning our electricity bills would increase 14 fold... an unreasonable shift in our economy. On wind * Would need more fossil fuel usage. Something has to make turbines and transport them. And those would be factories that use coal/oil and trucks that run on diesel. We're not making the environment any better by using wind * Wind needs to be supplemented with other forms of energy. * Resource shortages are driving up the cost, and no company is gonna foot that bill; it will fall upon consumers' shoulders. * Wind is 4 times more expensive than coal, so it also drives up the cost of electricity. On hydro (I'm going to group them together this time, my opponent can do the same) * Dams require a large amount of money to build, something that's lacking in the current system * Hydro power is inefficient * The oceans massive pressure creates a problem * Won't make a dent in U.S. consumption for decades * Too intermittent And that pretty much covers my last speech. I've referenced it a couple times, and my opponent did in the first speech, \"it\" being the environment. Should my opponent like to say that the extra cost is worth fixing our environment (despite the fact it's not. Our economy is experiencing overwhelming losses in every sector), I'll respond with the fact that the three forms of energy my opponent brought up all replace coal. Nothing on that list replaces oil. Coal only makes up 25 percent of our energy demands [1] {second slide} My opponent's proposed energy forms don't account for 55% of the fossil fuels! The above arguments (from this speech and the last) prove that: 1) Using my opponent's proposed energies will not fix the environment and 2) Using my opponent's proposed energies will not fix the economy. For those reasons, I strongly urge a CON ballot. I'd like to thank my opponent for starting the debate, the readers for taking time to read this, and the voters for reading and taking interest enough to voice their opinions. I'd like to ask the judges to judge only on the merits of the debate and not to bring personal opinions into the matter. Also, when judging, if you would like to leave comments as to why you voted the way you did, they'd be greatly appreciated. Good luck to my opponent, and I await the response...

However, these aren't the only renewable resources. We have more reliable resources, such as water and geothermal energy.\"- PowerPikachu21 I highly doubt there are as reliable, considering the world's energy consumption only consisted of 1/3rd renewable energy [1], . \"By using hydroelectric dams, we can use the machanical energy of water to obtain power. The resovoirs made by these dams helps the environment by creating habitats for animals and plants.\"- PowerPikachu21 \"Geothermal energy is heat energy from the Earth. This can be turned into electricity. The heat pumps associated with Geothermal energy is used to cool houses.\"- PowerPikachu21 Geothermal energy has alot of problems with it. It only works for areas with specific conditions and isn't developed enough to help power the world [1]. \"We can also burn wood into charcoal, which is a renewable version of mined coal. We can rely on renewable resources to be around much longer than coal and oil, making them viable for the far future.\"- Powerpikachu21 Biomass is also very expensive to convert and transport, and is also very inefficient when compared to fossil fuels [2] We can rely on them to be around, yes. But we can't rely on them for energy. The processes to convert renewable resources into energy cost alot of money, and they can only do a third of the job of coal.

            "premise": "My opponent even agrees that ethanol is a bad idea! She however claims sources from sugar and grass, for example, are sufficient to fix the problem. To this, I disagree. Vast amounts of land are needed to create biofuels due to its low energy density, about 0.3 watts per square meter. To switch to full corn crops to fuel our cars, it would take up 37% of the continental United States, if we uses Soy it would take up 1 billion more acres of land then the US even has! We would have to fill up all of the US and more in order to fuel our cars [1]. This problem would remain with all energy sources my opponent lists. We would have to have a lot of grass, we cant just take is from the ecosystem--I mean, that's kinda against this whole green thing. We cannot merely take the algae, there is probably not enough to take from nature and means of retrieval are probably expensive. We would need a lot of water in order to create algae farms, and even then, it will cost a lot, take up space, and be wholly inefficient. The fact is, biofuels should not be subsidized for a simple reason: they are ineffcient and impractical. My opponent claims that she supports these conventional fuel sources (again, if this is true, why should government favor alternatives), and that government will increase efficiency...False. Green energy takes up 3 times more subsidies than conventional fossil fuel energies, but is also about 3 times, sometimes more, expensive [2]. If something is truly efficient, it need not be subsidized. Investors and businessmen would create firms which distribute this energy. The free market provides a profit incentive, which is good at encouraging firms to use the best technology. If a technology is lacking, it loses. Why should the government fund lacking technology? Why back the losers? The free market would naturally move to gas most likely, reducing emissions and energy costs for everyone. My opponent is claiming that the government needs to bring alternative energy to the top, but as I argued, that would be a bad thing. But do subsidies really work? Green energy is inefficient and failing with government intervention. Governments have interfered with other fuel sources, which has promoted inefficient fuels, fuels which harm the enviroment, increase prices, obfuscate the market, and simply make the industry... worse [3]. That, to me, does not sound like efficiency. Let's assume that the government can make someting efficient--which it doesnt. Even if we assume this is true, do I lose? No, not really. Let's say we have two windows. One is cracked, the other is a nice replacement window. You argue lets put plastic over it, it will be stronger. I say, yes, it is stronger. However, this conventional replacement will be stronger than a weak cracked window with some thin cover. Which option sounds superior? My opponent, even if she is wholly correct, needs some foundation as to why increased alternative energy efficiency is the best route to take. If conventional methods are cheap, work, are robust, and save lives, why go to an inefficient source of energy--even if it is slightly more efficient with subsidies? It really doesn't make sense, even if her whole argument is correct, which it isnt. Wait... current energies strain the economy? So ethanol costing more, reducing mileage, and killing people is helping it? Cheap energy which works across the clock, keeps our homes warm (or cold) in different times of the year, creates jobs, is bad? Why give resources to other failing industries. If anything, that will create more of a strain to society, not less. If society uses one efficient energy source, it will benefit everyone. If we use 5, 2 are good 3 are bad, for example, thats better? It is a waste, if you ask me. You are giving resources to industries which fail to produce, and having to give to them is a drain of resources. To give to the sucessful industries, which deliver back energy and efficiency leads to a net gain, not a net loss. Supporting many industries sounds like a good idea, but in fact, it is a drain--not a gift. No demand for something? Wanna know why? Because it sucks. No one will pay extra--ok, almost no one--for heating on their home to be green. There is no demand because it is a failure, it is not a failure because there is no demand. You are confusing cause and effect. Vote CON, because I pretty much knocked out all of Pro's points. 1. http://www.ncpa.org...2. http://online.wsj.com...3. http://www.aei.org...",

            "conclusion": "Alternate energy",
            "premise": "Without breaking down into an argument of Semantics, This is what I thought we were debating \"Wind and solar energy will never surpass or even come close to surpassing the amound of energy created by the grid\" - I had solid proof and evidence to support that this is not the case. However, I will debate upon the new topic you raised \"Yes, my argument is that the amount of Solar/Wind energy used will never surpass the amount of energy created by fossil fuels.\" by a simple play of logic. You have created quite a steep slope for yourself by using the word \"never\" so frivolously - You back yourself into a logical corner that I can easily exploit by saying \"20, 30, 40 years is undeterminate to ensure that Fossil Fuels will NEVER be exceeded by Solar/Wind or even other renewable sources\" - The fact that these technologies are in their infantile stage, and still can generate megawats of electricty, is evidence alone that time is the main barrier to this transition. However to me that is not playing fair. I will discuss and prove to you why this is not the case, as sitting in a defensive position is not my way of debating. You state that power generated by the wind and solar radiation is inconsequential in comparison to the power generated from burning and compressing fossil fuels. I call balderdash! The ideals that are conjured when I imagine this scenario, are similar to the power of an Atomic bomb, as opposed to the power of a spear. Sure, the atomic bomb may deal a LOT of damage, and can be remembered for centuries afterwards for its impact, But statistically, a spear has 'killed' more than any type of Bomb we have - and that is just technically a piece of wood, that was later upgraded to have a metal pointy end. This is due to the fact it is time based (part of my original response in this round), and the fact that it is re-newable. You stab a person, pull it out - and you are good to go again. In comparison, only 2-3 Atomic bombs were created at one time, when they were first made (Weapons of Mass Destruction are not included in this, as this is outside of the scope of these bombs), they have a 'once off then it is gone' policy. It is similar here, we can generate alot more force for alot less effort using fossil fuels; However the resource is finite, and it heavily polutes its' external environment. Solar/Wind - This will be here as long as the Earth and Sun are, when those resources fail - im pretty sure our electric / sail cars not working will be the least of our problems. In your previous round, you made reference to the fact that the world is pushing for a 50/50 split between renewable sources, and fossil fuels. This is only a temporary estimation, it is recommended to push for a 100/0 split between Renewable resources and fossil fuels (the ration is split accordingly RN/FF, where RN = Renewable and FF= Fossil Fuels). The reason for this, is that the ability to generate as much force as we do, is nothing to do with our technology to harness the power, but the explosive force that the FF has latently. We basically do nothing by direct which way that explosive power goes, and happen to call the generated force \"Horsepower\" - which basically means we take the credit for natures 'liquid gunpowder'! On the flip side, all the power we have generated has been through minimal funding but maximum dedication - and has split of into the myriad of power sources we have today (Tidal, Wind, Solar, Nuclear - though this is not a 'Green' source) - That is all us. We have learnt to harness the forces that are everywhere and convert that into energy we can use. Time will improve this, and Time will prove you wrong - of that, I am certain. I look forward to your last round, Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this topic!",

            "discussionTitle": "Nuclear Energy should be the primary alternative energy",
            "conclusion": "Nuclear Energy should be the primary alternative energy",
            "premise": "Nuclear energy should be used as a primary source of energy for many reasons. Costs being one of them. Nuclear energy costs 2 cents per Kilowatt-hour. This is a fraction compared to the other sources of energy. Oil being 18 cents Per KWh and gas being around 8 cents Per kWh. Over time nuclear energy proves to be much less expensive and more practical. Safety might be more of the controversial subjects when it comes to nuclear power. The problem is when fission occurs it is very difficult to stop. With today's technology the chance of a melt down is around .00026% for the average reactor life. If that meltdown is to occur it would be contained. All modern reactors have a containment building. A large dome completely surrounding the reactor. The containment consist of many feet of concrete and are able to withstand a collision with a fully loaded passenger airliner. Nuclear energy is a declared green energy, the nuclear fission produces two byproducts. One being steam and the other nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is safely contained in canisters that do not allow any radiation or leakage of the waste to reach the outside. In other words nuclear waste does not harm the environment in anyway. Also nuclear waste is can be recycled through a reactor as plutonium, this reduces the amount of nuclear waste as a byproduct. Other energies like fossil-fuel energies produce tons of Co2. Coal-fire energy is extremely dangerous to the environment and is harming it now. The strip mining that is needed for coal causes devastation to landscapes. Coal fire plants use tons and tons of coal per day. While nuclear reactors use fuel rods which consume only a few uranium pellets every 30 years. The numbers between the two energies just do not compare. Other alternative energies don't contend with nuclear power when it comes to being used on a large scale. Nuclear power plants take a few hundred acres to produce its typical 1,000 megawatts per hour. To equal one reactor you would need around 2400 turbines and 60,000 acres and of coarse wind is not always blowing. On average, wind turbines are working at full potential 25% of the time. And a nuclear reactor is always producing energy. To be realistic you would have to quadruple the acres and turbines to equal a reactor. So the numbers would be 9,800 turbines and 240,000 acres. To put it another way 240,000 acres is 375 square miles. And the square miles needed for a nuclear reactor is 2 . This is 1/187.5 fraction. For solar panels to match one reactor, the land needed would be around 5,000 acres. And again solar panels only reach peak energy levels 25% of the time. And again you would have to quadruple 5,000 acres. This would be 20,000 acres of land needed to reach 1000 megawatts per hour. This is a 1/15 fraction. Hydro electric power is just plain unfriendly to the environment. On one side of a dam a river is made much more shallow. The other side of the dam a reservoir is created and thousands of acres of land is flooded, forcing the natural habitat out. Clearly, by the evidence that I have given there is no reason not to use nuclear energy as a primary energy.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels.",
            "premise": "1) \"I did not argue that the world would run out of oil at the year 2057. I argued that there would be an oil depletion at the year 2057 based off of the Hubbert Peak Theory.\" I understand the point you think you're making here, but my original contention still holds and you did not refute it simply by restating your argument from Round 2: we have no idea the magnitude of the \"Hubbert Peak\", nor can we even estimate when we might reach that peak with any degree of accuracy, which you yourself note here by writing: \" It is true that we have no true idea of how much crude oil the world holds\". Therefore it would seem to most people that you have conceded this particular argument based on your own admission that you actually have no idea the magnitude of our oil reserves and can no more make an accurate prediction of when we might run out of oil than a homeless man on a street corner - because you both are simply guessing. Another interesting tidbit for you, Hubbert using his model in 1974 predicted that the world would run out of oil by 1995, which I think both you and I can agree was wildly inaccurate, much like the predictions you are making now (1). Indeed, this entire argument assumes we actually reach the Hubbert Peak, as both you and Hubbert himself have neglected to mention artificial ways of producing oil (liquid hydrocarbons) from kerogen rich oil shale (2). Either way, your point has been refuted regardless of whether or not you have chosen to acknowledge it. 2) \"With enough oil reserves to meet our demands, we would still be dependent on other nations through the refining process.\" False. We have upgraded existing refineries' capacities by up to 300,000 barrels per year - the equivalent of adding one new, modern refinery per year (3). Naturally assuming this trend is accelerated by increases in supply, your point is fallacious and misleading. Furthermore, you did not refute my original contention. Therefore, you have conceded this point. 3) \"If we are once again cut off from a source of fuel like we were in the 1973 oil crisis, the preparation and drilling of these reserves would take a lot of time and money. Assuming the reserves were not set up for the commercial pumping of oil.\" We are not assuming anything. I am arguing that we have enough oil within the regions of the United States to meet our current and future demands. I have provided more than enough evidence to support this. You have acknowledged the validity of my statement by instead changing your argument to state that it would \"take too long\" to get the oil. Most would consider this improper conduct in a debate as you are changing the frame of your argument in the last round - you need remember that we are simply arguing quantities of oil. Therefore, you have conceded this point by nature of changing the frame of your argument to an irrelevant position. 4) \"One example was the solar panels and that \"we would need to mine extensively for silicon and phosphorus\". There is a problem with this statement because silicon is not mined, but manufactured from silica, wood, charcoal, and coal. Silica on the other hand one of the most abundant mineral found on the Earth's crust. It is commonly found as sand or quartz. Coal on the other hand is mined, but is a fossil fuel. We earlier defined; \"Alternative fuels are fuels that are other substances other than the conventional fossil fuels\". Coal which is an ingredient of silicone used to make solar panels is a conventional fossil fuel and therefore this example does not apply.\" Your argument for the environmental positives of solar panels is that we can mine silica (indeed it must be mined as it is most often found in ores, not in \"sand\"), cut down forests (wood too must be harvested commercially), and obtain silica from coal with little to no damage to environment relative to burning fossil fuels. This is an absolutely absurd argument to make. You also completely ignored that point that we still would need to mine for phosphorus, which is one of the most volatile minerals found on Earth in terms of potential for environmental damage. 5) \"Though it is impossible to remove all vegetation within the dam's path, this methane by product can be decreased by better planning of the water flow path and clearing of flood areas.\" You completely missed the point here. \"Clearing\" flood areas still removes vast areas of vegetation, which then decays, which then releases Methane - the most potent greenhouse gas man is capable of emitting on a large scale. Therefore my original point still stands, alternative fuels are no more environmentally conscientious than fossil fuels - they're simply portrayed that way because it's commercially beneficial for corporations to convince you that progress has been made. 6) \"Diesel powered cars tend to have a better fuel economy by 20-40% and produce less greenhouse gases.\" Of the most fuel efficient cars in the world, the top 6 rely on gasoline (read fossil fuels). Diesel comes in at number 7 (4). Indeed, of the Top 10 most fuel efficient cars in the world, only 2 are diesel. I would say you need to work on your facts. 7) \"Bio diesel average $0.28 per gallon with the assumption that the used oil was free.\" Not only do biofuels emit much more greenhouse gases than traditional fossil fuels (5), they also cost significantly more than any fuel made from crude oil (6). It would seem your either willfully citing made up \"facts\" that you have no sources for, or your simply ignorant of the true cost behind much of what you seem to be promoting. Either way, your facts have completely decimated your own argument by removing any credibility you might have had. ----------------------------- Conclusion: My opponent initially offered the common and popular arguments supporting a change to alternative fuels. However, when confronted with the facts he changed the frame of his arguments and proceeded to straw man. Finally when that didn't work, he resorted to simply making up facts for which he has no sources. In conclusion, my opponent failed to effectively refute my contentions, failed to provide evidence affirming the resolution as was his duty, and failed to address his opponents arguments. For these reasons I urge a vote for the Pro. http://en.wikipedia.org... (1) http://en.wikipedia.org... (2) http://www.politifact.com... (3) http://www.thedailygreen.com...

Moreover, Con killed the topic, which might have otherwise been accepted by someone who could explain why the practice of ignoring the total costs of alternative energy is so widely ignored.

            "premise": "Don't you have a rule that when people insult you they instantly lose? I expect your resignation next round. (not really) A fuel that can replace gasoline in its entirety forever- electric energy. Preferably electric energy derived from solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, wave, tidal energy sources. However, even if derived from just coal it actually ends up putting less pollution into the atmosphere (still). * You misapprehend the battery comment. We make hydrogen by splitting water. By the second law of thermodynamics the energy in the hydrogen is necessarily less than the energy we used to split the water. That doesn't make it a fuel. That makes it an energy storage substance. Other than from other energy sources (electric, natural gas) where do we get hydrogen? * Green energy, renewable energies and carbon neutral energies are all needed to not only reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, foreign energy sources, but also needed to prevent and slow the progress of global warming and climate change. * \"Primarily right now hydrogen is produced through reformation of methane\" -- You cannot scale that. It can be done, but cannot be scaled to any degree. Methane is a fossil fuel, one which we have about 50 years worth remaining and certainly cannot be a permanent replacement. That process produces twice as much CO2 as hydrogen (by the chemistry). * Regardless of the manner of electrolysis the end result is the same, less energy than it took to make is in the resulting product. That's just basic physics. For the sake of argument, I'll let you say you have perfectly efficient electrolysis, which is to say you have exactly as much energy in the hydrogen as you used on the water. -- That's a glorified battery! * Unlike a real battery however, you have no ability to store more energy. Battery technology has high potentials to store far more energy than we currently have in a tank of gas. Supercapacitors, better materials, faster charges, new technology... the possibility of innovation here is quite large. Batteries can be improved. The recharge time has been improved on a Toshiba batter. 90% in five minutes. http://www.dailytech.com... Cheap Li-ion batteries: http://www.popularmechanics.com... Nanotech advancement 10x battery life: http://www.news.com... And potentials to advance completely away from batteries to capacitors. http://www.spectrum.ieee.org... We are dealing with storing energy in either chemical form or in the electric field of a capacitor. That's pretty limitless and allows for massive amounts of innovation. * Being messy and tiny and leaky is far is not discredited by your comment of it being the \"cleanest\". Frankly, it's not. To get the hydrogen you're using actual energy. Just because it's a fairly green battery doesn't mean it's green energy. If you filled a building filled with hydrogen rupture it it might well just leave a giant hole in the ground if anything sparks. * We used the water to make hydrogen. The fact that hydrogen burns into water again is just confirming what I said in my intro... glorified battery. * I ignored the embrittle problem and certain other problems as they are simply small technological hurdles. I think however, the fact that it leaks all the time (think a 2-day old helium balloon) is problematic. * You cannot hijack the natural gas infrastructure. First, it will leak! Secondly, we use that for natural gas! My stove isn't set to run on a hydrogen and natural gas mix. My water heater, dryer, my heater they aren't either. Am I to forgo my use of natural gas in order to have leaky hydrogen to power a car which cannot pressurize the gas itself? We only have so much natural gas, and that's only while we're using it at the rates we're using it. Power cars with the stuff would drop our amount of natural gas and drive up the price. And we'd end up with electrolysis (which scales). * If you wanted to convert cars over to run on natural gas, that is something to be independently discussed. As is, you're arguing that one gas is pretty much another. And though we currently use natural gas in things made for natural gas. * Building the infrastructure is an acceptable ideas. Though, here we are faced with a catch-22. Do we build the infrastructure first or the cars first? How much infrastructure do we produce before the cars and who foots the bill if it doesn't work? Though, I assume that will be overcome. * Not a hazmat team to deal with a crash, but rather a well trained group of firefighters who know where they should not use the jaws of life to cut you out of that? How to detect a hydrogen leak, and what the risks are involved when different parts rupture or the car catches on fire. * I've seen them at car-shows but other than that I've seen them nowhere. * I do not typify the \"non-scientific liberal reaction to hydrogen\" -- the fact of the matter is that hydrogen has a large amount of following within the liberal community. My objection however is simply a scientific understanding that hydrogen is just a glorified battery and not a very good one at that. * Converting the power grid to carbon neutral profile is certainly a requirement to moving forward with energy today. Global warming is not our friend. We need to switch to carbon neutral sources of power (hydrogen is not a source) sooner rather than later. * I am strongly pro-nuclear. I am pro-science and the science behind nuclear is sound. * I never advocated ethanol, at least not corn ethanol. Sugar ethanol works well as it's a biproduct and works out quite effectively and doesn't replace food. * I said 2nd law because that's what prevented it. 0,1,3 weren't mentioned as they weren't needed. -- My solution (which isn't needed for the topic) is plug in hybrid cars, which transition to electric as the technology does. * The EV1 wasn't a failure, GM just recalled all the cars and forcibly scrapped the project (they didn't want politicians forcing them to make electric cars), see \"Who Killed the Electric Car\". Further, there are cars being put out all the time. Tesla Roadster - http://www.topspeed.com... There is massive potential for increases in technology here, whereas you're scrambling with \"just build the infrastructure\" or \"we'll use this fossil fuel instead. Plug-in hybrids and electric cars are on the road today. * For quick charge comment see Toshiba. Further, supercapacitors would have the ability to charge in a few seconds (you don't want to do that/might as well be lightning). * Hydrogen has less energy density than gasoline. Pure liquid hydrogen has less hydrogen than gasoline (the molecules pack the energy better than simple pressurization). * There's no room for advancement when you're dealing with chemicals. But, take a look at cell-phones. The charge time, the battery technology, the rather continual and gradual improvement. That's what we need in a car technology. Hydrogen has nothing behind it, and it can't scale. --- Your calculations about the \"price per gallon\" were flawed. The wikipedia page on the Toyota Prius (which I assume you used) didn't say the energy use was 100kwh. Rather it was saying the current limit to drive range was 7 miles in all electric mode up-bounded by the speed of 100 kilometers per hour. The range limit is low because batteries aren't designed for electric only mode and this is not a plug-in or electric model. The batteries only store about 1.3 kwh of power. Which by the way, works out to 0.185 kilowatt / mile or 2.8 cents a mile. That's 37% less than gasoline at $3.00 or $1.11 dollars a gallon.",

            "premise": "This sight is scientific fact about hydrogen and there is not a single scientist in the world that will even think of challenging it because it is a matter of the laws of nature and physics. Hydrogen will never be used as an alternative large scale fuel source. You are being fed a bunch of lies about Hydrogen and it's potential as an alternative fuel source. I defy anyone who reads this link to prove me wrong by proving the information in this report is incorrect. http://mb-soft.com... Hydrogen is an experiment, hydrogen is not a viable cost effective energy source and it will not be one in 5 10 or even 20 years. The price for a car with a fuel cell is anywhere from $70,000 to $150,000 dollars depending on the size of the fuel tank for the hydrogen. They get anywhere from 60 to 250 miles to the tank full depending on whether or not you have a lead foot. I hope every one reads this link, it will be a real eye opener for those who think Hydrogen is a viable large scale fuel source. All of the funding in the world will never make hydrogen cost effective unless you can change mother nature and the laws of physics. Oxygen power: I read up on this and there is some hope here, it makes fuel mileage increases possible but in no way can it be used without gasoline and it only works with and is designed for diesel and gasoline engines and does not reduce pollution. http://ezinearticles.com... \"Are you talking 8 years maximum with charging the battery, or without?\" One would assume if one bought a hybrid or all electric car they would use it and therefore have to charge the battery when it ran low after being used. Ether way once you buy it, the warranty starts to tick, whether or not you use it is irrelevant. Infrastructure: I was not referring to the roads that cars drive on. I was referring to the filling stations that would have to be built to deliver compressed gases such as hydrogen to the cars. If you refer back to my first link you will get an idea of the complexities involved with this and the inherent catastrophic dangers that go with compressed gases. Not to mention the astronomical costs that go with it. \"Also, if you need to switch batteries or get rid of yours, local/state governments can build places similar to wherever regular batteries are disposed of, and have people get rid of them there.\" First of all, your assumption that everyone is going to do the right thing and turn the batteries in instead of dumping the acid out and scraping it for the metal is quite naive. At my work place, we have three large air conditioners. Thieves have twice cut the condensing coils out of them risking jail time just to turn the metal in to make a few bucks. And then of course your assumption that govt is just going to pay for everything. There are no solar powered commercially available cars or trucks or anything available for sale. Still decades away from that technology. I have already explained hydro and wind power. What about the rest of the world that can't use this? I really don't think you understand anything about alternative fuel sources and how soon they will be available on a large scale. Your statement, \"It wont take that long \" is both mind boggling and without any source to back that statement up. \"Since most countries are suited for some sort of alternative fuel, they wont be \"dying by the millions\" Oh right, they will just pull some energy source out of their a##, they don't have anything to worry about. \"With proper funding they will be OK. My final point. I don't think you understand that you are being lied to about these dooms day predictions. Fossil fuels are and will continue to be the major fuel source for this planet for at least the next 50 years as I have proven with all of my evidence. Yet Al Gore, The fanatic environmentalists want to cut production of fossil fuels as the population grows and that will effect the poorest of the poor the worst. If you live in a third world country your outlook is pretty bad if they get their way. Millions will die. Again it is constantly drilled into everyone's head daily that this planet is doomed if we don't cut the use of dramatically or completely eliminate fossil fuels in the next twenty years. The planet is doomed or you are being lied to and the greatest hoax on man kind is being played out before your very eyes. Unfortunately Millions will die under the disguise of saving the planet and I can assure you that this will happen if fossil fuel production is cut or eliminated without a viable fuel source to replace it. All the funding in the world will not make this possible in twenty years.",

            "premise": "Well, I'm assuming first round is for arguments.1) Fossil fuels are a highly efficient energy source that power a majority of the world.Due to the fact that fossil fuels are easily combustible and have a high calorific value, it's one of the most efficient energy sources in the world. [1] It has the highest energy output levels bIt's also the cheapest form of energy in the world as shown in the graph below. [2] Engines can be run on rather small amounts of gas. For example, cars can be taken tens of miles on a couple gallons, because the engine is powered by exploding gas farts in the cylinders. That's kind of a funny way of saying it, but really, gas ignites and powers machines very easily.2) Fossil fuels are highly reliable.This is what I mean. Every time you light a bucket of gas on fire, that thing ignites on fire. If you ignite gas in a cylinder, that gas will explode.If you put up a windmill Colorado Springs, you might get 1 kilowatt of energy per year.Since I'm using windmills as an example, I should point out that it's actually one of the least reliable forms of alternative energy known to man. You have to have the right wind speeds to operate with an 11 mile per gap to work with for effective energy production. [3] As far as other forms of energy go, we know solar energy would only work in the UK for three days out of the year, and Arizona would get nothing out of hydro energy.While it's possible that some of these alternative energies might work sometimes in these areas, it's impossible to say that we would have energy year round. Fossil fuels are the most reliable form of energy.3) Nuclear energy has large disadvantages.Nuclear energy is great as an energy substitute as far as energy output and cost go. However, it has a huge drawback, which is nuclear waste.Nuclear energy uses radioactive materials to boil water. But these radioactive materials eventually decay past the point of use. When this happens, we have to find a place to put it. If you start to use nuclear energy for everyone in the world, we would have plenty of power, but storing that waste would be a nightmare.If just a little plutonium leaks out of a storage tank due to natural wear on the storage unit and that plutonium gets into water, that piece of plutonium could easily poison a city. Just specks of plutonium can kill anyone who inhales or ingests them. [4]So the alternative energy sources so far are either deadly or unreliable and inefficient.Sources:[1] http://www.conserve-energy-future.com...[2] http://www.theenergycollective.com...[3] http://www.wind-power-program.com...[4] http://www.world-nuclear.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels",
            "conclusion": "the government should interevene in the transition to alternative fuels",
            "premise": "My opponents argument is essentially this: 1. We need \u2018green\u2019 energy 2. Governments will lead us down a greener path faster 3. Therefore, we need government intervention in order for green energy to reign supreme However, the basic premises behind this argument are fatally flawed. 1. We need \u2018green\u2019 energy This is the basic foundation behind my opponents assertion. Conventional methods of energy (fossil fuels, nuclear) are the \u2018dirty\u2019 evil energy sources whereas the alternative energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) being efficient alternatives. Further, her argument relies on the fact that these pollutants are actually going to significantly harm the environment. Lets talk about these conventional sources. Natural Gas: Natural Gas is the second most clean conventional energy source (behind Nuclear). Natural Gas emits 117,000 pounds of CO2 emissions per btu of energy, compared to oil (164,000) and Coal (208,000). Further, natural gas is much more efficient than coal. 90% of natural gas produced is energy used by the public, whereas the number for other conventional forms of energy is about 30%. The market, at this stage, is moving towards Natural Gas. Even assuming that climate change and pollution is a major issue, a switch from coal to gas will lead to a huge reduction in pollution [1]. The Wall Street Journal writes, \u201cU.S. carbon-dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically in recent years, in large part because the country is making more electricity with natural gas instead of coal. Energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is widely believed to contribute to global warming, have fallen 12% between 2005 and 2012 \u2026 many experts believe the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation has been the biggest factor [in CO2 emission reduction].\u201d[2] Coal: Coal is the dirtiest form of energy which is commonly used, however, the fact is that coal actually works to save lives in aggregate, not decrease longevity. Energy is one of the most important things humans have. It gives us warmth, it gives us cold, it gives us electricity, computers, phones, cooking equipment, etc. For poor people, energy is a matter of life and death. The cheaper it is, the more access these people have, and the longer lives they live. The question is whether or not coal\u2019s pollution factor outweighs the health benefits of pollution. Researchers have found that if we take coal out of the energy equation, 150,000 people would die--for the government to restrict coal (a form of supporting alternative energy) and then promote expensive alternatives would lead to deaths, and a destruction of human life--not benefiting it. Another study argues that coal prevents 14,000-15,000 premature deaths in the US each year. Further, in countries with more energy consumption per capita (increases if energy is cheaper), human development is much higher [3]. Nuclear: Nuclear power is the cleanest, and one of the cheapest, forms of energy on the planet, and is considered \u2018conventional\u2019. In the United States, Nuclear was cheaper than all the other common energy types, including one of the cheapest, coal. Oh, and Gas is also pretty cheap too [4]. The fact is, if the government should be involved in anything, it should be nuclear. Nuclear is clean, cheap, and efficient. In fact, it is seen by many environmentalists that Nuclear is the energy source of the future, it is the way to prevent \u2018climate change\u2019. Nuclear is superior because renewable energy is intermittent: we will need a backup power plant to power us when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn\u2019t blowing. A few options: use batteries, inefficient and not \u2018green\u2019 for disposal, or another power plant, probably natural gas or coal. In either scenario, alternative energies will not be able to sustain us alone. As Mark Perry writes, \u201cTo use more wind and solar increases the need for backup power, and the associated emissions that come with it will largely cancel out any emissions savings from renewables.\u201d[5] Nuclear, on the other hand, is always working as long as it is being run properly. It could easily provide for all of our energy needs. Also, James Hansen--known for his rampant environmentalist fervor--co-authored a study saying that nuclear is ESSENTIAL to our future, and that it has saved 1.8 million lives [6]. Solar: As stated, solar is an intermittent source of energy, and when the sun isn't shining, the carbon savings will be washed out by the very cheap, reliable, conventional energy source having to fill in the gaps. Not to mention, it costs a lot. Solar power costs 20 cents per killowatt hour, compared to about two cents for coal [7]. Remember what I said? Expensive energy kills poor people. Wind: There is zero scientific proof that wind reduces CO2 emissions, according to the Ways and Means committee. They argue that CO2 savings will be minimal, and will look like nothing compared to the conventional nuclear power option [8]. Hydro: The fact is, hydroelectric power is dirty. Newscientist refutes hydropower\u2019s fans, saying \u201cHydroelectric dams produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, and in some cases produce more of these greenhouse gases than power plants running on fossil fuels,\u201d[9]. 2. Governments need to make us green! This premise is also flawed--the fact is, the free market will opt for the most efficient energy source. At this point, natural gas is the favored option--and as stated, it is cheap and clean. It will increase life spans, keep energy cheap, and \u2018save the planet\u2019, if you like that sort of thing. And in the foreseeable future, it is likely that nuclear will emerge as a key player in energy. And, thats a good thing. But this premise begs the question--do we even want to go green? The simple fact is, carbon dioxide is beneficial to the biosphere, and is a necessary component to life [10]. Further, there is significant peer reviewed evidence that climate change will not harm humanity, and in fact may benefit our existence [11]. There is even literature arguing that the link between CO2 and temperature is weak, exaggerated, or even nonexistent [12]. Other than the fact conventional \u2018pollutants\u2019 are likely beneficial with no strong proof of harm, overall air pollution in the United States is falling, and is expected to continue decreasing [13]. Therefore, this premise, too, is flawed. 3. Therefore, government needs to support alternative energy I deduce that this conclusion is false based on my above reasoning. Alternative energy sources are expensive and inefficient, whereas conventional sources are cheap, economically viable, and in many cases, clean. 1. http://www.aga.org... 2. http://online.wsj.com... 3. https://www.advancedenergyforlife.com... 4. http://www.nei.org... 5. http://news.investors.com... 6. http://blogs.scientificamerican.com... 7. http://www.businessinsider.com... 8. http://waysandmeans.house.gov... 9. http://www.newscientist.com... 10. http://www.co2science.org... 11. http://www.co2science.org... 12. http://www.co2science.org... 13. http://www.ncpa.org...",

It is only then after general adoption, that the inferior product will improve to the point at which it is equal to the product it is replacing. The fact is that as long as there are large scale supplies of fossil fuels available, and those supplies are plentiful enough to be affordable, consumers will be unwilling to accept the inferior performance they will get from electric cars, or the inferior comfort of smaller vehicles. The EU, with a far superior public transportation system is a bad comparison with the United States, as it is likely that the price at which Americans would accept the same sort of compromises is much higher, and no amount of environmental concern or preaching about alternative energy will generate the political capital to force them to if they don\u2019t have to. Furthermore, what the opposition ignores in this argument is that it is often the poor who will suffer the most from artificially high fuel prices. Raising prices will increasingly make driving a luxury good, limiting the mobility of low income workers. This will both reduce their standard of living (i.e. ability to take vacations) and reduce their options for work and therefore for advancement.",

            "premise": "why the government should intervene more with alternative fuel. people say the market will take care of itself. in the end, it will. but at what cost in the mean time? we should act now because we'll look back and see how much we've wasted on gasoline. companies say they can make alternative biodesial fuels for a dollar a gallon. (using algae farms, or any organic material using bacteria to make ethanol from hte cellulose material, switch grass and other things more entergy intensive than corn etc.. and exemplified by brazil etc who are energy dependant right now from gas) but, there's a catch 22 occuring. comanyies make alternative companies but often must put operations on hold. why? because there's no demand. the consumers who make demand say there's no supply. who can afford as a consumer to buy altnernative vehicles? the richer. does the rising prices right now of gasoline hurt them? not as much so they don't buy. but, even if they bought cars sometimes as they are now, there's still not much there in way of an infrastructure for the supply side. the rich won't start buying more until it really starting hurting them. the poor won't do it cause they can't. the middle won't do it, probaly for the same reason. it's conventional wisdom that the rich are the ones who start these new technologies... and the conventional wisdom is probably true here too. but, unlike many situations with conventinoal wisdom... for altrnernative fuel, waiting till the rich start teh technology isn't in the best interest of the country right now. that's because... for many other things, like buying a DVD player... fuel isn't something that's simply a perk as much, and isn't such a regular and substantial cost for the consumer. it has a noticable affect on the economy. fuel is the opposite. while we're waiting for the rich to convert, what's happening? in the mean time, the poorer are spending their money on gas, or not being as productive as they could with cheaper gas or some gas at all. the middle class largely too. consider all that money they're spending on that, when they could be spending on an array of other things. all that money could have been going to the economy at large, instead of the pockets and costs of a few. (and foreignors, which is a major concern in and of itself) to make it more of a practical example. say a new biodesial machine at a gas station costs fifty thousand. all that money that the poorer are wasting right now would have been more than enough to either subsidize or lend to that station. (you could lend the money to them... and ensur ethey make a tidy profit before they ever have to pay it back, if ever considering there's a risk they might not make money) if we invested in them as a government then, the effects would be much sooner, and the poorer and middle class would save more, and it'd be a boon to the economy. (plus all the jobs involved with the transitioning infrastructure) there'd be so much savings, you could even lend or subsidize biodisal plants too, though it'd probably not be needed for them. government intervention is the way to break the catch 22 sooner when it'll make a difference for hte economy, than later when we'll look back and see all that wealth that has been squandered.",

            "conclusion": "The United States federal government should substantally increase alternative energy incentives",
            "premise": "1. Fossil fuels are a finite resource. According to the BBC on June 29, 2010, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the recession is causing even West Virginia coal miners to re-think status quo fuels. 2. Traditional renewable energy is insufficient to meet America's energy needs. According to Dr. Daniel LaGatta on February 16, 2010, the U.S. cannot meet its energy needs by 2035 without at least 40 new nuclear plants. 3. Some form of nuclear power is inevitable. According to the Texas Tribune on June 28, 2010, more than $18 billion is currently being spent on developing nuclear power plants, and Congress is considering adding another $9 billion. A review done by the Department of Energy in 2008 found that there are 108 nuclear plants in operation in the U.S. 4. Status quo nuclear technologies create thousands of tons of radioactive waste. According to National Geographic in 2002, there is currently 52,000 tons of highly toxic waste in the U.S. 5. Despite his promise to scrub the project, President Obama recently lost a lawsuit challenging the current plan to store the waste in Yucca Mountain in Nevada. According to the New York Times on June 29, 2010, although the Yucca plan still faces significant hurdles, it is still highly likely that the project will continue. 6. Unfortunately, the Yucca Mountain area contains an active volcano range. According to the New Scientist in 2002, if a volcano were to erupt, the magma would burst into the storage tunnels underneath the facility, sending radioactive magma several miles into the sky. 7. A nuclear volcano would have devastating consequences. According to Dr. David Camarow, if a volcano near Yucca Mountain were to errupt, it would contaminate and sterilize the entire biosphere. Even if the risk is extremely low, we cannot risk the survival of the human race. 8. Thus I present the following plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase alternative energy incentives by funding the development of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR). 9. The IFR is an entirely different form of nuclear power. According to Dr. George Stanford in 2001, the IFR uses spent nuclear waste as fuel. This will allow the IFR to burn waste and old decommissioned nuclear warheads, and prevent the need to store waste in Yucca Mountain. 10. The IFR was a pilot project terminated in 1994, despite being only three years away from completion. According to Dr. George Stanford in 2001, the IFR is a proven technology, but only needs funding to complete the prototype. Once the prototype is complete, construction can being on a mass scale, replacing the use of traditional nuclear power. 11. There are several other advantages to implementing IFR technology. According to the London Guardian in 2008, more than 1 billion people have insufficient water supplies, causing millions of deaths each year and millions of dollars of drought damage in the United States. However, according to Dr. Robert Pfeffer in 2001, a small nuclear power plant could create millions of gallons of fresh water as a by-product of the cooling process. 12. Although there are some signs of recovery, the economic recession is still continuing. According to the American Council on Global Nuclear Competitiveness in 2006, nuclear power can generate billions of dollars of economic growth and thousands of high paying jobs would be created in the U.S. 13. Another factor in prolonging the recession is the loss of cheap energy. However, according to Dr. James Hylko in 2008, nuclear power is one of the most cost effective forms of energy at 1.6 cents per kilowatt hour.",

            "premise": "Okay so, I'm gonna run my PF case, since I didn't get to today on the actual tournament. Nuclear Energy needs to be substantially increased in the United States of America, heres why. 1.Relatively environmentally friendly 2.Economically Sound 3.Safe 1.Nuclear Power plants are the only power source capable of giving energy to people on a massive scale, while still not having major harmful environmental effects like coal and natural gas do. As Patrick Moore, the co-founder of the environmental group Greenpeace describes, \"\" Times have changed. I now realize nuclear energy is the only nongreenhouse-gas-emitting power source that can effectively replace fossil fuels and satisfy growing demand for energy.\" Unlike nuclear energy, Burning fossil fuels releases an abundance of elements into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy, to the contrary, fully contains all of its byproduct in the form of used nuclear fuel. Such waste is safely managed throughout the world in countries like France, Finland, and Japan. 1.Nuclear Power plants are also cost-efficient and create jobs, making them the most economically sound option for our 21st century power source. As Business Wire explains \"During construction, a nuclear plant will provide 2,500 jobs. The average operating plant employs 400-700 people, and jobs at these plants pay substantially more than average jobs in the local area.\" Nuclear power also saves money, because even after the fuel is used, it can still be recycled. The French, Japanese, and British all recycle their used nuclear fuel. Using that method, America can recycle its 58,000 tons of used fuel stored across the nation to power every U.S. household for 12 years. MIT performed a study in 2003, and found that when the construction of the plant is factored in, along with general running costs, nuclear power runs at the price of 4.2 cents per kilowatt an hour. Coal power also had the price of 4.2 cents, and gas ran at the price of 5.8. Also, Considering that our country is spending $700 billion a year on imported oil, it would be foolish not to make maximum use of all U.S. energy resources. With advanced technologies, energy conservation and improvements in energy efficiency, the United States could move within reach of total energy independence. - As explained by Professor John Mann of University of Illinois 3.My partner and I also support nuclear power because we find that nuclear power is safe for widespread growth throughout the country. First off, the waste that is produced from nuclear power plants can effectively be managed, through the usage of storage facilities in remote locations such as Yucca Mountain, or the Waste Isolation Plant in Carlsbad New Mexico. The second location is actively receiving transuranic waste from across the country in a highly secure manner. Nuclear waste has been transported on roads and railways worldwide for years without a significant incident. More than 20 million packages with radioactive materials are transported globally each year--3 million of them in the United States. Since 1971, more than 20,000 shipments of spent fuel and high-level waste have been trans-ported more than 18 million miles without inci-dentThis is only the beginning, as nuclear power grows, so will nuclear waste depositories, in the most remote spots in America. There is also a lot of fear with nuclear power plants regarding their release of radiation into the environment around it. However, this is a completely unfounded claim, as the Heritage Foundation explains. \"Indeed, less than 1 percent of the public's exposure to radiation comes from nuclear power plants. The average American is exposed to 360 millirem of radiation a year. About 83 percent (300 millirem) of this annual radiation dose comes from natural sources, such as cosmic rays, uranium in the Earth's crust, and radon gas in the atmosphere. Most of the rest comes from medical procedures such as X-rays, and about 3 percent (11 millirem) comes from consumer products. \" The third major fear with nuclear power is that the power plants could fall victim to terrorist attacks, leading to a disaster. But here are the facts, The United States has 104 commercial nuclear power plants, and there are 446 worldwide. Not one has fallen victim to a successful terrorist attack. Even a large passenger jet, such those that were used in the terrorist attacks of 9/11, would not be able to destroy a nuclear reactor. The Brookings Institution explains that \"U.S. nuclear power plants, which are subject to both federal and international regulation, are designed to withstand extreme events and are among the sturdiest and most impenetrable structures on the planet\u2014second only to nuclear bunkers.\" Speaking of 9/11, since then, a good $1.2 billion has been spent making sure that nuclear power plants are even more secure, outfitting them with bulletproof glass, and 60% more security guards. These days, nuclear power plants go through drills where commandos attempt to raid the facility, in order to regularly lessen the possibility of a security breach, which is quite low, considering that states post state troopers and the national guard to protect nuclear power plants, and the US military is standing by. Nuclear power is safe for the environment, for the people that work in it, and for the nation. So to summarize, its pretty good for the environment in that it is better than any of the alternatives that are able to produce at such a level. It would help the economy by providing for the creation of jobs, and cheaper than the alternatives. Finally, nuclear energy is safe because of the plans we have to store waste, and the very strong safety measures that are taken to protect plants.",

            "conclusion": "Nuclear Energy Is Beneficial to Society",
            "premise": "I would like to thank diddleysquat for accepting this debate. My first argument is going to be rather short, simply making a case for nuclear energy. I will be more in depth when I respond to con's objections and refutations. Amount Nuclear energy represents the longest-lasting, uninterrupted source of power the world has. Fossil fuels are fast running out and renewables need backup generators to run when energy is not being created. \"According to the NEA, identified uranium resources total 5.5 million metric tons, and an additional 10.5 million metric tons remain undiscovered - a roughly 230-year supply at today's consumption rate in total. Further exploration and improvements in extraction technology are likely to at least double this estimate over time.\" Of current known reserves, that's 230 years.[1] On top of that, other sources of uranium (such as seawater) and more efficiently built power points could dramatically raise that already large number. \"...fuel-recycling fast-breeder reactors, which generate more fuel than they consume, would use less than 1 percent of the uranium needed for current LWRs.\" This means that these plants would run out of the current supply of uranium in 30000 years.[1] Even further, uranium is only one potential ore. Take thorium, for example. The Thorium Energy Alliance says, \"There is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 10,000 years.\" Further, protactinium, radium, polonium, lead, bismuth, and radon could all be used as well.[2][3] What this adds up to is a tremendous supply of energy not just for today, but for the unknown demands of tomorrow. Between the different ores (many have multiple isotopes), it may be so that, at current energy consumption, we could sustain ourselves for 1 million years on nuclear fission reactions alone. Nuclear energy clearly has much greater reserves than fossil fuels, and energy that is always available, unlike renewables. Efficiency Not only is the amount of nuclear energy enormous, the way it is used is more efficient than other forms of energy. For example, take power plant capacity factors. This considers actual energy production as a percentage of potential energy production at full capacity- \"Nuclear energy facilities generate electricity 24/7 at an 86 percent capacity factor. This is more efficient than other types of energy - combined-cycle natural gas, with a 56 percent capacity factor; coal-fired at 55 percent; and wind at 31 percent.\" In other words, nuclear power plants produce energy more of the time than other forms of energy.[4] Further, let's now consider cost. Nuclear energy, per unit of energy, is the cheapest energy option that the world has. \"\"Production costs at nuclear energy facilities in 2012 averaged 2.40 cents per kilowatt-hour, cheaper than coal (3.27 cents) and natural gas-fueled plants (3.40 cents).\" It also costs much less the renewable energy sources.[4] Here is a picture of the range and median costs of four types of energy: [5] Nuclear energy is cheaper and more efficient that other forms of energy, as it has a greater capacity factor and lower per unit energy costs than than other forms of energy, both fossil fuels and renewable. Environment I'm sure my opponent will talk about this, and I'll have much more to say in the appropriate rounds, but I can make a positive argument here. Nuclear energy actually has very little effect on the environment. \"Of all energy sources, nuclear energy has perhaps the lowest impact on the environment especially in relation to kilowatts produced because nuclear plants do not emit harmful gases, require a relatively small area, and effectively minimize or negate other impacts. In other words, nuclear energy is the most \"ecologically efficient\" of all energy sources because it produces the most electricity in relation to its minimal environmental impact. There are no significant adverse effects to water, land, habitat, species, and air resources.\"[6] Further, the amount of waste that is produced is greatly reduced compared to fossil fuels. \"Because uranium contains many thousands of times more energy per unit of weight than fossil fuels, the waste from a nuclear power station is very small in volume and is fully managed and extremely secure at the nuclear sites.\" The small amount of waste can be stored safely in secure locations, and without harmful effect, unlike with fossil fuels.[7] Conclusion Overall, when considering the amount of nuclear energy the Earth has (potentially over 1 million years worth at current capacity), the capacity factor it has from producing energy more of the time (unlike often interrupted renewables), the lower cost of nuclear energy per unit of energy, and the lessened strains on the environment, it is clear that nuclear energy is a good choice for society.

            "discussionTitle": "To stop the usage of fossil fuel is the only way to combat global warming",
            "conclusion": "To stop the usage of fossil fuel is the only way to combat global warming",
            "premise": "- 1 - Global Warming could resolve itself\"due to human activities that have completely disturbed e bio geochemical cycles which are carbon cycle , nitrogen cycle and oxygen cycle- it is not likely possible.\"Humanity is aware that it is disrupting these cycles though, there is awareness to try to halt activities that disrupt these cycles. For example, the nitrogen cycle can be disrupted when nitrogen based fertilizers run off into lakes and cause algae booms, so farmers now know to be less trigger happy with fertilizers to not disrupt the nitrogen cycle. There are similar initiatives to prevent disrupting these cycles too. Furthermore these cycles arent something that can be broken, human activities have disrupted them at the most they can still be repaired and be returned to normal patterns. Lastly, the Earth naturally goes through periods of warming and cooling. These are not based off of CO2 levels and these periods of warming always have resolved themselves without the help of people. This could very well be one of those periods and now that humans have the ability to impact it, so we dont have to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels completely to fix this period of warming since the Earth has been able to resolve these thins by itself. - 2 - CO2 only has an impact if emitted in huge quantities\" it's not to total extent possible at advancing the technology\" Thats according to you, right now there are cars that use a variety of technologies to make cars get 40 mpg easy, and some that are hybrids can get up to 50 mpg, like the Fiat 500. Some really advanced cars though like the Nissan Leaf get up to 100 mpg. Basically if 10 people drive Nissan Leafs, it will offset the CO2 made from over 60 other cars that et 10mpg. http://money.cnn.com...Another thing, efficiency doesnt have to improve to a point where nothing is emitted anymore, it just needs to be improved enough and implemented in enough places to severely reduce CO2 emissions. The technology does exist, its only getting better and better, and we dont have to improve efficiency to infinity, it just has to be raised enough to reduce CO2 emissions to a point where it no longer effects the environment. \"It's will better option for us to use biofuels which exhaust no gas at all and can be used wi current car engines by mixing them to some percentage of gasoline.\"That sounds like a really good idea but biofuels still give off CO2..... Its fossil fuels with a different profile picture.\"Vehicles running on biodiesel still emit the same amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) as they did while running on diesel fuel\"http://thegreatbilby.com...Also you probably dont know that cars that run on gas cant run on biofuels. Thats in the link too\"Hybrid cars with ability to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water and using hydrogen as a fuel are also developing and are currently present in the market.\"Yeah but its easier to combine electric and gas engines in cars because the mpg is still limited to the point where they emit far less CO2 compared to any old gas powered car. - 3 - Plants + Bacteria in the Ocean fight CO2 the most so increasing their numbers is an option.\"Human hunt for deep sea fossil fuel and traveling on ships through marine routes have resulted in depletion of half of the ocean surface bacteria from the pacafic ocean\"That would be concerning if it were true in any way at all....As for the plants argument the Pro hasnt touched it at all. Lets face it a single tree can remove more CO2 then all the hybrids in the world because hybrids dont remove CO2 from the atmosphere, they only dont emit any. If the purpose is to combat global warming, then eliminating fossil fuel isnt the best thing to do because cars that dont burn fossil fuels dont remove CO2 from the atmosphere, nature does though. That being said planting more trees is a hell of a better alternative to fighting global warming then halting the burning of all fossil fuels. - 4 - High tech solutions to fighting global warming\"Launching mirror into the space to deflect sunlight is very expensive.it is much cost efficient to just\"Read the resolution of the debate. We are debating whether or not stopping fossil fuels is the ONLY way to combat global warming, not that stopping fossil fuels is the MOST EFFICIENT way to combat global warming. Mirrors in space is still a possible option, thus it defeats the resolution. If we are debating the simplicity of things though lets examine halting the burning of all fossil fuels. Here is a list of reasons of why halting all burning of CO2 may cause problems, - If we put a ban on use of fossil fuel, economies would collapse, the developing nations of middle eastern countries with large oil reserves would lose their main source of income and revenue while modern countries would struggle in making the transition off of an oil based economy - It will affect billions of people too since most cars use fossil fuels as their source of energy, removing fossil fuels would take lifetimes to transition off of without causing people to lose all means of transportation. - A large proportion of the worlds energy comes from coal, and some countries do not have the means to transition to more expensive greener sources of energy. - Entire industries would be forced to die out which would leave millions unemployed at a time when world economies are still trying to get back on their feet. And thats just off the top of my head. Lets examine some other cool ways to fight global warming. - Making clouds to reflect more sunlight - Carbon Sequestration (Taking CO2 and shoving it underground or in containers) - Paint roads and roofs white to reflect sunlight - Build open skyscrapers that only have plants to increase CO2 removal in the same amount of land spacehttp://knowledge.allianz.com... - 5 - Making cars more efficient could eliminate the amount of CO2 emitted which, if reduced enough, would have no effect on exacerbating global warmingUnaddressed by the Pro - 6 - Increasing reliance on greener technology eliminating reliance on coal can also reduce CO2 emissions to the point where CO2 emissions would no longer exacerbate global warming Unaddressed by the Pro - 7 - Technologies like Mass Transit reduce CO2 emissions drastically even though they too run on fossil fuelsUnaddressed by the Pro................ Let me make this perfectly clear, the Resolution is that stopping the use of fossil fuels is the only way to combat global warming. That being said, 1) I have shown that there are MANY ways to combat global warming, which defeats the resolution right there2) I have shown that these ways can be MORE effective then cutting all reliance on fossil fuels since simply cutting reliance on fossil fuels doesnt remove the CO2 already in the atmosphere3) I have shown how the Earth itself may be able to resolve this period of warming itself since it has done so in the past without human help I wait for the pro's counter arguments",

If we were to rely on nuclear power alone, we would need to increase energy output by 10% of it's current output each year from 2010 to 2050 to reach 2050 energy output needs. There are many problems. A. Mining of Plutonium would need to increase which would lead to more accidents because of a need of resources and, as seen throughout history, needs trump safety. B. A nuclear reactor would require $4.85 billion, which is a lot, considering their are 437, and to raise the energy outputs by 10 percent yearly would mean building roughly 45 plants yearly. C. It takes 5 to 7 years to build a plant. D. There are only 67 nuclear power plants under construction. E. If we were to do the math, and assumed that 1/5 of these plants will be build yearly, only 13 plants would be built every year. Also, we would have needed to start building an extra 32 plants yearly starting in 2010, to have been on track.",

Now, please don't be deceived into believing that that alternatively-powered cars have too be small, slow and as dull as ditchwater. Here's what's available on the market right now: The Tesla Roadster is powered by an electric motor: http://www.teslamotors.com... The Venturi Fetish is hybrid-powered http://www.hybridcars.com... All Saabs are available with biofuel engines http://www.topgear.com... The Honda FCX Clarity runs on hydrogen http://automobiles.honda.com... And here's what's coming soon: The Audi R8 V12 Le Mans is powered by a V12 diesel engine http://www.audi.co.uk... The Saab Aero X Concept is powered by a V6 biofuel engine http://www.saabbiopower.co.uk... The RUF Porsche 911 is powered by an electric motor http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de... Glamorous enough for you? And who knows what else will be available by 2040? If my opponent agrees that green cars can be desirable, and it is rather the case that he makes a living by prospecting and drilling for oil, and stands to lose out financially if alternative fuels are mandated by the United States Government, I have little sympathy for him - the need to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is an urgent one and just as steam replaced the horse, and gasoline replaced steam, the switch to alternative fuels is inevitable and I advise my opponent to adjust his investment plans accordingly.

            "premise": "Biofuels are now an economic alternative to fossil fuels and with advances in technology and the scaling up of production, their price per gallon (or litre) will continue to fall. Oil looks likely to maintain its current high prices well into the future, due to the exhaustion of many existing fields, strong demand from developing economies such as India and China, and security concerns which are unlikely to go away. Given these long-term trends, without investment in biofuel technology we actually risk our economies being crippled by sky-high fuel costs, for example if oil prices head up over $100 a barrel. Some subsidies to this investment seem highly justified, especially as they can replace existing agricultural support payments, rather than being additional money.\\ Biofuels are also a sensible bridge to a greener future, allowing us to develop a more sustainable future without unbearable economic or social cost. Unlike alternatives such as hydrogen fuel cells, biofuels do not need a completely different infrastructure to be widely adopted. \\",
