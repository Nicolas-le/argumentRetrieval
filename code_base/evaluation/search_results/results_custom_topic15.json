            "premise": "Thanks Pro. I. Plagiarism I don't have much to add on this, 95% of my opponent's previous round was copy pasted verbatim. I don't see such as acceptable behaviour, and most higher education institutions of state that text copied verbatim should at least have it enclosed in quotation marks and large quantities of such are discredited. One amusing thing to note is none of Pro's last round was plagiarised. Whether or not that is due to being 'called out' on her first round, or a kind fulfilment of my request is a matter of speculation. I'll leave voters to decide the rest as this is now non topical. II. Burden of Proof Please note this debate affirms two things: 1. Animal testing for pharmaceutical purposes 2. Animal testing for commercial purposes Remember, the burden of proof is on Pro, and she has yet to affirm the second contention, which is required for her to fulfil her burden of proof. Commercial purposes include food & cosmetics, and I made the assertion, and I maintain that these are simply not defensible. So immediately, Pro has clearly not done enough to win this debate. The defence of medical progress doesn't allow Pro to smuggle in the defence of commercial testing, even if her defence was valid and sound (and it's not). III. Animal Rights This is basically what the entire debate reduces down to. Pro has cited many reasons why the fruits of animal research has (at least pharmaceutically) benefitted us. I never denied this, the fruits of said research has positively impacted the well being of the human species. That much is obvious. That alone however does not affirm the resolution, that we SHOULD be using ANIMALS for this purpose. I have argued for a number of things so far: 1. By devaluing animal rights, we allow for the proliferation of negative rights 2. We value consent as a human right, and it is irrational to not expect this of animals 3. We have other, more ethical options, such as in vitro testing and human testing The most important one I will affirm is #1, and Pro's own sources back up my statements, with an already appalling treatment of livestock, with genocide levels of slaughters occurring on a weekly basis. This type of behaviour would not occur if we did not provide a special case for negative animal rights, when there is no rational reason to do in place of humans. Clear examples of this inconsistency are seen in laws and social acceptance regarding human cannibalism, beastiality, slavery and hunting. Pro has provided no reason why we should value Humans over animals, and I argue to do so is to commit the fallacy of special pleading. \"As I've already said, we don't conduct animal testing because we want to devalue animals' rights. Conrary, the fact that we have strict laws that protect animals' well-being, the fact that we use alternative research methods whenever possible and the fact that there is no other way to protect us and animals from viruses show the oppoiste!\" But there are other ways, and even if there were not, it would not make it ethical, and acceptable. Remarkably Pro follows up with the following statement: \"I never said that animals should be tortured and exploited because they are not as powerful as humans, but we ,firstly, have to think about our own species. We have to find a way to face some viruses so that we'll not be extinct. \" A few points: 1. The human species has existed for tens of thousands of years, and has yet to go extinct 2. No reasoning was provided to prioritise 'thinking of our own species', moreover why is human extinction such a bad thing? It just begs the question and assumes humans are intrinsically valuable. I argue that affirming such is absurd. Pro also appeals to the fact that animals kill each other, and would be brutal in our own shoes. My response is, so what? This is known as a \"tu torque fallacy\", and is irrelevant to this debate. Just because they would do it too doesn't make it right or just. Sheep will follow each other a cliff to their deaths, would it be right for us to do the same 'in their shoes'. Of course not! Pro fails to adequately address my points that we use humans in clinical trials anyway, so use of them in more stages is perfectly logical. Literally the only argument in Pro's (plagiarised) opening round that might carry some merit is that animals have a quicker life cycle. This is fine, but then we have a large population of humans to select from, so a high turnover rate is easily debunked by a large 'stock' of humans. There are almost certainly enough humans to do adequate testing upon, and they can also be bred for testing if absolutely needed, but we don't even need to go this far. Pro affirms that we do have good measures in place to minimise the need to use animals, to which I have the following points: Excellent, Pro affirms that animal testing is undesirable The fact that 'we're trying really hard' doesn't have any impact on the is/ought question that this debate addresses. The fact that we are trying our best to minimise homicides doesn't mean it's right for those homocides that do occur to take place. It is a red herring. Another point Pro makes is that medical research has improved the well being of some animals, to which I assert that the price paid in liberties is not compensated by a few animals not going extinct. In fact I fail to see why Pro values animals not going extinct, and I would argue that any animals that were saved from extinction where probably out in that position due to human influences anyway. IV. Conclusion In conclusion, I have affirmed two things: Animal Testing for commercial purposes is indefensible Animal testing for pharmaceutical purposes is unnecessary and immoral As such I hold that the resolution is negated. I both thank the voters for reading and Pro for participating and for some interesting points on animal welfare, and I wish her best of luck in future debates",

            "premise": "OK, before I start rebuttling Con's arguments I have to make something clear! :I knew it would happen!! Firstly, do you think I am so naive that I would not think that you would found the website? It's the number 1 result when you google \"animal testing pros and cons\"and \"animal testing cons\", the number 2 result when you google \"animal testing pros\", and the number 8 result when you google\"animal testing advantages\". It was almost impossible for someone to mke a good research without visiting this site! This is why I gave you the sources!.. Every copied sentence is attached with the link of the site where it was first published! Since, I give the links and admit that these sentences have not been created by me I have no reason to paraphraze them!Secondly, I don't understand why this was such a great deal for you that you could not rebuttle at least one of the arguments I posted. Here are some sites that mention the debate rules- nowhere says that participants must come up with their own arguments. http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw...http://www.entsoc.org...Do you know why? Because the main purpose of debating is to defend your side well in order to persuade the audience! \"I don't like doing this, but it doesn't seem at all fair that sophisticated published arguments are pasted against myself. I could do exactly the same if I wanted and we would be left with a non-debate. It is not intellectually honest.\"In the first place, it IS fair and honest! A debater's arguments should not be prepared based on his/her opponent's level of knowledge. It was not my indebtedness to make arguments easy enough for you but it was you who had to search and post sophisticated ones. Moreover, NO! we would not be left with a non-debte. Contrary, it woud be a very interesting debate! We would both have to rebuttle some sophisticted arguments instead of ordinary ones and it would be great! It would be one of those constructive debates that could help people define their position and gain some knowledge! \"I am going to cut this round short as I want to see Pro's genuine reasons for animal testing, given she has voided her entire previous round by plagiarising. \"Really? You had more arguments but you didn't post them because you waited for me to post my \"genuine\" arguments? And when did you expect to post them? In your round 3? Now, about the \"genuine\" arguments:A debater should collect as many arguments as he/she can in order to defend his/her side! It is impossible to base a whole debate on someone's arguments! Before starting a debate, we all do some research! There no one who uses only his/her own arguments. You cannot ask me not to search and collect arguments and evidence, so I suppose that you want me to paraphraze them. BUT:1) An argument is yours when you are the first to think about it or at least you have come up with it without having heard or read it somewhere.. You cannot claim that an argument is your just because you have paraphrazed it. So, almost all of us use arguments that someone else has though about. And that's what we have to do in order to form an opinion! You cannot define your position in a topic by taking into consideration only your genuine arguments. 2) Given that I have paraphrazed the whole text.. So what? Does anything change? The main idea would remain the same! The only difference would be that I would may have done some mistakes. There are things that only specialized people know and I would not be sure if the paraphrazed text would be correct. Sometimes, a word plays an important role in a text and it could also change the whole meaning. So, since I have given you the sources, why should I have to risk it? So, there was no reason for you to ignore the arguments, let alone to ask me to paraphraze them. If you want to rebuttle something, rebuttle these arguments! Unfortunately, I will not have the chance to rebuttle your rebuttles. And finally, NO! I have not voided my entire previous round by plagiarising. This is wrong! If you had spent a little time to read and compare the 2 texts, maybe you wouldn't have said that! I have done much research and work in order for my round to be completed. I've added and removed many things.. examples: what animal testing offersthe image (found it while checking out a source that the website used too.)\"Without animal research polio would still be claiming thousands of lives each year\",said Albert Sabin,developer of the Polio vaccine (source 6..Sorry, but I had not characters available)The quote at the endHousehold cats kill approximately 5 million animals every week in the UK-more than the total number of animals used in medical research every year.The UK consumes over 300 times more fish each year than the total number of all animals used in medical research every yearand many more things have been added. Now let's start with the rebuttals:\"However this is irrational, as we have absolutely no good reason to prioritise our own fellow species over another who has a measurable well-being. \"As I've already said, we don't conduct animal testing because we want to devalue animals' rights. Conrary, the fact that we have strict laws that protect animals' well-being, the fact that we use alternative research methods whenever possible and the fact that there is no other way to protect us and animals from viruses show the oppoiste! That we recognize animals' rights and we try to prevent them from suffering! Oh, yeah! I forgot..you have ignored my whole round 2 for some reason.. \"Let's assume we grant ourselves the right of our own well-being at the expense of animals, where does that leave us?'I have to repeat things..Oh gosh! OK, let's get started:We don't grant ourselves at the expense of animals. We just use animals whenever we cannot do something else.. I'm sorry but the only way to save from the HIV and the cancer or save animals from certain diseases we HAVE to use a few animals. Thanks to animal research we are where we are now and a lot of other species have not been extinct. We cannot stop using animals unless we find an alternative way to test drugs. \"An enormously disproportionate amount of suffering and negative well-being which is resultant of our own selfishness. Therefore, granting ourselves the right, and stating that animal research doesn't cost that many lives in comparison is a myopic way of looking at the bigger picture.\"I never said that animals should be tortured and exploited because they are not as powerful as humans, but we ,firstly, have to think about our own species. We have to find a way to face some viruses so that we'll not be extinct. If animals were in our shoes, they would do the same. This is how nature works! I also mentioned that :\"Household cats kill approximately 5 million animals every week in the UK\"This shows that animals kill each other without being menaced. The fact that we're being menaced now proves that in order for some species to become powerful so that they will not be extinct, they have to harm some other species. I never said that we have to torture animals because we are more powerful, but when we're being menaced, we have to find a way to protect ourselves. Please note that we try to harm animals as little as possible despite the fact that we're in danger. \" While an argument that animals are readily available for large scale testing might have had some credit in her he past, that same argument is no longer applicable today\"No, it is. I made a whole paragraph about why animals are necessary. Many diseases that menace our species today cannot be cured by using only alternative research methods. The tretments cannot be found so easilly. They need years of testing and examination. So, yeah, this argument is still appicable.\"Given that drugs are necessarily tested on humans anyway, why not cut out the 'middle man' and go directly from in vitro testing to in vivo trials in humans?\"Go to the last paragraph \" But why don't we use humans instead of animals?:\" There are a lot of things that humans cannot offer. \"except Pro simply doesn't have a leg to stand on in vested long term well-being interests\"Really? And your well-being? I have proved that animal testing benefits both people and animals. Thanks to medical research many animals have not been extinct. We have a lot of laws to protect them. We try to avoid using animals. What else can we do? Unless we find an alternative method we HAVE to use animals. If you have sth better to propose, do it. We can not quit medical research as we have to find treatments quickly if we don't want to die. Now, about morality:As Con has based all of her arguments on morality, I guess that she is a conscious person who stresses the importance of taking moral values into consideration. To start with, I have to clarify that morality is subjective and every person has differerent moral values. So, you cannot ask me to demonstrate animal testing to be immoral as I can simply answer that \"For, me it is moral as I think that we have to use our power against other species\" for instance. NOTE: THIS IS NOT MY OPINION IT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE. Furthermore, we are not responsible only for our acts but also for our omissions. That means that we have to take into consideration the consequences of conducting animal testing and those of quiting animal testing. Which is more immoral? To use a few animals in order to find a way to face some viruses or to let many people and animals die which can lead to the extinction of many species while we can avoid it?",

            "premise": "Thanks Pro. I. Preface My case is mostly going to concentrate on the morality of the issue of animal testing. Virtually all arguments for and against animal testing are reducible to claims about morality and well-being. I take the position that they are both connected, and that the benefits if animal testing so not outweigh the negative effects that are resultant, and extended from the presuppositions of positive animal testing. II. Plagiarism I have never had somebody plagiarise against me like this in a debate before, and I am not sure how to react, but I think this warrants pointing out. Almost the entirety of Pro's opening round is plagiarised, copy pasted verbatim, from existing websites. I have nothing against paraphrasing and referencing, but this is literal word-for-word and easily checkable with google. Pro's sources: 1. http://animal-testing.procon.org... 2. http://ca-biomed.org... And Pro's opening contentions: 1. Animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments - Copied from Source 1 2. There is no adequate alternative to testing on a living, whole-body system - Copied from Source 2 3. Animals themselves benefit from the results of animal testing - Copied fro, Source 2 4. Animal research is highly regulated, with laws in place to... - Copied from Source 1 5. The vast majority of biologists and several of the largest... - Copied from Source 1 6. Relatively few animals are used in research... - Copied from Source 1 7. But why don't we use humans instead of animals? - Copied from Source 1 I don't like doing this, but it doesn't seem at all fair that sophisticated published arguments are pasted against myself. I could do exactly the same if I wanted and we would be left with a non-debate. It is not intellectually honest. With that out of the way, I expect Pro to construct and bring her own arguments forward for the next round, now I will present my own. For now I will present my own case and address Pro's arguments in my rebuttal rounds. III. Harming sentient beings without consent is immoral As humans, one of the most basic moral acts is to consider the well-being of other conscious beings. This is axiomatically true, and to deny this axiom leads to one's own self-destruction. With this in hand the argument becomes quite simple. It is immoral to deliberately impinge on the well-being of a conscious being Animal testing deliberately impinges in the well being of a conscious being C. Animal testing is immoral Note that this doesn't quite get us to the conclusion and also runs into issues of liberties and rights. But the argument remains valid and a Pro needs to contend this. We can expand the issue further, that if we have a society, or culture that sees animal testing as moral, then we devalue an animal's rights & liberties. We essentially deprioritize an animal's well-being over out fellow species'. However this is irrational, as we have absolutely no good reason to prioritise our own fellow species over another who has a measurable well-being. I would argue that it is within our capabilities now to generally have a say on what the state of well-being of animals are, given the research on depression, love, pain, and even addition have all come up with positive results.[1] Therefore, Pro needs to content there is a rational and justifiable explanation as to why an animal's well-being should not be prioritised as highly as a human's well-being, given that we know they have comparable capabilities of pain and suffering, and will also evidently value their own well-being. IV. Knock-On effects Let's assume we grant ourselves the right of our own well-being at the expense of animals, where does that leave us? Well, I would like to let Pro's own charts speak on my behalf, billions of chickens are slaughtered every year for food, along with millions in other livestock. Most of which are born and bred in captivity in conditions optimised for profit (and hence human well-being) at the expense of animals. An enormously disproportionate amount of suffering and negative well-being which is resultant of our own selfishness. Therefore, granting ourselves the right, and stating that animal research doesn't cost that many lives in comparison is a myopic way of looking at the bigger picture. All things considered, very uncharitable consequences would appear insignificant to us and place most of society in ignorance of what is occurring behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Yes, this is real. V. Alternative solutions/Perspective Medical research had made significant advancements, and hence in vivo testing in animals is far less 'necessary' then it once was. While an argument that animals are readily available for large scale testing might have had some credit in her he past, that same argument is no longer applicable today.[2] In vitro testing can go a long way to determining efficacy, toxicity and putative pharmacokinetics of a new drug, and for drug trials, human trials are inevitably necessary anyway. A drug that had passed through phase IV. trials (and this is viable for market) has been tested on hundreds of humans anyway. Given that drugs are necessarily tested on humans anyway, why not cut out the 'middle man' and go directly from in vitro testing to in vivo trials in humans? The difference between trialling in humans and on animals is that humans are capable of giving consent, and accepting the discomfort, and risks involved in testing. Moreover they are more viable for incentives, for undergoing the risks and inconvenience of trials, which gives a positive moral 'payback'. Animals in the other hand, simply do not have a choice in the matter, they are bred and forced to undergo testing against their wishes, much like our livestock and bred and slaughtered against their wishes. VI. Cosmetics/Medicines All of what I have said so far is directed at pharmaceutical testing, but the resolution also encompasses cosmetics and food testing. The same reasoning provided so far in this debate applies to cosmetics testing, except Pro simply doesn't have a leg to stand on in vested long term well-being interests. There simply isn't a moral reason to perform cosmetic & food testing on animals. It is Pro's burden to demonstrate this to be false. VII. Conclusion I am going to cut this round short, as I want to see Pro's genuine reasons for animal testing, given she has voided her entire previous round by plagiarising. Pease provide your arguments in the next round so I may provide a cogent rebuttal VIII. References 1. http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org... 2. http://www.neavs.org...",

            "premise": "First of all,I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate! No,the debate is not only about ethics.All arguments are accepted because we want to reach a conclusion and we cannot take into consideration only the ethical side.Of course,we will talk about morality as the main reason why people oppose to animal testing is because they think that it is not right to use innocent animals to test drugs and other substances. Ok, to start with, I would like to mention what animal testing offers*: Improving the health and well-being of people. Improving the health and welfare of entertainment, recreational, sport, and service animals, and of animals used to provide therapeutic support. Improving the health, welfare and productivity of farm animals and other production animals Finding better ways to preserve, protect and manage a range of animal species (especially endangered and native animals) to maintain a balance that is ecologically stable and well adapted to the Australian environment. Developing more humane and effective pest control methods to protect endangered animals and plants from the species that threatens them and to prevent damage to the environment. Broadening the foundations of biological science,including our knowledge and understanding of life processes in all animal species. I think that we should use animals for scientific or commercial testing because: 1)Animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments: The California Biomedical Research Association states that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals.[1] Experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics.The polio vaccine, tested on animals, reduced the global occurrence of the disease from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 223 cases in 2012. \"Without animal research polio would still be claiming thousands of lives each year\",said Albert Sabin,developer of the Polio vaccine. Animal research has also contributed to major advances in understanding and treating conditions such as breast cancer, brain injury,childhood leukemia, cystic fibrosis, malaria, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis,and many others, and was instrumental in the development of pacemakers, cardiac valve substitutes,and anesthetics. Chris Abee,Director of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's animal research facility,states that \"we wouldn't have a vaccine for hepatitis B without chimpanzees,\"and says that the use of chimps is\"our best hope\" for finding a vaccine for Hepatitis C,a disease that kills 15,000 people every year in the United States.[2]2)There is no adequate alternative to testing on a living, whole-body system: Whenever possible,researchers do use non-animal models for research.Computer models, tissue and cell cultures,and a number of other non-animal related research methods are used today in biomedical research.However, animal testing remains a necessity.For example, blindness cannot be studied in bacteria and it is not possible to study the affects of high blood pressure in tissue cultures.The living system is extremely complex.The nervous system, blood and brain chemistry, gland and organ secretions, and immunological responses are all interrelated, making it impossible to explore,explain,or predict the course of diseases or the effects of possible treatments without observing and testing the entire living system of a living organism. In the meantime,scientists continue to look for ways to reduce the number of animals needed to obtain valid results,refine experimental techniques,and replace animals with other research methods whenever feasible.[1]3)Animals themselves benefit from the results of animal testing: The same methods that have been developed to prevent and treat diseases in human have improved thelives of countless animals.More than 80 medicines and vaccines developed for humans are now used totreat animals.Animal research has helped develop many animal vaccines to fight diseases such as rabiesand distemper in dogs and cats,feline leukemia,infectious hepatitis virus,tetanus,and has assisted in thedevelopment of treatments for heartworm.In addition,animal research has helped preserve nearly extinct species such as the California condor and the tamarins of Brazil due to new reproductive techniques being applied to endangered species[1].The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) endorses animal testing. 4)Animal research is highly regulated, with laws in place to protect animals from mistreatment: In addition to local and state laws and guidelines, animal research has been regulated by the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) since 1965.As well as stipulating minimum housing standards for research animals (enclosure size,temperature,access to clean food and water,and others),the AWA also requires regular inspections by veterinarians.All proposals to use animals for research must be approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) set up by each research facility.Humane treatment is enforced by each facility's IACUC, and most major research institutions' programs are voluntarily reviewed for humane practices by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).All institutions receiving funding from the US Public Health Service(PHS)must comply with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.[3]Furthermore, animal researchers treat animals humanely both for the animals' sake and to ensure reliable test results. Research animals are cared for by veterinarians, husbandry specialists, and animal health technicians to ensure their well-being and more accurate findings. According to the journal Nature Genetics, because \"stressed or crowded animals produce unreliable research results, and many phenotypes are only accessible in contented animals in enriched environments, it is in the best interests of the researchers not to cut corners or to neglect welfare issues.\"[7] 5)The vast majority of biologists and several of the largest biomedical and health organizations in the United States endorse animal testing: A 2011 poll of nearly 1,000 biomedical scientists conducted by the science journal Nature found that more than 90% \"agreed that the use of animals in research is essential.\"[4]The American Cancer Society, American Physiological Society,National Association for Biomedical Research,American Heart Association, and the Society of Toxicology all advocate the use of animals in scientific research.6)Relatively few animals are used in research, which is a small price to pay for advancing medical progress: People in the United States eat 9 billion chickens and 150 million cattle,pigs and sheep annually,yet we only use around 26 million animals for research,95% of which are rodents,birds and fish.We eat more than 1,800 times the number of pigs than the number used in research,and we consume more than 340 chickens for every research animal.[5]Household cats kill approximately 5 million animals every week in the UK-more than the total number of animals used in medical research every year.The UK consumes over 300 times more fish each year than the total number of all animals used in medical research every year[6] But why don't we use humans instead of animals?: This is something that almost of all us have questioned about.If we can use people instead of animals and have the same results why don't we try it?Some people believe that this is because we don't want to harm our species and we prefer to exploit animals as we are more powerful.But the answer is not that simple. First of all,animals have a shorter life circle than humans,so researchers can study the effects of treatments or genetic manipulation over a whole lifespan,or across several generations,which would be infeasible using human subjects.The more research that can be done in the shorter amount of time means that new drugs can be produced more rapidly.In addition,scientists can easily control the environment around animals(diet,temperature,lighting),which would be difficult to do with humans.Moreover,animal testing,particularly with rats and mice is very cheap in addition to testing with human beings who would probably need to be highly compensated.Finally,rats and mice breed very quickly which means that supplies can be replenished qickly. All the above contribute to a sucessful and effective research. Moreover,this claim is not right. Drugs are tested on humans,too. Animal experiments are not used to show that drugs are safe and effective in human beings.They cannot do that.Instead,they are used to help decide whether a particular drug should be tested on people.Animal experiments eliminate some potential drugs as either ineffective or too dangerous.If a drug passes the animal test it's tested on a small human group before large scale clinical trials. \"(primates) are used only when no alternative approach can provide the answers to questions about such conditions as Alzheimer's, stroke, Parkinson's, spinal injury, hormone disorders and vaccines for HIV\" Colin Blakemore,former CEO of the Medical Rsearch Council [6] SOURCES:*http://www.adelaide.edu.au...

            "premise": "Animals should, and must, be used for research because, animals are the only other living organisms that are closely related enough to humans to be able to test, animals hold the key to understanding scientific discoveries that impact human medical conditions, and the scientific discoveries found by using lab-test animals helps save lives and can improve the quality of life for many people. Humans must test drugs on \"something\" to see if it will work. That \"something\" should be a living organism. We can not test drugs in rocks, so we use animals. Some people ask why don\"t we test drugs in humans? First, because testing drugs in humans is considered inhumane. The outcomes for drug testing is unpredictable and could have mild to severe side effects. Also, in many cases, the test animals must be monitored and kept in a controlled experiment. This would be hard to do for people with responsibilities to their families and jobs. Second, many drug tests fail, again causing harm or death to the lab animal. What seems more detrimental would be to use humans as test cases. Unfortunately, Nazis used humans as test subjects. That part of world history is atrocious. The inhumanity that the Jewish people endured in the name of science should never happen again. Author James Morcan writes, \"The ends justify the means mindset has been the impetus behind many a cruel medical or social experiment\" (Goodreads) Using lab test animals is the only way at this point in science to help advance medical knowledge and improve the quality of life for people without having to use people as test subjects. It is true that \"More than 90 percent of basic science discoveries from experiments on animals fail to lead to human treatments\"(2018, peta). However, the ten percent that does succeed are huge scientific discoveries. One huge discovery, for example, is Ketamine. Ketamine is also known as a brand name called Ketalar. This medication is used as anesthesia at the start of surgery and throughout surgery. Ketalar is a key medicine that allows surgeons to operate because it puts a person in a trance-like state, provides pain relief, sedates people, and creates short-term memory loss of the surgical experience (Wikipedia). When this drug was made it was tested on zebrafish. The scientists that tested this drug had tanks full of zebrafish; furthermore, within each tank, the water had different amount of this drug in it. If too much drug was in the water the fish \"mutated.\" You don\"t really want to create mutated humans, do you? Ketamine is now a life saving substance that when tested on animals had its faults, but that doesn't make it any less of a life saver. What would happen if scientists immediately stopped using lab animals as test subjects? Frankie Trull, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR) has an answer for this. She says, \"An immediate end to animal research in the U.S. would be a death sentence for millions of people around the world.\" If you have ever taken a drug for any medical reasons, you can thank the animals that had there life lost or had there life changed through these drug tests. For example, penicillin is an antibiotic medicine that has had a huge impact on society. Penicillin was discovered by research scientist Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 who tested it on animals first to make sure that it was non-toxic to humans. Then in 1940, Sir Howard Florey tested penicillin on mice infected with bacteria and found out that the mice that were given penicillin survived. Because of what these two scientist discovered through these tests on lab mice, doctors are now able to prescribe this antibiotic to save people\"s lives. Without penicillin and other antibiotics, the number of people dying from infections each year would be significantly higher. Drugs used for medical purposes change the lives of others for the better and can save human lives. Without animals to test drugs on we have two options. One, use humans as blatant test dummies. Or two, give humans drugs when necessary and get information off of their suffering. Animals must be used for research to improve our lives and the development of the human race because animals are a necessary test subject, animals are the key to scientific discoveries, and the scientific discoveries found by using lab-test animals helps save lives and improve the quality of life for many people. \"The contributions of animal research to medical science and human health are undeniable... When the majority of scientists see the work as scientifically justified, and so do the many professional medical and scientific organizations, the expert views cannot be simply dismissed based on wild claims of ulterior motives, self-interest and conspiracy theories\" (2017, Pro-con). We have been teasing animals since the ancient greeks (Wiki), so why stop now?",

Now I will try best to counter it. \" A good deal of people would say that so many animals are being killed in animal research but it isn't realised that animals are used in the food industry as well.\" Well, As my worthy opponent says that a good deal of animals are used in the food industry, Pro, fails to realise that food industry is a high breeding industry too and no harm to the subsistence of animals is done in this industry. Does it mean that people are killing plants ruthlessly and causing extinction of wheat and rice plants? No. That is called agriculture and rearing animals for commercial purposes is called animal husbandry.(1) (1)en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandryR06; \" If we stop animal testing the human race would wipe out; and because of this human beings wouldn't be able to keep control of the reproduction of animals, leading to many of them dying for their own record!\" And nothing will happen to the population of the animals? A common example of what animal testing leads to is the situation of the Tokay gecko.(2)(3) (2)http://www.dw.de... (3)www.tokaygeckos.org/tokay-gecko-fact-sheetR06; What happens is that when a species of animal is thought to have some medicinal cures, it is researched upon. slowly, the demand of this species grows and people come to know about it. Frequently, these species are found in areas which are full of poor people. Catching these animals and supplying them to buyers gives a lot of money. So, everyone follows the rule of catching these animals and selling them for money. This happens recklessly and the population of these animals go down in a constant rate leading to their extinction. Tokay Geckos are researched on to find an HIV cure. While Top scientists say that it is in vain. Many have taken this research as a hope to find a cure...some for the welfare...and some for the money. The greed to earn money is leading to the extinction of beautiful animals. Think about it. If Human beings have fundamental rights, should the animals also not have some basic rights? At Least the right to LIVE? Tiger was first hunted as a game, gradually the GOVT. took steps. Later, they were researched on. GOVT. scientist said that tiger doesn't contain any medicinal factors and research on them was banned but is the tiger safe today? Nope. People who believe that tiger can be used to cure cancer are still researching on them by illegal means. Poachers are still prevalent. Tiger reserves are proving to be useless. The count of tiger in the whole world is >3200!! In such situations, should animal testing be actually allowed?",

            "premise": "Con: Animal Rights By many accounts, animal testing often means that that animals are not treated humanely. According to Santa Clara University, approximately 8 million animals are exposed to painful testing procedures, and at least 10 percent of these do not receive painkillers. Many people believe it is unjust to sacrifice one species for the benefit of another, and that animal cruelty is never justified, regardless of the benefits that come from it. Some feel that it does not follow that a human --- Earth's most highly developed animal --- is considered more valuable than any other animal. Even when animals are not killed or harmed during experimentation, they are often subjected to great deals of stress. Some animal advocates believe that the animal's experience of stress could actually influence an experiment, making the results unusable. Con: Expense Animal testing is notoriously expensive, and also very time-consuming. According to Care2, scientific professionals in the U.S. have used approximately $20 million in taxpayer money on animal experiments that are deemed \"arbitrary and pointless.\" Animal testing in general costs more than non-animal testing, since it requires additional lab equipment, such as animal food, cages and needles, and usually takes a lot more time. Animal activists argue that many animals experiments aren't necessary in the first place --- like testing cocaine on monkeys --- and don't contribute vital information to the scientific community. Con: Necessity Individuals in the scientific and animal rights community alike maintain that most experiments leading to life-saving scientific breakthroughs could have been done just as easily without using animals. Some scientists even believe that non-animal testing produces more accurate results than animal testing. Advances in stem cell research, for example, may well render animal testing pointless in the future. In addition, according to Living Cruelty Free, the safety of a product or procedure on an animal does not always translate over to human safety, due to \"interspecies variation in anatomy, physiology and biochemistry.\" Lots of experiments performed using cosmetics and other household items are not necessary, because many popular companies do not test on animals. These companies are labeled \"cruelty-free\" by PETA.1. Animals are killed or kept in captivity: In animal testing, countless animals are experimented on and then killed after their use. Others are injured and will still live the remainder of their lives in captivity. Function Animal testing is used to see how a product could possible effect humans, animals and the environment. The different demands for animal testing come from the medical field, household products, agricultural chemicals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, paint, food additives and beauty products. Types There are three general types of animal testing. Product testing is the testing of products such as soaps, cosmetics, household cleaners and pesticides on animals to ensure they are safe for human use. Research uses the testing of drugs and medical procedures on animals. Education and training uses animals to teach anatomy and to train medical students I have not seen any information for preserving animal testing plus Wikipedia literally anyone can put something on Wikipedia and it could be wrong",

            "conclusion": "Should animal testing be banned",
            "premise": "\"Why is an animal's life more valuable than a human's life?\" I'm going to work under the assumption you meant to ask \"Why is a human's life more valuable than an animal's?\" The truth?... it depends on whose perspective you look at this question from. A human's life is more valuable than an animal's (in general) because I am a human. I want to ensure the survival of my species first and foremost above all other species. However, If you could speak with a lion and asked it whose life it valued more, a fellow lion or the human, it would say the lion. We can assume this to be true because if it came down to a matter of life and death a lion would kill a human to feed it's family in order to ensure the survival of it's species. I often liken argument of animal testing to hunting. You say that animal testing puts the life of the animals in danger and that it is cruel towards the animals. That it utterly true and undeniable. But I would ask you, how is the cruelty animals face from being used in research worse or different than the cruelty and suffering an animal faces at the moment it's life is being extinguished by a hunter, whether that hunter be man or another animal? The truth of the situation is that most animals that are used for scientific research are bred into existence for the sole purpose of being used in research, and for the majority of the time that animal is alive it is treated just like any other pet or animal in a zoo. In round 1 you base your argument off the statement \"If you were asked to go and eat a thought-to-be-poisonous berry, would you say yes, even though you probably would die. That is why animal testing should be banned\". This shows a misinterpretation of the core fundamentals of science. In addition the statement makes the assumption that researches do not understand the gravity of using live animals in their scientific research, and it's down right insulting. A statement that would more accurately represent what scientists are trying to do would read as \"Ok, we are almost certain this berry won't be dangerous to people but we cannot be certain. We need this berry to feed thousands of starving people that would otherwise die without it. Before we feed this berry to those thousands of people and possibly end uo killing them further lets see if other animals can eat it without dying, just to be sure its safe. Ok, all the animals that ate the berry didn't seem to have any negative reaction to it. Now we're almost certain it is safe to feed to those starving people but we are still crossing our fingers that it is safe for people too and it will indeed save the lives of those starving people that eat it\". It's a common misconception that scientists do not have respect for the animals they test on, and that most animals involved in research die as a result of the experiment. It is quite the opposite. Animal's are only used in research as a last resort for the final step of the research to ensure a medical procedure or drug is as safe as possible for people. Like you say, other technology is used in research, but that only gets you so far. If we tried to apply medical technologies to people before it went through the process of animal testing, many people would be suffering instead of animals and the advancement of medical technologies would be almost non-existent. We are decades, if not centuries away from being able to develop medical technologies without the use of animal models. I know this because I am around this culture everyday. The hard truth that you and other people against animal testing must face is that without it we would not have modern medicine. Everything from surgery techniques to the vaccine for polio was only made possible with the use of animals in research. Without testing on animals large groups of the human population would be susceptible to being wiped out by disease. Furthermore, as technology is refined the suffering animals face in research is minimized and there is a great effort in the scientific community to ensure animals used in research suffer the least amount possible in the duration of their life. I link the argument back to life and death because even though you do not see it, the majority of research that uses animals to test on is a matter of life and death for the individual human and for our species. Although I am not religious I understand the statement that \"god gave man dominion over the animal kingdom\". Instead of suggesting animal testing should be banned, it would be a better effort to minimize the necessity of using animals in research and minimize the animals suffering in that research and this is an effort pushed strongest by the scientific community. Instead of thinking of animal testing as subjecting animals to pointless cruelty in testing we should think of the great sacrifice these animals make for humanity. In reality it is quite noble.",

A medicine is initially tested in vitro using tissues and isolated organs, but legally and ethically it must also be tested in a suitable animal model before clinical trials in humans can take place. The animal tests provide data on efficacy and safety. They not only identify potential safety concerns, but also determine the doses which will be given to volunteers and patients during the first human trials. Testing on animals aso serves to protect consumers, workers, and the environment from the harmful effects of chemicals. All chemicals for commercial or personal use must be tested so that their effect on the people and animals exposed to them is understood. The chemicals that we use day-to-day can accumulate in the water, ground or air around us, and their potential impact on the environment must be researched thoroughly.",

            "premise": "CON: Intro: Ever since the 17th century, we have been testing products on animals to make sure that they are safe for human use. Animal testing aids researchers in finding drugs and treatments to improve health and medicine. Many medical treatments have been made possible only through animal testing. This includes treatments for HIV\"S, Cancer, insulin, antibiotics, and many more. Animal testing has proved itself to work and has saved many human lives already. Scientists use animal testing for one main reason. That is because animals are similar to humans and most cosmetics have the same effect on humans. Because we believe that animal testing is not only great but it is essential to advancing in society, we negate the resolution which states: RESOLVED: The US federal Government should ban all testing that requires the use of animals. CON FRAMEWORK: In this debate, the pro has the burden of proving that ALL animal testing should be banned and that nothing good comes out of it. On the other hand, the con has the privilege of demonstrating that animal testing benefits the humanity and the pros to animal testing outweigh the cons. CONTENTION 1: THE BENEFITS OF ANIMAL TESTING http://www.worldometers.info... According to the University of Oxford, Approximately 3 million human beings are killed each year by general cancer. Leukemia, malaria, and lung cancer are the main contributing factors to another 4 million human deaths. Currently, there are approximately 2.1 million children living with HIV\"S in this country alone and over 1,300 deaths from HIV\"S a day. Due to animal testing, these numbers are dropping as we speak by at least 70 percent. So what you have to see is that because of animal testing, the human life is being preserved. 6.3 percent of the U.S population suffers from either type 1 or 2 diabetes, that humans aren\"t the only ones suffering. Every breed of dogs, cats and other animals also have been diagnosed with diabetes. It is through testing on different breeds of animals that we have been able to come up with a temporary cure for this chronic disease. CONTENTION 2: ALTERNATIVES WON\"T PROVIDE ACCURATE RESULTS In order for medical advancements to be made, we need to continue to use animals in testing. Where animals are used in research projects, they are used for a wide range of scientific techniques. Animals are used only for parts of research where there are no other techniques are available and can deliver the same answer. You cannot copy a human on a computer and get the same results. A beating heart or a pulse is irreplaceable and complex. While we already know a lot about how it works, there is an enormous spectrum we have yet to discover. A computer hasn\"t been invented that has the power to reproduce all the complexities of a human body which cannot be created in a test tube. While humans are used extensively in Oxford research, there are some things which it is ethically unacceptable to use humans for. There are also variables which you can control in a mouse like diet, housing, clean air, humidity, temperature, and genetic makeup that you could not control in human subjects. What we are basically saying in this contention is that even though there are alternatives, they won\"t produce the same results that a real patient would. CONTENTION 3: THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE USE OF MEDICAL TESTING ON ANIMALS SO LONG AS THERE ARE REASONABLE LIMITS Simon Festing [Executive Director of the Research Defense Society, London] and Robin Wilkinson [Science Communications Officer at the Research Defense Society, London], \"The ethics of animal research. Talking Point on the use of animals in scientific research,\" EMBO Reports, Volume 8(6), pp. 526-530. URL= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.... Thanks to some extensive opinion polls by MORI (1999a, 2002, 2005), and subsequent polls by YouGov (2006) and ICM (2006), we now have a good understanding of the public's attitudes towards animal research. Although society views animal research as an ethical dilemma, polls show that a high proportion\"84% in 1999, 90% in 2002 and 89% in 2005\"is ready to accept the use of animals in medical research if the research is for serious medical purposes, suffering is minimized and/or alternatives are fully considered. When asked which factors should be taken into account in the regulatory system, people chose those that\"unknown to them\"are already part of the UK legislation. In general, they feel that animal welfare should be weighed against health benefits, that cosmetic-testing should not be allowed, that there should be supervision to ensure high standards of welfare, that animals should be used only if there is no alternative, and that spot-checks should be carried out. It is clear that the UK public would widely support the existing regulatory system if they knew more about it. What this means is that the public is fine with animal testing. A minimum of 84 % support it as long as we consider alternatives and that it is completely necessary. I love debating and look forward to their response.",

            "premise": "Animals should not be tested on. Did you know: A 2011 poll of nearly 1,000 biomedical scientists conducted by the science journal Nature found that more than 90% \"agreed that the use of animals in research is essential.\" [35] Animal testing is cruel and inhumane. According to Humane Society International, animals used in experiments are commonly subjected to force feeding, forced inhalation, food and water deprivation, prolonged periods of physical restraint, the infliction of burns and other wounds to study the healing process, the infliction of pain to study its effects and remedies, and \"killing by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, neck-breaking, decapitation, or other means.\" [47] The Draize eye test, used by cosmetics companies to evaluate irritation caused by shampoos and other products, involves rabbits being incapacitated in stocks with their eyelids held open by clips, sometimes for multiple days, so they cannot blink away the products being tested. [48, 49] The commonly used LD50 (lethal dose 50) test involves finding out which dose of a chemical will kill 50% of the animals being used in the experiment. [65, 102] The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported in 2010 that 97,123 animals suffered pain during experiments while being given no anesthesia for relief, including 1,395 primates, 5,996 rabbits, 33,652 guinea pigs, and 48,015 hamsters. [26] In vitro (in glass) testing, such as studying cell cultures in a petri dish, can produce more relevant results than animal testing because human cells can be used. [15] Microdosing, the administering of doses too small to cause adverse reactions, can be used in human volunteers, whose blood is then analyzed. Artificial human skin, such as the commercially available products EpiDerm and ThinCert, is made from sheets of human skin cells grown in test tubes or plastic wells and can produce more useful results than testing chemicals on animal skin. [15, 50, 51] Microfluidic chips (\"organs on a chip\"), which are lined with human cells and recreate the functions of human organs, are in advanced stages of development. Computer models, such as virtual reconstructions of human molecular structures, can predict the toxicity of substances without invasive experiments on animals. [50]",

            "premise": "May I start out by saying this is one of the best debates I have ever been in and it has been a really fun experience for me. Thank you for starting this debate and we should do this again sometime!Now, for my final arguments!\"Total federal revenues were $2.16 trillion in fiscal year 2010\" I did the math and exactly 0.00629% of tax dollars.\"I thought you might say that. That is only what it is costing us, the taxpayers. What is it costing the government? Think about that.\"Your pain argument is also ludicrous. You make a moral claim, but I could make a moral equilibrium by saying there pain is justified by the pain it saves us from.\"I'm sorry, but that is just heartless. Do you have no pity?! There is LITERALLY a video of a monkey being stuck in a tube and dying, which was one of my links in the last article. It saves about 5 million of us and takes 100 million of them (as stated in previous arguments) that, last time I checked, is not equal. \"B. Rats in labs are bred especially for the purpose of testing, and otherwise wouldn't have been born.\"Therefore, we are breeding animals just to kill them? I think not being born is a bit better than a full life of pain and misery. \"Because they are RATS.\"In every round, you have made an argument against a rat. At LEAST three times. You have failed to notice that only 18% are rats, as YOU SPECIFICALLY SAID. You have made no arguments against animals that don't carry diseases and that we love. If I didn't know any better, I would say your whole argument is revolving around rats. Look, rats are animals too and deserve to be treated with at least a LITTLE respect!\"Which is irrelevant\"It is not irrelevant because failed animal testing has KILLED people! If you think so highly of humans, why have you not addressed the fact that it is killing us, too? \"Around 95% of all animals that are being tested are specially bred rats and mice\"And I corrected you with 85% of the time. Did you just scan my argument or thoroughly read it?\"That rabbit you pulled up has no sources whatsoever and as far as I know is probably used in testing hair products.\"Check out the source at the bottom [1]. And the title says \"Animal Testing.\" How am I supposed to know what \"Animal Testing\" means to you? And how do you know that it was hair product? It might very well be for medical purposes.\"You are simply trying to evoke emotions in the voters\"I am trying to show them what we are doing, and trying to make some points. You are free to include some pictures, also. It is good debating skills to include pictures and you can't change that.\"We aren't just small minded eating machines.\"...Wow. Do you really hate animals that much? What did they ever do to you?\"Want to know what keeps him alive? Insulin. And want to know how they made that? By animal testing.\"Insulin was \"discovered\" in 1869 by research [2]. This was far before advanced animal testing. We made a life saving product without animal testing, and in less evolved times, so why do we have to do it today? You just proved another one of my points. I will only make one point because my opponent only made this debate three rounds, and he can't post a rebuttal. But I will end with one more point.Argument 1: We do have some alternatives, you know! [3]For my last argument, I will show that animal testing can be stopped and replaced with an alternative. Corrositex is one example. It is artificial skin that shows damages of products. That means it is not cruel and you don't have to use animal's skin for it. Another example and alternative to animal testing is computer modeling [4]. We are advanced, as you said, and computer modeling would both cut the costs for scientists AND save a ton of innocent animals. Many countries around the world are using these alternatives successfully. The rest of the world should follow in their footsteps.To sum up, my debate was against animal testing overall. I posted many rebuttals and seven arguments. Now It's all up to you, the voters, to see who you want to win.

According to this viewpoint it is unethical to use animals for any purpose, whether for pets, research, recreation, clothing, or as food. Animal use in testing is a huge controversial issue. Some believe animals have the same rights as humans and should for no reason be used as test subjects for research. Others, including members of medical and scientific communities say it is unethical not to use animals in research because animal experiments can lead to medical discoveries that improve the health and well-being of both humans and animals. Human health will not improve without animal experimentation. There is of course two sides to this issue. Worldwide, animals are used in numerous experiments which inflict pain and suffering to the animal. The first testing of animals started over one hundred years ago. Since then, animal testing has been a source of emotional conflict for humans. In 1966, the Animal Welfare Act took place. This was the start of the animal rights movement. Over the years, animal activists have become increasingly vocal and/or destructive. The ways in which animal activists try to get their message across to the public varies greatly. Some conduct letter-writing campaigns, others attack laboratories and harass scientists. One of these groups is the PETA founded in 1980 by Alex Pacheco and Ingrid Newkirk. PETA stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The group works on a wide range of issues such as biochemical testing, cosmetic testing, dissection, factory farming, neglect and abuse to animals in pet stores, and through hunting and trapping, and the wearing of fur, and non-leather footwear. The PETA is not known to be a violent group. Instead it often pulls public stunts. For example three members dressed in rabbit suits and chained themselves to a flagpole in front of Gillette head quarters in Boston, Mass. to protest the company\"s use of animals in product testing. The stunt was an embarrassment to the company. While PETA may be the most visible animal rights group, it is by no means alone. There are dozens of \"rights\" groups who pursue a more far-reaching agenda. One of these groups is the ALF, Animal Liberation Front. This group emerged in the United States in the late 1970\"s and has claimed responsibility for destroying or damaging more than one hundred labs and farms around the nation. In a world of animal testing there are a wide range of tests. These tests are done for multiple purposes, from finding a cure for a disease to testing the harshness of a shampoo or floor cleaner. Many activists claim that animal testing is not only unethical but also often scientifically unproductive. \"There have been some medical advances of course but the pay off is slight. When you\"re doing billions of animal experiments, it would be a miracle if there weren\"t some developments,\" says George Cave an animal activist. When Dr. Hamm was told what George Cave said, Hamm came back with a strong argument. He discussed how childhood leukemia, used to be a death sentence but now those kids get to go home. He also discussed Hodgkin\"s disease and how it is now a treatable cancer when ten years ago it was also a death sentence. Another argument he stated was how we can treat some types of liver cancer today and the research that got us there was done on animals because it had to be. There are no other alternatives exist that could give us this progress. One species that humans tend to use often in testing because they are most like ourselves is the chimpanzee. They are used in different experiments. Because chimpanzees are more like humans than any other species they are popular subjects for the development of vaccines for prevention of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and onchocerciasis. Chimpanzees are the only nonhuman animal species susceptible to these infections (Prince 115). Animal Activists are against the use of chimpanzees b/c of the decline in the chimpanzee population. In approximately the past ten years the chimpanzee population of Gabon, containing some of the best habitats, was reduced by twenty percent. There is an estimate between four thousand and five thousand chimpanzees that exist worldwide in medical institutions, zoological exhibits, roadside menageries, and entertainment compounds.",

            "premise": "Okay, I agree with everything my opponent said about supporting medical research. However, I also think animal researching should be justified in testing for purposes beyond medical research. I will be attacking the resolutions use of the word \"only\". First, some definitions medical-of or pertaining to the science or practice of medicine medicine is any substance or substances used in treating disease or illness; medicament; remedy. testing- A basis for evaluation or judgment:: all Definitions from dictionary.com unabridged. Now, I argue animal testing should be allowed for non medicinal uses such as psychology, agricultural and genetic testing. 1-Scientists constantly test animal psychology to better understand how the mind works. This testing has greatly increased our scientific knowledge. Large amounts of information on the mind has been developed from animal testing [1] 2- Farmers are constantly testing different methods of raising animals to produce the highest yield for meat and dairy products. This testing has increased the amount of meat and dairy products we can get from animals, resulting in farmers making more money and people having to pay less for food. This positively benefits society as it helps solve world hunger. The less people have to pay for food the more they can eat. 3- Genetic manipulation- This links back to the basis of my opponents case. Its better to risk a 100 rats than a million humans. Scientists are testing various genetic manipulations in animals to see how it effects them. Animals are very similar genetically to humans. This testing could provide invaluable data for future manipulation of humans. Furthermore, even testing for products no meant for humans is beneficial. Farmers could test genetic manipulation on cows, for example, to produce higher meat and dairy product yields. 1-http://www.psychology.org...",

            "premise": "I accept this debate. I am not a strong supporter of any animal groups such as PETA, but I still think that animal testing should be banned. And I will proceed to tell you why, but first, I will argue with you on your points. \"Would you rather a albino rat die or a young girl with leukemia die? Most people (unless you belong to PETA which is another debate entirely) would prefer the girl.\" Therefore, you prefer the girl to die? But I thought you were on the other side.\"Would you rather a albino rat die or a young girl with leukemia die?\"I don't think that you understand animal testing thoroughly. One lab rat isn't going to provide the key to a strong vaccination. Thousands of animals have to be tortured, tested, and killed. And it usually takes a lot longer than a day to get a scientific breakthrough. If one lab rat could find the cure to cancer, then I'd be all for it. But I'm going to dig a bit deeper into the statistics. As a population, the whole world uses up to THREE every SECOND for testing. That's... 274,000 per day, 100 million per year [1]. Yep. That's right. 3 per second.I don't know how you can be possibly for this, even with all of the PROS that it does have... which actually isn't anything besides cures.Now for my own arguments, which I have stacked up like a pile of books waiting to fall over.Argument 1: The cost of testing is around $136 million per year [1]We are spending way too much on something we shouldn't even be doing in the first place. If you think your taxes are going mostly towards roads and schools, that is wrong. A ton of it is going to animal testing. If we just stop animal testing, we wouldn't have to pay as much money and tons of innocent animals would be saved from the harm that animal testing causes them.Argument 2: They feel pain, too!Since the beginning of time, animals felt pain. We feel pain. Every living thing (that has a brain) feels pain. Imagine if that was you. How would you feel? Because this is exactly what we are doing to the animals. We know they feel pain, and yet we continue to do what we do. Even in extremely painful procedures, animals are not given anything, like drugs that we are given so we don't feel any pain during surgery [2]. They also can't express their pain to us, so even if a drug passes in an animal, they can't express how much the drug hurt them. If they could talk, we would all be crying because of how much pain in felt.Argument 3: Why is a human life more valued than an animals life?Well? Have an answer? I do. It shouldn't be. Humans are just animals too, we just don't realize it. At the most, a humans life MIGHT, in the best of circumstances, be worth two tested animals. But more than 100 million animals are used yearly to find a cure for something. In ten years, that is a billion. Say the flu shot saves 500,000 in the U.S from getting the flu. 36,000 of them would die [3]. Another 4 million who get the shot wouldn't be sick that year. 36,000 human lives= 1,000,000,000 animal lives? Nope. 36,000 human lives= 36,000 animal lives? That's a bit better. But it's still pretty outrageous.To conclude, I said why pros arguments were wrong and stated three of mine with links to prove my points.

Is he referring to testing hair products or cancer drugs, we don't know. Secondly, since Pro has been so incredibly vague on the nature of scientific research which he is referring to, he has in no way actually backed up those assertions.- \"You wouldn't test on humans so the next best thing is animals\"This is also unsupported. Why can't we test on humans? On the contrary, it would seem to be a better idea since (a) humans would seem prima facie more comparable to other humans in determining the result of experimentation and (b) humans can actually give their consent, freeing one of the various ethical dilemmas brought on b forced testing on animals.",

            "premise": "Before I proceed, it is necessary to define \"animal testing.\" According to Wikipedia, animal testing is: \"The use of non-human animals in experiments.\" [1]Con is under the impression that the goals of animal testing is solely to improve medicine and is solely in the best interests of humans. This is not true. C1. Benefits for Animals and Environment- Animal testing also helps animals. Animal testing is done not solely to improve medicine and health for humans, but for animals as well. I will give some examples:- Animal testing must be done for Veterinarians and Animal Hospitals to properly understand animals so that they can help sick and injured animals. - Pet food companies often perform animal testing by having pet animals eat a variety of pet foods to determine which are healthiest and tastiest, thus improving the quality of pet food, which is a benefit for both pet owners and their pets.- Animal testing is also necessary to help preserve endangered animals. To help preserve an endangered species, you must know what they eat, what living conditions are comfortable for them, their predators, their behavior, why they are endangered, etc. To determine these factors, the animals must be tested. These tests don't hurt the animals. It could be as harmless as having a monkey eating two different types of bananas to determine which are better for it.- In some cases, an endangered animal is a keystone species. A keystone species is a species of animal that plays a crucial role in its ecosystem. [2] If a keystone species goes extinct, the whole ecosystem collapses. For example, if a hummingbird goes extinct, the plants in its environment would not get pollinated, and after a few generations, all the plants in this environment dies out. Animal testing plays a crucial role in preserving endangered animals, which plays a crucial role in preserving the ecosystem and ultimately, the environment. Therefore, animal testing plays a crucial role in preserving the environment.C2. Probability of Success- One of Con's main arguments is that animal testing should be banned because there is a low probability of success. However, the probability of success is still there, and it won't hurt to keep trying. Thomas Edison tried thousands of times with a small probability for success, and made a scientific breakthrough in the end that brought huge benefits to the world. Conclusion:While animal testing has a low probability of making medical breakthroughs, the probability is still there, and is certainly worth the failures, like Edison's failures that resulted in the breakthrough of light bulbs and electricity, which is responsible for the invention of the very computer you are using right now.And aside from medical purposes, animal testing also plays a crucial role in helping animals which ultimately also helps the environment.

            "premise": "Animal Testing: The use of non-human animals in experiments. Experiment: a scientific test in which you perform a series of actions and carefully observe their effects in order to learn about something. [1] Rebuttal: \"By many accounts, animal testing often means that that animals are not treated humanely.\" - I'm sure they aren't treated \"humanely\", as they are not human. - However there are many cases of animal testing also do not harm the animal and in fact benefits the animal. - For example, currently the WWF organization are working hard to preserve Pandas, which are an endangered species. [2] To preserve the Pandas, they must learn more about Pandas. To do this, they must experiment on them. These experiments are generally harmless. For example, a scientist may measure and weigh several Pandas to determine which size and weight is healthy, so that they can spot out Pandas that are not healthy easier. Also, if a Panda is sick, veterinarians must experiment on the Panda to determine what is wrong with it and how to cure it, much like how a doctor would perform an x-ray scan on a broken bone to determine where the fracture is so he can accurately provide a diagnosis. \"According to Santa Clara University, approximately 8 million animals are exposed to painful testing procedures,\" - That is unfortunate, but why should we humans care about the pains felt by animals? We already butcher and slaughter them for food. They already suffer whether or not we test them. And we do this because food benefits us, just like animal testing may benefit us. - Furthermore as I have shown, not all cases of animal testing result in the suffer of animals. Con's resolution is basically: \"Animal testing is terrible and should be banned.\" My burden of proof is simply to show cases in which animal testing is not terrible and is actually necessary. I've met this burden by explaining how animal testing is necessary for the preservation of animals, which may also preserve the environment. \"Many people believe it is unjust to sacrifice one species for the benefit of another, and that animal cruelty is never justified, regardless of the benefits that come from it.\" - Con has committed the Argumentum ad populum fallacy, otherwise known as the bandwagon fallacy. [3] Using an appeal to the masses does not validly support one's argument. \"Some feel that it does not follow that a human --- Earth's most highly developed animal --- is considered more valuable than any other animal.\" - It doesn't matter how much we or animals are worth. If those people truly feel like this, they would all be vegans/vegetarians, which I'm sure is unlikely. We eat because we benefit from it, not because we devalue animals. The same goes for animal testing. - Animal testing has made huge medical breakthroughs in fighting breast cancer, Leukemia, HIV/AIDS, lung cancer, birth defects, diabetes, and the list goes on. [4] Those are the benefits we got from animal testing. Therefore, we don't do it because we devalue animals, but because it benefits us. \"Even when animals are not killed or harmed during experimentation, they are often subjected to great deals of stress. Some animal advocates believe that the animal's experience of stress could actually influence an experiment, making the results unusable.\" - It is important for judges to note that this entire sentence was plagiarized word for word from this website: http://www.ehow.com... *In fact, the rest of Con's argument on \"Expense\" and \"Necessity\" has also been plagiarized from the same website. Because they are not Con's arguments, I refuse to address them. This is a clear conduct violation. \"There are three general types of animal testing. Product testing is the testing of products such as soaps, cosmetics, household cleaners and pesticides on animals to ensure they are safe for human use. Research uses the testing of drugs and medical procedures on animals. Education and training uses animals to teach anatomy and to train medical studentsI have not seen any information for preserving animal testing plus Wikipedia literally anyone can put something on Wikipedia and it could be wrong\" - Con did not provide a clear definition for animal testing in both round 1 and round 2. Therefore, I was allowed to provide a definition that Con must abide by. My definition of \"Animal Testing\" was: \"The use of non-human animals in experiments.\" - My examples of preserving animals and the environment require non-human animals to be used in experiments. Therefore, it is still valid in the boundaries of this debate and considered animal testing. Sources: [1] http://www.merriam-webster.com... [2] http://wwf.panda.org... [3] http://en.wikipedia.org...

            "premise": "\"A ton of it is going to animal testing.\" This is a weak point because the funding to the sciences as is is little enough, and the information is worth much more than the costs of testing. Only a fraction of tax money is even going to animal testing at all and it is a ludicrous notion that 136 Million is a lot, \"Total federal revenues were $2.16 trillion in fiscal year 2010\" I did the math and exactly 0.00629% of tax dollars. Your pain argument is also ludicrous. You make a moral claim, but I could make a moral equilibrium by saying there pain is justified by the pain it saves us from. You are recommending rats are equal to us, \" At the most, a humans life MIGHT, in the best of circumstances, be worth two tested animals. But more than 100 million animals are used yearly to find a cure for something.\" We are far beyond rats in an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore \" rats get rid of many insects.\" is an invalid point because A. Rats carry insects that harm us as well and B. Rats in labs are bred especially for the purpose of testing, and otherwise wouldn't have been born. We kill so many rats a year to further our knowledge of science and to save lives. Rats wiped out huge portions of the european population with the black plague for none because they didnt know what they were doing, becasue they are RATS. \"Mice share more than 98% DNA with humans, therefore, animals are susceptible to many of the same health problems as humans.\" [3] and you said \"That means that just a few things in animals are the same as in humans.\" which is simply not true. The genetic similarities of mice and men is outstandingly close, and we use mice the most when researching. You said that \"95% of drugs passed by animal tests are immediately discarded as useless or dangerous to humans.\" Which is irrelevant considering that all of the major medicines developed in the past 5 years have used animals. Also you said, and I quote, \"rats take up 85% of the animal testing population.\" Which is not true, I never said that, I said \"Around 95% of all animals that are being tested are specially bred rats and mice\" I said rats and mice, meanwhile of that percentage only 18% are rats. That rabbit you pulled up has no sources whatsoever and as far as I know is probably used in testing hair products, which we aren't debating. You are simply trying to evoke emotions in the voters, thats not passion thats manipulation. Also your post about the murder is completely invalid. The reason humans are worth more than the mice being tested is that we are smarter! We aren't just small minded eating machines, he are thoughtful individuals that come together and form solutions to the problems regarding our race, like cancer, and those solutions often involve the testing of animals You said that your brother has diabetes. Want to know what keeps him alive? Insulin. And want to know how they made that? By animal testing. 1[http://www.dummies.com...] 2[http://www.history.com...] 3[http://ca-biomed.org...]",

Animal tests are the experiment that the humans do for such medical development and scientific development. Animals are comfortable, fest, and easy for the humans to do experiments since they have similar body structure like the humans. For example, chimpanzees share 99%of their DNA with the humans, and mice are 98% genetically similar to the humans. That may save the time of the experiment. Animal tests may give much help to the life time of the humans. Humans have life cycle, and these animal experiments may expand the humans' life cycles. It is because it deveops the medical curing system for the humans.Animal tests creates the products to be better and safe. Also, science became more and more important these days because of environmental problems and the development of technology. So, improving the science will be helpful. Also, animal tests may even benefit the animals themselves. If vaccines were not developed by animal testings, the animals might have died from some diseases. Animal testing benefits the health of the animals and the medical cares for them",

            "premise": "I have found so many flaws with your argument I'm just going to argue them all in short, two or three sentence arguments and then get on with my stuff.\"It could mean that in a test they use five or six at a time...just to clear that up.\"And how is that any better? That just makes it worse. Why do they test five or six at a time if the drug might fail anyway?! It's just another flaw in animal testing. Also, I have a LINK to back that up. So yes, I do get the concept.\"it might be necessary to sacrifice some non-sential life for the good of sentient ones.\"Animals have just as much right, if not more, to live on this planet than we do. Who is to say that animals aren't important? Who says humans are the most important? If anything, we are the least important, because we are destroying the environment. We haven't done anything to make this world a better place except for us. If anything, that quote is just selfish.\"Humans are not JUST animals.\"So neither are bunnies. Or horses. Or rats. What is your definition of \"just an animal?\" Sure, we're by far the smartest, but we are animals.\"We should do everything in our power to advance our kind.\" And why shouldn't any other animal have the right to do that, too?! \"The rest our made up of other small primates.\"Earlier, you said that \"95% are mice and rats.\" First off, it's 85% [1], not 95%, and second off, that means 15,000,000 animals aren't rodents, but rather bunnies, dogs, moneys, cats, fish, and in rare cases, frogs [1]. And what difference does it make that rodents are being tested? Because they're not cute and useless? Mice are cute and useful, and rats get rid of many insects. We need both of them for much more than animal testing.\"Shortening a life that is only 2-3 years in it of it self is completely minuscule.\"And when you multiply it by about 85,000,000...That's about 170,000,000 years of rodent life right there. And maybe, by a LONG shot, 250,000 human life years. That just does not add up. And I'm not going to get into the 7-year life of dogs and bunnies, let alone the long life of a cat.\"The following disease have had medicines made from animal research. Breast Cancer, Childhood Leukemia, Lung Cancer, (Prolonged life of people with) AIDs and HIV, Heart Disease, Diabetes\"Then why does my brother still have diabetes? Why am I reading of so many deaths from AIDS, about 1.9 million? [2]? What's the use of \"prolonging a life for 2 or three years,\" like you said? Does that only apply to humans? And heart disease is a huge problem, and breast cancer isn't getting much better. And lung cancer is still a death sentence.And now onto another few of my arguments.1. 95% of drugs passed by animal tests are immediately discarded as useless or dangerous to humans. [3]Would you think about that for a second? 95% of drugs that are potentially safe fail in humans. So that means that in less than 5% of the time, it is useful when they get a good sign. That means that just a few things in animals are the same as in humans. Just think about that. 88% of doctors agreed that animal testing is useless because of differences between humans and animals (this is said by the [3] link also.) Oh, and one more thing. 61% of all birth defects are due to drugs that passed in animals. Birth defects are up 200x since the post war times... when animal testing started. Every fact here is said by the [3] link.2. Rats are 37% effective in identifying what causes cancer to humans \u2013 less use than guessing. The experimenters said: \u201cwe would have been better off to have tossed a coin.\" [4]As you said, rats take up 85% of the animal testing population. And yet they have a small chance of successfully identifying what causes cancer in humans and how solve it. Scientists LITERALLY say they would be better off flipping a coin. This is more of a point than an argument, so I will have a second section to it.Second section: What humans suffer due to failed testsLast year, 106,000 people were killed due to medical issues due to tests of animal products. Each year, 2.1 million people are in the hospital due to medical treatments. An estimated 70,000 people in the UK are severely injured or KILLED by drugs that pass in animal testing. Wow. This is only per year.3. So this isn't murder?Every day, we sea murder controversy on the internet or a suspect getting jailed for killing a human, which is seen by many, if not all, as the worst possible thing that a human could do. What about killing thousands of ANIMALS per day? Why is that not a sin, or illegal, like murder? Do we really think that we are so highly above the animals that we should get to do that? If one person is jailed for killing another person, or possibly receiving a death sentence, why shouldn't a scientist be doing it? Let's take a look:Scientists are \"doing it for a good cause,\" killing many to save one. Murder is \"also for a good cause\" then. Killing one to reduce world's problems by one. It is reducing the amount of people on the Earth. If you are for animal testing, you are kind of for murder. I know I'm not for murder. And I know that I'm not for animal testing. This is what we are doing by testing animals. Look it in the eye and say, \"I'm sure it doesn't hurt one little bit.\" THANK YOU FOR READING AND GOD BLESS!!! :)[1] http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org...[2] http://www.who.int...[3] http://www.animalliberationfront.com...[4] http://www.vivisectioninformation.com...",

            "conclusion": "animal testing",
            "premise": "I am against animal testing on both moral and scientific grounds. Morally, animal testing is often extremely cruel and completely unnecessary. For example, I once saw some undercover footage from a laboratory in which dogs were being force-fed weedkiller. Allegedly, this was to see how toxic said weedkiller was. However, it had already been tested on humans, and the dogs were being given 50 times what had been established as a dangerous dose for humans - what possible reason could there have been for this? It is nothing short of torture, just like pouring shampoo into an animal's eyes just to see what happens, or infecting it with horrific diseases like cancer just to see if a potential cure works. I find these sorts of things utterly repugnant. Scientifically, testing products meant for humans on animals is unreliable and potentially dangerous. Animals react differently to humans to many substances, rendering many tests pointless. For example, a contraceptive called Tamoxifen was once developed which was tested on rats. It worked as intended, and was given to humans. However, it had the opposite effect on women, actually increasing their fertility! There are many other examples, some of which had much more harmful consequences. You may remember Thalidomide, a drug given to pregnant women to prevent morning sickness. It had been tested on animals and declared safe for humans, but it caused severe deformities in many of the babies born after their mothers had taken it. A couple of years ago a drug called TGN1412 was tested on some human volunteers, and very nearly killed them - they were on life support for some time, and were left with permanent health problems. Prior to being given to these people, this drug had already been tested on monkeys at a dose 500 times stronger than that which was given to the humans, without causing the monkeys any ill effects. Aspirin causes birth defects in cats. Penicillin kills guinea pigs. 6-azauridine, a cancer drug which can be used in humans for long periods, will kill dogs in a few days in even small doses. The list goes on. My personal view is that products meant for humans should be tested on humans. It's the only way to know if they will work as intended, and we have the choice of whether or not to volunteer for testing - animals are given no choice, they are simply used and discarded like objects. They have as much right to live as we do, and the right to live that life free of pain and misery. As noted philosopher Jeremy Bentham put it, the central question is not \"Can they reason?\" nor \"Can they talk?\", but \"Can they suffer?\" And obviously they can. Our greater intelligence gives us a responsibility to protect other species, not the right to use and abuse them in any way we see fit - that should be abhorrent to any sentient, compassionate being. Poisoning, shocking, burning, and killing animals is all in a day's work for vivisectors. If these atrocious acts were committed outside laboratories, they would be felonies. But animals suffer and die every day in laboratories with little or no protection from cruelty. Here are the top five reasons why it needs to stop: 1. It's unethical to sentence 100 million thinking, feeling animals to life in a laboratory cage and intentionally cause them pain, loneliness, and fear. 2. It's bad science. The Food and Drug Administration reports that 92 out of every 100 drugs that pass animal tests fail in humans. 3. It's wasteful. Animal experiments prolong the suffering of people waiting for effective cures by misleading experimenters and squandering precious money, time, and resources that could have been spent on human-relevant research. 4. It's archaic. Forward-thinking scientists have developed humane, modern, and effective non-animal research methods, including human-based microdosing, in vitro technology, human-patient simulators, and sophisticated computer modeling, that are cheaper, faster, and more accurate than animal tests. 5. The world doesn't need another eyeliner, hand soap, food ingredient, drug for erectile dysfunction, or pesticide so badly that it should come at the expense of animals' lives. For everyday ways to keep animals out of cruel experiments, see PETA's list of surprising ways to help animals in laboratories.",

Just because they use a certain amount per year, 100 million. That doesn't mean they kill one every 3 seconds just for the hell of it, it could mean that in a test they use five or six at a time...just to clear that up.

However, since thats often impossible, it might be necessary to sacrifice some non-sential life for the good of sentient ones. Furthermore, I feel you are trying to evoke emotions in me, but I am just as passionate about this as you are about that. DEFENSE 3- Humans are not JUST animals. I am not saying we AREN'T animals but we are also more than that, we have the most complex brains in the animal kingdom and more importantly- WE are human, and we should do everything in our power to advance our kind. Argument 1- Around 95% of all animals that are being tested are specially bred rats and mice, .25% our Non-Human Primates. The rest our made up of other small primates. The reason rodents are so popular is because of there short life spans which allow for speedier disease development in the rodents. Shortening a life that is only 2-3 years in it of it self is completely minuscule compared to the amount of years of human lives they can be saving. The following disease have had medicines made from animal research. Breast Cancer Childhood Leukemia Lung Cancer (Prolonged life of people with) AIDs and HIV Heart Disease Diabete And many more!

            "conclusion": "Animal Testing",
            "premise": "My opponent made good arguments. My turn. :) Society: Animal Testing is just unscientific. You cannot replicate the exact results to humans. Apes and rats do share 99% of their DNA, but that means little to nothing it is still not 100%. Science needs to be 100% concrete to defined as science, therefore animal testing is unscientific. What does DNA similarity even mean? Bananas share 50% of their DNA with humans. Should we test on them? Of course not, that would lead to faulty results, just like how animal testing leads to faulty results. Humans share 100% of their DNA. Still, even with that, drugs react differently to everyone. DNA compatability does nothing to prove it's effectiveness. Animal testings does little to contribute society in the modern era. In 2004, a paper published in the British Medical Journal concluded that there was little actual scientific evidence that animal experimentation was essential to medical research. Experimenters perpetually attempt to justify the terrible suffering they inflict on animals by claiming there is a cure just around the corner, but decades of animal experiments on AIDS vaccines (more than 80 that passed animal tests have failed in people), strokes (150 treatments have worked in animals and failed in people) and other diseases have failed to deliver any cures for the millions of people who suffer from these conditions. That's because while humans and animals are alike in our ability to feel pain, fear, sadness, joy, and other emotions, we vary enormously in our physical reactions to toxins and diseases and in how our bodies metabolise drugs. Trying to apply the results of animal tests to humans is a shot in the dark. US Food and Drug Administration figures show that 92% of drugs which pass animal trials are later found to be unsafe or ineffective in human trials. Everytime humanity takes one step forward, animal testing takes us two steps back. Human and animal testing agree only 5-25% of the time, according to Huntingdon Life Sciences. Corneal transplants were delayed for 90 years and blood transfusions were delayed 200 years due to animal studies. The cure AIDS could've possibly already been found if it wasn't for animal testing My opponent says, the benefits of animal testing outweight the risks. I have posted a link that says 50 ways how animal testing has hurt humans. I would like my opponent to link a list that says 50 or more ways that animal testing benefited humans. 50 WAYS ANIMAL TESTING HARMS HUMANITY: http://www.healingcancernaturally.com... Inhumanity and animal cruelty: Animal testing harms animals. It's just plain wrong. Those animal suffer, feel pain and are lonely just like people do. Life in a cage or between four walls, doesn't sound like life it sounds like prison. These animals deserve to be with their family roaming free in the wild. They suffer fron stress and anxiety just like we do. The Animal Welfare Act is poorly regulated by the government. Alot of this cruelty and pain happens in private behind closed doors, which the government has no control over. Sure, there are many scientist who love animals and try to protect them. Though there are just as many or more, who beat and bash animals, who treat them like dummys and punching bag rather than a real life. Every year, tens of millions of animals are dissected, infected, injected, gassed, burned and blinded in hidden laboratories on college campuses and research facilities throughout the U.S. Still more animals are used to test the safety of cosmetics, household cleansers and other consumer products. These innocent primates, dogs, cats, rabbits, rodents and other animals are used against their will as research subjects in experiments and procedures that would be considered sadistically cruel were they not conducted in the name of science. This is fact, not made up there is plenty evidence that shows this. Just look up \"Animal Testing\" any where on Youtube and you will see the cruelty these creatures face agaisnt their will. Researchers claim that they must be allowed unfettered access to animals for experiments in order to find cures for human diseases, yet they refuse to address the serious ethical problems of torturing sentient creatures for research purposes. On top of that, over-reliance on animal experimentation has historically hindered scientific advancement and endangered human safety because results from animal research typically cannot be applied to humans. In fact, scientists could save more human lives by using humane non-animal research and testing methods that are more accurate and efficient. Proof Animal Cruelty Exist in Laboratories: \"USDA Charges UCSF for Animal Welfare Act Violations\" In 2005, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) charged the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with 89 violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA). Instead of defending themselves in court and revealing their mistreatment of animals to public scrutiny, UCSF chose to pay a $92,500 fine, one of the largest ever levied against a research institution by the USDA. \"Coulston Foundation Forced Out of Business\" At one time, the Coulston Foundation had possession of an astonishing 650 chimpanzees almost half the population of chimpanzees used for research in the United States. Frederick Coulston was flush with millions in federal funding, as well as contracts with pharmaceutical, chemical and medical device companies, and was pursuing plans to become the sole source of chimpanzees for research in the country. They later closed, humiliated.\" These are just a few examples that cruelty exist no matter what regulations. Philosophy: Quoting one of the greatest peace maker in history. Animal life is equivalent in value to human life. Mahatma Gandhi - \"To my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being. The more helpless the creature, the more that it is entitled to protection by man from the cruelty of man.\" My opponent mentions, the analogy of lions and gazelles. Yet animal testing has nothing to do with the \"predator/prey\" complex. A lion needs to kill a gazelle to survive. A human doesn't need to hurt a rodent, ape or dog/cat to survive. We survived thousands of year without animal testing. Animals don't exist to serve humans. In cosmetics, do we need more mascara? Did caveman use hairspray? Don't we have enough eyeliner? In medicine, it's not helping it's hurting us. Hurting an animal for experiments is like hurting a pet, which people would not do. People would never want their own pets tested; why other animals? People that have pets typically develop an affection and even love for their pets, and often believe that their pets return that love and affection. They generally believe that animals have feelings, express happiness, and feel pain and suffering at times. Most would never allow their own pets to be subjected to testing for most of the above reasons. Why then would they believe it acceptable to subject other animals to such testing; animals that have the same capacity for the above feelings? Cost: My opponent never gave a counter agument. All wasteful spending must be reduced. Animal testing is wasteful since it does little to nothing to help society. Alternatives: Ninety-four percent of animal testing is done to determine the safety of cosmetics and household products leaving only 6% for medical research! Animal experiments can be replaced by at least 450 methods known at this time, according to the scientific community. Cloning of human skin has already been done. Why are still burning animals?

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting this debate! Finding the Cure Animal testing is used in the process of finding a cure for diseases but I wouldn't say that the cure for a disease is found just from testing on animals. The diseases get cured when they start using human trails and improving the drugs at the last stage for the best results. You said that \"The alternatives to animal testing are not reliable\", but most of the time is animal testing isn't reliable either. Furthermore once scientist start human trails, that is when they learn that some drugs that were tested on animals whether they have any effect on humans or not. In today's day and age there is more non-human testing methods being developed. Since scientists are able to create human tissue and have the actual human gene information I believe there is no point in going back to testing on animals. There are scientist who are working on human tissues and have created human ears and bladders through scientific experiments. If scientist enforced these techniques more than animal testing can become obsolete and not needed anymore. Technology The technology in this time is very advanced and can offer a great alternative to animal testing. Sure, using a computer might not be as good as using real organisms but it can help and reduce the amount of animals being tested on enormously. Computers can be an effective tool for conducting certain experiments and research. Technology is also advancing rapidly each year offering more and more reliable testing techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also a great piece of technology that can be used to help examine diseases through human scans. Negative Effects You mentioned that animal testing reduces the risks of negative effects that a drug can have on human but even after animal testing scientist don't know how the drug will affect the human body. There are many warning signs and side effects on almost every drug out there, so testing on animals doesn't take all of the negative effects away. Animal testing may even be the reason why there are so many side effects on medication nowadays. Unfair Treatment Even though animal test may reduce some negative effects and may reduce human suffering it still isn't right on many accounts. Animal testing is an unfair and excruciating process that innocent animals have to endure. You stated that, \"We live in a society that values human life over the lives of animals\". Which is very true but who are we to say that we are more important than other living animals? It's morally wrong to inflict pain on one species in order to help another. Just because animals cannot verbally express their emotions and feelings doesn't mean they don't have any or feel pain. The fact that these animals can feel everything that is being tested on to them through the experiments makes this whole issue unsettling. There are company's out there that don't need to be using animal testing but are anyway. The FDA doesn't require animal testing for cosmetics but companies are still killing millions of animals each year while they test there cosmetic products on animals. Researchers should be using more reliable test subjects instead. However, there are a few companies that do use non-animal testing to make sure there products are safe like Avon and Mary Kay. More companies need to realize what they are actually administering to the animals and need to try alternative techniques because they do exist and they are available.",

Considering the animals must be fed, housed, cared for and treated with the drug or similar experimental substance, longevity of testing, and the price of animals themselves. Finally, the reaction to the drug/experimental substance in an animal's body is different from the reaction in a human's.

            "premise": "I agree that animal testing has provided valuable information in finding vaccines and saving thousands of lives. However, animals should not be the cost of us trying to find cures/vaccines for HUMAN diseases. Animals were not put on this earth to be poked and prodded with needles at the sake of scientific advancements. Some are here to be companions to humans while others are to roam among the wild. \"Humans are the only hunters who kill when not hungry.\" -Steven Spielberg. Right this very moment there are chimps being tested for HIV, but ironically enough, they can't acquire HIV. There is only one monkey who has ever died from AIDS, Jerom, and it was only because he was injected with three different strains of the virus which ultimately created a hybrid strain. Some people argue that \"animals don't have feelings,\" but just because they can't talk to tell you that they're in pain, doesn't mean that they aren't. Animals can become happy, sad, depressed, etc. In his final months that Jerom was alive, he became severely depressed and frustrated. His \"keepers\" say that they would see him sobbing quietly and would even curl up in a fetal position to comfort himself. Does that sound like an animal that doesn't have feelings? Rodents are almost always the ones used in research, however, rodents are only 37% effective in determining the cause of cancer in humans. Flipping a coin would be more accurate. 95% of drugs passed by animal tests are immediately discarded as useless or dangerous to humans. An example would be the drug Vioxx, a drug to treat arthritis. It was found to be safe in monkeys (and five other animal species) but has been estimated to have caused around 320,000 heart attacks/strokes and about 140,000 deaths worldwide. So not only did the drug cost thousands of animal lives, but nearly a half of a million humans were impacted, and not for the better. If scientists want to find a cure/vaccine for human diseases, they should use willing HUMANS to find it, not poor helpless animals. I know animals can't talk, but I guarantee that is they could, they would be begging for freedom, pleading to be let out of the cages and released into their natural habitat. Despite what you might think, there are alternatives to animal testing. One that is catching the eyes of pharmaceutical companies is a device called \"organ-on-a-chip.\" It's a microchip lined with human cells through which air, nutrients, blood, and infection-causing bacteria could be pumped. They are meant to mimic the function of human organs, which will be a huge scientific advancement. Not only can it eradicate animals from being tested on, but it will provide more precise and accurate information as to what happens to the human body after being injected with a potential drug. It's more accurate because it's using human cells and not animal cells. No more playing the guessing game when it comes to determining what will happen to the human body when given a drug.

            "premise": "****REBUTTALS**** \"Animal Testing is just unscientific. You cannot replicate the exact results to humans. Apes and rats do share 99% of their DNA, but that means little to nothing it is still not 100%. Science needs to be 100% concrete to defined as science, therefore animal testing is unscientific.\"This is completely false. You have no proof to sustain the belief that animal testing is innefective. In my last argument I proved how animal testing has helped overcome and cure many dis-eases, and unlike you, backed the claim up with evidence. \"DNA compatability does nothing to prove it's effectiveness.\"It has everything to do with effectiveness. I have proven this. Your point false because it lacks the evidence to support this emotion riddled statement. \"In 2004, a paper published in the British Medical Journal concluded that there was little actual scientific evidence that animal experimentation was essential to medical research.\" First off the article which you are referring to is based on human modification to animals. The entire article is emotion based. This attack fails to work, becuase you forget that animal testing results in saving hundreds of HUMAN lives. Let's take a look at the article. It says that 80 animals died in the process of animal testing, for the aids cure. What the article leaves out, is that the cures have worked on humans. This is where the validity of the speceism argument works out. If the lives of 80 animals are spent, such that the lives of 1,000,000 humans are saved, is it not beneficial then to use animal testing? This is the article we are referring to btw: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk... \"My opponent says, the benefits of animal testing outweight the risks. I have posted a link that says 50 ways how animal testing has hurt humans. I would like my opponent to link a list that says 50 or more ways that animal testing benefited humans.\"This is just ridiculous. First you cannot make an argument without copying and pasting everything from a link that weas so obviously googled, and found on the first page. Second, you fail to read my arguments. I have provided a list of all the ways that animal testing has benefitted human kind, in that it cures diseases, and save millions of human lives.http://www.amprogress.org...Want more sources?Here you go.http://www.amprogress.org...http://www.ca-biomed.org...;http://www.nih.gov...http://www.pharma.org...;http://www.heart.org...http://www.cancer.org...;http://www.liverfoundation.org...http://www.findacure.org...;http://www.jdrf.org...http://www.marchofdimes.com...;http://my.clevelandclinic.org...http://www.pedaids.org...http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org...https://www.michaeljfox.org...http://www.stjude.org...Every single site I just listed, are proven medical centers that have been benefitted from the research animal testing has done. Their are hundreds and hundreds more of them. So some animals die, but for what cause? You almost make it sound as if we are strapping then down on tables and brutally torturing them for sheer pleasure. Naive animal rights activists blindly following PETA's lies, compleetely astound me.\"My opponent mentions, the analogy of lions and gazelles. Yet animal testing has nothing to do with the \"predator/prey\" complex. A lion needs to kill a gazelle to survive. A human doesn't need to hurt a rodent, ape or dog/cat to survive.\"Wrong. We do. Hundreds of thousands of people die from cancer, HIV, Aids, strokes, etc everyday. Animal testing has put a significant decrease to these trends. Not all animals die from animal testing, in fact in my previous arguments, I show exactly how good their living conditions actually are. You completely missed this, and instead just continued to copy and paste from your tree hugging PETA sources. \"My opponent never gave a counter agument. All wasteful spending must be reduced. Animal testing is wasteful since it does little to nothing to help society.\"WTF?!?!?!?!?! You cannot be serious. You haven't provided counter arguments to more than half of everything I have said! In fact you completely ignore 50% of my arguments and sources, yet you have the gall to call me out on not making an argument that I did in fact make? Un-Be-Lie-Vable. PROVE TO ME HOW IT IS WASTEFUL IF IT SAVES HUMAN LIVES. Ninety-four percent of animal testing is done to determine the safety of cosmetics and household products leaving only 6% for medical research!Proof, or GTFO.Animal experiments can be replaced by at least 450 methods known at this time, according to the scientific community.I have dis-proved all your methods. False dichotomy.Cloning of human skin has already been done. Why are still burning animals?Cloning of human skin cells does nothing for scientific and medical examiners concerning the preservation of medical research for curing disease.****CONCLUSION**** My opponent lacks sufficient evidence for more than half of his claims, and fails to refute the majority of the statistics, and evidence I have offered. My opponent has not upheld his burden of proof. All of his arguments are an emotionally unstable attack from a manipulated structure of what he thinks is argumentation. I ask that he reads over all the evidence I have provided in the first two rounds, and come at me with a better argument for the following round. Thankyou.",

            "premise": "The most reason animal testing should be abolished is, we should respect animal.As you know, mankind and animal have one same thing, it is both are organism. The ultimate of reason that we are living is because, to enjoy our life, I mean to make fun with others. But how would you feel if you are trapped in a small room to used by others just because you're weaker than them? You'll said that it's unfair, because they don't even ask about your position. Some might said we shouldn't treat human and animal likewise. Anyway what I think like is this \" If we are birthed in Earth, every organism no matter of their power, must treated same.\" Because, animals didn't choose to be animal, they didn't choose to be weaker than human, they didn't even choose to be laboratory animals. According to these reasons, I believe animal testing should be banned.---Source: http://animal-testing.procon.org...--- If you have enough time, I recommend you to read about--- Animal testing is cruel and inhumane. According to Humane Society International, animals used in experiments are commonly subjected to force feeding, forced inhalation, food and water deprivation, prolonged periods of physical restraint, the infliction of burns and other wounds to study the healing process, the infliction of pain to study its effects and remedies, and \"killing by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, neck-breaking, decapitation, or other means.\" [47] The Draize eye test, used by cosmetics companies to evaluate irritation caused by shampoos and other products, involves rabbits being incapacitated in stocks with their eyelids held open by clips, sometimes for multiple days, so they cannot blink away the products being tested. [48, 49] The commonly used LD50 (lethal dose 50) test involves finding out which dose of a chemical will kill 50% of the animals being used in the experiment. [65, 102] The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported in 2010 that 97,123 animals suffered pain during experiments while being given no anesthesia for relief, including 1,395 primates, 5,996 rabbits, 33,652 guinea pigs, and 48,015 hamsters. [26]Alternative testing methods now exist that can replace the need for animals. In vitro (in glass) testing, such as studying cell cultures in a petri dish, can produce more relevant results than animal testing because human cells can be used. [15] Microdosing, the administering of doses too small to cause adverse reactions, can be used in human volunteers, whose blood is then analyzed. Artificial human skin, such as the commercially available products EpiDerm and ThinCert, is made from sheets of human skin cells grown in test tubes or plastic wells and can produce more useful results than testing chemicals on animal skin. [15, 50, 51] Microfluidic chips (\"organs on a chip\"), which are lined with human cells and recreate the functions of human organs, are in advanced stages of development. Computer models, such as virtual reconstructions of human molecular structures, can predict the toxicity of substances without invasive experiments on animals. [50]Animals are very different from human beings and therefore make poor test subjects. The anatomic, metabolic, and cellular differences between animals and people make animals poor models for human beings. [52] Paul Furlong, Professor of Clinical Neuroimaging at Aston University (UK), states that \"it's very hard to create an animal model that even equates closely to what we're trying to achieve in the human.\" [53] Thomas Hartung, Professor of evidence-based toxicology at Johns Hopkins University, argues for alternatives to animal testing because \"we are not 70 kg rats.\" [54] Drugs that pass animal tests are not necessarily safe. The 1950s sleeping pill thalidomide, which caused 10,000 babies to be born with severe deformities, was tested on animals prior to its commercial release. [5] Later tests on pregnant mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, and hamsters did not result in birth defects unless the drug was administered at extremely high doses. [109, 110] Animal tests on the arthritis drug Vioxx showed that it had a protective effect on the hearts of mice, yet the drug went on to cause more than 27,000 heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths before being pulled from the market. [55, 56]Animal tests may mislead researchers into ignoring potential cures and treatments. Some chemicals that are harmful to animals prove valuable when used by humans. Aspirin, for example, is dangerous for some animal species, and Fk-506 (tacrolimus), used to lower the risk of organ transplant rejection, was \"almost shelved\" because of animal test results, according to neurologist Aysha Akhtar, MD, MPH. [105] A June 1, 2006 report on Slate.com stated that a \"source of human suffering may be the dozens of promising drugs that get shelved when they cause problems in animals that may not be relevant for humans.\" [106] 95% of animals used in experiments are not protected by the Animal Welfare Act. The AWA does not cover rats, mice, fish and birds, which comprise around 95% of the animals used in research. The AWA covered 1,134,693 animals used for testing in fiscal year 2010, which leaves around 25 million other animals that are not covered. These animals are especially vulnerable to mistreatment and abuse without the protection of the AWA. [1, 2, 26]Animal tests do not reliably predict results in human beings. 94% of drugs that pass animal tests fail in human clinical trials. [57] According to neurologist Aysha Akhtar, MD, MPH, over 100 stroke drugs that were effective when tested on animals have failed in humans, and over 85 HIV vaccines failed in humans after working well in non-human primates. [58] A 2013 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) found that nearly 150 clinical trials (human tests) of treatments to reduce inflammation in critically ill patients have been undertaken, and all of them failed, despite being successful in animal tests. [59, 58] A 2013 study in Archives of Toxicology stated that \"The low predictivity of animal experiments in research areas allowing direct comparisons of mouse versus human data puts strong doubt on the usefulness of animal data as key technology to predict human safety.\" [60] Animal tests are more expensive than alternative methods and are a waste of government research dollars. Humane Society International compared a variety of animal tests with their in vitro counterparts. An \"unscheduled DNA synthesis\" animal test costs $32,000, while the in vitro alternative costs $11,000. A \"rat phototoxicity test\" costs $11,500, whereas the non-animal equivalent costs $1,300. A \"rat uterotrophic assay\" costs $29,600, while the corresponding in vitro test costs $7,200. A two-species lifetime cancer study can cost from $2 million to $4 million, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends $14 billion of its $31 billion annual budget on animal research. [61, 62, 63]Most experiments involving animals are flawed, wasting the lives of the animal subjects. A 2009 peer-reviewed study found serious flaws in the majority of publicly funded US and UK animal studies using rodents and primates. 87% of the studies failed to randomize the selection of animals (a technique used to reduce \"selection bias\") and 86% did not use \"blinding\" (another technique to reduce researcher bias). Also, \"only 59% of the studies stated the hypothesis or objective of the study and the number and characteristics of the animals used.\" [64] Since the majority of animals used in biomedical research are killed during or after the experiments, and since many suffer during the studies, the lives and wellbeing of animals are routinely sacrificed for poor research. [65]Animals can suffer like humans do, so it is speciesism to experiment on them while we refrain from experimenting on humans. All suffering is undesirable, whether it be in humans or animals. Discriminating against animals because they do not have the cognitive ability, language, or moral judgment that humans do is no more justifiable than discriminating against human beings with severe mental impairments. [66, 67] As English philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote in the 1700s, \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" [66]The Animal Welfare Act has not succeeded in preventing horrific cases of animal abuse in research laboratories. In Mar. 2009, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) found 338 possible violations of the Animal Welfare Act at the federally funded New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) in Louisiana. Some of the primates housed at NIRC were suffering such severe psychological stress that they engaged in self-mutilation, \"tearing gaping wounds into their arms and legs.\" Video footage shows infant chimps screaming as they are forcibly removed from their mothers, infant primates awake and alert during painful experiments, and chimpanzees being intimidated and shot with a dart gun. [68] In a 2011 incident at the University of California at Davis Center for Neuroscience, \"three baby mice were found sealed alive in a plastic baggie and left unattended\" on a laboratory counter, according to the Sacramento Bee. [69]Religious traditions tell us to be merciful to animals, so we should not cause them suffering by experimenting on them. In the Bible, Proverbs 12:10 states: \"A righteous [man] regardeth the life of his beast...\" [70] The Hindu doctrine of ahimsa teaches the principle of not doing harm to other living beings. [103] The Buddhist doctrine of right livelihood dissuades Buddhists from doing any harm to animals. [46]Medical breakthroughs involving animal research may still have been made without the use of animals. There is no evidence that animal experiments were essential in making major medical advances, and if enough money and resources were devoted to animal-free alternatives, other solutions would be found.",

            "premise": "Should animal testing exist or not? When animals' protectors say absolutely no, other people, such as scientists say yes. It is hard to decide who is right and who is wrong. Using animals for humans' purposes started from the earliest times. Natalie Kustcher, (2010), explains, experiments on anmals existed even in antique times, Greeks and Roman used them for vivisection. After World War II the amount of medical experiments on animals increased enormously. Animals were used for lots of purposes: for medicine, biology, education and training of doctors, for developing new vaccines and drugs, also they were used for cosmetics. This situation caused many debates and controversies. Especially now, when we have various organizations which protect animals, this issue has become a hot topic for discussion. From one point of view people understand that we should care about animals. They say that testing drugs and other things, for human benefits is unethical. From another point of view people like doctors and scientist claim, that animal testing is a very important activity for science, medicine and whole humanity. If to compare who is better to be used to conduct an experiment, of course people will choose animals instead of themselves, even though they realize that animals are also important creatures in our life. However, testing animals for new medicine showed most accurate results. Millions of experiments, which gave different results, were conducted by a great number of scientists. What is interesting, the results of drug testing on animals are recognized as the most accurate. Of course there are some alternative methods which can only predict the reaction, but cannot guarantee human safety. In this case results got from animal researches are the most reliable. Jaime Harvey, (n. d.), gives an example of a successful testing Parkinson's disease on animals, which is have already saved millions of people's lives. Whereas computers cannot give accurate and reliable results. According to Jaime Harvey, (n. d.), animal testing plays a big and important role in medical development in the last two centuries. The proportion of successful results from animal testing is more than 70 %. Due to testing drugs on animals, now we have antibiotics and vaccines that have saved many people. Dr Jane Goodall . (as cited by Simon Festing ) says that, people got used to take all conveniences from life and forget, that all those depend on medical researches on animals. Antibiotics and anesthetics are possible now due to animal testing. As an example the polio vaccine alone saved many lives. In addition, the remedy that now saves thousands of women with breast cancer was developed through testing on mice. Moreover, nowadays treatment and control of diseases and sufferings are possible through animal research. Over 70% of Nobel prizes in medicine on inventing new drugs have involved the use of animals. Even such known and useful drug like aspirin, which controls pain, was created based on animal testing. For instance, before using animals for testing drugs, there was such bad illness like the Thalidomide. This disease infect pregnant women and in the 50's babies were born whether without legs or hands. The treatment for this illness was successfully tested on rats so today it is not a problem . Additionally we must take into account such fact that inventing of useful drugs like insulin, Tetanus vaccines, AIDS treatment are possible owing to experiments on animals. (Jaime Harvey, n. d.).All we know such illness like diabet. And as we know the cure to this disease, especially insulin was invented due to testing on dogs. So nowadays testing drugs on animals has become so usual that people forgot about origin of most remedies. Tanks to animals, currently, we have drugs to treat people and it makes possible to save millions of lives every day, every hour, every second.",

            "premise": "Introduction The status quo is that animals are widely and generally used to be experimented on with certain chemicals and products to find out if those certain chemical and products are safe and effective to humans. Thus, it is the burden of the Con to prove why this status quo should change. He must provide strong arguments supported by evidence and alternatives as to why his proposal should be accepted. On other hand, I will be defend the status quo by also providing good arguments backed by pieces of evidence. The proposal of Con is ambiguous as he fails to set the parameters of this debate as to what extent the ban on animal testing should be, whether it is absolute or not. Because of that, I would assume that it is an absolute ban that he wants. Rebuttals: a. Animals should not be tested on because animal testing is cruel and inhumane. Response: It is given that animals do experience cruelty and pain to some extent. However, the question is not whether they experience pain, but whether that pain is justified. I would say that it is justified because the benefits outweigh the cost. Take note that scientists inflict pain on animals not for fun but for research. Consequently, this research would greatly enhance both human and animal lives and welfare. (I would elaborate this later) b. A 2011 poll of nearly 1,000 biomedical scientists conducted by the science journal Nature found that more than 90% \"agreed that the use of animals in research is essential. Response: Con, thank you for giving this statistics that would support my case. c. Other alternatives to animal testing exists. Response: Living systems like human beings and animals are extremely complex. Studying cell cultures in a petri dish, while sometimes useful, does not provide the opportunity to study interrelated processes occurring in the central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system. Evaluating a drug for side effects requires a circulatory system to carry the medicine to different organs. Also, conditions such as blindness and high blood pressure cannot be studied in tissue cultures. Computer models can only be reliable if accurate information gleaned from animal research is used to build the models in the first place. [16] Furthermore, even the most powerful supercomputers are unable to accurately simulate the workings of complex organs such as the brain.1 In short, those alternatives you stated are not as effective as animal testing. With your alternatives, it would only endanger the lives of humans for producing inaccurate results. Arguments: a. Animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments The California Biomedical Research Association states that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. [Experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. The polio vaccine, tested on animals, reduced the global occurrence of the disease from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 223 cases in 2012. Animal research has also contributed to major advances in understanding and treating conditions such as breast cancer, brain injury, childhood leukemia, cystic fibrosis, malaria, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, and many others, and was instrumental in the development of pacemakers, cardiac valve substitutes, and anesthetics. Chris Abee, Director of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's animal research facility, states that \"we wouldn't have a vaccine for hepatitis B without chimpanzees,\" and says that the use of chimps is \"our best hope\" for finding a vaccine for Hepatitis C, a disease that kills 15,000 people every year in the United States. 2 Moreover, because animal research, many diseases that once killed millions of people every year are either treatable or have been eradicated altogether. Immunizations against polio, diphtheria, mumps, rubella and hepatitis save countless lives, and the survival rates from many major diseases are at an all-time high, thanks to the discovery of new drugs, medical devices and surgical procedures. According to the American Cancer Society, the fight against cancer has seen 24 significant biomedical advances in the past 30 years.3 Similarly, Animal research for animal health also has resulted in many life-saving and life-extending treatments for cats, dogs, farm animals, wildlife and endangered species. Pacemakers, artificial joints, organ transplants, freedom from arthritic pain, and vaccines for rabies, distemper, parvo virus, infectious hepatitis, anthrax, tetanus and feline leukemia contribute to longer, happier and healthier lives for animals. New treatments for glaucoma, heart disease, cancer and hip dysplasia can save, extend or enhance the life of a beloved pet, and new reproductive techniques are helping to protect threatened species.4 b. Animals themselves benefit from the results of animal testing. If vaccines were not tested on animals, millions of animals would have died from rabies, distemper, feline leukemia, infectious hepatitis virus, tetanus, anthrax, and canine parvo virus. Treatments for animals developed using animal testing also include pacemakers for heart disease and remedies for glaucoma and hip dysplasia. [] Animal testing has also been instrumental in saving endangered species from extinction, including the black-footed ferret, the California condor and the tamarins of Brazil. [Koalas, ravaged by an epidemic of sexually transmitted chlamydia and now classified as endangered in some regions of Australia, are being tested with new chlamydia vaccines that may stall the animal's disappearance. [The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) endorses animal testing. 5 c. Animals are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways. Chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA with humans, and mice are 98% genetically similar to humans. [All mammals, including humans, are descended from common ancestors, and all have the same set of organs (heart, kidneys, lungs, etc.) that function in essentially the same way with the help of a bloodstream and central nervous system. Because animals and humans are so biologically similar, they are susceptible to many of the same conditions and illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. 6 Sources: 1 2Animal testing.

They might be right too but researches have figured out that animals are a lot more like us. The animals have feelings just like us. They can feel the same pain as we can and I find it is hard to understand why people fail to see that. It has been proven that pigs can feel pain, affection, excitement, experience stress and even feel love. They can get depressed very easily if they are denied to interact with each other or isolated. How is that different from us? Won't we feel depressed if we don't interact with other people? Yes, these tests on animals have saved human lives but for what costs? Millions upon millions of animals that are caged and tortured their entire life. Some of these medications do not even work in the end. The animals died for nothing at all.

            "premise": "Finding the cure You seem to be informing me on a lot of information on diabetes but fail to elaborating on how exactly animal testing was able to find the treatment for the disease and the side effects from it. You mentioned that animal testing had produced treatment for Type 1 diabetes and it did but there were complications. The insulin that was used to treat the patients used to cause a lot of allergic reactions to the people who took the insulin. That was because the body saw the insulin as being foreign and would cause allergic reactions. Animal testing alone wasn't able to make the drug officially safe to take. Recently with the new technology that has been developed scientist were able to make human insulin in lavatories using more advanced technology to make sure it is safe for people to take. Technology The technology does exist now but it just isn't has advanced as it will be in years to come. However, we do have some advance technology now, that is how scientist are able to experiment with cell culture and create human tissue. What's wrong with looking into the future? I don't see how it is irrelevant just because it doesn't deal with animal testing right now. It's not going to take that long for technology to get upgraded and completely take away animals testing for good. Negative Effects I did not say that we should move straight to human trials without performing other test beforehand. I said we should use other methods before we use humans. Scientist should perform on human tissues and use other non-animal experiments, like with computers before we use humans to reduce any negative effects it can have. Volunteering When scientist's use other methods with technology before they use humans they won't need to do a millions test on humans like they do with animals. With using technology that will save more lives from being lost either its humans or animals. I think scientist will be able to find a good amount of people who are will to help with science researching because they want to help find cures for these diseases. Just because a drug was tested on animals doesn't mean more people will be okay with having that same drug tested on them. Many people might feel safer having a drug tested on them if it was experimented on with technology and human tissues instead of having it tested on animals. Since animals bodies can be very different than ours. Developing A great tool scientist should use is have one database that will be able to show what drug combinations work with others on humans. So scientist can see what drugs have been used and what works and what doesn't. The advantage with that is it will save many lives' either being humans or animals. Unfair treatment If The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or IACUC have created methods for animal testing to keep it humane then why are animals still being tested unfairly? I don't think whether or not scientist follow those regulations would be another debate because them not treating the animals fairly is part of the reason why animal testing is cruel and not needed. Clearly the scientists who are performing these tests on the animals don't care much about the animal's well-being or they won't be in that field of this kind of research. So giving animal's pain medication that could interfere with the drug they are testing probably isn't something they are willing to do.",

            "premise": "Firstly, I'd like to ask my opponent a question for clarification of this debate's rules and parameters.To my opponent: Being that it is that the rules dictate a correct use of conventional grammar and spelling, is it out of bounds for me to point out grammatical and spelling errors made? I'm typically not very strict as long as the point is made, but the rules seem to obligate that I point them out. Is it optional? Is it mandatory? Is it advised against? I'd like to be clear on how we're dealing with that. That's all. /opponentSociety's Sympathizations to Species Sans-HumanIt's pretty obvious that animals deserve our attention if anyone deserves our attention. Animals often surpass humans in many areas of intelligence, strength, and speed, and have more practical use in our society than what they're used as today (tortured, eaten, and all that other stuff that my opponent will most surely mention).Of course, the body of scientific knowledge that led up to this is exactly that: Scientific knowledge. Knowledge deduced, induced, and abduced through scientific rigor. We know what we know of animals through research, experimentation, and testing.Testing is vital to our understanding of the natural world. We test several phenomena under specific circumstances to understand them. That's simply what it is. We test on humans all the time, and are doing so right now, why should animals be any different or \"special?\" We could treat animals differently from us in terms of ethics and such, but that doesn't ensure that that treatment would be humane. So, just as we test humans with science, we should treat animals with the same rigor.The only problem I can see is the lack of consent. They're born, and they're tested. However, if the standard of living is sufficient for those tested, I don't see the problem. Consent is not necessary for humans when they are born into a government in which the standard of living is sufficient. Born into a nation with sufficient resources to feed and nurture everyone, is one not a citizen until they have the age to give consent for such things? In the same sense, do we have to condition an animal to learn between two choices so that they understand to give consent every time? We have the ability to do that, but it would be inefficient and unnecessary.That is my argument for why animal testing is vital and should not be illegal.With my arguments made, I'd like to rebut my opponent with the remainder of this round.Obligatorily Opposing My Opponent's ObligingsMy opponent's first point is that animals feel pain. My opponent states that when we test animals, the procedure involves sticking chemicals down their eyes, as an example of testing being inhumane.There is absolutely no evidence that this is part of any standard procedure in typical animal testing. My opponent cites no sources, despite dictating in the rules of this argument that that is a necessity. So far, my opponent has broken the majority of the rules set by their own self.The claim that this is something that's done to ensure that their capacity in pain is sufficient for testing is a rather big claim, so I don't understand why my opponent would breeze right past it without properly giving a source.The next point my opponent makes is that people in jail make stronger candidates for testing.In case my opponent actually means jail instead of prison, I'm going to make an argument against that. What!? Being in jail does not strip you of all citizen and consensual rights! That's not how jail works!In the case that my opponent did misspell/miscommunicate what was meant to be communicated, it's worth noting that experiments were done on prisoners for a very long time. The protection of prisoners was heightened recently due to abuse of scientific conduct. I don't see it as being a dilemma, an ultimatum between animals and prisoners. They're all worth testing. Disqualifying a batch is unfortunate, but we've still got batches aplenty.To my opponent: Of utmost urgency, I'd like you to address the following points first: Clarification of the rules; How animal testing is inherently inhumane. The rest can be replied and rebutted to in your own time and pace. Thank you. /opponent",

            "conclusion": "Animal Testing",
            "premise": "To address the concerns of my opponent, I have never stated that animal testing is 100 percent conclusive. In relation to human trials, animals simply provide the next best model. Physiological differences between humans and animals do create a minor disparity between results; however, animal testing delays human trials in an attempt to make the drug as safe as possible before it is administered to human patients. Once a drug has been determined to be both safe and effective for animals, it is then generally tested on a small group of people before being approved for mass distribution. This human testing is performed in compliance with many laws which ensure to protect the safety of human subjects and require the drug to be tested extensively prior to these trials to ensure its safety. In-vitro testing is one method of determining a drug's reliability but is likewise inconclusive in determining safety of a drug. Animal testing is required for FDA approval of the drug to be tested on human patients. In the case of Vioxx, which was removed from the US market in 2004, animal testing and human testing were likewise performed. The drug which was supposed to act as an anti-inflammatory had cardiovascular side effects in humans which did not appear in animal testing. Vioxx was first tested in animals and showed no evidence of cardiovascular failure. According to the VP of Clinical Research for Merck (the company who tested this drug) non-of the human trials confirmed that the drug prevented blood clotting so the company relied on animal studies in order to claim these results. The company was accused of falsifying data and using unreliable sources in order to get approval by the FDA. Generally, once human trials of the drug begin, these results become the most prominent and are relied upon to determine the drug's ultimate safety. Prior animal testing is performed only to ensure the drug as much as possible before commencing human trials. The Vioxx trials performed on green-monkeys were performed after human clinical trials found an increase in cardiovascular effects for patients taking the drug. It must also be noted, animal trials are more effective for certain types of modeling (ie. antibiotic modeling vs. systems modeling \u2013particularly of the CNS but in this case of the cardiovascular system). Vioxx failed to recognize this in their studies of the cardiovascular system and used animal trials above human trials when relaying their results, an act that was highly controversial and seen by the scientific community as unethical. The study of genetics envelops many types of research. The research of homology and plasticity between genetic material of differing species is used to determine the similarity between species on different traits. One result of this type of experimentation is to determine which animal species are most closely related to humans physiology and genetically dependent on the area of research. (Mice share 99% homology of their genes with humans making them useful in studies of human diseases.) This helps determine which animal would more accurately model a human response. Deliberately produced genetic diseases in animals will have pathologies like those of human diseases and finding cures in animals helps to finding similar cures for humans (Pines, Maya, ed. \"Blazing the Genetic Trail.\" Bethesda, MD: Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 1991). In-vitro research can be performed using human DNA just as effectively as by using animal DNA. Recombination practices as well as insertion or deletion practice however, cannot be replicated in humans. These practices are integral for the study of progression of disease and effects on physiology as well as drug effects. In regards to protein homology, protein interaction is integral in many diseases and disorders. Treating these ailments is performed through methods of integration of proteins, mutation of proteins (particularly growth factors), interaction of proteins with antibiotics or other drugs, etc\u2026 Genetic studies of animals have led to advances in research on and production of drugs for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes just to name a few. Insulin for diabetes patients is the result of research with dogs, leprosy vaccines is from armadillos, treatments for Huntington's disease and polio first used research performed on primates. Vaccines such as the leukemia vaccine were also developed primarily as the result of animal testing. This research continues because of the numerous safe and effective drugs and vaccines which are developed through animal testing. Currently many new projects are taking place including research for a new TB vaccine (since TB strains are subject to resistance factors). As for cancer, clearly there has not been a \"cure all\" cancer drug developed from animal research. What has been developed however, are many drugs and methods for treatment of cancer. While in-vitro studies may initially show correlation between drugs and their effects on cancer, these results are not conclusive without clinical trials. Clinical trials must be performed on animals prior to trials on humans to ensure the safety of drugs. Numerous treatments are developed and tested and are never passed to human trials because they do not first pass animal trials. I propose that it is more beneficial to humans to allow these treatments to be tested on animals before they are tested on humans, simply for more evidence of their safety. As shown with Vioxx nothing is ever 100 percent certain after animal trials, but it must be recognized that animal testing provides more evidence towards the safety of these drugs. In conclusion, after analysis of the variant types of animal testing and the results it has produced and continues to produce, I suggest that the practice of performing research on animals should continue. Animal testing has been directly linked to improvements in human medicine through understanding of genetics, development of vaccines and other drugs, and further research into surgical procedures and cures for diseases. I feel that research performed on animals, is justifiable due to these contributions.",

            "conclusion": "Animal Testing",
            "premise": "Ok. Last round. Yay. :) Society: I would first like to say that I never denied animal testing in past medication before scientific advancement. I would like to make it clear animal testing WAS beneficial and DID help humanity. However, this debate is about the present and how it benefits or hurts society today. It DID bring polio down and it DID hurt people in the past. However, today in the 21st century it is no longer helping us. Nor is it hurting us. It helped, it hurt. Now it is not helping nor hurting humans. Therefore it shouldn't be persued anymore. Without animal testing scientist would scramble to find even more alternative making more scientific advancements. Animals: Animal testing today is not helping or hurting humans, like I mentioned previously. It is still hurting animal though. Life in a cage is still life in a cage. Quoting the link my opponent gave. \"On the other hand, they are still kept in cages. A cage can never be as interesting, stimulating, or open as a natural habitat. This can be a problem especially for the more intelligent animals like dogs, cats, pigs, and primates. They can become tremendously lonely and bored unless they have things to play with or ways to get more exercise.\" Many of us would hate being subjected to boredom and loniless. While SOME institutions use medicine to prevent physical pain, there is nothing that can prevent emotional or pdychological pain. These animals would rather live free in the jungle rather than in a laboratory where they must wait and wait for a procedure. When these animals are no longer in use they are euthanized involuntarily instead of being set free. I already gave links to that in my previous arguments. Philosophy: The philosphy argument will never lead anywhere it's just what people believe. With that being said I would still like to give my opinion. Animals are not our tools. I have never heard of people take their tools to the groomer, or feed them tool food, I've heard of animal doctors(vets) but not tool doctors. Just like a mother can't hit a child for not listening, a person can't hit their pet for not listening. Sure, we must teach our pets obedience, we must also teach our kids obedience. Abuse of a pet is no better than abuse of a child. Unfortunately, that is what animal testing is today, abuse. I would not want to live with cure it means thousands of animal dies for me. I don't see my life as more important than an animals. I hope I would never have to come to a decision between an animal or my mom. I would choose my mom. But obviously I could rephrase that and say a stranger or my mom. I would still choose my mom. Not because one species is inferior to the other, but because emotion will always play a part in society. We can't base our judgement on 100% facts. It always has to be 50/50. Let's try that again, stranger or my pet. Bye human. :) I don't believe animals exist for humams. I mean why do spiders exist then. We don't eat them we don't use them. Why do sharks exist, we don't eat them, we don't use them. Animals existed millions of years before humans. Why would animal exist if there was no human to use them? Maybe because it isn't our duty to use them. This was just my opinion. As I mentioned in the first sentence of this argument. Obviously, other people would feel different. Cost: As I said in the first round it is not necessary. Those 16 billion dollars are 6.4 times the cost the Mars Rover($2.5 billion). All that money could be used to for patients who don't have health insurance to help them with their disease, instead of hurting another living being. It is still a lot of money. I would not like to see my tax money being used on something that kills many creatures but only saves a few. Alternatives: Animal testing is no longer necessary with over 450 alternatives that work. Scientist are not using alternatives when it's possible. Which is wrong. No alternative can be denied, all of them work, otherwise we wouldn't call them alternatives. Three R's of Animal Testing alternatives: (From the link my opponent gave) Replacement - Whenever possible, we should replace living, feeling animals with other things like tissue cultures and computer simulations. In addition, we should actively search for new ways and try to develop new technologies that can replace live, feeling animals in the lab. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Reduction - Reducing the number of animals used in research. While we are trying to replace animals, we need to reduce the number of animals used in research to the smallest number possible. We should use as few animals in an experiment as we can. We should be very careful to be sure that experiments on animals are necessary. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Refinement - Improving the lives of animals used in research. If we have to do an experiment that uses animals, then we must improve the living conditions of the animals used in research. The Animal Welfare Act mostly addresses refinement. With these alternatives a tremendous of lives will be saved. All types of lives humans and animals. Sources: http://www.aspca.org... Thank you to my opponent TUF for accepting this debate.

            "premise": "Hello today we have 3 rounds.1. Acceptance/ Introduction2. Body3. ConclusionRulesFlaking= LoseTroll= LoseForfeit= Lose Status Quo: Medical research is the hardest case for proposition in this debate to prove, since it has previously yielded substantial benefits for humanity , while contemporary animal research continues to contribute demonstrably to the speed and efficiency with which new scientific break throughs are achieved. Focussing the proposition case on toxicology, or cosmetics alone would divert the debate into an area of law and ethics that is settled in most respects: many states around the world have instituted bans using animals to test cosmetics and the toxicity of domestic cleaning products. Thus the best proposition strategy is to focus on the hard case of medical research. Animal research has been used for several centuries as part of efforts to better understand the world around us. Almost all states actively research on animals at present. The total scale of all research on vertebrates is hard to measure, but according to some estimates it could be as high as 115,000,000 animals per year, with the vast majority of these being euthanized at the end of the period of experimentation. The pharmaceutical industry spends a significant amount of time conducting research on animals. Due to the relative paucity of drugs that make it on to the market place after the initial testing phases, the global cost of each successful new drug in terms of animal lives, is around 5.75 million animals. By contrast the now shrinking industry sector on chemical safety testing using animals, uses around 860 animals per chemical when screening for carcinogens (cancer-causing substances). Whilst much the research described above is categorised as causing minimal pain and suffering, figures obtained in 2010 show that in the USA alone 97,123 animals were used in research likely to involve pain and suffering, where pain killers and sedatives would not be administered. However, it should be born in mind that this figure is equal to only 8.5% of the total number of animals used in research activities covered by the US Animal Welfare Act - but the act does not cover mice, rats, birds or fish.Defintion: Testing: In this debate \"testing\" should be defined as all testing on animals including, medical research, cosmetics, toxicology testing, and psychological research involving animal subjects. Most existing bans on animal research, when they have been implemented, have involved some form of disciplinary action by a professional body and the possibility of criminal prosecution.Animal: A living organism which feeds on organic matter, typically having specialized sense organs andnervous system and able to respond rapidly tostimuli:Sources:http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...http://idebate.org...;",

Animals are a valuable part of our environment and wthout them we will surely decline in environmental help. 3. We are doing it for our own luxury We are tourturing many animals for hand creams,Bath and body products,and many other items for our own convenience. This is unjust and unhumane. 4. We treat animals as if we are less than them. We are all equal in fact humans share 30% of our DNA with lettuce weare all interconnected without bee's which are considered animals pollinate flowers.

My opponent may work for PETA [2], but I personally am highly skeptical as to the originality of these arguments.Still, I will counter these arguments anyway.Con writes '[A]nimal testing is often extremely cruel and completely unnecessary. For example, I once saw some undercover footage from a laboratory in which dogs were being force-fed weedkiller.'One anecdote is hardly sufficient to determine a general pattern.Con writes 'Scientifically, testing products meant for humans on animals is unreliable and potentially dangerous.'My opponent has failed to respond to my sourced arguments about all the medicines and techniques developed using animal testing, preferring instead his/her/its own theorizing.Con writes 'My personal view is that products meant for humans should be tested on humans. It's the only way to know if they will work as intended, and we have the choice of whether or not to volunteer for testing'Of course products should be tested on humans, but they should be tested on animals first.Con writes 'Our greater intelligence gives us a responsibility to protect other species, not the right to use and abuse them in any way we see fit - that should be abhorrent to any sentient, compassionate being.'Animal testing also helps animals:'Animals also have improved healthcare and a longer lifespan. Farm animals, household pets, wild species and endangered species are all benefiting from the research conducted through animals. There are vaccines for rabies, distemper, tetanus, parvo virus and numerous other illnesses in cats, dogs and countless other domesticated animals. Cats now have a treatment for Feline Leukemia.' [3]What personally seems more abhorrent to me is to let the far more valuable humans die/suffer over other species. One who doesn't care for his own species is a failure.Con writes 'It's unethical to sentence 100 million thinking, feeling animals to life in a laboratory cage and intentionally cause them pain, loneliness, and fear.'Why? It helps humans.Con writes 'It's bad science. The Food and Drug Administration reports that 92 out of every 100 drugs that pass animal tests fail in humans.'How does that make it bad science?Con writes 'It's wasteful. Animal experiments prolong the suffering of people waiting for effective cures by misleading experimenters and squandering precious money, time, and resources that could have been spent on human-relevant research.'Bare assertion.Con writes 'It's archaic.'Actually, we'd probably still be stuck in the middle ages (medicinally) if we never used animal testing.Con writes 'The world doesn't need another eyeliner, hand soap, food ingredient, drug for erectile dysfunction, or pesticide so badly that it should come at the expense of animals' lives.'But we could use a cure for cancer so badly that it should come at the expense of animals' lives.ConclusionMy opponent has not directly addressed any of my arguments, and has preferred to copy/paste some arguments off the internet. I am very disappointed.Sources: 1. http://ph.answers.yahoo.com...;2. http://www.peta.org...;3. http://www.pro-test.org.uk...;",

            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for accepting this debate. I will present my arguments for animal testing and why it should be allowed for medical research. (Not cosmetic research.) Argument 1: Many animal testing opponents say that it is cruel to animals that take part. Indeed it is in some cases, but no more so than the wild. An animal in the wild can die of disease, predators, habitat destruction, or a huge number of other ways. An animal in a lab may die, but when it does it has helped scientific progress and potentially saved human lives. Animals in labs suffer no more cruelty than the wild has to offer. Argument 2: All drugs intended to help animals have to go through animal testing. Treatments for common pet sicknesses have gone through animal testing as well as human drugs. Without animal research, the treatments that help animals would likely have not been created. The animals used in these sorts of tests benefited their kind through their use in research. Argument 3: Alternatives to animal testing exist, but are not yet reliable. The problem with using cells is obvious. Most bodily functions have different cells for their tasks. If we look at one cell we are only looking at one potentially affected area. Also, it fails to show how cells can react with other bodily mechanisms as part of a whole animal. Computer simulations are iffy because they rely on our knowledge of the animal and the substances in the drug. What is not coded into the computerized test is unable to be observed. Also, many alternatives are vastly more expensive or time-consuming than animal testing. I await my opponent\u2019s response Sources: PETA http://www.aboutanimaltesting.co.uk...",

            "premise": "I would like to start my argument with a favorite quote of mine: Ask the experimenters why they experiment on animals, and the answer is: \"Because the animals are like us.\" Ask the experimenters why it is morally okay to experiment on animals, and the answer is: \"Because the animals are not like us.\" Animal experimentation rests on a logical contradiction. - Charles Magel Animal experimentation is less reliable, more expensive, and considerably less humane than alternative options. I'm going to avoid delving into consumer good research at this time, and focus more on medical research as that seems to be where the OP is aiming. Contention: Animal experimentation is not actually useful and is not reliable. A recent experiment involved surgically embedding coils into the heads of monkeys in order to track neural activity, but further inspection of the test revealed that the neural pathway being researched was not involved in the progression of Alzheimer\"s disease (Hansen). The testing of drugs is no more accurate. The American Anti-Vivisection Society states that \"nine out of ten drugs that appear promising in animal studies go on to fail in human clinical trials (AAVS \" Problems With Animal Research).\" A prominent example of this is thalidomide, a drug designed as a sedative and an anti-nausea medicine for pregnant women, which in animal tests had very few issues in pregnant dogs, cats, rats, monkeys, hamsters, and chickens. However, when released in the late 1950s for human use, it caused high amounts of birth defects, as well as issues in adults after prolonged use (Singer 57). Oftentimes, drug research on animals can skew in a different direction. For a remarkable number of drugs, animal tests indicate little to no benefits and the test subjects may develop significant issues. As a result, these drugs never continue on to clinical studies, or need to be pushed through to human clinical trials via back channels. Lipitor, a medicine designed to lower cholesterol, failed in animal testing but was an important medical development for humans (AAVS \" Problems With Animal Research). Synthetic insulin, crucial for diabetic people, causes deformities in rabbits and mice. Morphine, used for sedation and pain management, is stimulating to mice. Penicillin, an oft-used antibiotic, is fatal to guinea pigs (Singer 57). Animal tests run on these drugs, and many more, were inaccurate, and had they been relied on, would have held up medical advancement. Contention: There are plenty of alternatives that are more reliable. Animal experimentation is not the only option, and it is not the best option. Alternative research methods have been developed and approved, and studies show that they are often more accurate, faster, and less expensive. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute use cell cultures to test chemicals for anti-cancer properties, and have been able to recreate sixty different types of tumors and cancers, including brain, lung, and reproductive cancer. Using this method, over 20,000 drugs can be tested per year (SHAC). Dr. Bjorn Ekwall developed a test using donated human tissue to test toxicity, in place of the LD50 test. Not only does this test have more accurate results at 84% compared to the LD50\"s 52%, but it is able to target the toxicity on specific organs. Skin corrosivity testing has a 40% error rate when using animals, but is 100% accurate when using synthetic skins, such as EpiDerm or SkinEthic. Computer-based Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship models (QSAR) can also predict skin irritation correctly 95% of the time by comparing a new chemical to similar established chemicals using its properties (NEAVS \" Alternatives In Testing). Scientists have used human cells to develop \"microbrains\" and bone marrow, and have been able to use egg membranes and blood samples to test drugs (Newkirk 63). The Embryonic Cell Test (EST) is often used to ensure drug safety for pregnant women, and has been named more valuable than all animal tests combined (SHAC). As Gordon Bacter, founder of the cruelty-free Pharmagene Labratories, said, \"If you have information on human genes, what\"s the point of going back to animals (Newkirk 68)?\" Other alternative testing options include microdosing, where human volunteers are given extremely small amounts of the test drug so as to learn effects of the drug without compromising the entire human body, in vitro testing, where cells are given diseases and results are found within hours, epidemiological studies, or studying the population to learn how diseases work, and clinical studies. Clinical studies often involve people who have already contracted an illness volunteering for drug trials (NEAVS \" Alternatives In Research). The studies are carefully managed and so the risk to volunteers is minimal. Another option is computer models, which were used in the development of the \"AIDS Cocktail\", a potent combination of drugs used to slow the progress of HIV (Newkirk 225). These programs are able to simulate anatomical functions and can collect and manage a large number of research data points (NEAVS \" Alternatives In Research). Contention: Animal testing is too expensive and slow. Using animal testing, it takes five years, eight hundred animals, and four million dollars to test a single drug. Alternative methods allow, for the same cost, 350 chemicals to be tested in one week (Pacelle 342).

            "premise": "Thanks you, Pro. This debate should be fun. In response to the two questions Pro poses in Round 1: 1) No, they would probably not lay down their life for their pet, but they would also probably not lay down their life for anyone. There is a reason that killing someone in self-defense is not the moral equivalent of killing someone to steal their money. The difference lies in the intention: in one case you kill someone to save your own life. Killing animals, pets, whatever, makes sense when there is a direct threat to your own life. 2) Pro's second question already presupposes that testing our \"vaccinations\" and other \"crucial experiments\" on animals works. Before we can ask if their are alternatives to using animals for testing, we have to know whether testing on animals is relevant to human health in the first place. Of course, the answer is that animal testing has not been relevant to advancements in medicine or human health. In an article published in the esteemed \"Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,\" the very notion itself was debunked. In the article, it was pointed out that \"animal experiments are not relevant to human health, they do not contribute meaningfully to medical advances and many are undertaken simply out of curiosity and do not even pretend to hold promise for curing illnesses.\" Furthermore, there is the obvious fact that animal biology is very different from human biology, and therefore, is unreliable. The FDA has noted that 92 percent of drugs shown to be safe and effective animal tests fail in human trials because they don't work or are dangerous to humans. It has been shown that physiological reactions to drugs vary enormously from species to species. Penicillin kills guinea pigs but is inactive in rabbits; aspirin kills cats and causes birth defects in rats, mice, guinea pigs, dogs, and monkeys; and morphine, a depressant in humans, stimulates goats, cats, and horses. The point is, using animals for our experiments has no medical value for us, because it is simply unreliable. Animal biology is different from ours.",

            "premise": "Apologies to my opponent for calling her a him, I was unaware and wrongfully assumed she was male. My opponent has wholly misunderstood my argument. Where it might normally be irrelevant that people eat animals for food, I was establishing this as a parallel case. It is for the same reasons that we should continue consuming animals that we should continue testing products on animals. We do both of these things because animals generally have no use to us besides the use we choose to use them for. An animal is useless to us unless we can get products from it (fur, milk, etc), get meat from it, or use it in any other way to help us. Included in this last option is the usefulness of a pet (gives the owner happiness), the usefulness of seeing eye dogs, police dogs, hunting dogs, etc, or the usefulness of an animal we use for product testing. My opponent directly asked \"How is this a good thing? Hurting poor and harmless animals just to test products?\" My opponent already answered that question himself: \"...to test products?\". It is good because testing products is useful to society, much more than the lives of a very small number of animals who otherwise would not be helping our society. My opponent also has come up with a supposedly better answer for the products that need testing: we should develop ways to test products without the possible rare harm to an animal. While it could be said that this would be preferable, we do not currently have such a method. Therefore, until such a method is created, we should continue testing on animals, as it is the best option we currently have. My opponent is hoping you will vote for him based on your own feelings, based on your own empathy he has appealed to. However, he has failed to show why it is wrong for us to test products on animals. Do not vote based on your own feelings; rather, vote based on which side made the more solid case. Thank you for reading. That is all.",

            "premise": "I am going to try and make this short, simple, and to the point.****MY CASE****C1:In a philosophical Utilitarian rule, Animal testing is inherently good.Animal testing to some, may seem detrimental. But I ask those who feel this way to consider the alternatives to animal testing. Most of the major diseases, sicknesses, and treatments we have today, are possible because of animal testing. We learn, and continue to learn new things every day by the testing of medical by-products, that helps further the medical interests and endeavors required when pursuing world renown care in health purposes.Utilitarianism, is possibly one of the biggest ideas that comes to mind when considering the prospect however. When we test on animals, how much good are we doing in comparison to bad? My opponent has offered no clarification to supposed harms that animal testing brings. I must ask the same. Overall, how can you sustain that animal testing is harmful?What harms does this do? Animal testing is done as a lost resort, when the medicine has been scientifically altered to the point where it should not fail by all means. However there is a certain amount of risk involved in the procedure none the less. Why not test it on an animal?Another question my opponent must answer, is how testing on other humans brings more good than testing on animals?Do animal trials really tell us about humans?Animals are surrogates for humans. The basic reason for animal trials is to determine two issues before any new compound is introduced into a human: safety and efficacy, whether a compound is safe for human ingestion and also whether or not a product works for its intended purpose. Really that process begins way before we get to animals. But at some point in the process it is critical to understand how a compound, let's say, a hypertension medication, works in a whole living system. You can't just determine how it works on blood pressure or the heart. You need to know how it would affect all the organs. That really is the whole purpose of using a complex biological system known as an animal.http://www.time.com... The point of this entire argument, is that over all, animal testing does more good than harm. C2: Animal testing benefits animals.The thing that most people don't consider when thinking about animal testing, is that we are actually helping out animals as well with testing. Veterinarians, zoo keepers, pet owners, all with sick or injured pets, rely in some way on medicines to help animals. The tests are usually run on scientific bread rats, an over populated species that most people nary consider anything more than a pest. If you would kill a rat for sneaking into your home, or for crawling around in the sewers, why would it not be preferable to cause some good before ending that rodents life? Animals used for testing purpose cause an inherent good for their own species as well.http://www.fda.gov...C3: Humans take a higher priority in speceism.Humans take a higher priority, because we need to benefit our own kind over that of another species. We can replenish that of the species we are harming, and do enough good to counter act the harm of possibly killing a rat. The harms of not using animal testing, are simply too great not to consider the uses of them. But in the end, humans need to take care of humans. Hypothetical situation: If a family member close to you bore some deadly illness or dis-ease, and an un-tested cure was made, would you want it to be tested right into humans? What if this cure, worsened the state of your loved one, and killed them? Would you not then prefer animal testing to this fate? Unfortunately, the option is a bleak one to the minds of most humans. 30-40 years ago, an untested version of the polio vaccination was given to hundreds of people in western America. This resulted in a vast amount of law suits, after victims suffered from intellectual dis-abilities for life (My uncle was among one of these victims). So basically because we refused to test the product on one animal, we risked the lives of hundreds of human beings living in torment. Again, inherent good.http://nichcy.org...I conclude.****CONCLUSION****Animal testing seems like a bad idea to the blind eye, but the plain and simple truth is, that the alternative to animal testing is much worse. If we do not test on animals, do we test on humans, our own brothers and sisters? Is there any more good in that than in doing a deed for man-kind? We use animal testing to further benefits to animals as well. I feel as if I have proven that over all, animal testing brings more good than harm, when weighing everything in significance. I look forward to my opponents rebuttals, and thank him for the challenge. Good day mate!",

            "discussionTitle": "Animal Testing",
            "conclusion": "Animal Testing",
            "premise": "Animal testing is cruel and inhumane. According to Humane Society International, animals used in experiments are commonly subjected to force feeding, forced inhalation, food and water deprivation, prolonged periods of physical restraint, the infliction of burns and other wounds to study the healing process, the infliction of pain to study its effects and remedies, and \"killing by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, neck-breaking, decapitation, or other means.\" The Draize eye test, used by cosmetics companies to evaluate irritation caused by shampoos and other products, involves rabbits being incapacitated in stocks with their eyelids held open by clips, sometimes for multiple days, so they cannot blink away the products being tested. The commonly used LD50 (lethal dose 50) test involves finding out which dose of a chemical will kill 50% of the animals being used in the experiment. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported in 2010 that 97,123 animals suffered pain during experiments while being given no anesthesia for relief, including 1,395 primates, 5,996 rabbits, 33,652 guinea pigs, and 48,015 hamsters. a. The Animal Welfare Act has not succeeded in preventing horrific cases of animal abuse in research laboratories. In Mar. 2009, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) found 338 possible violations of the Animal Welfare Act at the federally funded New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) in Louisiana. Some of the primates housed at NIRC were suffering such severe psychological stress that they engaged in self-mutilation, \"tearing gaping wounds into their arms and legs.\" Video footage shows infant chimps screaming as they are forcibly removed from their mothers, infant primates awake and alert during painful experiments, and chimpanzees being intimidated and shot with a dart gun. In a 2011 incident at the University of California at Davis Center for Neuroscience, \"three baby mice were found sealed alive in a plastic baggie and left unattended\" on a laboratory counter, according to the Sacramento Bee.b. 95% of animals used in experiments are not protected by the Animal Welfare Act. The AWA does not cover rats, mice, fish and birds, which comprise around 95% of the animals used in research. The AWA covered 1,134,693 animals used for testing in fiscal year 2010, which leaves around 25 million other animals that are not covered. These animals are especially vulnerable to mistreatment and abuse without the protection of the AWA. c. Animals can suffer like humans do, so it is speciesism to experiment on them while we refrain from experimenting on humans. All suffering is undesirable, whether it be in humans or animals. Discriminating against animals because they do not have the cognitive ability, language, or moral judgment that humans do is no more justifiable than discriminating against human beings with severe mental impairments. As English philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote in the 1700s, \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" 2. Alternative testing methods now exist that can replace the need for animals. In vitro (in glass) testing, such as studying cell cultures in a petri dish, can produce more relevant results than animal testing because human cells can be used. Microdosing, the administering of doses too small to cause adverse reactions, can be used in human volunteers, whose blood is then analyzed. Artificial human skin, such as the commercially available products EpiDerm and ThinCert, is made from sheets of human skin cells grown in test tubes or plastic wells and can produce more useful results than testing chemicals on animal skin. Microfluidic chips (\"organs on a chip\"), which are lined with human cells and recreate the functions of human organs, are in advanced stages of development. Computer models, such as virtual reconstructions of human molecular structures, can predict the toxicity of substances without invasive experiments on animals. a. Animals are very different from human beings and therefore make poor test subjects. The anatomic, metabolic, and cellular differences between animals and people make animals poor models for human beings. Paul Furlong, Professor of Clinical Neuroimaging at Aston University (UK), states that \"it's very hard to create an animal model that even equates closely to what we're trying to achieve in the human.\" Thomas Hartung, Professor of evidence-based toxicology at Johns Hopkins University, argues for alternatives to animal testing because \"we are not 70 kg rats.\" [ b. Animal tests are more expensive than alternative methods and are a waste of government research dollars. Humane Society International compared a variety of animal tests with their in vitro counterparts. An \"unscheduled DNA synthesis\" animal test costs $32,000, while thein vitro alternative costs $11,000. A \"rat phototoxicity test\" costs $11,500, whereas the non-animal equivalent costs $1,300. A \"rat uterotrophic assay\" costs $29,600, while the corresponding in vitro test costs $7,200. A two-species lifetime cancer study can cost from $2 million to $4 million, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends $14 billion of its $31 billion annual budget on animal research.",

Even supposing that a fish would go through the same experiences of pain and grievance, which is impossible to prove at best, humans are much more social and productive creatures. Think about it this way: can you name one other animal that cares AT ALL for the well-being of another species or the environment, except for humans?\" We only have knowledge about what humans can emotionally and physically experience BECAUSE WE ARE HUMANS. Think about the mutual relationships between animal species. They are are beneficial to each other, and, of course, that relationship is valued because of the benefits. Animals value their environment because it provides the habitat and resources they need to survive. Isn't it the same with humans? We care about the environment and other animals species because they either directly or indirectly benefit us. If the environment is impaired, that could mean harmful repercussions. If the food chain is disrupted, consequential extinction and overpopulation of species ensues. The following is information found from a reputable source. ________________________ Nobody benefits from animal testing when they take medicines. Drugs originate not from such tests but from clinical observation, serendipity and rational drug design. Animal testing became mandatory following the thalidomide tragedy, but it has failed to prevent further disasters. Vioxx, which was used to treat arthritis and acute pain, is the biggest drug catastrophe in history. According to David Graham, associate director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Drug Safety, an estimated 88,000 to 139,000 Americans alone had heart attacks or strokes as a result of taking Vioxx, as many as 55,000 of them fatal. Smaller drug disasters are commonplace, killing many thousands every year. New human-based tests could prevent many of these deaths. Microdose studies of volunteers reveal drug metabolism in the human body with accuracy. Yet regulators require animal studies, not microdose studies. We would all be safer without animal tests, which correctly predict drug side effects only between 5 and 25 per cent of the time, according to studies published in the scientific literature. Action must be taken now to prevent another Vioxx. -------- http://www.newscientist.com... __________________________ \"Of course toxicology testing that assumes that all drugs safe for animals are safe for humans is dangerous. But incidents such as the Thalidomide tragedy would not have been PREVENTED by not testing the drugs on animals.\" Many more lives would have been saved if humans were initially tested on, instead of animals, before the product was released. We should not assume that medical products that have one effect on animals will have the same effect on humans or vice versa. That is why animals testing is not only futile but detrimental to humans.",

My opponent has said that there is no other way to experiment to aid in Scientific breakthroughs, and said that animal testing have 'no cons to humans'. However, there are other more accurate, cheaper and faster methods compared to animal testing. I will touch on these alternatives in the later rounds. She also mentioned that animal testing has no cons to humans. However, According to Cruelty Free International, out of 93 dangerous drug side effects, only 19% could have been predicted by animal tests. Hence, it shows that it may pose danger to humans. I will cover examples of such consequences later on in my points. Now, for my substantives. 1. The human anatomy and body structures differ greatly from animals. This could cause erroneous information to be obtained when we apply animal diseases to human diseases and drug responses. 2. Animal testing is ineffective. due to time constraints, I will continue my arguments in the next Rd.",

Obviously I do have concerns for animal rights and I feel where possible alternatives should be used but I feel at this point in time they are not good enough and animal testing is pivotal. The alternatives you have suggested such as Ceetox have flaws, I have scoured there whole website and I cannot find any text or document which mentions any significant success of their products. Again, the problem with the chips is described well in this Scientific American article (http://www.scientificamerican.com...): \"the chips may not capture certain crucial aspects of living physiology the way whole animal tests do\". \"If you don\"t use as close to the total physiological system that you can, you\"re likely to run into troubles\". Furthermore through testing human blood or human cells you can\"t see the way the whole physiological system of the human body is going to be affected. On contrary to your last point, many more animal-friendly drugs have proved to be effective in humans. Even if they have caused harm to humans they can be manipulated and eventually evolve to become successful. Let\"s think about the greater good of animal testing, all the positives it\"s brought about for people (and animals themselves) suffering from conditions such as diabetes and cancers. Although I can see your point with cosmetics not been essential I am pretty sure many humans would not want to give up their products. The US FDA includes in its description of cosmetics anything which is applied to the human body for \"cleansing\". So we have to think beyond make-up, Vaseline and lip balm are even included in the cosmetics category. Many of these items are not used for beauty but for human health. Therefore many cosmetics items should be viewed as essential.",

However, my opponents alternative is flawed for the following reasons. 1. It is essential in scientific and technological advances. As long as pain and suffering for the animals is minimized, I believe that it is acceptable to use testing on animals as opposed to having humans go through the same process. That said, it is very impractical to have humans endure these tests. 2. It would prevent any harmful side-effects had the testing been done on humans. The ethics is questionable. However, it is widely believed that the value of a human is MUCH greater than the value on an animal. It is undebatable that we, as people, would rather have someone else do something. As long as everyone accepts this fact, there are no ethical dilemmas. In summary, I believe that animal testing is VERY desirable and the ethical issues are outweighed by the benefits of using them as opposed to human beings. My opponents argument is loose and the alternative is impractical and may cause danger to human beings.",

            "premise": "I'd like to extend gratitude and respect to my opponent and which them the best of luck in this debate. With that being said, I believe the fundamental nature of animal testing is acceptable. To begin, your original premise posits that animal testing is fundamentally immoral because we have not been given consent by said animals to be used. As of yet, there seems to be no way of obtaining consent from a plethora of animals. While it is true that we can observe and predict the behaviors and reactions of certain animals and species different than us (for example, we can generally tell when animals are happy/sad/angry etc.), this premise relies on the notion that all animals are able to give consent. However, while we do have swaths of knowledge about animal behavior available to us, we have yet to encounter animals with the complicated executive capabilities of humans, so comparing humans to all other animals can't possibly be a fair comparison because humans are unlike all other animals in a variety of quantifiable ways. For example, out of all of the animals studied and observed by humans, it is extremely rare to establish that other animals have theory of mind, the ability to complexly understand the emotions, desires, actions, etc. of themselves and others around them. Even in animals that have the potential to develop theory of mind, it is often at rudimentary levels and often disputed by other researchers regarding the significance of the study's findings. Another reason animal testing isn't inherently immoral is because any alternative would stunt the progress and development of new medicines, treatments, vaccinations, etc. For example, banning animal testing would either 1) extend to all humans, because, as you suggested, they're animals too or 2) not place restrictions on human testing. In the case of the second instance, you must then concede that humans are uniquely distinct from other animals, in which case we are back to the first point I suggested. Animal testing has helped to accelerate medical and scientific advents for both domesticated pets and for humans. Leapfrogging off of my previous point, if you extend a ban on animal testing, you must then establish if it is ethical to do social experiments or milder forms of testing on those same animals. If your response is no, then we are stuck in the situation I previously described in which you must subjectively arbitrate which procedures and which animals are acceptable to test. If your answer is none of them, then the result of that policy would be a cessation of the mounds of scientific value obtained from testing on animals, even as simple as social and behavioral experiments. Overall, I believe animal testing is not only ethical, but ought to be encouraged for the purposes of scientific and medical advents and because, as I pointed out earlier, any concrete restrictions placed on animal testing will lead to a slippery slope that is inevitably invalidated.",

We can't test on humans primarly because of the moral. But if we can't use humans, why can we use animals?My reasons for using animals on research and/or experiments are: Most of the animals are breed in laboratories specifically for testing (like flies). This doesn't affect a species population. In fact, the species used are really common and aren't endangered. Animals (specifically mice) can be breed for a special experiment. An animal life could help the human race to find a cure, understand how certain organs work or even make a progress in the genetics area. Testing on animals allows us to know if a drug is safe for selling it. Scientists care about the animals. They use them just in really necessary cases and they use techniques that cause the least harm, stress or pain to the animal.",

            "premise": "Thank you DDD for beginning the debate. As one reads the first set of arguments presented by my opponents (mostly copy and pasted), they will surely notice a great number of errors, generalizations and hypocrisy. However, as stated in the rules, I am not allowed to attack any of their points until my second round. By then, they will have presented 2 more points, which will make my task of rebuttal lengthier. So that you, the reader can follow, I will be presenting my arguments in an organized fashion. Allow me to outline what you can expect from me over the next 4 rounds, as I attempt to prove that animal testing is bad. I will be presenting just 1 argument/pillar per round. This will be followed with my conclusion, in round 5. My arguments/pillars are as follow: 1) Animal testing is unethical 2) Animal testing is unsafe 3) Better alternatives to animal testing exist ************************************************************************************ Lets begin: 1. Animal testing is unethical The reality of animal testing is that annually, in labs across Canada and USA, millions of animals are subjected to torturous disease-ridden conditions, and an appalling amount die. Lets look at the numbers: According to CCAC (the Canadian Council on Animal Care), in 2011, 3.3 million animals where used by testing institutions certified by CCAC. The annual report continues to state that 35% of these animals where used in experiments causing \"severe pain near, at, or above tolerance threshold of anesthetized conscious animals\". This means, over 1 million animals including, dog\"s cats, and primate\"s suffered/ died horribly without the use of any anesthesia. The problem is, these are just the animals being tested under government-regulated conditions. In the USA, the AWA (Animal Welfare Act), seeks to protect and regulate the testing conditions of animals, much like CCAC. In 2010, only 5% of all animals used for testing were regulated under the AWA. More appalling still, organization PETA says \"over 100 million animals\"including mice, rats, dogs cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, monkeys, fish and birds are killed in U.S. laboratories each year\". Currently, most countries punish their citizens for abuse of animals under the scientific understanding that animals can experience pain and suffering. In fact, England and Germany have enacted laws pertaining to the mistreatment of fish using this same understanding. When looking at the last few paragraphs, two undisputable truths emerge: 1) Animals experience pain 2) Millions of animals experience pain/die because of animals testing, yearly. This brings us to the fundamental question: is this animal suffering ethically acceptable? Later in the debate I will present my 2nd argument, explaining how animal testing does not save lives. But, for the sake of this particular moral argument, lets say it does. As individuals, our code of ethics is created/influenced by various factors, including: 1) Our legal beliefs 2) Our spiritual beliefs (for some) 3) Our individual experiential beliefs The answer in all 3 cases argues against the use of animal testing. Legally speaking, we know that the mistreatment of animals is a punishable, jail-inducing crime. Spiritually speaking we know that Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist texts all speak against the violence of animals. Finally, we know through individual experiences that harming animals is wrong, even for the benefit of others. How do we know this? Well, I will ask you: Could you harm, mutilate or kill your own dog? It must be understood then, that the practice of Animal testing is undisputedly unethical. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to DDD\"s response.",

It's a part of life. I do not object to that. What I AM trying to say here, however, is that we are not testing for the bare minimum and there are possible alternatives that could be created. \"Animal testing is a good thing.\" How is this a good thing? Hurting poor and harmless animals just to test products? \"First, I will explain the other possibilities I can see.\" I have another possibility also. I do agree that testing on humans would be a bad idea. Why don't we create scientifical ways to test products? If science and technology can create these amazing computers we are on, surely we can create alternatives to testing products. \"Without testing on animals, all the negative consequences that are currently given to the animals would be given to humans instead\" Not if we create alternatives. Also, about your statement about the food chain. We are discussing animal testing. Not the food chain and being a vegetarian. That is off topic and a whole other debate. Same goes for your comments on bacteria. Bacteria, however, are single celled; they are not able to respond to surroundings as intelligently as animals that have more cells, and a NUCLEUS. Also, the bacteria are harming us. These poor animals are NOT harming us. Just to comment on your statement.

            "premise": "Animal tests do not reliably predict results in human beings. 94% of drugs that pass animal tests fail in human clinical trials. [57] According to neurologist Aysha Akhtar, MD, MPH, over 100 stroke drugs that were effective when tested on animals have failed in humans, and over 85 HIV vaccines failed in humans after working well in non-human primates. [58] A 2013 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) found that nearly 150 clinical trials (human tests) of treatments to reduce inflammation in critically ill patients have been undertaken, and all of them failed, despite being successful in animal tests. [59, 58] A 2013 study in Archives of Toxicology stated that \"The low predictivity of animal experiments in research areas allowing direct comparisons of mouse versus human data puts strong doubt on the usefulness of animal data as key technology to predict human safety.\" [60] ---------Drugs that pass animal tests are not necessarily safe. The 1950s sleeping pill thalidomide, which caused 10,000 babies to be born with severe deformities, was tested on animals prior to its commercial release. [5] Later tests on pregnant mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, and hamsters did not result in birth defects unless the drug was administered at extremely high doses. [109, 110] Animal tests on the arthritis drug Vioxx showed that it had a protective effect on the hearts of mice, yet the drug went on to cause more than 27,000 heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths before being pulled from the market. [55, 56] Animals can suffer like humans do, so it is speciesism to experiment on them while we refrain from experimenting on humans. All suffering is undesirable, whether it be in humans or animals. Discriminating against animals because they do not have the cognitive ability, language, or moral judgment that humans do is no more justifiable than discriminating against human beings with severe mental impairments. [66, 67] As English philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote in the 1700s, \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" [66]",

The inner workings of a rat and a human may be similar, but they are no means identical. When it comes to drug discovery and development, these limitations can jeopardize every segment of the pharmaceutical pipeline, from synthesis to prescription. Side effects are missed, and millions of dollars are wasted. Even if a new chemical entity is deemed safe at the animal stage, it still only has 8 percent chance of being approved form human use. Also, the ultimate crash test dummy has been invented by military scientists and will eventually replace live testing on animals such as pigs which are regularly blown up and dismembered in the search for more lethal mutations hundreds of scientists are making medicines from chemicals found in sea plants and animals. Once scientists find useful chemicals, they can often copy them in a lab without killing any animals. Plus,less than 2% of human illnesses (1.16%) are ever seen in animals. Over 98% never affect animals. According to the former scientific executive of Huntington Life Sciences, animal tests and human results agree \"5% of the time.\" Among the hundreds of techniques available instead of animal experiments, cell culture toxicology methods give accuracy rates of 80-85%",

            "premise": "Save Animals: Don't Test on Them Animal testing is a huge controversy. Some argue that animal testing is a necessity to make medical breakthroughs. Opponents believe that animal testing is inhuman. Clearly, animal testing is a bad practice because it has caused suffering on a massive scale, it's a bad form of science, and is unethical. Throughout the world animal testing has caused suffering on a massive scale. In 2016, US Government statistics put the number of laboratory animals used in research at 820,812, a 7% increase from 2015 (PETA). Studies show that 4.1 million experiments are conducted on animals in laboratories in the UK each year ( National Antivisection Society). This is proof that laboratories have been on a rise lately, showing that the use of animal testing is a problem in other parts of the world, not only in the United States. Animal testing is a bad form of science. The food and drug administration reported that 92 out of every 100 drugs that pass animal testing would fail on testing on humans (PETA). After seven years of testing on animals the anti-Rheumatic drug, Orpen, was declared safe for use on humans. After initiation of use on humans, this so-called \"safe\" drug was responsible for killing 76 people and caused a very serious illness to 3,500 others in Britain (NewStatesman). Some feel that animal testing is a unethical form of testing. More than 100 million animals are killed in the US each year. Laboratories are used for biology lessons, medical training, drugs, and cosmetic testing. Before animals die, most are forced to inhale toxic fumes or they are also immortalized and stuck to multiple devices for hours suffering. Scientist from PETA announced that companies/ testing laboratories could put stress and suffering on animals by have drilling holes into their skulls, have skin burned off, or their spinal cords crushed (PETA). Studies have also shown that because of the torment of the experiments animals are deprived of everything that is natural and important to them. Animals are taken out of their natural habitat and confined in barred cages and are socially isolated, which is not helping the animals in any way. On the other hand, many scientists and companies believe that animal testing is the best form of testing drugs for humans cures. Those against animal testing feel this isn\"t right, they feel that scientists should start testing on humans for their own cures because animals and humans function differently. Why make animals suffer for them to possibly die after the scientist are done trying to see if the drug worked on the animal? The animals are under unnatural testing environments and the scientists are doing this in a very unhealthy and unnatural way. There is really no thought out processes behind testing on animals. How do animals benefit from dying? Animals don't have any say in getting tested on in a laboratory. If companies and scientist started testing on humans it could lead to more cures found in viruses and diseases, because the testing would be done on the very being that the drug would be used on to cure the ailment. Testing on animals doesn't benefit from much. Yes, scientist do find cures for viruses and disease, but scientist are killing creatures that can't fight for what they want. Animals have no say in what is happening to them. They get put into a situation that they can't protect themselves from. Animal testing shouldn't exist because of the pain and suffering they make them go through just to find a cure that they could test on a human instead of risking animals lives in the process.",

            "premise": "Blaine Laswell Ms. Hogan English 1 19 November 2014 Testing On Animals Testing on animals is violent and wrong because they feel and think in the same way that we do. My main points are that we should ban animal testing everywhere in the world and that animals have feeling and emotion lastly is that there are alternative testing methods for testing medicines and such. Testing medicine and makeup on animals is wrong. We should ban animal testing all over the world. Countries have already ban animal testing but why not the rest of the world? The E.U, Norway, Israel, and India have all ban animal testing but not the United States, Canada, or Russia. Why not? Animal testing costs lots of money and time but most of the money they use is actually taxpayers money. Others could say that everything they are doing is humane but it is not \"It is unethical to put one hundred million thinking feeling animals to a life in a laboratoratory cage\" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or Peta for short. Almost ninety-two of one hund0red drugs pass animal testing but fail in human exactly like the drug Vioxx which worked for animals but killed sixty thousand people. Everyone in the world should ban such a horrific thing to do to all animal species. Animals have nerves like us and feeling like so why does testing go on, the animals are forced to suffer more and more every day. Animals have emotions and thought processes like we do. If a dog whimpers what does the dog feel? If a cat hisses what does it mean? These things that do express feelings and emotions like when a human being cries or laughs. Just because they are not exactly like us does not mean they cannot feel. The most common thing people say is that animals do not have feeling or emotion. When a dog wags its tail t means that they could be happy or that they are agitated or some other emotion but it is an emotion. When an elephant covers the remains of its species and caresses the remains what do you think it is doing it is mourning the elephant that died. The things that these animals are doing show that they have emotion and feeling but why test on them when there are other ways. There are other methods for testing medicine and makeup than using a living creature that did not volunteer itself. When using animals for testing it is essentially a waste of funding and time because the other ways are humane and cheaper. The college of Harvard has created a system that uses human cells grown inside a machine made to replicate human diseases and drug responses more accurate than animal testing. Otherwise they could just pay volunteering humans that give them their consent to mess with their body. The government may say that no those things are far more expensive than animal testing but it is not. Almost sixteen billion dollars of taxpayer\"s money goes to animal testing. One point nine million dollars in the University of Ohio State for cruel heart attack experiments on dogs or the sixteen million at Harvard for drug addiction experiments on monkeys even the three million at Wisconsin University for mice fighting experiments. Just because animals do not talk like us does not mean they do not feel so all the testing that the world does on animals is wrong and should be stopped. The governments of the world should ban animal testing because animals have feelings and emotions, because there are alternative ways to test these things. Animal testing should be ban world wide not a single town not a single state should it be allowed. If you were being dissected to see what a toxin did to your tissue would you think it was humane?

I feel compelled to affirm today\"s resolution that animals should be used for medical research because animal testing has contributed to many life saving cures and treatments, animals themselves benefit from the results of animal testing, and that there is no adequate alternative to testing on a living whole body system. Contention 1: Animal testing has contributed to many life saving cures and treatments. The California Biomedical Research Association states that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. Imagine how many more possible medical breakthroughs that could be discovered with animal experimentation. An example of a life saving treatment discovered from animal testing is the Polio Vaccine. The Polio Vaccine tested on animals, reduced the global amount of those with polio from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 223 cases in 2012. ( animal-testing.procon.org ) Chris Abee, director of the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Centers animal research facility states that \"we wouldn't have a vaccine for hepatitis B without chimpanzees\" and says that the use of animal research is are \"our best hope\" for finding a vaccine for Hepatitis C, a disease that kills 15,000 people every year in the united states. ( animal-testing.procon.org ) A poll taken in 2011 by the science journal Nature showed that nearly 90% of biomedical scientists agreed that the use of animals in research is essential. Contention 2: Animals themselves benefit from the results of animal testing. If vaccines were not tested on animals, millions of animals would have died from rabies, distemper, feline leukemia, infectious hepatitis virus, tetanus, anthrax, and canine parvovirus. (animal-testing.procon.org ) Isnt it reasonable to test on animals if its gonna save more animals? Without Animal testing, many species would soon become extinct. Koalas, aravaged by chlamydia are being tested with new chlamydia vaccines that may stall the animals disappearance. Without animal testing, we could soon lose many species such as the Koala. Even the American Veterinary Medical Association endorses animal testing. Contention 3: Animals are appropriate research subjects due to their similarity to humans. Chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA with humans, and mice are 98% genetically similar to humans. Every mammal including humans have the same set of organs such as the heart, kidneys, and lungs that function in the same way as humans. Because mammals and humans are so similar, they are open to many of the same conditions and illnesses as human such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Animals do not have rights, therefore it is acceptable to experiment on them. Animals do not have moral judgment or cognitive ability that humans do and because of this every culture recorded throughout human history has treated them differently than humans. If we grant animals rights, all humans would therefore have to become vegetarians, and hunting would be illegal. Conclusion: In today\"s round I have shown why Animal Experimentation is essential for progress in Medical Technology due to the fact that Animal testing has contributed to many life saving cures and treatments, Animals themselves benefit from the results of animal testing, and that Animals are appropriate research subjects due to their similarity to humans. For these reasons, we can clearly conclude that progress ( value) should be upheld and we should affirm the resolution that animals should be used for medical research. Clearly we must affirm today\"s resolution.",

Rats are given infected blood to see what effect it takes on them. Is it fair?(a) Is it that the Tokay gecko is bred in all the animal testing labs? Then why is there such a high demand for it? Why is it that the 'tokay\" call that I used to hear every evening near my home has now ceased?(b) (a)http://t0.gstatic.com... (b)http://upload.wikimedia.org... \"Also, animals that go through animal testing are not going through pain and suffering or death.\" Animal testing brutality is an endless list.(c) Animals endure chemicals being dripped into their eyes, injected into their bodies, forced up their nostrils or forced down their throats. They are addicted to drugs, forced to inhale/ingest toxic substances, subjected to maternal deprivation, deafened, blinded, burned, stapled, and infected with disease viruses. These treatments are exempt from anti-cruelty statutes, and worse yet, undercover investigations have exposed violations of animal welfare policies and cases of extreme negligence at labs and universities. That is the point. Negligence. It is like who cares for a few animals? Animal testing labs that are supposed to be safe,clean,anti-cruel etc...have turned out to be cruelty labs where even if not desired, animals are killed because of negligence. (c)http://www.downtoearth.org... \"Also, in regard to your count of tigers in the whole world, the major reason for the small population of tigers, is hunting tigers for their skin, teeth and other features. animal testing is not the reason for close extinction heading towards animals\" Tigers for their skin, teeth and other features? Skin is nowhere to be found now,Pro. The bones are used. The bones for medicinal uses. Now, how did this theory come into being that tiger bones are medicinal? As I mentioned before, this is something that happens when animal testing is done but then stopped but people carry it on illegally. Tiger is just an example of what animal testing leads to. It inspires other individuals to carry these tests themselves for money. Animal testing is not the reason for close extinction of animals? How can one guarantee that when examples of tokay gecko and Giggles are prevalent? Animal testing leads to the high demand of animals. illegal poaching and large scale hunting of such animals occur because of money. Leading to extinction of such animals. How can we say that animal testing is perfectly safe and O.K in such a case? \"Also, it is considered that there are alternatives than using animals for testing drugs, but if this is the truth, then why aren't any alternatives used? Why are animals considered the first option? The truth is that there are no alternatives\" And from which reliable resource does such an argument come from? Of-course there are alternatives to animal testing. animals are also not the closests sample of humans. (e) Cell culture, human tissue use, Vitro modular immune. many of these are in use but this of-course are costlier than animal testing but they are used in respectable labs but as I said, not only respectable labs do these test and prefer animals for the cheapness. Animal testing is never helpful in population control. It is leading to extinction. (e)http://en.wikipedia.org... Conclusion.... I agree that animal testing is having benefits but why helpless animals should suffer when there are alternatives? Animal testing should be made illegal and banned and only alternatives should be used so that only respectable and safe labs funded by the government can carry these tests. This will not only ensure the welfare of animals and also help us find cures and save lives. Thank you.",

            "premise": "Well, this hasn't been the best of debates, but hopefully we can have a better one in the future. Rebuttals:1. My opponent has admitted to using certain forms of medicines and has even gone to the doctor. For example, he admits to taking Tylenol. Tylenol has actually been a result of animal testing [10]. Thus, he is contradicting himself in the sense that he benefits from animal testing in his everyday life yet claims that it should be abolished. In addition, he claims that there are better alternatives than animal testing, yet he provides none. As a result, I do not have to refute this point. 2. To answer your question truthfully; no, I would not like to be taken from my family to be subjected to tests. However, please take note that the animals that are used in animal testing are generally rats and mice. In addition, these rats and mice are not always alive. Sometimes, scientists test on already dead animals. Therefore, I feel somewhat offended that my opponent has compared my life to that of a rat's. Are you suggesting that we, human beings, are no better than these small, tiny mice and rats? Are you suggesting that intellectual beings such as us can be compared to animals that have brought disease and death upon us [11]? Moreover, the animals that are taken away are treated respectably until it is time to test on them. Certain government agencies make sure of this, and if they feel that a company is not treating the animals that are being subjected to testing fairly, then they will close them down or prevent them from testing on any more animals. Lastly, testing on animals isn't just to help us, it is to help them (as I proved in my second argument and its subgroups). 3. You claim that it is immoral to test on animals, yet I have proved otherwise. Without animal testing, there would be no treatments, medications, or knowledge as to how to save an animal's life. Without animal testing, we could no longer bring back animals that were near to extinction. Animal testing may be evil, but its outcomes are just so good that it is illogical to get rid of it. Wouldn't you be willing to sacrifice, say, 50 animals to find a cure to a deadly disease that affects both humans and animals? The cure would protect us from many unneeded deaths. You also state that organs can be donated to test on. And where do you think these organs are coming from? Did you imagine that, perhaps, they would appear out of thin air? No, these organs can come from two sources--animals or humans. I am doubting that any human, including yourself, would want to donate their kidney to cure a disease. After all, would you want to donate your lungs/heart/brain/etc. to be subjected to testing? I certainly wouldn't. There are those, however, who are selfless and will give their lives for the greater good. Sadly, there aren't too many of those people who will be willing to give their lives to cure a disease. However, let's assume (as a hypothetical situation) that we have enough organs from humans to test on. Well, depending on what organs were donated, it would probably cause a plethora of pain, suffering, and death among humans. Thus, it would be pointless to create a cure if that many people die for it. Have you ever read Alas Babylon? If so, then at the end of the book you would have noticed that while the U.S won the war against the Soviets, a character (I cannot recall who) states that it doesn't really matter. Do you know why? Because the U.S lost so many people and cities that winning the war seemed to be a trivial matter. Likewise, the same will probably happen here. In addition, testing on organs doesn't always work. Sometimes, we need to see the effects on the whole body, and not just that particular organ. Therefore, it is so much simpler and better to use animals to test on. Conclusion:I have successfuly refuted all of my opponent's arguments and some of my own have gone un-challenged. Thus, I urge you to vote Con!I thank my opponent for creating this debate, although I wished he had had more time to make his arguments. With that said, I'm going to go eat some chips and salsa!

            "premise": "This has become quite a long argument, jlconservative, and I applaud you for your passion toward the subject. I want to make it clear right now to anyone reading this that this was a debate I was challenged to, and I am merely debating for the sake of debating. That said, I wish to bring up more information, just for the sake of presenting more information. As many as 115 million animals are experimented on and killed in laboratories in the U.S. every year. Much of the experimentation-including pumping chemicals into rats' stomachs, hacking muscle tissue from dogs' thighs, and putting baby monkeys in isolation chambers far from their mothers-is paid for by you, the American taxpayer and consumer, yet you can't visit a laboratory and see how the government has spent your money. You can't even get an accurate count on the number of animals killed every year because experimenters and the government have decided that mice and rats and certain other animals don't even have to be counted. This is referring to the Animal Welfare act, a document passed that OBVIOUSLY doesn't cover rats, birds, mice and other small animals. Here is some more Animal experimentation is a multibillion-dollar industry fueled by massive public funding and involving a complex web of corporate, government, and university laboratories, cage and food manufacturers, and animal breeders, dealers, and transporters. The industry and its people profit because animals, who cannot defend themselves against abuse, are legally imprisoned and exploited. Obviously this comes from a highly opinionated and not very detailed source, but it still presents quite accurate information. There have been numerous testimonies from the actual \"experimenters\", per say, and they say Its A OK because the animals are not like us. Bull. The animals that have organs MUCH SIMILAR TO OURS, like monkeys and dogs, are still used for animal testing. Now I see how this can be beneficial to organ testing and what not but, seriously. I also direct your attention to http://www.defra.gov.uk..., a website listing all of the animal welfare acts and Animal Regulations in the U.S. and UK. Another great website is http://www.hsus.org... If you don't want to go through the trouble of visiting and critiquing these websites, then I might add some here. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) spells out the minimum standards of care and treatment required for certain animals used in research, bred for commercial sale, transported commercially, or exhibited to the public. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the agency responsible for establishing these minimum standards of care and enforcing them through inspections. Originally enacted in 1966, the AWA initially regulated only the acquisition and handling of animals by dealers. It was amended in 1970 to include the care of animals in research institutions. However, birds, rats, and mice bred for research were excluded from regulatory oversight. Subsequently, an amendment was passed as part of the 2002 Farm Bill (the USDA later issued the regulations in 2004) to explicitly exclude virtually all birds, rats, and mice bred for research. These species account for approximately 85% of all animals used in laboratories. The Animal Welfare Act also requires that any institution conducting research on USDA-regulated species have an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which oversees and provides final approval of experiments. This committee must ensure that any pain and distress caused by experiments be minimized, and that investigators consider any alternatives that are available to them (including non-animal alternatives). Standards regarding amount of space, feeding, bedding, exercise, and transportation are written according to species. The standards are broken into three subsections under Part 3 of the USDA regulations, namely Facilities and Operating Standards, Animal Health and Husbandry Standards, and Transportation Standards. that is a passage describing the Animal Welfare Act The Guides stated goal is \"to promote the humane care of animals used in biomedical and behavioral research, teaching and testing; the basic objective is to provide information that will enhance animal well-being, the quality of biomedical research, and advancement of biologic knowledge that is relevant to humans or animals.\" The Guide sets forth standards for animal care in areas such as pain and analgesia use, veterinary care, and behavioral management. That was a passage describing the public health service policy. It protects and promotes humane care of animals. I also recommend going to http://www.stopanimaltests.com... of which I am sure you have been. There is an excellently descriptive video hosted by the actor, James Cromwell, made by PETA. It shows examples of the horrible things done to animals in research labs and the way they are treated. I will disprove some common myths as well. Myth: There are only a few animal rights organizations and they're not worth joining. Fact:There are hundreds of AR-related organizations scattered around the globe. In addition, there are many vegetarian and vegan groups. Visit http://animal-rights.com... for a list of organizations longer than they can post. Myth: Animal Rights is something minuscule that I shouldn't worry about. Fact: Many famous people have supported animal rights, and I have a few quotes to support it. The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withheld from them but by the hand of tyranny. Jeremy Bentham (philosopher) Life is life--whether in a cat, or dog or man. There is no difference there between a cat or a man. The idea of difference is a human conception for man's own advantage... Sri Aurobindo (poet and philosopher) Non-violence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages. Thomas Edison (inventor) The time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals as they now look on the murder of men. Leonardo Da Vinci (artist and scientist) Myth: Arent animal rights hypocritical, because you don't give rights to plants and insects? Fact: This is an argument frequently used against animal right activists and the like. The general hypocrisy argument appears in many forms. A typical form is as follows: \"It is hypocritical to assert rights for a cow but not for a plant; therefore, cows cannot have rights.\" We then begin to assess the rights of an insect verses the rights of a cow. Hmm. Big difference. I am near to running out of characters, and I want to leave readers with a quote to tie up my argument. The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated. Mahatma Gandhi (statesman and philosopher) Thank you.",

            "premise": "First of all, I would like to state that I am new to this site. I extend my thanks to Daniyar for putting forward this stimulating topic, and accepting my input on the debate of this issue. I would also like to ask the community at large for leniency in view of my relative inexperience! As Daniyar says, this is both a contentious topic and there are few easy answers as to the right and wrong of it. I would first contend that to argue that a specific mode of research has previously provided vital and valuable information is meaningless in the context that most of this research has been undertaken with no other methodology available. Studies can be undertaken upon human cell cultures and engineered tissues, often at less cost than testing on animals. A company by the name of Pharmagene Laboratories in the UK utilises only tissue cultures and computer modelling in it's drug development and testing. (http://www.newscientist.com....) I put forth the argument that historically, animal testing was essential due to the lack of viable alternatives; the existence of this company shows that this is now no longer the case. Whether or not this is enough as a method to review a drug's effects on the entire system remains contested by those in favour of medical testing. The UK authorities and relevant boards however accept that this company meets stringent criteria for test safety. In short - I can be grateful to the animal tests of the past for the drugs they have provided us, without seeing a need for animal tests in the future. The next point would be to discuss the failures of animal testing. Animal physiology is not human physiology. The trial of TGN1412, an experimental drug intended to suppress immune system response, is a clear case in point. Despite extensive animal testing, the agent turned out to have an adverse and indeed almost lethal effect on humans (http://en.wikipedia.org...). Aidsvax failed to protect human test volunteers, despite protecting chimpanzees (http://www.safermedicines.org...). It has long been stated that animal testing can certainly be downright contradictory in the results it provides, as well as merely misleading. (Indeed, the previously referenced article highlights the uncertainty amongst UK medical professionals that animal testing indeed has clinical relevance). In Dr. Andrew Knight's 'The Costs And Benefits of Animal Experiments' it is stated that in a study of twenty randomly chosen cases, only two proved useful in further developing medicines and/or consistent with clinical trial data. Several additional reviews illustrated cases where adverse effects failed to predict negative effects through animal testing methods. (http://www.newint.org...) Then we may consider cost. The cost to rear, feed and maintain animal subjects is extremely high, as stated even by proponents of animal testing (http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk...). Alternative methods are cheaper and thus less burdensome on the economy. In societies where governmental funding is provided for medical research, there is a corresponding lessened burden on the taxpayer. The ethical debate is also of primary concern here. No one would put forward the idea that testing on humans in the same manner would be acceptable. Yet animals evince 'intelligence' and quite certainly feel. Scientists have considered it possible to develop a universal intelligence test which animals could take (http://www.newscientist.com...) and have variously noted that even molluscs show signs of consciousness (New Scientist, 11th June 2011, p38 'A beautiful mind') and that signs of intelligence and indeed emotion are not wanting from animals (New Scientist, 2nd July 2011, p41 'Claws for Thought'). If someone were to put to me that a small number of humans should be experimented on for research purposes for 'the greater good', I would be adamant in my objection to the idea. The same argument still applies when referring to animals. Of course, I put my species and self-aware consciousness first. If there was a greater good to be achieved by harming animals , if animal research provided a humanitarian benefit, I would support it wholeheartedly. However, my previous arguments indicate that continued animal research is prolonging unnecessary suffering. It goes without saying that cosmetic testing on animals is completely abhorrent and unnecessary. The argument can be put forward for consideration that a great deal of continued experimentation exists because the structure of scientific society, even within ethical boards, is geared toward a psychological comfort with retaining familiar tests, rather than out of strict necessity. It can also be put forward that such experimentation continues because the traditional methods provide psychological comfort to scientists with an emotional investment in them, namely the avoidance of any discomfort they might feel if they were forced to concede that they had participated in acts of needless harm. These arguments are of course not possible to prove, but I feel they are nonetheless worth offering up for consideration. In UK law comprehensive regulations already limit the extent of permissible animal testing allowed in the laboratory, and is not acceptable unless it is believed that no other means of validating an experiment are available. In short, animal testing is already being phased out. It is my belief that as familiarity with new technologies increases and emotional attachments to animal testing falter, what would amount in practice to a ban would result in any case. Discussions of whether or not a complete, immediate ban is practical, I put it to the reader, are based on individual economic concerns with regards to jobs, as opposed to wider socio-economic concerns or research necessity. I conclude by reiterating my arguments as follows. Firstly, to congratulate animal testing on it's previous successes and therefore conclude that it is essential now is a failure of logic. Second, there exist viable alternatives to animal testing such that it is no longer a necessity for a commercial company to satisfy safety testing requirements. Third, the usefulness of testing with regards to the differences in animal and human physiology is in question amongst a large number of practicing medical professionals, and systemic investigations of such trials have shown that animal tests can be misleading and often do not go on to provide the same results in humans at clinical trial. Some indeed have proven harmful. Fourth, the ethics of testing on animals when they can be shown to have intelligence and awareness, if not equal to that of humans, is highly questionable when alternate methods exist. Fifth, there are arguments to be made as to the reasons for scientific 'clinginess' over animal testing in both review boards and the scientists offering up proposals for review. Finally, an immediate ban would not necessarily have a far-reaching negative impact in an economic sense, given the astronomical costs of animal testing as a whole. I respectfully submit these points for perusal, and await the response with interest.",

            "premise": "Thank you, Pro, for those reasons. I shall present my own arguments, and then deal with Pro's arguments.Argument 1: Animal testing is not as effective as it seemsIt is a common misconception that animal testing is the key to unlocking treasure vaults of scientific knowledge. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the FDA has noted that an overwhelming 92 per cent of all drugs that are declared safe after animal testing fail in human trials due to inefficacy or danger. Examples of drugs in this category include Vioxx, Phenactin, Selacryn and several more.Argument 2: Animal testing is not painlessMy opponent claims that scientists care about the animals, enough to prevent them from experiencing pain. I admire and respect his idealism. It is, in fact, legal under the Animal Welfare Act for animals to be cruelly hurt without pain relief . Such acts include burning, shocking, poisoning, isolating, starving, and brain-damaging these animals. It is, of course, unthinkable for us to do such a thing to a human being without recourse. Doing this to animals therefore causes us to examine the ethicality of our principles.Argument 3: Animal testing is unnecessary for educationIt is widely believed that animal testing is necessary for students to understand physical anatomy. In fact, schools such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford educate their medical students using cutting edge computer programs, that give them an incisive view of human and animal anatomy without necessitating the dissection of these animals.Counter Argument 1: Most of the animals are breed in laboratories specifically for testing (like flies).While this may be true, this does not justify the use of animals for testing. It is akin to suggesting that we should breed humans for the specific purpose of drug and chemical testing. We would not, however, make such a suggestion, because we recognise that sentient beings have inalienable rights.Counter Argument 2: This doesn't affect a species population. In fact, the species used are really common and aren't endangered.This is true, but the same counter argument as above applies. Humans are far from endangered, why do we not use them?Counter Argument 3: An animal life could help the human race to find a cure, understand how certain organs work or even make a progress in the genetics area.As mentioned in my arguments, drugs that work on animals very often fail in human clinical trials. Richard Klausner, former head of the National Cancer Institute, once said that \"We have cured mice of cancer for decades and it simply didn\u2019t work in humans.\" It is unjustifiable, therefore, to inflict pain on animals when this pain is all for nought eventually.Counter Argument 4: Testing on animals allows us to know if a drug is safe for selling it.As mentioned in Argument 1, this is a misconception. Examples of failed drugs may also be found there.Counter Argument 5: Scientists care about the animals. They use them just in really necessary cases and they use techniques that cause the least harm, stress or pain to the animal.Also addressed in arguments.I have therefore proven that my opponent's reasons are weak and that there is little evidence to justify inflicting pain on animals, the way they experience pain in laboratories. I wish my opponent all the best in the following rounds.",

I will be debating the Con side of this argument, however will not be debating that animals SHOULD be used for testing, but rather that it is not in and of itself immoral that animals ARE used for testing. I am using the following definition: Animal: a living, multi-cellular biological organism which derives nourishment through ingestion rather than photosynthesis, and which are spontaneously and independently mobile, and not a human being. I will use Round 2 to rebut Pro, and I will conclude in Round 3. Ultimately, the question of whether or not it is right to use animals for product testing is a moral one. As such, I will be arguing from moral grounds. So, given that this is to be a moral argument, why does man have morals if but to serve our values? What does a rational human being hold as their highest value or highest purpose? I would argue that the first principle of morality is to pursue man's primary purpose \" that being survival of man qua man.[1] In other words, in order to survive as a human being ought to survive. In other words, the prime moral directive of a human being is to choose his actions, values, and goals, in such a way as to maintain and enjoy that which we value the highest \" our own life.[2] Given that products which are tested upon animals are generally either necessary for the direct preservation of our lives (pharmaceuticals), or aid us in the enjoyment of our own lives (shampoo, soap, cosmetics). It is necessary to perform testing on living cellular structures similar to that of human beings in order to determine safety for human use. Given that necessity, it is therefore morally justifiable to use animals for testing purposes. 1) Ayn Rand, \"The Virtue of Selfishness\", p21 http://philo.abhinav.ac.in... 2) Ibid, p22",

            "premise": "haha Ok, well lets take a look at your claims, 1. \"and actually if you look at the numbers, more has been discovered without animals then with\" wow ok well I am not certain why this has anything to do with thy we should not test on animals, making a statement like this is sort of irrelevant and naive, in that sense we should stop oceanic exploration because we have discovered more things in space.. dose not quite make sense. 2. \"Think about penicillin, radioactivity and the theories involving the earths rotation in copernicus' time. Animals were around, and it couldve been tested on them, but the bottom line was it wasnt neccesary.\" haha well first of all according to webmaster,Encyclopedia,Webster, and Bud Wolfons MD. Penicillin was tested on lab mice and sheep so that was something you either research and found the wrong answer or you just have no clue what your saying, personally I vote for the latter. 3.\"Radioactivity and the theories involving the earths rotation in Copernicus time\" wow.... I'm sorry I thought this was almost to stupid to quote, first of all radioactivity and the theories involving the earths rotation have absolutely nothing to do with animal testing, the actual fact that you think that is some sort of ground to stand on is amusing, these theories did not and could not have been tested by using animals whatsoever. 4. \"I have a dog, and all the dog people out there shiver at the prospect of their animal, their best friend, being tested for chanel no. 5.\" well..wow again, first of all you make it sound like the government breaks into houses takes little Annie's pet puppy and brings it to the mad scientists layers were he performs evil experiments on it....again this was a pretty foolish and naive claim.. according to RDS incorporated: \"More than 80 out of every 100 animals used in research are mice, rats and other rodents. Less than one in every 200 research animals is a cat or a dog.\" Dogs, because of the size and similarity of their organs, are important for the development of new surgical techniques and for the study of the heart, lungs and blood vessels. Cats are important in the study of hearing and brain function. The use of both cats and dogs is subject to particular controls which require that they are specially bred for research. Stray cats and dogs or lost pets are not used for research in Britain. 5. \"The point that I am trying to make is that no matter how much we create new drugs and test out new things, animals will always be there. We will not use them, however, because there is so much technology it is unnecesary. We are moving into an age of technology, and moving out of an age of animal testing.\" Ok well...I am either not dumb enough to understand what point your trying to make or I just cannot understand you. So I will just make a point on why it is necessary to use animal testing. Those who would seek to abolish animal research often claim that the use of animals in biomedical research is unnecessary because information can be obtained by alternative methods, such as test tubes and computers. What is often not realised is that scientists have strong ethical, economic and legal obligations to use animals in research only when absolutely necessary. A lot of effort goes into trying to reduce the numbers of animals used, and trying to develop new methods to replace animals. As a result, the number of laboratory animals used annually in the UK has almost halved in the last 20 years. Non-animal methods - tissue culture, computer modelling, studies of patients and populations - are very widely used. In fact, only about ten pence in every pound spent on medical research goes on animal studies. The word alternatives, often used to describe these non-animal methods, can lead to confusion because these methods are generally used alongside animal studies, not instead of them. All these techniques have their place, and it is rarely possible to substitute one for another. There are stages in any research programme when it is not enough to know how individual molecules, cells or tissues behave. The living body is much more than just a collection of these parts, and we need to understand how they interact, how they are controlled. There are ethical limits to the experiments that we can do using people, so the only alternative is to use the most suitable animal to study a particular disease or biological function. As science progresses, it may be possible to reduce the numbers of animals used in some areas. In other areas, the numbers of animals may increase. For instance, new and better animal models may be developed. It is now possible to breed animals with exactly the same genetic faults that cause some human diseases. So mice with cystic fibrosis, for example, have the symptoms as children with cystic fibrosis. These mice are the ideal way to test gene therapy, which may offer a medical breakthrough for the disease. Just as it is necessary to use animals in the study of normal body functions or the study of disease mechanisms, it is also necessary at the later stage of developing and testing treatments. It is unethical and illegal to expose patients to new medicines without being confident that they are likely to benefit and not be seriously harmed. Treatments must, therefore, be tested first in animals to establish their probable effectiveness and safety. They are then tested on human volunteers. The process is not perfect but testing in whole animals is by far the best way to protect people. Animal tests ensure that obviously toxic substances are not given to human beings and that doctors in charge of the human volunteer studies are made aware of possible serious side effects. For example, it is difficult to even imagine what range of test tube techniques or the complexity of computer systems would be necessary to mimic the amazing events that occur during the development and birth of a new baby. With present day technology, and even in the foreseeable future, this is simply not possible. By contrast, appropriate whole animal tests can detect potentially harmful effects of new treatments on foetal development and other events during pregnancy. Thus another thalidomide disaster is most unlikely. No one wants to use animals unnecessarily or to cause them unnecessary suffering. The guiding principles in animal research today are called the three Rs: * Refinement, to make sure animals suffer as little as possible * Reduction, to minimise the number of animals used * Replacement, to replace animal procedures with non- animal techniques wherever possible. Randomknowledge just a hint, get some facts in don't try and sneak lies or false information by me.",

            "premise": "\"believe that my opponent is insinuating that humans are much more superior to animals, if I am correct. This would mean that the psychological and physical differents would be immediately pointed out. Which means that all reactions coming from animals will not be corresponding to those of humans. I do have examples and proof of disasters due to differences between the two species:\" \"Many have died FROM animal testing.\" I understand your argument. You are essentially saying \"Animal testing goes wrong. Sometimes, we think it works in animals, but then we accidentally kill people\". The problem is, this does not show that we should ban animal testing. Banning animal testing would result in MORE human deaths because then we won't have ANY way of testing a medication or procedure. So your argument is void. \"Like you have stated before, from the chinese proverb, how could you feel sure that you know is isn't feeling tortured? Also, torture is a broad term. It could mean anything from slight physical pain to serious psychological confusion.\" Scientific evidence. Rabbits do not have the mental capacity to develop the concepts we know as freedom and pain. They just experience pain. And in this sense, torture would mean both a physical and mental anguish. If your definition of torture is just slight physical pain, it would be wrong to disinfect surfaces, take antibiotics, eat any sort of meat, etc. Thus, there must be more than the physical component to accurately define torture. \"Many livestock are being killed everyday for food. Why add to the mounting number of deaths, when those in the labs can be stopped?\" Begging the question fallacy. This debate is about whether or not we should stop the deaths in the labs. Thus, it is not a valid point. \"Why cause more physical and perhaps psychological pain?\" As I have said before, the benefits we as a species get from animal testing far outweighs the harm we do to the animals we test on. You have no responded to my point about every medication on the market being the result of successful animal testing. \"When you disinfect surfaces, you do kill bacteria. Bacteria, however, are single-celled. They have no nucleus. They simply have the required elements to survive and DNA material to reproduce.\" Your understanding is off. You mean to say that bacteria don't have brains. The nucleus of a single celled organism does not act as neural processing. However, this point is void. Bacteria respond to negative stimulus the same way we respond to pain. When we touch a hot stove, there are chemical signals telling us \"this is bad, pull away\". When bacteria encounter a destructive chemical, chemical transmitters and ion gates make it stop moving in that direction and turn around. \"Animals have so much more; they have the intelligence to feel; even if we do not know what they are feeling, what would cause behavioral differences besides feelings?\" Perhaps, but this really isn't helping your argument. You cannot show that animals feel the same way humans do, so why should we give up animal testing and the lives of so many other humans just because we feel we have an ethical duty towards animals who don't even know what ethics or morals are? \"As for destroying and eating plants, I do not believe that we are talking about plant testing or gardening. Please do not go off on a tangent.\" No tangent here. Plants and animals similarly respond to negative stimuli. Roots grow away from toxic substances, therefore, if we accept your definition, using weed killer is \"torture\" and should be stopped. My point is, \"torture\" must have both a physical and psychological component. Yes, animals may have feelings, but they don't understand the concept of torture. If a human is being tortured, half the pain comes from knowing that they can't escape the pain. Most lab animals simply keep trying to escape the pain. \"As for the poison issue, yes, many animals do die by posions. Who's to disagree? But as the animals adapt to their surroundings, poisons must be strengthened, and have flaws altered. When this happens, the creators will wish to determine whether or not their poison is successful, thus testing it on animals. This kills animals being tested as well as those who have never set foot in a lab.\" Again, you have completely missed my point. You started talking about people trying to manufacture poisons and you have proven me correct. I made the hypothesis that you were skimming through my point about medications, saw the word \"poison\" and began to rant on something incoherently. I was right. You still don't know what you are talking about. I asked you to prove your point that the process of developing MEDICINE will eventually poison more and more animals. You have not done that. I was not talking about people who want to create poisons. I was talking about people who wanted to create working MEDICATIONS. Scientists developing a certain drug will test it on an animal. If it fails, they fix it, and test it on animals until they live. Hence, more testing leads to LESS overall deaths of lab animals, because the medication will have less and less side effects and a lower fatality rate. This completely disproves your point. \"Since you have requested proof that animals have rights, I will give it to you. When I see a dog wag its tail in euphoria, whimper in lament, growl in frustration, or other physical signs indicating emotions, I know I can believe that animals have emotions. You may ask me how I know, but why question this when no one questions when a human smiles or frowns?\" This argument is completely irrelevant, a non sequitor. The fact that an animal displays emotions has nothing to do with whether or not is has human rights. You have failed to prove your point and thus, my argument still stands. \"Those are two main points. There have been counter-arguments, but no other reasons.\" That's the only reason I need. Animal testing is going on and removing it would do a great deal of harm to our species. You are the one proposing the change, you think we should ban it. Thus, the burden of proof falls on you to develop an argument as to why we should ban animal testing DESPITE the terrible setback it would cause for our race. \"I know that you may say that those two are enough, but why isn't an animal's pain enough?\" Non sequitor. This statement may bode well if you were a politician campaigning for the presidency, because it has a nice ring to it. But in debate, this makes absolutely no sense. \"Anywho, there have been many more sufficient reasons posted in this argument that you will hopefully read thoughtfully and thoroughly without \"skimming through\" I hope I have analyzed my opponent accurately, because this seems to be his point between humans and animals. Why not apply it to those among the human race?\" You have analyzed my argument poorly and have not made a single coherent point. --------- First and foremost, my point that animal testing is extremely beneficial to mankind has not been rebutted. Thus, we must take this as truth. Second, my opponent FAILED to show that animals deserve human rights. She only showed that animals have emotions. Third, my opponent is arguing that we should take measures to BAN animal testing. Thus, the burden of proof was on her to give an argument as to why we should sacrifice members of the human species for the sake of other animals. She has failed to do so. While it is regretful that animals die in the labs to produce our medications, the fact remains that animal testing is a necessity for our survival. There is no sufficient reason why we should sacrifice our survival for another animal's since non-human animals do not have and do not deserve human rights.",

            "conclusion": "An alternative for animal testing should be found.",
            "premise": "I will open this argument with writing a counterargument for the \"positive\" side of animal testing. Before I begin this argument I need to state the reasons (that I do agree, are valid) for animal testing: First I do agree that animal testing has helped scientist tremendously over the years in terms of the medical practise. Animal testing does help researchers to find drugs and treatments and I do understand that animals are the easiest target for them to test on, but I do not necessarily agree that it\"s morally right to do so. The next \"positive\" on animal testing is that it improves human health. Yes, this might be true, because animal testing allows scientist to create better drugs and treatments that cures human sicknesses, but is it fair to practise this on animals in order to improve human health? Isn\"t this just a very cruel and selfish way of thinking? I do understand that we need to move forward in the medical practise, but do we necessarily have to kill innocent animals to do so? Animals are alive; therefor they have a life even though they are not human. Is it fair to take one life (which you might think of less), in order to save another life (which you might think is more valuable)? The second last \"positive\" point on animal testing I\"d like to make is that it helps to insure the safety of drugs. I agree with this statement and I understand that there might be less or non-alternatives for animal testing. My question to this is: what do we sacrifice in order for this? Is it worth it to brutally harm and kill animals in order for humans to succeed in the medical practise and live better lives? The biggest reason for animal testing is the fact that animals are considered similar to humans; therefor they are the best candidates for drug/medicine testing. I do not think that we should validate a cruel deed by using this argument. I suggest that a better alternative to animal testing should be discussed and decided on. It\"s not fair to just accept the fact that animals are being used for animal testing, because they are similar to humans. Now for the reasons I do not agree with animal testing: First of all, animals are mostly killed or kept in captivity in order for the testing to proceed. Countless animals are tested on and killed after an experiment. Other animals will be injured and still remain in captivity after tests have been done. As an animal lover, I cannot imagine this being done to animals. Just as humans, animals are alive. They have a heart and soul, just as much as we do and it is not at all fair for humans to justify such a cruel action, just for the sake of improving our own lives. The second thing that makes this a loathing thought is that some of the drugs tested on animals may never be used for anything useful. To me, this is a disgusting thought. Why would you torture animals, to test drugs on them that might never be used? I think mankind should shame them for being so emotionless towards animals. The worst part of animal testing is the fact that it\"s actually very expensive. Animal testing cost an enormous amount of money, since they fed, housed, cared for and treated with drugs or a similar experimental substance. On top of that, animal testing may occur more than once and over the course of months, which means that additional costs are incurred. The price of animals themselves must also be factored into the equation. This makes animal testing even less worth the effort. If it costs you money to kill animals for drugs that might not even be used in the future, surely there should be a less cruel and cost-effective way of doing this?

            "premise": "Well, there isn't much to say at this point as my opponent has pretty much admitted to plagiarism and appears to think that it is benign. That unfortunately isn't true.\"Actually mr what ever it doesn't matter if i get it from that link because i only have to prove it.\"First, it's fascinating that you've admitted to plagiarism, which to me is the equivalent of a full forfeit.Second, this is not the case. You can use some of the arguments in a piece, but literally copying and pasting somone else's work and passing it off as your own work is not permitted, neither here or in academia. I can tell you, as a published academic, that I would get into big trouble if I ever attempted to do that. Third, you haven't proven anything. And, because you bear the burden of proof, you need to prove your case.Fourth, you can call me Mr. Keynes, if you'd prefer.\"By the way Animal testing is cruel last night i read this really sad story about this cat and it says \"Kyle is a little white mouse who lives in a lab. Unlike others, he doesn\"t have to worry about risking his life for food.\" His mother was being cut alive to test for a reaction to certain products and his dad was being tested for different types of drugs, which made him lost the ability to see. Kyle knows his destiny, he\"s still waiting for his day to come, and he\"ll never forget the hopeless look in his mother\"s eye. He watched his mother being rudely taking out of the cage, tortured and abused. He only hopes that someone will understand how he feels, but even that is too scary to think about.This doesn't prove anything. First you haven't cited the story nor used it as evidence -- please don't copy and paste it. So, at this point, you're only argument is \"Trsut me, I'm right.\" Second you're making an assertion that animal testing is cruel without proving it. Third you haven't connected cruelty to a ban. The resolution does not pertain as to whether animal testing is cruel in its current form, but whether it should be flat-out banned. If, for instance, animal testing were modified so that it weren't cruel, and therefore there wasn't a need to ban it -- as your only contention thus far is that animal testing is cruel -- the resolution would fall.Fourth in claiming that \"Kyle knows his destiny\" you pronounce that the mouse is conscious and aware. You've done somhting similar by saying that \"He only hopes that someone will understand how he feels, but even that is too scary to think about.\" These are extraordinary claims, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. What evidence do you have of either of these claims? How can you prove either of them? \"Think about it guys. Imagine you as a dog being locked inside a cold barren cage waiting to be tested . Will you still think animal testing is fair?\"My opponent is quite right that dogs are used for testing in the United States. As I said, she does not conntect this to the resolution. Her argument is essentaily this:P1: If (x) is cruel, it should be banned. P2: (x) is cruel.C: X should be banned. If this were the case, we have to ask ourselves how we define \"cruel.\" Not only is the phrase subjective, but then we have to consider how far we would like to go in our endeavor to eliminate cruelty. Do we ban all forms of animal slaughter? Do we agree with PETA that we animals shouldn't even be kept as pets? If that were the case, wouldn't animals be subjected to even worse fates in the wild? The point is, my opponent cannot take a hypocritical stance that some forms of cruelty are fine, but others are not. At the same time, she cannot ignore that fact that, if animal testing were to be reformed to eliminate cruelty, the resolution falls, anyway. At this point, even though I do not bear the burden of proof, I will offer my own contentions.Contention 1: Animal Testing is Necessary Truth be told, there simply isn't any alternative to animal testing, and we would be foregoing critical scientific research. For instance, all veterninary research requires animal testing, every medical breakthrough over the past 10 years has utilized it, every Nobel Prize Winner in medicine or physiology from as early as 1901 utilized it in their work, and several surgical techniques (e.g., hip replacement and heart transplants), seveal medicines (e.g., several antibiotics and pain killers), and several anasthetics all relied on animal testing -- as did medical techniquies such as MRI's. Simply put, there is no way to substitute non-animal testing completely for animal testing. We would be sacrificng major medical breakthroughs and put human lives at risk.[1. http://tinyurl.com...] Contention 2: My Opponent's Case is DeceptiveMy opponent cites dogs in her example. However, in the U.K., dogs, cats, and primates only account for 0.2 percent of the animals used in research (1). There may be ways, as I said earlier, to reform testing, but using the example of a dog is highly deceptive and Pro is leaving out crucial context. At the same time, the U.K. has strict regulations on the type of testing that can be carried out. For instance, animal testing may only be used in cases where non-animal testing cannot be substituted. Ethics committees constinually review practices to ensure that the benefits of the testing outweigh the costs, the costs being the suffering to the animals. Contention 3: Trade-Off Between Human Suffering and Animal SufferingAs I have pointed out, in many cases animal testing is non-substitutable. It has been crucial in developing crucial medicines and breakthroughs that we use today. So, if you intended to stop the suffering of animals by banning animal testing, you would significantly increase the suffering of human beings who are suffering and dying with otherwise preventable diseases. Surely my adversary would not support that. Contention 4: Philosophical CaseThere is in fact a philosophical case against animal testing. Rene Descartes, for instance, did not consider animals to be conscious, minded creatures, but essentially machines who operated solely with respect to causal laws, noted in the fact that they coudn't display adaptibility as it pertained to language and behavior. Peter Carruthers takes a simialr position. He argues that consciousness necessitates higher-order thinking. For this reason, not all human behavior is conscious. Because animals cannot exhibit higher-order thinking, an argument for consciousness is essentially null and void.[2. http://tinyurl.com...]",

            "premise": "Firstly, I thank Con, for your rebuttal, and will proceed with my own. Well, you have stated that while the food industry uses an insignificant amount of animals, it does have a breeding program, for example, farms, albeit, it is unfortunate that you have not considered the fact of breeding programs also occurring in animal testing, as proved in the 'Royal Society Publishing', written by highly qualified scientists and professors. They have stated this quote, \"We breed animals for four principal reasons: as sources of usable products or services; for medical or scientific research; for aesthetic, cultural or ethical consideration; and as pets\", proving my point of how a small amount of animals, used for medical purposes, also enables us to advance our drugs, has a breeding program, and comparing this to the food industry who, in fact, kill more than 55 billion animals per year, according to 'The Vegan Society of Peace', and yet only do this to satisfy their taste unlike finding cures for cancer, and saving millions of lives, shows that animal testing is a great thing. This proves how animal testing is far more beneficial than all of the other industries that use animals, and how despite using a small amount of animals, as mentioned before, they advance us, as humans, so much more than all the others. Do you really want to stop animal testing? Also, I believe you have failed to comprehend my other point, (as you proved by saying, \"and nothing will happen to the population of the animals?\") which elaborates on, the fact, that, if we stop animal testing, the human race could possibly wipe out; and if the human race is wiped out, the food web/chain, would be out of control, distorted, which would then allow some species to die out, eventually dying out all living creatures. Animal testing would save millions of human lives, thus continuing the human race. By all means, animals are vital for our living. I do believe that animals are affected by the activities of humans. But it is unfortunate that you are slow to realise that as a result we, as humans, have a duty of care for all living things, and animal testing is essential for animals and humans to not become extinct. Also, animals that go through animal testing are not all going through pain and suffering or death. Some tests are even as simple as seeing different wet animals shake themselves. (1) Besides, even if all testing animals died, it must be considered how this is done for the benefit of us staying alive, which as mentioned before, is a must for animals to live. Many of these animals, including mice or primates, are used to test medicines which range from stopping headaches to saving lives. Under these circumstances, would you want animals to be stopped from testing? Millions of human lives depend on bettering our medication, would you rather see millions of humans dying, or 20 rats in a laboratory? Several important medical advances have been made in the twentieth century due to the testing of non-human animals. These advances in medicine could not have happened without the use of animals as testing before releasing it to common people. It must be understood that although animal testing sounds inhumane, it does, and will continue to save lives. Also, in regard to your count of tigers in the whole world, the major reason for the small population of tigers, is hunting tigers for their skin, teeth and other features. Animal testing is the least of the reasons, albeit, the diversity of the tiger count in the whole world, is quite touching, and depressing. Anyhow, even if animal testing is stopped, people will still do this illegally, for the sake of money, albeit, animal testing is not the reason for close extinction heading towards animals, the intention for animal testing is to benefit and advance our drugs, and not to end the animal races. Also, it is considered that there are alternatives than using animals for testing drugs, but if this is the truth, then why aren't any alternatives used? Why are animals considered the first option? The truth is that there are no alternatives, and there aren't any satisfactory alternatives because animals are the closest things related to humans, and for accurate medicine results, that won't kill or harm humans, we need to test our products on other creatures, which enables us to verify if the results are positive and actually work right in the living immune system of an animal, and since we cannot test an experimental medicine on a fellow human with human rights, we must test it on the other members of the animal kingdom who have immune systems. In conclusion, animal testing is extremely beneficial for both humans and animals, if we continue animal testing, we will find new cures, and save millions of lives. Animal testing is to advance drugs, population control, and morality. (1) http://www.bbc.com.... Thank you. :)",

            "premise": "Hello and I would like to start the rebuttal round Moral Community->While this is a valid argument, this can be refuted. While animals cannot show or \"appreciate\" human's rights, they are completely at our mercy. \"The other animals humans eat, use in science, hunt, trap, and exploit in a variety of ways, have a life of their own that is of importance to them apart from their utility to us. They are not only in the world, they are aware of it. What happens to them matters to them. By insisting upon and justifying the independent value and rights of other animals, it gives scientifically informed and morally impartial reasons for denying that these animals exist to serve us.\"-Tom Regan. \"The Philosophy of Animal Rights\" \"Even if we apply the notion of \"dominion\", and if we deprive animals of rights, the principle of \"dominion\" should be applied in a way that requires humans to see themselves as \"stewards\" of animals. As outlined by Matthew Scully in Dominion, humans should apply the principle of mercy to animals, which requires that they inflict no pain or suffering on them. He writes, \"We are called to treat them with kindness, not because they have rights or power or some claim to equality but...because they stand unequal and powerless before us.\" -Dominion by Matthew Scully Con, if you were powerless before someone, would YOU want them to show mercy? A world without animal testing->However, these medical benefits are not due to animal testing. Humane Research Australia (HRA) reports that many discoveries made by non-animal methods were later verified by animal experiments, \"giving false credit\" to animal use. For example, HRA notes, \"Ovarian function was demonstrated by physician Dr. Robert.T. Morris in 1895 in surgical procedures on women, yet history credits the discovery to Emil Knauer who reproduced the procedure in rabbits in 1896... [and] Banting and Best are often cited as having discovered insulin through animal experiments in 1922. However... the discovery of insulin dates back to 1788 when an English physician, Thomas Cawley, performed an autopsy on a dead diabetic.\" No complete alternative to animal testing-However, we could use the data already collected from animal testing to fuel these alternatives, which due to the irreversible effects of time we have. 3 R's-> R1-Con, does it matter what species is skilled if it is a sentient or sapient one? R2-Contradicting yourself. You said that the other alternatives where implausible, then, according to your argument, the 2nd R would be nonexistent R3-Here, I will give examples of testing conducted in the last 2 months Endotracheal intubation, a procedure in which a tube is passed through the mouth into the windpipe, is used on sick and injured children and adults who are experiencing breathing difficulties. Many cats, kittens, and ferrets are still tormented and killed in order to teach pediatric intubation to doctors, nurses, and others at a number of facilities across the country. During these training sessions, live animals endure repeated intubations by inexperienced students, and most are forced to undergo this trauma every few months, often for many years. Cats and ferrets often suffer bruising, bleeding, scarring, pain, chronic coughing, collapsed lungs, or even death . To determine the danger of a single short-term exposure to a product or chemical, the substance is administered to animals (usually rodents) in extremely high doses via force-feeding, forced inhalation, and/or eye or skin contact. Animals in the highest-dose groups often endure severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, seizures, paralysis, or bleeding from the nose, mouth, or genitals before they ultimately die or are killed. The Draize eye and skin irritation and corrosion tests date back to the 1940s. In these tests, a substance is dripped into rabbits\" eyes or smeared onto their shaved skin. Laboratory technicians then record the damage\"which can include inflamed skin, ulcers, bleeding, bloody scabs, swollen eyelids, irritated and cloudy eyes, or even blindness\"at specific intervals for up to two weeks. There is no requirement to provide the animals with any pain-relieving drugs during this prolonged process. The rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is a test in which rats or mice are forced to ingest or inhale a test substance or the test substance is injected into or spread on their skin. The substances are administered to the animals for up to two years before they are killed so that researchers can look for signs of cancer, such as abnormal cells or tumor formation. A 2002 review of existing data suggests a high degree of both false positives and false negatives when using rodents to predict carcinogenicity in humans For years, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) conducted so-called \"wound labs,\" during which conscious or semiconscious dogs and other animals were suspended from slings and shot with high-powered weapons to inflict injuries for crude medical training drills.

            "premise": "My opponent does not contend the point that animal testing is the cause of unspeakable cruelty and also admits to lack of regulations in regards to the testing that is performed. This further highlights the fact that this process is not only archaic, but barbaric as well.My opponent mentions the use of animal testing in regards to treatment of the polio virus. However, as stated in my previous argument, an overwhelming majority (92%) of pharmaceutical drugs that pass animal tests are deemed unsafe for humans. The polio virus vaccination was one of the 8%--an outlier case, if you will. The ineffectiveness of these drugs cannot be stressed enough. 88% of stillbirths are caused by drugs deemed safe in animal tests; the drug Vioxx was proven to protect the hearts of mice, dogs, and monkeys, but led to heart attacks and strokes in 146,000 humans; a scientific executive of Huntingdon Life Science found the animal tests and human results agreed a mere 5%-25% of the time.[1] Even if, hypothetically, animal testing did not entail cruelty and suffering for the lab animals, a method of testing so inaccurate cannot be continued for the health of humans around the world.Animal testing is incredibly costly. Up to $14.5 billion a year is spent on animal testing.[2] One human patient simulator costs $50,000.[3] It would take 290,000 human patient simulators (all of which can be used far more than once) to equal the cost of animal testing.In conclusion, there is absolutely no valid reason to continue the practice of animal testing. Animal testing is costly, ineffective, and above all, cruel. Humans have no right, God-given or otherwise, to inflict pain upon another living creature--animals included. A dog has the intelligence of a two-year-old child,[4] and we would never allow a two-year-old child to undergo such inhumane and appalling test procedures.

It is therefore never acceptable to test medicines on perfectly healthy animals, even if the treatments are for use on other animals.The advent of genetic technologies has made possible all sorts of new and horrific acts of animal exploitation, from cloning sheep to creating mutant and hybrid creatures with no dignity or quality of life at all. We should end animal experimentation before things get even worse.In fact, most animal experiments are done on animals that are nothing like human beings - rats and mice - which undermines the argument that these experiments are a reliable guide to human reactions. Scientifically, as well as morally, most animal experimentation is to be rejected - the reaction of a mouse to a substance is no guide to human reactions. Each species has its own unique physiology. And the more similar an animal is to a human being - e.g. a chimpanzee - the more intelligent and sentient it is, and so the more immoral it is to treat is as a disposable and worthless biological object.in fact few breakthroughs have been made as a result of animal experimentation - its advocates have overstated its achievements. There has been a catalogue of errors and failures in animal testing, which its advocates gloss over; as many as half the drugs that have been approved in the US and the UK after animal testing have subsequently had to be withdrawn because of harmful side-effects. Furthermore, there are alternatives to many tests that are currently done on animals - e.g. growing tissue or cell cultures from human cells in the laboratory.besides that how would you like to have laundrey deterget clowly and painfully driped onto your eye with out being able to blink it out or getting a paralitic because you try to resist and of you say i woud take one for the team and just do it than lets really do it to you and see if you are a little \"squmiry\"",

Con says that my second assertion is bald. However, in respectance to the topics, if the lab workers thought what they were doing was ethical, then they would not threaten the inspectors. That proves that even the workers know it is unethical. Con attempts to refute my \"pointless\" point by saying that we need animal testing to fight of mutations. However, Con has failed to provide examples for this claim and stated a hypothetical when he talked about a \"black plague\" Con used a Slippery Slope Fallacy to close off that refutation, therefore, we cannot take it into account. Con said that we need to test animals for micro-dosing, however Con does not address my other alternatives which include microfluidic chips, artificial skin, and cell culture testing. In defense of Moral Community, Con has set up a strawman fallacy when he misrepresented my argument. My argument was not that animals should have equal rights, by argument was that animals should be treated with a decent expected towards another sentient/sapient being. While animal testing has brought forward various medical treatments, differences in genetic structure render animal testing inefficient 99% of the time (Statista) Con attempts o refute that point by saying I did not say enough examples, but I would have run out of characters if I did. Con talks about how Banting and Best experimenting on animals brought realization of Insulin, however, medical benefits should be credited to those who discovered it, not those who verify it. Con again commits a strawman fallacy when he stated that a relationship between grain and maggots cause the creation of life. Again, this is misrepresenting my argument because Insulin was discovered in that autopsy. Con sourcelessly claims that one of my arguments is false, therefore, that refutation cannot be taken into account. In refutation to the systematic alternatives point, microfludic chips are more accurate then animal testing because they share 100% of the same genetic structure as humans. therefore, that is more accurate then animal testing. Actually, when I addressed the wound labs used in the military, i cited a 2016 NYtimes article that showed the test actually happening. That therefore counter-refutes Con's refutation. I would like to thank Con for an interesting debate and may the best debater win!",

            "premise": "For starters, Con's link is broken (for me, anyway), and it strikes me as probably being an appeal to emotion anyway.Even though I have plenty of rounds, I might as well write my case now.Argument:Contention One: Animal testing of products is beneficial for humansIt is clear that we realize many benefits from animal testing, especially for medicines. The Royal Society argues:'Humans have benefited immensely from scientific research involving animals, with virtually every medical achievement in the past century reliant on the use of animals in some way.' [1]There is no doubt that we realize great benefits from testing products on animals, as the development of antibiotics, insulin, vaccines for polio and cervical cancer, organ transplantation, HIV treatments, and heart-bypass surgery all involved animals. It is even claimed that 70% of Nobel prizes for medicine were awarded for discoveries that in some way was tested on animals [2].Without animal testing, there is little doubt that we would not have made much progress medicinally. Since humans have gained so much from animal testing, and the medicines produced from animal testing have saved so many lives and improved quality of life so much, from a purely utilitarian perspective it makes sense to continue animal testing for science.After all, if you could save a thousands of humans by experimenting on a few animals, wouldn't you?Contention Two: Animals have no rightsAnimals (using the term colloquially, excluding humans) are generally considered to be inherently less valuable by many and most. In fact, there are few who would argue that all nonhumans are deserving of rights. For instance, if you swat a fly that's buzzing around your house, are you morally condemnable? Do you really have any right to turn that bear out of your garage? You might claim it's your property, but how did you get that property? Was it immorally seized from the bear's ancestors? Does the bear in fact have more right to your property than you?From a nontheist persepctive, you can view rights as a series of contracts:'The best means through which we enable all people to pursue their own ends is through individual, hypothetical contracts that we make to not violate each others' ability to pursue ends. We constrain our interests if others constrain their interests so that we do not violate each others' autonomy. From these contracts, we create the basis of rights like life, liberty, and property. If we did not accept these contracts, there would be no reason for other people to do so either, and thus we could very easily violate autonomy and eliminate the basis for self-worth.' [3]However, we cannot form these contracts with animals. If I say to a tiger that's looking at me hungrily 'Hey, you know what would be cool? If we both decided not to harm each other. That will maximize happiness for the both of us!', that's not going to stop it from gulping me down. Since animals won't agree to not harm us, we're under no obligation to agree not to harm them.Conclusion:Since animal testing is beneficial to humans and we have no reason to recognize animal rights, animal testing should continue.Sources:1. http://royalsociety.org...;2. http://www.telegraph.co.uk...;3. http://www.debate.org...;",

            "premise": "Firstly, I will refute my opponent's points, and then advocate my one and only contention to this topic.\"Not any more cruel\"This point does nothing to address why animal testing SHOULD continue for medical research--it merely states how animal testing is not worse than the wild. This is a textbook example of Ignoratio elenchi--presenting an argument that may or may not be logically or functionally valid, but that fails to address the issue in question. This logical fallacy must therefore be discarded, or my opponent must prove how it relates directly to the resolution, and how it isn't just a poorly-disguised attempt at pre-emptively refuting my possible arguments.\"All drugs have to go through animal testing\"This is more of a superficial comment, but I challenge my opponent to cite what information, exactly, is sourced directly from his citations below. This would expedite a reasoned discourse. Furthermore, all of these \"drugs\" that my opponent claims have gone through animal testing can just as easily go through cell culture testing, as I will address in greater detail below.\"Alternatives are not reliable\"Ah. Now this argument promises to be the major point of clash in this debate, as my sole contention is as follows:\"Animal testing can be substituted for cell cultures or other alternative methods.\"My opponent claims that, because \"most bodily functions have different cells for their tasks\", then to use cell cultures as a testing method will somehow incur erroneous or insufficient results. However, it is important to note exactly the testing systems that laboratories and pharmaceutical companies use to ensure drug safety.A study by Bjorn Ekwal, \"Screening of toxic compounds in tissue culture,\" where \"comparisons of in vitro cytotoxicity with in vivo toxicity of 85 randomly selected drugs indicated that for most drugs a systemic lethal action was brought about by cytotoxicity. A screening model is advocated by which results of cytotoxicity tests are compared with systemic toxicity in vivo to evaluate the systemic cytotoxicity of chemicals [1].\" What does this mean? For most drugs, their potentially lethal effects are brought about by damage to cellular systems. The study says it all: \"A screening model is advocated by which results of cytotoxicity tests. . .systemic toxicity.\"Thus, testing drugs' effects on cells themselves is actually one of the most important parts of any pharmaceutical testing battery, contrary to what my opponent suggested.Furthermore, these cell cultures are cultured \"in vitro\"--in a laboratory environment that is carefully manipulated to remove \"interference by nervous and humoral factors present in the intact organism [2].\" This means that they are actually more accurate than testing the entire animal, as extraneous (or \"nervous or humoral\") factors may be excluded from the pharmaceutical testing battery with greater accuracy.Now, a careful reader might note that all of these sources cite using cultured cells derived from tissue samples from animals, and my opponent may attempt to argue that these samples are, in fact animals, but that is just the status quo. These cells could come pretty much from anywhere.Moreover, \"animal cell culture[s are] used to study the effects of new drugs, cosmetics and chemicals on survival and growth of a number of types of cells. Especially liver and kidney cells. Cultured animal cells are also used to determine the maximum permissible dosage of new drugs [3].\" This quotation succinctly sums up my entire argument--animal cell cultures are far more efficacious than testing \"animals,\" which my opponent implied to mean \"the entire animal\" when he attempted to refute my argument pre-emptively.What is the clash? Why does it matter?My opponent's entire argument was alarmingly devoid of thorough citations, as well as truly scientific research. Thus, any evidence I can provide to the contrary immediately renders my opponent's points irrelevant--they aren't supported enough to even really consider \"points.\"Let me quote: \"Also, many alternatives are vastly more expensive or time-consuming than animal testing.\"Where is the citation? Furthermore, to quote my opponent's only linked source, \"Animal testing generally costs an enormous amount of money, as the animals must be fed, housed, cared for and treated with drugs or a similar experimental substance. [4]\"Now, while I'm not focusing on the problems inherent within animal testing, this point is worth noting. To focus on the problems inherent to animal testing would provide an interesting debate, but I'll focus primarily on the benefits of my counterplan.Moreover, I have provided scientific studies that show cell testing is far more important than testing an entire animal, and thus cell testing is superior to animal testing.Finally, all of these research sources I have provided are in consensus--cell testing is better than entire animal testing.I await my opponent's rebuttal, and I challenge my opponent to provide clearer citations at the risk of unintentional plagairism.Citations:[1]:http://www.sciencedirect.com...[2]:http://www.annualreviews.org...[3]:http://www.biotecharticles.com...[4]:http://www.aboutanimaltesting.co.uk...",

            "premise": "It is my position that those convicted of the most serious offences, for example murder, have forfeited their human rights and deserve execution. Furthermore that the best method of execution is to utilise them for medical experimentation and/or organ donorship. My initial argument rests on these points, 1: Rights carry obligations. By committing such heinous offences the criminal should forfeit all rights. 2: Crimes such as murder, rape and terrorism are such terrible crimes that the criminal is unlikely ever to be 'rehabilitated' and should never be freed to endanger society. 3: Permanent incarceration is a drain on the resources of the State and it is amoral to expect the taxpayer to support such people. Whilst imprisoned there is always the chance that the prisoner may harm prison staff or escape back into society. 4: Simple execution fails to give anything back to society. 5: Medical testing on animals raises ethical concerns, people are more concerned with the well being of an average rabbit than they are of a rapist. 6: Medical testing on animals is of limited scientific value. 7: The testing of new drugs or procedures on patients or paid volunteers is unethical, why should normal members of society be used as guinea pigs when we have a surplus of unproductive and worthless criminals? I would like to thank my opponent in advance for accepting this debate.",
