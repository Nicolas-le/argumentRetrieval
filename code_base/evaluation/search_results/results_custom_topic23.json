            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for send out this challenge ahead of time. I wish him good luck in this debate.Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. I shall begin by giving you the horrible statistics of Euthanasia. [1] Approximately 900 euthanasia's a year are done without the consent of the one being euthanized and 50% of euthanasizations are done unreported. In 2005, it was reported that 1.7% of the nation's deaths were caused by Euthanasia, a total of 2,410 people. 1 out of every 5 people who receive euthanasia are done without consent. [2] A study in Belgium reported that 32% were without consent. Contention 2: The Slippery Slope ArgumentKeown gives in his slippery slope argument of 2002, that once one form of euthanasia is accepted that other forms, like involuntary euthanasia, to become legal. For my number one example I present the Dutch. In 1987, the Royal Dutch Medical Association had written into law, \u201cIf there is no request from the patient, then proceeding with the termination of his life is [juristically] a matter of murder or killing, and not of euthanasia.\u201d However, in 2001 they supported a new law that completely supported a law that would legalize non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. [3] .) There 2001 law also permitted children from age 12-16 to be euthanized with parental concent! Though the nation does not consider the child at liberty to make the call. [4]The euthanasia\u2019s in Belgium have doubled since 1998. The involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia rates have slightly increased from 1.5% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2007. In Flanders the euthanasia numbers have increased from 0.3% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2007. In the graph bellow we can see that the number of euthanasia\u2019s have doubled since 2007 as well. The definition of Euthanasia has actually changed over the years from it being killing in 1950 to a quick and easy death in 1981. In the bellow quote we can see that our perspective has changed to the point that we almost do not even associate death with euthanasia in the definition.\"\"Have we really forgotten that euthanasia is killing?\"From a pre-1950 dictionary: \"Mode or act of inducing death painlessly or as a relief from pain.\"From Webster's Third International Unabridged Dictionary (1968): \"1. An easy death or means of inducing one. 2. The act or practice of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from incurable conditions or diseases.\"From Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (1981): \"1. Dying easily, quietly and painlessly. 2. The act of willfully ending life in individuals with an incurable disease\" [5]You are also given the healing doctor a killing roll. This can have a huge effect on doctors as it was proved that it has an effect on doctors who are supposed to heal their patients and are now asked to kill. This also gives off a fear of the doctor as in Holland, the elderly are scared of the doctor, because they are scared that the doctor will euthanize them. [6] We can also see that doctors themselves oppose euthanasia.Physician-Assisted Suicide [euthanasia]:42% Had both a \"religious and nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide31% Had \"no objection\" to physician-assisted suicide21% Had a \"nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide5% Had a \"religious objection\" to physician-assisted suicidePhysician Characteristics:79% of Asian doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide71% of Hispanic doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide67% of White doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide65% of Black doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide79% of Catholic doctors object to physician-assisted suicide79% of Muslim doctors object to physician-assisted suicide75% of Protestant doctors object to physician-assisted suicide74% of Hindu doctors object to physician-assisted suicide54% of Jewish doctors object to physician-assisted suicide39% of doctors with no religious affiliation object to physician-assisted suicidePhysicians from the US Midwest are more likely to object to physician-assisted suicide than those from the US South[7] and [8]Contention 3: Self Ownership and SicknessConsent from a palliative specialist is also very important, but recent euthanasia\u2019s have not been doing so and consenting them. In Belgium, before 2002, all euthanasia cases without concent of a palliative specialist were denied, but from 2002-2007, that number declined from 100% to only 9% as only 19% of all euthanasia cases was a palliative contacted for their opinion. (Same source as the first one used in this round)Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually died on TV. They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. [9]For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. [10]Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, \"\u201cit is thegreatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right andwrong.\u201d [11]This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society.Due to me running out of characters my sources will be presented in the comments section.",

Though the sad fact is tha the government hasn't always used these inventions to the best of their use in order to help people. The Guillotine being one of the greatest examples of a doctor creating an invention for a more humane way for prisoner executions. He had no idea that the Revolutionaries would use this to execute thousands in the Reign of Terror. He had no idea that France would use this to silence their political opposition. Peter Jensen has seen his invention of the loud speaker to turn into a massive invasion of privacy and brainwashing as Hitler took the project and changed it to how he saw fit. Euthanasia. Even though there's a good intention behind the practice history has shown that if you give the government the power of the invention via legalization that it will be used for the wrong reason. Many great authors have already begun to forecast this. The best example is that of \"The Giver\" where the weak are killed off via infantcide and the old are euthanized. There is already a beginning of a mounting support for the practice of eugenics and if this becomes legalized then it will enlarge the government and allow them to infrindge on the rights of their citizens and even take their lives. In this debate I will show why it shouldn't be legalized as we are already seeing this fall from grace and it is our job of this generation to halt this trampling of our rights before we give the government another weapon like the Guillotine or even the Dark Net.Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent.

In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually died on TV. They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. [9]For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. [10]Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, \"\u201cit is thegreatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right andwrong.\u201d [11]This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society.Due to me running out of characters my sources will be presented in the comments section.",

            "premise": "Assisted Suicide. Why? Don't Legalize Euthanasia! Euthanasia, a term that can be described as \"mercy killing\" or the ending of a person's life because they no longer have the desire to live. Euthanasia has been a worldwide controversial debate for many years. Two types of euthanasia may be discussed, active and passive. Active described as \"killing\" and passive as \"allowing to die.\" Is it the physical pain or is it depression that leads a person to desire death? If foreign countries allow, and cannot control their own \"mercy killings,\" why wouldn't the United States follow in their footsteps? These questions and life are too often taken for granted. Euthanasia goes against our morals and duties as human beings. It should not be legalized in the United States, and where it is legal it should be stopped. Active euthanasia is the more controversial of the two types. Supporters of active euthanasia base their defense on \"One, it is cruel and inhumane to refuse the plea of a terminally ill person for his or her life to be mercifully ended in order to avoid future suffering and/or indignity. Two, the individual choice should be respected to the extent that it does not result in harm to others; since no one is harmed by terminally ill patients' undergoing active euthanasia...\". The common rebuttal to this is, \"One, Killing an innocent person is intrinsically wrong. Two, killing is incompatible with the professional responsibilities of the physician. And three, any systematic acceptance of active euthanasia would lead to detrimental social consequences (e.g., via a lessening of respect for human life)\". Basically, a physician has a clear moral obligation to his/her patients, to cure and comfort. This \"obligation\" does not entail killing the patient. Lets talk about Bob, what about Bob. Bob contracted polio at the age of five; initially, he was paralyzed from the neck down. Doctors told his parents that he would never walk again. Due to impairment of respiration and other problems, they believed that he would not live to the age of twenty-one. He also might have been a perfect candidate for physician-assisted suicide. Were the doctors thinking \"better dead than disabled?\" That it would be better to kill your son now in return for 20 years of hospital bills just to have him die? It seems as if there was an attempt to put a price on a person's life. Assisted suicide is most commonly contemplated by the terminally ill. Terminally ill patients do suffer greatly, but is it the physical pain they suffer from? Many physicians seem to believe it is depression that leads these patients to desire suicide. \"USA Today has reported that among older people suffering from terminal illnesses who attempt suicide, the number suffering from depression reaches almost 90%\" (Why We Shouldn't Legalize Assisting Suicide). Dr. Jack Kevorkian believes that any person with a disabling disease who doesn't suffer from depression is \"abnormal.\" What is hard for these people to understand who are pro-euthanasia is that depression is treatable and even curable. A person would suffer a lot less physically if they suffered less mentally. Some medical doctors also feel this way. I think depression factors in greatly with the terminally ill patients, some more than others do. Let's take AIDS patients for example. In time, they suffer greatly physically and mentally. Does this constitute their ability to have suicide granted upon request? No, if it were so, millions of people would die, and look how frivolous life would seem if it were legal to have your own life taken. Physician-assisted suicide in foreign countries has proved to be catastrophic. \"In 1990, physicians in the Netherlands were involved in 11,800 deaths, or 9% of all deaths in the country. Of these, half were labeled \"active involuntary euthanasia\", that is, the patient was killed without his consent\" (Ohio Right to Life). For example, \"by the late 80's it had become routine to \"euthanize\" babies born with handicaps, like Downs syndrome and spina bifida. Three nurses in Amsterdam killed several comatose patients without any consent. They were convicted, not of homicide, but of failing to consult a physician\" (Ohio Right to Life). All of this has occurred in a country where euthanasia is legal. How would it be possible for the United States to keep it under control? \"If we can't even control the actions of one doctor (Jack Kevorkian) when physician-assisted suicide is illegal, how can we expect to regulate the actions of thousands of doctors where physician-assisted suicide is legal\" (Christian Medical & Dental Society). The United States should learn from the mistakes of other nations and think twice about making physician assisted suicide legal. Life is taken for granted all too often, people always look for the shortcuts, the easy way out. Death should never be a persons last resort, there will always be an alternative. Humans cannot be compared to animals either. We can't be taken to a veterinarian to be put to sleep. It is immoral and dehumanizing. People rarely take into consideration how precious life is. Feelings of depression and guilt often overwhelm the sick. They only think of one way out. If euthanasia were to be legalized, the already declining morals and ethics of this country would be further compromised. Making it legal to kill is immoral, and goes against our duties in society.",

            "premise": "I don't know why you keep saying that the process is arbitrary, because it isn't. People are not arbitrarily moved to hospice care. That is a much more involved and arduous process among the patient, family and doctors than some doctor simply saying \"Ok, you're going to die now because I've arbitrarily made the decision to let you die without having some medical reason to back it up\". Doctor shopping the likes of Rush Limbaugh hopping around trying to buy amounts of Oxycontin that would ordinarily kill an elephant only happens because such a thing is illegal. Once euthanasia was made legal, the only reason why a doctor would say no is because they medically don't fit a need for it or the doctor doesn't personally believe in it. I, personally, don't believe that a doctor should be allowed to deny someone requesting it. Doctors who do believe in physician-assisted suicide have thus far been forced to watch patients degenerate over long periods of time until a painful death, so why should doctors who don't believe in it be able to skirt their obligation to their patients and deny them the care they deserve? If there is doctor shopping to find someone who will assist someone who wouldn't fit the need for hospice care, then that will be illegal in the same way as doctor shopping for large quantities of controlled drugs is illegal now. It might happen regardless, but to say that small problem should derail euthanasia from becoming legal is ridiculous. If you do think euthanasia should be kept illegal because of the threat of doctor shopping, then we should re-evaluate a number of privileges that doctors have now that might potentially be shopped around for. Are you talking about doctorates or physicians? I take all my classes from Ph.D's, but none of them are physicians. If you are talking about all doctorates, then of course I wouldn't want your friend to help me or anyone commit suicide because they aren't an actual doctor. I wouldn't want my Public Policy professor helping anyone commit suicide. But actual doctors, with actual medical degrees, who actively practice medicine in a medical environment (so pretty much the \"white coat\" physician that everyone thinks of when you say \"doctor) should be allowed to make that call. I figured that when we were talking about physician-assisted suicide, you knew I meant actual physicians and not anyone with just a doctorate. I might have been mistaken, but I doubt it. That's a great story about your dad, but he wouldn't have been able to make the call himself since he wasn't 18, so it doesn't fit in this debate. Is there a possibility that some of the people who would opt for euthanasia would have perhaps pulled out of their illness, such as with your dad...maybe. There are stories of people waking up one morning and no longer having cancer, but this rarely ever happens and should not be counted on to happen with any regularity. Not only would they have to miraculously recover, which almost never happens, but that person would also have to have actually selected euthanasia, which is a personal choice many people will not make. Their suicide would also would have had to happen before they had their miraculous recovery, which presumably would not be a same-day kind of procedure. All of these things happening would make such an occurance incredibly unlikely. Thus, national policy should not be based off of something as unlikely as that, especially since the decision would be based on the individual patient's decision. Death penalty supporters don't seem to be very deterred by the much more likely possibility of putting an innocent person to death, and that's when the state is forcing the issue on the individual.",

Approximately 900 euthanasia's a year are done without the consent of the one being euthanized and 50% of euthanasizations are done unreported. In 2005, it was reported that 1.7% of the nation's deaths were caused by Euthanasia, a total of 2,410 people. 1 out of every 5 people who receive euthanasia are done without consent.

For my number one example I present the Dutch. In 1987, the Royal Dutch Medical Association had written into law, \u201cIf there is no request from the patient, then proceeding with the termination of his life is [juristically] a matter of murder or killing, and not of euthanasia.\u201d However, in 2001 they supported a new law that completely supported a law that would legalize non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia.

The involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia rates have slightly increased from 1.5% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2007. In Flanders the euthanasia numbers have increased from 0.3% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2007. In the graph bellow we can see that the number of euthanasia\u2019s have doubled since 2007 as well. The definition of Euthanasia has actually changed over the years from it being killing in 1950 to a quick and easy death in 1981. In the bellow quote we can see that our perspective has changed to the point that we almost do not even associate death with euthanasia in the definition. \"\"Have we really forgotten that euthanasia is killing?\" From a pre-1950 dictionary: \"Mode or act of inducing death painlessly or as a relief from pain.\" From Webster's Third International Unabridged Dictionary (1968): \"1.

This also gives off a fear of the doctor as in Holland, the elderly are scared of the doctor, because they are scared that the doctor will euthanize them. (http://www.all.org...)

For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death.

Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, \" \u201cit is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.\u201d (http://www.bmj.com...) This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society.",

            "premise": "Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. I shall begin by giving you the horrible statistics of Euthanasia. [1]) Approximately 900 euthanasia's a year are done without the consent of the one being euthanized and 50% of euthanasizations are done unreported. In 2005, it was reported that 1.7% of the nation's deaths were caused by Euthanasia, a total of 2,410 people. 1 out of every 5 people who receive euthanasia are done without consent. [2] A study in Belgium reported that 32% were without consent. . Contention 2: The Slippery Slope Argument Keown gives in his slippery slope argument of 2002, that once one form of euthanasia is accepted that other forms, like involuntary euthanasia, to become legal. For my number one example I present the Dutch. In 1987, the Royal Dutch Medical Association had written into law, \u201cIf there is no request from the patient, then proceeding with the termination of his life is [juristically] a matter of murder or killing, and not of euthanasia.\u201d However, in 2001 they supported a new law that completely supported a law that would legalize non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. [3] .) There 2001 law also permitted children from age 12-16 to be euthanized with parental concent! Though the nation does not consider the child at liberty to make the call. [4] The euthanasia\u2019s in Belgium have doubled since 1998. The involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia rates have slightly increased from 1.5% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2007. In Flanders the euthanasia numbers have increased from 0.3% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2007. In the graph bellow we can see that the number of euthanasia\u2019s have doubled since 2007 as well. The definition of Euthanasia has actually changed over the years from it being killing in 1950 to a quick and easy death in 1981. In the bellow quote we can see that our perspective has changed to the point that we almost do not even associate death with euthanasia in the definition. \"\"Have we really forgotten that euthanasia is killing?\" From a pre-1950 dictionary: \"Mode or act of inducing death painlessly or as a relief from pain.\" From Webster's Third International Unabridged Dictionary (1968): \"1. An easy death or means of inducing one. 2. The act or practice of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from incurable conditions or diseases.\" From Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (1981): \"1. Dying easily, quietly and painlessly. 2. The act of willfully ending life in individuals with an incurable disease\" [5] You are also given the healing doctor a killing roll. This can have a huge effect on doctors as it was proved that it has an effect on doctors who are supposed to heal their patients and are now asked to kill. This also gives off a fear of the doctor as in Holland, the elderly are scared of the doctor, because they are scared that the doctor will euthanize them. [6] We can also see that doctors themselves oppose euthanasia. Physician-Assisted Suicide [euthanasia]: 42% Had both a \"religious and nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 31% Had \"no objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 21% Had a \"nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 5% Had a \"religious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide Physician Characteristics: 79% of Asian doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 71% of Hispanic doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 67% of White doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 65% of Black doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Catholic doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Muslim doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 75% of Protestant doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 74% of Hindu doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 54% of Jewish doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 39% of doctors with no religious affiliation object to physician-assisted suicide Physicians from the US Midwest are more likely to object to physician-assisted suicide than those from the US South [7] and [8] Contention 3: Self Ownership and Sickness Consent from a palliative specialist is also very important, but recent euthanasia\u2019s have not been doing so and consenting them. In Belgium, before 2002, all euthanasia cases without concent of a palliative specialist were denied, but from 2002-2007, that number declined from 100% to only 9% as only 19% of all euthanasia cases was a palliative contacted for their opinion. (Same source as the first one used in this round) Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually died on TV. They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. [9] For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. [10] Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, \" \u201cit is thegreatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right andwrong.\u201d [11] This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society. Due to me running out of characters my sources will be presentedi n the comments section.",

            "conclusion": "Assisted Suicide shoud be legal in Virginia",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for proposing this topic. I have the same objects to Physician assisted suicide as I do with Euthanasia, they are it is immoral, they are subjective, there is no right to die, it will lead down a slippery slope to other things, it really isn't voluntary, it is against any every major religion, and it degrades human life. First lets address my opponents points. \"patients will be able to die with dignity, free from pain and a possible long, suffering death.\" You mentioned Oregon's Death with Dignity Act. In Oregon you qualify for PAS if \"An adult who is capable, is a resident of Oregon, and has been determined by the attending physician and consulting physician to be suffering from a terminal disease, and who has voluntarily expressed his or her wish to die, may make a written request for medication for the purpose of ending his or her life in a humane and dignified manner\" [1] It makes no mention of pain. Further, \"It is widely believed that there are only two options open to patients with terminal illness: either they die slowly in unrelieved suffering or they receive euthanasia. In fact, there is a middle way, that of creative and compassionate caring. Meticulous research in Palliative medicine has in recent years shown that virtually all unpleasant symptoms experienced in the process of terminal illness can be either relieved or substantially alleviated by techniques already available.\" [2] Since Pain can be controlled it should not be used as a reason to kill yourself. \"physicians should assume their roles in relieving the sick from suffering\" When people receive their medical degree they have to take something called the Hippocratic oath. In the Hippocratic oath it prohibits directly or indirectly killing human beings. The oath was created in part so patients could be reassured that doctors only wanted to help them, not hurt them. [3] By violating this oath how can we know the doctor is acting in the patient's interest? A physician's role is to kill illnesses not kill patients. \"DWD is the humane thing to do\" This is basically saying it is compassionate to kill them because they have no hope of recovery. \"A century ago, high blood pressure, pneumonia, appendicitis, and diabetes likely meant death, often accompanied by excruciating pain. Women had shorter life expectancies than men since many died in childbirth. Antibiotics, immunizations, modern surgery and many of today\u2019s routine therapies or medications were unknown then.\" [4] It is never humane to kill humans, and there is always hope for a cure. Now to the objections 1. Immoral One of the most famous philosophers of ethics was Immanuel Kant. He came up with a system of figuring out if an action was moral or not called the Categorical imperative. The Categorical imperative is an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings and is independent of any personal motive or desire. In using the this method Kant condemned all forms of suicide by saying the purpose pain is to protect one\u2019s life [5] , such as taking your hand out of a fire because it burns, and by using pain as a reason to end one\u2019s life was contradictory to the purpose of pain and was therefore immoral. We usually strive to be moral beings, so we should avoid from having immoral acts. 2. Subjectivity Due to the laws subjectivity there are never clear answers. In the Oregon Death with Dignity act Terminal Illness is defined as \u201cmeans an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months\" [1] Things such as pain, suffering, or terminal illnesses are all subjective and you could get different opinions between different doctors, and why is the limit six months for physician assisted suicide and not four or eight months? There is no sound medical reason for why six months are chosen. Since there is subjectivity, it makes the law hard to enforce and have safeguards for. 3. Right to Die The courts have ruled on physician assisted suicide and there was no constitutional right to die. In the case Washington v. Glucksberg the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that Washington\u2019s ban on physician assisted suicide was not a violation of the fourteenth amendment and there was no constitutional right to die. [6] They ruled the same in the similar case of Vacco v. Quill. As far as the courts are concerned there is currently no legal right to euthanasia or physician assisted suicide. 4. Slippery Slope The legalization of voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide would lead down a slippery slope to other non-voluntary euthanasia. The Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia in 2001 but have they gone down the slippery slope? In 2004 the Netherlands passed something called the Groningen Protocol. This allows the non-voluntary euthanasia of infants. [7] So, as far as the slippery slope is concerned the Netherlands is well on their way down and there nothing stopping other countries from following. We should not legalize PAS because it will lead to other more damaging things. 5. Voluntary? Voluntary euthanasia is not as voluntary as you might think. The most famous euthanasia program was the one that took the lives of eleven million people in the 1940s, the infamous holocaust. The victims of the Nazis were Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, Homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and people with disabilities. In particular the Nazis attacked people with disabilities with a propaganda campaign portraying them as burdens to society and their families. \"The principal reason people in a 1991 Boston Globe survey said they would consider some option to end their lives if they had \u201can incurable illness with a great deal of physical pain\u201d was not the pain, not the \u201crestricted lifestyle,\u201d and not the fear of being \u201cdependent of machines,\u201d but rather that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be a burden\u201d to their families. Family members who support the suicide of a terminally ill patient often unwittingly reinforce the notion that the ill family member\u2019s life has lost all meaning and value and is nothing but a \u201cburden.\u201d\" [8] \"Many elderly people already feel a burden to family, carers and a society which is cost conscious and may be short of resources. They may feel great pressure to request euthanasia 'freely and voluntarily'. These patients need to hear that they are valued and loved as they are. They need to know that we are committed first and foremost to their well-being, even if this does involve expenditure of time and money. The way we treat the weakest and most vulnerable people speaks volumes about the kind of society we are\" [2] So, voluntary euthanasia/Physician Assisted Suicide is almost as voluntary as in Nazi Germany. I look forward to my opponent's response. Sources: [1] http://euthanasia.procon.org... [2] http://www.ethicsforschools.org... [3] http://www.life.org.nz... [4] http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org...

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for being patient for my response time. I will readdress his doctor's opinion's on PAS in my second contention. Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia without consent. My opponent does not actually refute my argument, but rather attacks the validity of my sources. He states that my ncbi source in C1 is a mere opinion, so it doesn't matter, right? Wrong, if we just so happen to look at the bottom and see his sources we can see a trememdous amount of creditable sources that he has site. Okay so what, he has valid sources? Well if we observe our J. Pereira we can see that he is the author of several medical papers and is a very creditable source. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...) Secondly, he isn't the only source that I use in my argument that I've made last round. I've made two as this was the second article. (Smets T, Bilsen J, Cohen J, Rurup ML, De Keyser E, Deliens L. The medical practice of euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands: legal notification, control and evaluation procedures. Health Policy.2009;90:181\u20137. doi: 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.10.003) He also states that my argumentation was false, but this is incorrect as the Euthanasias without consent are that of the doctor terminating the person's life when they do not wish it to end. This simply mirrors that of putting a baby into a microwave and \"drying them off.\" It's not correct. Plus I've showed that even with it legal we can see that there is still a black market for euthanasia so it does not solve that problem what-so-ever. Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually woke up to be on the O\u2019Rielily Show. (http://www.rense.com...) They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. (http://www.nysrighttolife.org...) Contention 2: Slippery Slope argument. My opponent only discounts my argument as a slippery slope, but states that it doesn't have any support claims, but the two examples that he put up on petistools were the examples I used and I showed that their pregresssion has lead to Non-Voluntary Euthanasia. It all started with legalizing PAS and is happening in other parts of the World. Even the US. Just like in Belgium now, people are able to euthanize children, which I had brought up last round. You can see how this is becoming socially acceptable as the numbers and the rates of euthanasias are increasing and in some cases doubling. The cases of Euthanasia in both Belgium and Neatherlands have doubled and skyrocketed since they had been able to legalize it and this is proof of this becoming a norm. There is plenty of information on euthanasia avaliable as several European nations have been doing this for years. Now once again, I understand that Pro is against involuntary euthanasia, but the fact is that I have show that by supporting this will lead to the fact of it getting legalized as it has led to the ability for children to be euthanized by the word of their parents in Belgium in 2009. So I just extend my arguments across the board. I also extend my moral decay argument. Physician-Assisted Suicide [euthanasia]: 42% Had both a \"religious and nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 31% Had \"no objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 21% Had a \"nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 5% Had a \"religious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide Physician Characteristics: 79% of Asian doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 71% of Hispanic doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 67% of White doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 65% of Black doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Catholic doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Muslim doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 75% of Protestant doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 74% of Hindu doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 54% of Jewish doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 39% of doctors with no religious affiliation object to physician-assisted suicide Physicians from the US Midwest are more likely to object to physician-assisted suicide than those from the US South (http://euthanasia.procon.org...) Contention 3: Self-Ownership and sickness My opponent here only quotes about my entire third Contention says I'm wrong and that's it. He doesn't refute it or anything and because of that I extend it across.",

            "premise": "Hey lannan, Thank you for extending this debate opportunity to me. I look forward to an intense clash of minds in which all who observe can enjoy. XI: Intro and Definition I would like to begin this debate by making the clear observation that PAS (Physician assisted suicide) is NOT the same as euthanasia. In my own words PAS is self-administered death while euthanasia is the taking of another's life by the actual doctor, with of without their consent. Basically in euthanasia the doctor pulls the trigger (with or without permission by the patient) while in PAS the doctor simply supplies the gun, very different. These quotes will demonstrate what I am saying: \"Physician-Assisted Suicide is where patients with a terminal diagnosis (life-limiting disease) formally request a prescription for a fatal dose of a drug which they can administer to themselves at a time of their choosing......It is a patient-initiated and controlled form of dying, to treat an unbearable situation, and is legal in two states in the U.S.A. (Oregon [Death with Dignity Act 1994] and Washington [2009]), and in Europe in The Netherlands.\" \"Euthanasia is when a physician or other healthcare provider does something, such as administering a known lethal dose of a drug, to deliberately kill a patient, with or without the patient\u2019s consent. It is not legal anywhere in the U.S.A.\" ~http://comfortcarechoices.com... \"Physician-assisted suicide is often confused with euthanasia (sometimes called \"mercy killing\").\"~Wiki: Assisted Suicide XII: PAS is Safe and is fairly common in other countries Many people have misconceptions about physician assisted suicide. PAS is a very safe practice, Countries which allow PAS include: Colombia, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Canada. In the U.S. these states allow PAS currently: Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Montana and Vermont. ~Wiki: Assisted Suicide. Another fear many people have about PAS is that it is unsafe and leads to family members forcing others to engage in PAS for personal gain such as inheritance. This would be a major concern if it were not for the reasonability of legislation and the opposition to PAS. What I mean by that is, the fact opposition brings attention to the possibility of abuse, special measures are taken to implement especially safe laws. Here is a sample of the legal process to apply and receive PAS: \"Several safeguards in Death with Dignity laws ensure all patients are protected, and if they wish to use the law, they're in full control of the process. These safeguards and the request process ensure there's no chance patients are coerced to hasten their deaths. The terminally ill patient: verbally requests the medication from the physician twice; each request is separated by 15 days. make a written request to the attending physician; the request is witnessed by two individuals who are not primary care givers or family members. can rescind the verbal and written requests at any time. must be able to self-administer and ingest the prescribed medication. The law further requires... The attending physician must be licensed in the same state as the patient. The physician's diagnosis must include a terminal illness, with six months or less to live. The diagnosis must be certified by a consulting physician, who must also certify that the patient is mentally competent to make and communicate health care decisions. If either physician determines that the patient's judgment is impaired, the patient must be referred for a psychological examination. The attending physician must inform the patient of alternatives, including palliative care, hospice and pain management options. The attending physician must request that the patient notify their next-of-kin of the prescription request. Use of the law cannot affect the status of a patient's health or life insurance policies. The states' departments of health enforce compliance with the law. Compliance requires physicians to report all prescriptions to the state. Physicians and patients who comply with the law are protected from criminal prosecution. Physicians and health care systems are not obligated to participate in the Death with Dignity laws.\" ~ See more at: http://www.deathwithdignity.org... XIII: The Moral Reason Physician Assisted Suicide Should Be Legal Beyond any facts I have presented I must state the moral reason for which PAS should be allowed, ultimately it comes down to the fact that people who suffer never-endingly, deserve the right to control their own life and as has been said, \"Die with Dignity\". People who oppose PAS often make arguments which are quite contradictory to the way in which we are supposed to treat others in the U.S.. One I often hear is, 'we cannot play god', to which I must respond, \"Which one?\". Not everyone believes in the same god and some lack such a concept. by rejecting the idea of PAS using this logic, are you not imposing your religious beliefs on others and is this not against the way in which we are supposed to operate in the U.S. concerning religion? I find it wrong that people who have never experienced excruciating and continual pain, force their beliefs on those who on a daily basis do. It is very egotistical to believe that you know more than an 'expert' in pain, in essence. So these people who have never experienced such pain prevent laws from being passed which would free people from the prison of their body. A person who is burning in a fire will experience pain so vast that it is incomprehensible, and it should be absolutely morally irreprehensible to allow the continuation of such pain; what deprives one of their right to pursue happiness than something like that? Please let me be clear, if such pain occurs for just a moment, then of course they should not be allowed to end their life. And if this pain is psychological and caused by depression, then of course they should not be permitted to end their life in this name, however it is when this suffering is permanent that we must disallow its continuation. Doing otherwise should be considered a crime, not vice vera. Thanks you for reading and considering, I end my opening statement.",

            "premise": "The right to life is perhaps the most basic and fundamental of all our rights. However, with every right comes a choice. The right to speech does not remove the option to remain silent; the right to vote brings with it the right to abstain. In the same way, the right to choose to die is implicit in the right to life. The degree to which physical pain and psychological distress can be tolerated is different in all humans. Quality of life judgments are private and personal, thus only the sufferer can make relevant decisions.[1] This was particularly evident in the case of Daniel James.[2] After suffering a spinal dislocation as the result of a rugby accident he decided that he would live a second-rate existence if he continued with life and that it was not something he wanted to prolong. People are given a large degree of autonomy within their lives and since deciding to end your life does not physically harm anyone else, it should be within your rights to decide when you wish to die. While the act of suicide does remove option to choose life, most cases in which physician assisted suicide is reasonable, death is the inevitable and often imminent outcome for the patient regardless if by suicide or pathological process. The choice for the patient, therefore, is not to die, but to cease suffering.

            "premise": "1. Third Party Influence: My opponent agrees that no law can be crafted on such a delicate issue which will rule out corruption in the Ethanasia system. Also, my opponent does not present a way for a system to have transparency built in to allow reviews of the decision's toward euthanasia. It is very important to understand that Third Party Influence has the potential to corrupt the Euthanasia system. No law can be crafted which can ensure this does not occur or to allow prosecution in the future since transparency does not exist. My opponent argues that he believes a case in which a Third Party (Family, freinds, or outsiders) has an agenda and pressures the patient into assisted suicide is \"rare\". This is true but that is because only 6 places in the ENTIRE world allow euthanasia. Now extending the legality of euthanasia to all of the USA, the third largest country in the world, you can imagine that cases of corrupt behavior by a third party will rise as the number of euthanasia procedures rise. Since my opponent agrees that corrupt behavior does exists he must understand that by extending the power of euthanasia to 350,000,000 people corrupt behavior will increase. My opponent's argument: \"Mind you, for most if not all voluntary euthanasia procedures, this patient is under unbearable pain and/or is terminally ill. So it's not like family members (really corrupt ones at that) can try to find any excuse to persuade their relative to pull the plug; the patient would have to meet the requirements medically speaking. This requirement by itself limits the possibility of family members trying to profit from someone's death.\" As the law is written in Oregon, \"Under the law, a capable adult Oregon resident who has been diagnosed by a physician with a terminal illness that will kill them within six months may request in writing, from his or her physician, a prescription for a lethal dose of medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life.\" (Wikipedia.com) So my opponents argument that the patient is on a deathbed in excruciating pain pleading for their life to end is only half the story. Patients can ask for euthanasia as soon as they are diagnosed with a terminal illness and they have less than six months to live. My opponent assumes that they will wait until they are in severe pain and almost dead to ask for euthanasia when in fact they can choose euthanasia before disease has the chance to consume their body. Hence the name of the law in Oregon - \"Death with dignity act\". Meaning a person can avoid putting his or her family through the pain of seeing them in severe pain and drifting in and out of consciousness and ending their life weeks or months before this occurs. So their family is not exposed to such trauma. This being true makes his argument that corruption by a third party is limited since the patient must meet medical standards and be in severe pain false. Since the only requirement the current law in Oregon requires the patient to have a terminal illness that will kill them within 6 months. This leaves a large enough window for Third Party corruption. This being true euthanasia should not be legalised. 2. Corruption in the Euthanasia System Opponents Agrument: \"A doctor can't get paid by some shady character and kill the patient; there has to be written consensus on the patient's part.\" The scenario i presented in round is this: Under the model that doctors must not be paid for euthanasia but offer them for free to rule out corrupt behavior in the euthanasia system would not work. Doctors would have more incentive to authorize and conduct fraudulent euthanasia procedures since they would be paid \"under the table\" for them. My opponent argument fails for 2 reasons. First, my opponent again insists that \"written consent on the patients part\" rules out corrupt behavior. As i have clearly explained, patient consent does not rule out corruption. If a patient is pressured by a third into assisted suicide his \"written consent\" is merely a lie for he or she truly does not want to undergo euthanasia. Second, my opponent's depiction of \"some shady character\" paying a doctor to \"kill the patient\" is exaggerated. Under the model of free euthanasia procedures, a Third Party (family or friends of the patient, hardly \"shady\") can approach the doctor and pay him money to fraudulently authorize and conduct an euthanasia procedure. If the doctor is not getting paid to conduct and authorize legal euthanasia he has more incentive to conduct and authorize a fraudulent euthanasia for money. The argument that offering euthanasia for free will uproot corruption again is false. Not only will doctors be more susceptible to corruption but consumers of euthanasia procedures will increase. So more people will choose euthanasia as a viable option since it is free, there is no barrier to curb the use of euthanasia, instead this will increase the number of procedures performed. As i stated earlier, with the increase of euthanasia procedures, the probability that corrupt behavior will occur also increases. Conclusion: Euthanasia is a very tough issue. It offers families in dire situations to help end the suffering of loved ones. Many can agree that it seems humane and right to allow Euthanasia to speed up the process of death in such a scenario. However as the law in Oregon shows, a person can choose Euthanasia month or weeks before they are reduced to such a state. The dangers that are clearly eminent by corruption can not be purged from any Euthanasia system. Legislatures can not craft a law perfect enough to rule out corruption and greed. Nor, can they craft a law allowing transparency into the decision of the terminally ill for later review into corrupt or fraudulent behavior since the terminally ill has deceased. Allowing 350,000,000 the right to assisted suicide is dangerous since we can not control corrupt behavior. It should noted Patients are allowed to refuse medical treatment even if it speeds up the process of their death. In this situation the patient in in complete control, no second party is conducting procedures that actively kill the patient. Also people should understand that Euthanasia is not a perfect science: \"In an earlier 2000 study of 649 patients undergoing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, 14% of patients undergoing euthanasia had complications such as waking from the coma, spasms or vomiting.[2] Thirty-two percent of patients undergoing physician-assisted suicide had complications which were troublesome enough in 18% to require their doctors to switch to active euthanasia. In this study physicians were absent in 28% of cases of euthanasia and 48% of cases of physician-assisted suicide.\" http://en.wikipedia.org... These stats are from the Netherlands where Euthanasia is legal. The Netherlands only represents %5 of the USA population. For these reasons Euthanasia should not be legalized.",

            "premise": "Subject- Today's debate is centering around the ethicality of euthanasia and whether or not it's process should be practiced throughout the world. Although today's main argument will be about \" Voluntary Euthanasia\" Euthanasia- (from the Greek: \u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 meaning \"good death\", eu (well or good), thanatos (death)) refers to the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering. Ethicality- in accordance with principles of conduct that are considered correct, esp those of a given profession or group. Voluntary- proceeding from the will or from one's own choice or consent Like other terms borrowed from history, \"euthanasia\" has had different meanings depending on usage. The first apparent usage of the term \"euthanasia\" belongs to the historian Suetonius who described how the Emperor Augustus, \"dying quickly and without suffering in the arms of his wife, Livia, experienced the 'euthanasia' he had wished for. \"The word \"euthanasia\" was first used in a medical context by Francis Bacon in the 17th century, to refer to an easy, painless, happy death, during which it was a \"physician's responsibility to alleviate the 'physical sufferings' of the body.\" Bacon referred to an \"outward euthanasia\"\"the term \"outward\" he used to distinguish from a spiritual concept\"the euthanasia \"which regards the preparation of the soul.\" Euthanasia conducted with the consent of the patient is termed voluntary euthanasia. Active voluntary euthanasia is legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Passive voluntary euthanasia is legal throughout the U.S. per Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health. When the patient brings about his or her own death with the assistance of a physician, the term assisted suicide is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington and Montana Premises of Debate: Round 1- Acceptance Round 2- Presentation of Main Argument Round 3 & 4: Rebuttals Round 5: Conclusions \"Let the games begin!\" ;D",

I understand the point you're making, but it is unrelated to the debate at hand. You seem to be confusing physician-assisted suicide with euthanasia. Physician-assisted suicide is when a physician helps someone commit suicide (see my definition). Euthanasia is the killing of an unconscious (usually terminally ill) patient by a physician, i.e. \"pulling the plug\". (http://depts.washington.edu...) \"just because people in hospitals are pulling the plug, does not mean that people who are crazy are going to stop killing themselves. the two things are not relevant to each other.\" Generally, people who commit suicide are not crazy. They usually are suffering from severe depression or are experiencing extenuating circumstances. These people are reasonable enough to seek help from a physician.

            "conclusion": "Assisted suicide/euthanasia should be legal",
            "premise": "In your response, you cite the Hippocratic Oath as a reason why physician-assisted suicide should stay illegal and claim that all medicine in this country is practiced by it. Would this be the same Hippocratic Oath that also says a physician must treat the person who taught him medicine as a parent, as well as teach others this \"art' for free? If doctors are really bound by the Hippocratic Oath, then every doctor who takes any pay from a medical school that charges students to attend there would be violating the oath. Later on in the oath, it says that doctors will \"not use the knife\". So I guess surgeons are violating the oath as well. And the part that everyone does know, the \"first, do no harm\" (and apparently the only part you are aware of), it says \"I will keep them from harm and injustice\". Since the rest of the oath has been subjectively revised so as to keep up with the times, I can and will easily say that keeping patients from harm includes keeping them from needless pain and suffering. In addition, keeping patients from injustice can and should also mean keeping other people's values and morals off of an individual's or a family's personal and private decision. The fact of the matter is that the Hippocratic oath has been amended significantly, and is often not even used. In the 1970's, many schools abandoned the oath because of its archaic principles. My guess is that many medical schools dropped it because of its call to teach medicine for free and only to men. Other schools use some other versions of the Hippocratic Oath, or other oaths developed by other doctors or medical associations. In short, claiming that the Hippocratic Oath is universally accepted, universally used and universally adhered to is simply false. I never claimed that morality has no place in medicine, just not a morality that is being imposed by people outside of the doctor/patient/family relationship. Go back and read what I wrote in round 1. I said \"I believe it to be the height of arrogance that someone can feel as though they can enforce THEIR morality on someone suffering from a terminal disease\". Unless you are the person dying, or a family member of yours is the one dying, you should have no say in what decision they make. A physician should use his own moral code to direct his actions regarding euthanasia, but many doctors feel that such a practice should be allowed, especially when they are forced to watch a person waste away from a terminal disease. If a doctor has a problem with it, he or she can refuse to perform the procedure, the same as any doctor with performing an abortion. The issues surrounding guidelines and legal standards are the strongest parts of your argument. Even so, it doesn't seem to bother people in Oregon. They don't seem to have any trouble figuring it out. While I could use Oregon as an example and leave it at that, I will instead try to give common sense answers to your questions. If we went by the \"Kevorkian method\", as you call it, that doesn't seem to be such a bad thing. By Kevorkian's account from last night, he only assisted 1 in 5 that came to him for help because the others did not fit a medical need. That's a lot of discretion for someone you seem to feel is blood thirsty. If there would be any guidelines used, perhaps the guidelines that doctors follow when they determine that someone does not stand to gain from any further medical intervention and recommend hospice care. That seems common sense enough to me. In addition, most people have seen so many doctors by the time they reach this point that the requirement to get a second opinion would have been reached long ago. There should be no need for a psychologist if a person has been determined to be terminal and he wishes to end his life on his own terms. To require a psychological workup would be an unnecessary governmental intrusion, much like what we have to deal with now. The concerns of the family are taken into account by the patient himself. But this is one of the points of allowing euthanasia: to help keep patients from getting to the point where they can't make their own decisions. If they are incapacitated, then living wills and advanced directives override family desires anyway. For example, if a patient has ordered that they are DNR, or Do Not Resuscitate, the directive overrides the family in the event of a medical emergency. If there are no directives or living wills, then the family should be able to make the decision after consulting with the doctors in charge of their loved one's care, just as they do now. In fact, making euthanasia legal would make episodes like Terry Schaivo much better for everyone involved because they would have access to physicians who would be able to end her life much more humanely than simply pulling her feeding tube. She didn't have to die like that. It was conservatives and their use of the government to impose the laws that we have that starved her to death. If someone is determined to be terminal by at least two doctors, then if euthanasia were legal, their terminal status should invalidate the no-suicide clause. In my view, and in a view that I feel would hold up legally, physician-assisted suicide should be no different than when someone desires to be listed as DNR. The doctors and nurses could prolong a patient's life by intervening in a medical crisis, but their choice to be DNR hastened their death from the crisis, much the same as assisted-suicide. As I know from personal experience, insurance companies and pensions still pay out when a family member dies while being listed as DNR. These are doctors we're talking about, not lawyers. I'm not sure how many \"shysters\" are out there running around, but I'm sure there aren't that many. The procedure would not take a lot of time for the doctor, nor would it take much in the way of equipment or drugs. So in relation to other procedures that the doctor could be spending his time on, assisting someone to commit suicide would probably not be very lucrative for the doctor. If there are a lot of shysters running around trying to milk money out of desperate people, then I think we have a much larger problem in our medical system that needs to be addressed ASAP. I actually didn't get to see him speak last night. I couldn't get a ticket to go and was left to read about it this morning in the paper. But I have supported this position for a long time now. I supported it before Terry Schaivo and before my dad very nearly avoided a situation much like hers. If my family had faced the same kind of intrusive intervention that Michael Schaivo faced, I would be a lot more militant about it than I am now. Fortunately for me, though, I don't have to go through the same thing he did to empathize.",

Physician assisted suicide: The killing of a person by a physician, assuming consent of both physician and person, and proof that the person is mentally sound. Contention 1: Freedom of Choice People have a freedom of choice. Yes, this freedom has limits when others are in harm's way. But suicide is internal and personal. It affects others far less than it affects oneself. So in the end, it is a personal choice. Contention 2: An End To Suffering When someone is suffering, she may want it to just be over. She has no reason to continue living, so why should she? Requiring someone to continue living when she does not want to is terribly unjust: it is an intentional affliction of suffering unto someone. This is needless, and is why physician-assisted suicide should be legalized. Contention 3: Reduction of Traditional Suicide Those who are suicidal will not stop themselves from committing suicide simply because it is illegal. Personally-executed suicides are dangerous and have the potential to be very harmful due to the carelessness of the suicidal. But if physician-assisted suicide is legalized, then it will greatly reduce the risk of suicides gone awry. Subsequently, the government and health institutions will be able to document the suicides. Keeping accurate records of who has committed suicide greatly increases convenience for the hospitals and insurance companies.",

            "conclusion": "Should Physician assisted suicide be legal",
            "premise": "A1: Physician-assisted suicide (I'll just call it assisted suicided henceforth) is a well thought-out policy that has many advantagesMy opponent argues that the law passed in Oregon has several safeguards to ensure that patients who make the decision are in a clinically competent frame of mind, and are aware of the consequences. Furthermore, a lot of time is taken for hospital authorities to appropriately evaluate requests for assisted suicide. He also wisely cites public health reports that show that a majority of patients in Oregon who opted for the programme are educated, and therefore competent enough to make an informed decision. He concludes that the policy allows a patient to die with dignity.Response: Not being an American citizen or an expert of any kind on medical law, I will have to cite an expert on the effectiveness of the law in Oregon. The following was published in 2008 in the medical journal Geriatric Medicine, under the website of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre:\"Oregon, whose law permitting assisted suicide (though not euthanasia) came into force in 1997 is often presented as a model for other legislatures to follow. In fact, Oregon polices assisted suicide even less than does the Netherlands: self-reporting by doctors is followed by no investigation, but merely a passive reporting by the relevant authority.[v] And although nothing like the official Dutch surveys has been carried out in Oregon, there is anectodal evidence of patients being pressured to die or undertreated on the grounds that they have a suicide prescription and need nothing more. [vi] It is worth pointing out that reported pain in Oregon has worsened since assisted suicide was legalized, [vii] and that the State, which funds assisted suicide, is less ready to fund essential medical services for those who want and need them.\"This article tells us that far from the rosy picture that my adversary paints, enforcement of the law, for example, is a daunting task that the Oregon authorities are not a success story on. The safeguards that my adversary mentions look good on paper, but are very difficult to enforce, leading to the problems mentioned by the above. It is indeed disturbing to hear that it even encourages the state to push people who need medical services to consider assisted suicide.The sources of the reference marks above are:[v] Keown J. Considering Physician-Assisted Suicide: An evaluation of Lord Joffe's Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill. 2006; Care Not Killing Alliance, London: 11. [vi] Keown J. Considering Physician-Assisted Suicide: An evaluation of Lord Joffe\u2019s Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill. 2006; Care Not Killing Alliance, London: 13-14. [vii] Fromme EK, Tilden VP, Drach LL, Tolle SW. Increased Family Reports of Pain or Distress in Dying Oregonians. J of Palliative Med 2004;7:431-442.Aside from the above, there are some fundamental points that I disagree with my adversary on, and I shall provide reasons for these disagreements. I look forward to his responses on them. CA 1: PAS is not taking \"ones own life\".My adversary confuses Physician-assisted suicide with the conventional understanding of suicide. Oxford Dictionary defines \"suicide\" as \"the action of killing oneself intentionally\". Assisted suicide, however, cannot be looked at as an act in isolation, or a private act. Assisted suicide involves a medical practitioner facilitating the death of another person, and a wide variety of stakeholders, including these medical practitioners, patients, the patients' families and society, are affected by the ramifications of assisted suicide. I will go into just a couple of these stakeholders.1. Doctors and medical ethicsIn the words of the International Code of Medical Ethics, \"A doctor must always bear in mind the obligation of preserving human life from conception\". This code inspires doctors to place the foundations of their practice on the value of human life, engenders empathy for the patient, and thereby strengthens the doctor-patient relationship. Reminding doctors of the value of human life inspires them to do their best to preserve it at all costs. Legalising assisted suicide creates a dangerous precedent, that adds to the conflict in the mind of doctors.If hastening the death of a terminally ill patient was to become a routine administrative task for a doctor, and indeed it can, then there is the potential for a lack of compassion when dealing with elderly, disabled or terminally ill people.If the doctor is the person (or one of the people) who evaluate(s) the patient's well-being, then there is a definite possibility that a patient may begin to distrust his/her doctor. As mentioned on the website of the National Health Service in the UK, where this debate is ongoing, \"They may think that their doctor would rather 'kill them off' than take responsibility for a complex and demanding case.\" 2. Ramifications on society, and ethical implicationsAll humans are said to have inalienable rights, and the right to life is one of them. \"Inalienable\" means that they may not be given up, nor may they have these rights taken from them, except under process of the law (meaning if they're criminals). My adversary has not given any reasons for believing that patients have any right to take their own lives, nor has he given reasons to believe that the healthcare system has the right to take the lives of others. If he does, however, believe that deciding whether to live or die is a right, then he must accept that this right cannot only be arbitrarily ascribed to the sick, or terminally ill. If it is truly a human right, then it must be made available to all people who wish for it. I am interested in my opponent's response to this. I will not offer any further arguments at this point, because I have refuted my opponent's argument and given him plenty to refute.ConclusionIt is true that assisted suicide offers dignity to people in pain. However, \"dignity\" can be a dangerous and misleading veneer for \"convenience\", either on part of the patient, the patient's family, the doctor, or as we have seen, even the Government. Assisted suicide should not be legal because of the several unpleasant effects on society, which cannot be ignored and which certainly outweigh the proposed benefits of the law.Sources1. http://www.linacre.org...2. http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...3. http://www.nhs.uk...4. http://www.care.org.uk...",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should legalize Physician Assisted Suicide.",
            "premise": "Thanks for the timely response. Now as for the definition. If we observe the medical definition of Physician Assisted Suicide we will find the following definition, \"Somewhat of a hybrid between passive and active euthanasia is physician-assisted suicide (PAS), also known as voluntary passive euthanasia.\" (http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com...) This means that it is voluntary Euthanasia, but just by a different name. In this debate I will be arguing that the legislation of this type of Euthanasia will lead to the legislation of other types of Euthanasia outside of Voluntary Euthanasia. Now I will warn that I will give my arguments, but may not get to all of my opponent's argument here and some of them may have to wait until the next round. Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. I shall begin by giving you the horrible statistics of Euthanasia. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...) Approximately 900 euthanasia's a year are done without the consent of the one being euthanized and 50% of euthanasizations are done unreported. In 2005, it was reported that 1.7% of the nation's deaths were caused by Euthanasia, a total of 2,410 people. 1 out of every 5 people who receive euthanasia are done without consent. ( Smets T, Bilsen J, Cohen J, Rurup ML, De Keyser E, Deliens L. The medical practice of euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands: legal notification, control and evaluation procedures. Health Policy.2009;90:181\u20137. doi: 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.10.003.) A study in Belgium reported that 32% were without consent. . Contention 2: The Slippery Slope Argument Keown gives in his slippery slope argument of 2002, that once one form of euthanasia is accepted that other forms, like involuntary euthanasia, to become legal. For my number one example I present the Dutch. In 1987, the Royal Dutch Medical Association had written into law, \u201cIf there is no request from the patient, then proceeding with the termination of his life is [juristically] a matter of murder or killing, and not of euthanasia.\u201d However, in 2001 they supported a new law that completely supported a law that would legalize non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. (Medical end-of-life practices under the euthanasia law in Belgium. Bilsen J, Cohen J, Chambaere K, Pousset G, Onwuteaka-Philipsen BD, Mortier F, Deliens L N Engl J Med. 2009 Sep 10; 361(11):1119-21.) There 2001 law also permitted children from age 12-16 to be euthanized with parental concent! Though the nation does not consider the child at liberty to make the call. (The medical practice of euthanasia in Belgium and The Netherlands: legal notification, control and evaluation procedures. Smets T, Bilsen J, Cohen J, Rurup ML, De Keyser E, Deliens L Health Policy. 2009 May; 90(2-3):181-7) The euthanasia\u2019s in Belgium have doubled since 1998. The involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia rates have slightly increased from 1.5% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2007. In Flanders the euthanasia numbers have increased from 0.3% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2007. In the graph bellow we can see that the number of euthanasia\u2019s have doubled since 2007 as well. The definition of Euthanasia has actually changed over the years from it being killing in 1950 to a quick and easy death in 1981. In the bellow quote we can see that our perspective has changed to the point that we almost do not even associate death with euthanasia in the definition. \"\"Have we really forgotten that euthanasia is killing?\" From a pre-1950 dictionary: \"Mode or act of inducing death painlessly or as a relief from pain.\" From Webster's Third International Unabridged Dictionary (1968): \"1. An easy death or means of inducing one. 2. The act or practice of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from incurable conditions or diseases.\" From Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (1981): \"1. Dying easily, quietly and painlessly. 2. The act of willfully ending life in individuals with an incurable disease\" (http://www.all.org...) You are also given the healing doctor a killing roll. This can have a huge effect on doctors as it was proved that it has an effect on doctors who are supposed to heal their patients and are now asked to kill. This also gives off a fear of the doctor as in Holland, the elderly are scared of the doctor, because they are scared that the doctor will euthanize them. (http://www.all.org...) Contention 3: Self Ownership and Sickness Consent from a palliative specialist is also very important, but recent euthanasia\u2019s have not been doing so and consenting them. In Belgium, before 2002, all euthanasia cases without concent of a palliative specialist were denied, but from 2002-2007, that number declined from 100% to only 9% as only 19% of all euthanasia cases was a palliative contacted for their opinion. (Same source as the first one used in this round) Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually died on TV. (http://www.rense.com...) They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. (http://www.nysrighttolife.org...) For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. (http://www.vatican.va...) Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, \" \u201cit is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.\u201d (http://www.bmj.com...) This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society.",

            "premise": "Point: Those in the late stages of a terminal illness have a horrific future ahead of them. The gradual decline of their body, the failure of their organs and the need for artificial support. In some cases, the illness will slowly destroy their minds, the essence of themselves; even if this is not the case, the huge amounts of medication required to \"control\" their pain will often leave them in a delirious and incapable state. At least five percent of terminal pain cannot be controlled, even with the best care. Faced with this, it is surely more humane that those people be allowed to choose the manner of their own end, and have the assistance of a doctor to die with dignity. One particular account was of Sue Rodriguez who died slowly of Lou Gehrig's disease. She lived for several years with the knowledge that her muscles would, one by one, waste away until the day came when, fully conscious, she would choke to death. She begged the courts to reassure her that a doctor would be allowed to assist her in choosing the moment of death. They refused. Rodriguez did not accept the verdict and with the help of an anonymous physician committed suicide in February 1994.[1] [1]Chris Docker, Cases in history, euthanasia.cc, 2000 http://www.euthanasia.cc...

            "premise": "I thank my opponent and as per rules, I shall be goin on my Opening Case this round. Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. I shall begin by giving you the horrible statistics of Euthanasia. [1]) Approximately 900 euthanasia's a year are done without the consent of the one being euthanized and 50% of euthanasizations are done unreported. In 2005, it was reported that 1.7% of the nation's deaths were caused by Euthanasia, a total of 2,410 people. 1 out of every 5 people who receive euthanasia are done without consent. [2] A study in Belgium reported that 32% were without consent. . Contention 2: The Slippery Slope Argument Keown gives in his slippery slope argument of 2002, that once one form of euthanasia is accepted that other forms, like involuntary euthanasia, to become legal. For my number one example I present the Dutch. In 1987, the Royal Dutch Medical Association had written into law, \u201cIf there is no request from the patient, then proceeding with the termination of his life is [juristically] a matter of murder or killing, and not of euthanasia.\u201d However, in 2001 they supported a new law that completely supported a law that would legalize non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. [3] .) There 2001 law also permitted children from age 12-16 to be euthanized with parental concent! Though the nation does not consider the child at liberty to make the call. [4] The euthanasia\u2019s in Belgium have doubled since 1998. The involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia rates have slightly increased from 1.5% in 2001 to 1.8% in 2007. In Flanders the euthanasia numbers have increased from 0.3% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2007. In the graph bellow we can see that the number of euthanasia\u2019s have doubled since 2007 as well. The definition of Euthanasia has actually changed over the years from it being killing in 1950 to a quick and easy death in 1981. In the bellow quote we can see that our perspective has changed to the point that we almost do not even associate death with euthanasia in the definition. \"\"Have we really forgotten that euthanasia is killing?\" From a pre-1950 dictionary: \"Mode or act of inducing death painlessly or as a relief from pain.\" From Webster's Third International Unabridged Dictionary (1968): \"1. An easy death or means of inducing one. 2. The act or practice of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from incurable conditions or diseases.\" From Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (1981): \"1. Dying easily, quietly and painlessly. 2. The act of willfully ending life in individuals with an incurable disease\" [5] You are also given the healing doctor a killing roll. This can have a huge effect on doctors as it was proved that it has an effect on doctors who are supposed to heal their patients and are now asked to kill. This also gives off a fear of the doctor as in Holland, the elderly are scared of the doctor, because they are scared that the doctor will euthanize them. [6] We can also see that doctors themselves oppose euthanasia. Physician-Assisted Suicide [euthanasia]: 42% Had both a \"religious and nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 31% Had \"no objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 21% Had a \"nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 5% Had a \"religious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide Physician Characteristics: 79% of Asian doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 71% of Hispanic doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 67% of White doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 65% of Black doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Catholic doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Muslim doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 75% of Protestant doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 74% of Hindu doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 54% of Jewish doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 39% of doctors with no religious affiliation object to physician-assisted suicide Physicians from the US Midwest are more likely to object to physician-assisted suicide than those from the US South [7] and [8] Contention 3: Self Ownership and Sickness Consent from a palliative specialist is also very important, but recent euthanasia\u2019s have not been doing so and consenting them. In Belgium, before 2002, all euthanasia cases without concent of a palliative specialist were denied, but from 2002-2007, that number declined from 100% to only 9% as only 19% of all euthanasia cases was a palliative contacted for their opinion. (Same source as the first one used in this round) Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually died on TV. They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. [9] For this next part I will argue that of self-determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide whether or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgmental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. [10] Another anti-Euthanasia advocate is Jeremy Bethem who is quoted saying, \" \u201cit is thegreatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right andwrong.\u201d [11] This means that we must observe the weight of the individual's value to the comunity verse the needs of that individual. Though the individual may be in pain they are still in the wrong state of mind as I brought up earlier meaning that the person cannot properly think for themselves and have lost the ability to choose between right and wrong as they are attempting to end their lives with no reguards to others. They belong to the collective comunity and because of that the value of them is together a great impact. For this we are reminded of the allusion of For Whom the Bell tolls meaning that we as a society are joined together as one and it's because of that one person missing from society the entire society will feel the loss in everything from emotionally to the person's productivity that the contribute to better the community would vanish and that one person's death and their suicide would harm the entire community. So it maters not the level of pain the person is expierencing as if they kill themselves they would be robbing the community and it in turn harms society. As per rules, and character limitations, my soures will be in the following debate link. (http://www.debate.org...)",

            "premise": "We aren't legalising homicide, we are letting people choose to die when they are unable to. Oprah (and most likely the other two, I don't know who they are) would have been able to commit suicide whether or not euthanasia was legal, she could have easily thrown herself in front of a train, jumped off a bridge or taken an overdose. Euthanasia needs to be there for people who are unable to commit suicide. So, even if euthanasia was legal, we would still have Oprah and other icons. In 2005, Tony Nicklinson from Wiltshire suffered a stroke at the age of 51. Consequently, he suffered from locked-in syndrome and was unable to talk, walk, move his arms and he had absolutely no independence. He lived a life of absolute misery. His wife would have done anything to help him painlessly put an end to his misery but because of laws banning assisted suicide in the United Kingdom, she could do nothing. Mr Nicklinson's only choice was to starve himself. After refusing food for one week, Tony passed away; but this week of intense pain he endured could have been stopped if euthanasia was legal. Tony would have committed suicide either way, the British government forced him to do it in a most painful and horrible way. People who want to commit suicide will usually find a way to do it; by legalising euthanasia we can make it a better path for them all. I understand what you're saying about potential trauma for the person who assisted with the suicide but we can take measures to ensure they are not pushed into it and are perfectly comfortable with doing it. But imagine how traumatic it must have been for Tony's wife, having to watch her husband endure the worst pain every day of his life and watch him waste away as he took a difficult but the only path to an end to misery.",

In order to legalize physician assisted suicide you would literally have to re-write the basic code by which all physicians are bound. You argue that morality has no place in medicine, while the exact opposite is true. There is no medicine without morality, else all doctors would be little more than snake oil salesmen. Morality is required as a basic code of being a physician moreso than any other profession save for a preacher. Let's visit your theory for just a moment and assume it should be legal. On what basis or code should the doctor be bound by while making the determination of which patients to \"help\" in this manner? Should it be the Kevorkian method, that is whatever the physician himself believes? Should there be a set of guidelines on when it's acceptable and when it's not? Should it be required to get a second opinion from a consulting physician? How about from a psychologist? Do the ramifications of a suicide on family, particularly dependents, get taken into account? What about the clause in most life insurance policies that explicitly state they don't pay upon suicide? It's clear that some shysters masquerading as caring physicians would quickly take advantage of such a situation for the sake of profit rather than mercy. That is to say, if the first 5 docs say no, you don't qualify, the 6th one will say sure, but not until after the check clears. He'll likely have on staff equally immoral folk with necessary degrees to back him up. I am quite certain that Mr. Kevorkian eloquently stated his position on the matter and he obviously swayed you to his way of thinking, however when one looks at the situation through more than his very narrow viewpoint, it becomes quite obvious there are many obstacles that Jack doesn't adequately address on his lecture tour.",

            "premise": "1. ImmoralOne of the most famous philosophers of ethics was Immanuel Kant. He came up with a system of figuring out if an action was moral or not called the Categorical imperative. The Categorical imperative is an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings and is independent of any personal motive or desire. In using the this method Kant condemned all forms of suicide by saying the purpose pain is to protect one\u2019s life [1] , such as taking your hand out of a fire because it burns, and by using pain as a reason to end one\u2019s life was contradictory to the purpose of pain and was therefore immoral. We usually strive to be moral beings, so we should avoid from having immoral acts.2. SubjectivityDue to the laws subjectivity there are never clear answers. In the Oregon Death with Dignity act Terminal Illness is defined as \u201cmeans an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months\" [2] Things such as pain, suffering, or terminal illnesses are all subjective and you could get different opinions between different doctors, and why is the limit six months for physician assisted suicide and not four or eight months? There is no sound medical reason for why six months are chosen. Also, how do you measure pain? Does it include mental or physical? In Belgium people have been euthanized for depression, anorexia, and going blind. [7]Since there is subjectivity, it makes the law hard to enforce and have safeguards for.3. Right to DieThe courts have ruled on physician assisted suicide and there was no constitutional right to die. In the case Washington v. Glucksberg the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that Washington\u2019s ban on physician assisted suicide was not a violation of the fourteenth amendment and there was no constitutional right to die. [3] They ruled the same in the similar case of Vacco v. Quill. As far as the courts are concerned there is currently no legal right to euthanasia or physician assisted suicide.4. Slippery SlopeThe legalization of voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide would lead down a slippery slope to other non-voluntary euthanasia. The Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia in 2001 but have they gone down the slippery slope? In 2004 the Netherlands passed something called the Groningen Protocol. This allows the non-voluntary euthanasia of infants. [4] So, as far as the slippery slope is concerned the Netherlands is well on their way down and there nothing stopping other countries from following.We should not legalize PAS because it will lead to other more damaging things.5. Voluntary?Voluntary euthanasia is not as voluntary as you might think. The most famous euthanasia program was the one that took the lives of eleven million people in the 1940s, the infamous holocaust. The victims of the Nazis were Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, Homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and people with disabilities. In particular the Nazis attacked people with disabilities with a propaganda campaign portraying them as burdens to society and their families. \"The principal reason people in a 1991 Boston Globe survey said they would consider some option to end their lives if they had \u201can incurable illness with a great deal of physical pain\u201d was not the pain, not the \u201crestricted lifestyle,\u201d and not the fear of being \u201cdependent of machines,\u201d but rather that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be a burden\u201d to their families. Family members who support the suicide of a terminally ill patient often unwittingly reinforce the notion that the ill family member\u2019s life has lost all meaning and value and is nothing but a \u201cburden.\u201d\" [5] \"Many elderly people already feel a burden to family, carers and a society which is cost conscious and may be short of resources. They may feel great pressure to request euthanasia 'freely and voluntarily'. These patients need to hear that they are valued and loved as they are. They need to know that we are committed first and foremost to their well-being, even if this does involve expenditure of time and money. The way we treat the weakest and most vulnerable people speaks volumes about the kind of society we are\" [6] So, voluntary euthanasia/Physician Assisted Suicide is almost as voluntary as in Nazi Germany. I look forward to my opponent's response.Sources[1] http://www.siue.edu...[2] http://euthanasia.procon.org...[3] http://www.oyez.org...[4] http://www.nejm.org...[5] https://www.nrlc.org...[6] http://www.ethicsforschools.org...[7] http://alexschadenberg.blogspot.com...",

There's no crime called \"assisted suicide.\" I do not argue a legal penalty for patients who seek help in dying. The crime at issue is assisting suicide, and it's targeted solely at those who help another commit suicide. The legal right sought by proponents is the right to assist someone in killing themselves without suffering adverse legal consequences. That said, I'll still use \"assisted suicide\" as a short-hand description for the crime/right, as a way of deferring to common usage.The term \"assisted suicide\" is also a misnomer in the sense that it's often confused with \"euthanasia.\" In euthanasia, the doctor kills the patient. In assisted suicide, the doctor assists but the patient is the final causal actor in his or her own death. I don't think the difference will matter much for this debate -- in both, the doctor intentionally helps the patient end his or her life -- but extra clarification always helps.== Rules ==1.

It is absurd that anyone or any group should have the authority to tell someone else what they can and cannot do with their own life with regard to this issue. I believe it to be the height of arrogance that someone can feel as though they can enforce their morality on someone suffering from a terminal disease. The overly moralistic person is not feeling the pain. They will not be affected in any way whether the dying person takes their own life or if they needlessly prolong their suffering. Yet, they insist on using the government to enforce their morality on people they don't even know. A dying person, suffering from cancer or some other horrific illness that promises nothing but a slow, painful death, should be able to die on their own terms, with dignity. I eagerly await someone to accept my open challenge.",

Euthanasia is indeed a very complicated process, and questions on the basis of our own mortality will always be extremely difficult morally and spiritually. There are many questions, as my opponent has shown, that can prove to be difficult in answering whether or not euthanasia should be a legal practice. I will attempt to answer these questions now, providing a suitable basis for moral and ethical euthanasia. >Is it an option when a man is suicidal? You may think that people who want euthanasia are suicidal because they want to die, or you may not think that. If it is indeed suicide, it would depend on the circumstances. >Is it the choice of the man to be mercy-killed? Euthanasia is a very complex choice for those who wish to do it. If somebody is suffering and will not survive their illness, then it is justified for the person to terminate their own life to avoid the prolonging of their own suffering and the suffering of others. >Is it the choice of his friends and family? No. If a terminally ill person wants to live on, that is their decision. >Can any man say it was a mercy-kill? This depends on what you mean, again. Since it is up to the patient, the death is caused by a terminal sickness but suffering is reduced by the patient's own actions. >Can we trust the doctor? Doctors are generally trustful, but I understand your scepticism when it comes to deciding death. I would make necessary for euthanasia to have consultations with TWO SEPARATE physicians to determine whether an illness is terminal and if euthanasia could be justified from the suffering, and a psychiatrist to determine if the patient has a sound mind to decide their own death. You suggest that euthanasia cannot be regulated, but this is what supporters of euthanasia are trying to do. Currently it is not illegal for a terminally ill person to kill themselves, it is only illegal for those to assist him. Making euthanasia LEGAL AND REGULATED would place necessary barriers to make euthanasia open and safer for those who are terminally ill and suffering.",

I also 100% agree that the undesirable symptoms would be horrific and aren't sacred. But there are many dangers in legalizing euthanasia. First and foremost, executing euthanasia would give a certain paycheck to the physician who aids in this activity, which could cause mental trauma over time, I mean, you're killing someone. While yes it may be a wanted and legal murder, you are still watching the life flow out of another person's eyes. Not only this, but the heartless people in the world may even run a scam just for the paycheck. This would simply be done by the physician who clears his patient for mentally ill, says that he will deteriorate over time, and then kill his patient. The DNR style confirmation from the patient could simply be forged by the doctor or accidentally signed by the patient if the physician provides a medicine that puts the patient into a drowsy state or half-conscious state. Furthermore, if the patient could've been cured, the physicians career could be ruined, the victims family could even go to court and sue for murder. This legalization would clog the government because they need to create clauses, hear court cases, endure protests.",

            "premise": "I would like to begin by saying thank you for this debate. I look forward to it and I strongly urge you to listen to my argument. However, I also urge you to reconsider your proposition. I thoroughly believe that doctor assisted suicide (I will refer to it as euthanasia as it is a more appropriate term) should be a viable option for terminally ill patients and patients who would be in crippling pain for the foreseeable future; in fact, it is an option already. However, doctors should not be responsible for assisting in this suicide. It poses many problems both morally and legally. My first contention involves the morals of the situation. You were correct on saying doctors have nice things such as money, prestige, and social status. However, you were not correct in claiming they were \u201cprivileges.\u201d If we take a look into the lives of doctor\u2019s, we will notice how difficult it is. The average physician spends 8 years in very detailed study and 11-16 years total of medical training (1). At that point, the large salaries, prestige, and social recognition is earned. It is not a privilege. Physicians spend a great deal of time, money, and energy to develop the skills they need to save lives. Their rewards are certainly not privileges. Furthermore, your argument states that \"if doctors have this power, they should have to deal with the consequential responsibility of such power--that is, their decisions should not hinge on their little moral codes; whatever they think is right or wrong should be a non-issue.\" Besides the fact that doctors have earned this power, these are not \u201clittle moral codes\u201d either. In every culture to ever exist, human life has been the #1 priority. Many people are not alright with ending the lives of others, regardless of how or why they are doing it. A recent study found that 69% of physicians object to euthanasia, 18% to permanent sedation, and 5% to PAS (2). This is mainly due to religious and philosophical influences. This is made obvious by the same study. 84% of highly religious physicians are opposed to euthanasia (3). The majority of doctors, and people, are against killing people altogether. These are not \"little moral codes.\" Euthanasia is defined as the act or practice of killing someone who is very sick or injured in order to prevent any more suffering\" by Merriam Webster (4). Killing someone is something that an overwhelming majority of people feel is wrong. We cannot ask doctors to kill people. It is their job to heal, cure, and prevent disease and injury of their patients, not to end their patients lives. Aside from morals, the legality of euthanasia could prove problematic. There is an oath that every doctor takes called the Hippocratic oath. This oaths specifically reads \"I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect (5).\" This means that a doctor may never give a patient a substance that will harm them, nor shall they suggest it. Oaths are legally binding, so doctors are obligated to not provide euthanasia. However, I see that you believe the Hippocratic Oath is \"irrelevant and should be changed.\" I will take the time to remind you exactly what the oath does. It protects the patient, not the doctor. It prevents doctors from committing malpractice and experimentation on patients, it prevents them from having sexual relationships with patients and their families, and more. The Hippocratic Oath has saved so many lives and brought a form of perfection to medicine. It is entirely relevant and always will be. To think it needs changed ignores what doctors had done before the oath. They did experiments on people, harming them and disfiguring them, they accepted bribes to hurt people, and worse. The oath has been one of the most important events in medical history and it has allowed medicine to flourish. We cannot unsubscribe from it. Also, we must consider how this oath keeps people at the doctors. Hippocratic's Oath eeps trust in the medical system. Because of its importance and sheer practicality for protecting patients it keeps people comfortable seeing a physician. Without the Hippocratic Oath, there is little gauruntee that doctors wont commit malpractice. It should not be a responsibilty for doctors to provide this service. I urge you to reconsider your view point. Euthanasia should be an option for the terminally ill and those who are in permanent pain, but it should NOT be a responsibility for doctors to assist in the death of their patients. It runs contrary to the sheer principle of medicine and being a doctor. Therefore, the only viable option is to decide that it is not the responsibilty of doctors to assist in suicide or preform euthanasia. Thank you. Please vote in the negation of this proposal.

            "discussionTitle": "Assisted suicide should be illegal.",
            "conclusion": "Assisted suicide should be illegal.",
            "premise": "== What's this debate about? ==The resolution is \"assisted suicide should be illegal,\" not \"assisted suicide vs deadly drugs.\" My burden isn't to show that deadly drugs should be legal. I only need to show that assisted suicide should be illegal. There's nothing about the resolution, definitional note, rules, or nature of this debate that prohibits me from arguing both the status quo and deadly drugs. This isn't a high school policy debate. Nowhere on DDO does it say Pro and Con must advocate a single case.R1. To be clear, R1 is the opening round, and it defines the parameters of the debate, not R2. The words \"deadly drugs\" or \"single case\" don't appear in R1.R2. It's obvious I was arguing for the status quo. The words \"status quo\" weren't necessary; it was implied. You can't legalize assisted suicide without changing the law. All my contentions except deadly drugs don't say anything about changing the status quo. Notably, I emphasized keeping assisted suicide illegal: \"Assisted suicide undermines equality, liberty, medical care, and the power of suicide. There's also a host of potential unintended consequences. Taken together, all of these points make a compelling case that assisted suicide should remain illegal\" (quoting myself from R2). I wrote this after 9,000 characters that didn't mention deadly drugs at all. I only spent 3 lines discussing deadly drugs; it was an afterthought, not the focus of my advocacy.R3. I addressed Con's misunderstanding the first chance I had: the start of R3. The resolution, R1, and R2 weren't ambiguous: all contentions obviously applied to the status quo because they don't support changing the law at all, and deadly drugs was a 3-line afterthought, not the focus of my advocacy. As I said in R3, don't punish me for Con's mistake.Definitions. Con also seems to misunderstand what assisted suicide is, as defined in R1. The right/crime at issue is intentionally helping a patient end their life. We're not talking about the right to kill oneself. Suicide is currently legal in all states and most countries. [Con's 6] Everyone already has the freedom to take their own life. That's not the issue here. The debate's about whether doctors should have the right to intentionally cause the death of another human being. I want to make sure this is absolutely clear, because Con says multiple times in R3 that he's simply arguing for the right to kill oneself, and that just isn't what the debate's about.Fairness. Con says it's unfair that he has to argue against two cases while I only have to argue against one. But limiting discussion to a single case wasn't a requirement of this debate. Con could have argued as many cases as he wanted. Instead, Con chose not to argue any. That doesn't make the debate unfair. It's not my fault that Con had multiple strategy options but then chose to limit himself by not employing them. Again, don't punish me for Con's mistakes.Education. Con says arguing two cases isn't educational. On the contrary, it's far more educational to consider all relevant issues instead of limiting the discussion. Confining the debate to two niche advocacies isn't educational. Great thinkers, politicians, philosophers, and theorists don't pidgeon hole themselves into discussing a single opinion; we shouldn't either.Reasonableness. Con says arguing against two inconsistent cases is unreasonable. But the cases here aren't inconsistent. The only difference between the status quo and deadly drugs is the available means of suicide. Both are distinguishable from assisted suicide in the same critical ways: (1) doctors can't intentionally cause death; (2) no arbitrary limits on who can commit suicide; (3) no slippery slope to involuntary euthanasia; (4) no corruption of doctors. These are the key distinctions and they're fully consistent. Even if the cases are opposed in some ways, they're still independent proofs of the resolution: both argue against assisted suicide. Nowhere in R1 or on DDO does it say Pro or Con can't advocate multiple independent cases. If Pro and Con were discussing ice cream flavors over dinner, and Pro argued, \"vanilla isn't the best because hazelnut and lemon are better,\" nobody would say Pro's argument isn't fair or reasonable. Pro's burden isn't showing which flavor is best; it's only to show vanilla isn't the best. Likewise, Con can't show vanilla is best by arguing only against hazelnut and then completely ignoring arguments for lemon. Multiple independent cases aren't only fair and reasonable, they best emulate real world situations.Burdens. Con says rebuttals alone can win an equal burdens debate. While that may be true sometimes, it's absolutely not true in this debate. Arguing that deadly drugs shouldn't be legal doesn't show that assisted suicide should be legal. You can't argue for a change in the law without making an offensive case; rebuttals alone aren't enough. Con failed to meet his burden and therefore cannot win the debate.== Arguments ==I'm gonna summarize my arguments while responding to Con's stuff from R3.Unintended Consequences(1) Assisted suicide leads to involuntary euthanasia. Con concedes that assisted suicide and involuntary euthanasia are grounded on the same logic. But, Con argues the Netherlands legalized voluntary euthanasia before it legalized involuntary euthanasia. That's one of the weakest arguments against a slippery slope that I've ever seen. Yes, before a country legalizes involuntary euthanasia, it's presumed that they'd legalize voluntary euthanasia. That's how slippery slopes work. Assisted suicide and euthanasia (both voluntary and involuntary) are grounded on the same *logic.* The empirical evidence demonstrates how this logic plays out, showing a slope from assisted suicide to voluntary euthanasia, and from voluntary euthanasia to involuntary euthanasia. This outcome undermines bodily freedom and the right to life.(2) Con admits risks of abuse. Anyone can already commit suicide without assistance from a doctor, so there's no reason to accept these risks. There's no unique benefit here that outweighs the harms. The impact is people getting away with murder. Con also says his case allows a private deathbed, which increases the risk of abuse. Also, note that Con's own *every suicide is a potential murder* argument applies to his case but not the status quo.(3) See R2 for reasons that assisted suicide would expand the categories for whom assisted suicide is available, as well as reducing interference with suicide attempts. Con drops these points in R2, and offers no reason to believe these outcomes won't happen. Expanding categories means less equality and greater magnitude of harms. Limiting interference means more successful suicides.(4) Minorities: more suffering means more assisted suicide. More minorities choosing assisted suicide because of institutional discrimination shows there's a potential unintended consequence from legalizing assisted suicide.(5) Assisted suicide lowers demand for pain control, which could disincentivize R&D.Equality. Con asks that we enforce a distinction between persons not with respect to social security or education or other government services, but with respect to the most fundamental question of all, namely, whose lives should be treated as inviolable under law and whose may be subject to intentional destruction by others. Con asks that we accept, judge, and decree that certain persons are worth total respect while others don't merit such respect. This creates a second class of citizens. Con's response in R3 is incoherent. You can't justify equal protection if some lives are worth more than others. Saying life has inherent value doesn't mean anything if what matters under the law are differences in instrumental value. Why treat people equally if they're not actually equal? Con never answers this. See R3 for why Con's position leads to infanticide and murder. Con's criteria are also arbitrary (who decides which lives aren't worthy of preservation?). Also see R3 for my argument that consent doesn't justify assisted suicide (i.e. it's like trying to justify a slavery contract).Right to Refuse. A patient who asks to be taken off life support effectively asks for assistance in suicide. The doctor must cause death. This blurs the line between assisted suicide and refusing treatment. The problem is that assisted suicide empowers doctors to refuse assistance. As a result, there's a risk that assisted suicide will undermine the right to refuse treatment. A brightline distinction between refusing treatment and assisted suicide isn't possible unless assisted suicide is illegal.Corruption. Medicine is about preventing or curing disease, not causing death. Con agrees that suicide isn't a medical treatment. And Con can't deny that historically suicide has always been a moral issue, not a medical one. Thus, legalizing assisted suicide corrupts the role of doctors. Remember, patients can already commit suicide without a doctor's assistance, so the only effect that assisting suicide has is approving the suicide. That's something better left to moral institutions, not medical ones. Those left behind can't judge a suicide approved by a doctor; this turns doctors into priests.Suicide. Preapproving suicide shields it from judgment and deprives its social power. Bouazizi's suicide was inspirational precisely because it was shocking; it reflected the value we place on life. Nothing can reflect the value we place on life the way a suicide can. Protests don't have that effect. Suicide is unlike anything else we do; to say its effect on those left behind is non-unique totally mistakes its nature. Bouazizi's suicide didn't have a non-unique impact.Conclusion. Con's rebuttals are weak, lacking in substance, and incoherent. Moreover, Con refused to argue that assisted suicide is preferable to the status quo. Why legalize it if suicide is already an option? Con never answers this. Thus, Con has failed to meet his burden. For all of the above reasons, vote Pro.",

            "premise": "Arguments against euthanasiaDo safeguards really prevent abuse of euthanasia legislations?Is there consensus about \"medical aid in dying\" in Quebec?Freedom of conscienceLegal documents \" QuebecLegal documents \" CanadaScientific studiesEuthanasia and assisted suicide around the worldBelgium (euthanasia)Netherlands (euthanasia)Oregon (assisted suicide)Switzerland (assisted suicide)Washington (assisted suicide) Please note that we include assisted suicide or \"medical aid in dying\" when we use the word \"euthanasia\" in this document. Euthanasia is a homicide. In most countries killing another person is considered murder, even if the intention is to \"ease the pain\", even if the person has a terminal illness. Euthanasia is never necessary - even less since the advent of palliative care. Palliative care provided by a well-trained team help the patient, his family and loved ones. Good palliative care is able to control physical, psychological , social, spiritual and existential suffering. In extreme cases, palliative sedation is used. It is not only already legal, but effective. Only about 20% of Canada's population has access to palliative care. Euthanasia is incompatible with palliative care. The World Health Organization says that palliative care \"intends to neither accelerate nor postpone death .\" 90% of doctors working in palliative care in Canada oppose euthanasia. There has been abuse where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal. It is impossible to establish guidelines strict enough to limit euthanasia to persons for whom it is provided. In fact, the safeguards provided do not hold up in practice. According to Professor Etienne Montero, Dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Namur in Belgium, it is extremely difficult to follow a strict interpretation of legal requirements once euthanasia is permitted. There are several documented cases of abuse in countries where euthanasia is legal and in countries or U.S. states where assisted suicide is legal. For example, in Belgium deaf twins were euthanized at their request because they became blind. Also in Belgium, a woman was euthanized because she was suffering from anorexia. In the Netherlands, a woman was euthanized because she was going blind and could not see the dirt. In Oregon, United States, a woman received a letter from her insurance company refusing to pay for her chemotherapy, but offering assisted suicide instead. The right to die implies a duty to kill. The so-called \"right to die \" (for the patient) implies the duty to kill (for someone else, in this case the doctor). The medical personnel who commit euthanasia suffer personal consequences. The act of euthanasia is neither easy nor peaceful. It is a difficult thing to do, and medical personnel is adversely affected. In Belgium, doctors are entitled to psychotherapy after euthanizing a patient. It is not uncommon to see Belgian nurses take a day off when they know that euthanasia is planned. Euthanasia devalues R03;R03;some lives. Accepting euthanasia means accepting that some lives (such as elderly or people with disabilities) are worth less than others. Legalizing euthanasia would send a clear message: it is better to be dead than sick or disabled. For a healthy person, it is too easy to perceive life with a disability or an illness as a disaster, full of suffering and frustration. Euthanasia is not in the best interests of the person. It is easy to imagine cases where a patient could request euthanasia, freely or under pressure, while it goes against her best interests. The diagnosis is wrong and the patient is not suffering from a terminal illness. The prognosis is wrong and the patient will not die quickly. The patient does not receive good care and suffering could be alleviated. The doctor does not know all the treatment options that could be offered to the patient. Veterinarians receive five times more training than doctors about pain management! The request for euthanasia is often a cry for help. The patient does not really want to die, he wants to see his symptoms and fears treated and relieved. The patient is depressed and believes that his situation is worse than it really is. The patient maintains unrealistic fears about possible future pain. Euthanasia may weaken patients. Access to euthanasia could cause an internal conflict for the patient, torn between fear of pain and the desire to continue to live rich moments with his family and loved ones. Thus, in the context of a society open to euthanasia, the patient having difficulty living with a demanding illness would bear an additional burden . Additionally, faced with a doctor who both heals and kills, the patient lives with an uncertainty that adds to her vulnerability. Euthanasia encourages vulnerable people to end their lives. Directly or indirectly, euthanasia imposes many pressures on the elderly and people with disabilities . These pressures stem from family or society. Patients who are ill or dependent often feel worthless and a burden to their family and loved ones. The growing number of cases of abuse or neglect of elderly or those with disabilities illustrates that this is a major issue to consider. An overburdened health care system limits the quality of care and may create pressure on patients, making them choose death. Patients estranged from their family may think that euthanasia is the only solution. Euthanasia is likely to increase the suicide rate. Our society aims to reduce the suicide rate. Quebec even has an annual Suicide Prevention Week, an initiative that some would like to see replicated across Canada. It is important to note that in the U.S states that have legalized assisted suicide, the rate of non-assisted suicide has increased. Death penalty and euthanasia. Since the abolition of the death penalty in Canada, it is not permitted to cause another person's death. This action is irreversible. Euthanasia would transform hospitals into unsafe places. Many people would hesitate to seek treatment at the hospital. Euthanasia is therefore in contradiction with the demands for dignity and genuine compassion that are at the heart of medicine. Euthanasia is not necessary to avoid heroic measures. The law provides that every patient has the right to refuse treatment or to request that ongoing treatment be stopped. Euthanasia will lead to the decline of care for terminally ill people. The Geneva University Hospital reduced its palliative care team after it decided to allow assisted suicide. In the Netherlands, there is a confirmed case of a patient euthanized to free up a hospital bed. In Brazil, although euthanasia is illegal, a doctor has recently been accused of seven murders after killing patients in intensive care. An investigation is underway to elucidate 300 other cases of suspicious deaths, probably caused by the same doctor. What would have happened if euthanasia was legal? Euthanasia could become an economical method of \"treating\" the terminally ill. The cost of poisons used for causing death by euthanasia is about $ 50 per injection, while a chemotherapy treatment costs thousands of dollars. There are few studies and data on the impact of euthanasia on society. We know that euthanasia is increasing in countries that have legalized it: an increase of 18 % in the Netherlands in 2011, and another 13% increase in 2012. Moreover, according to The Lancet, 23% of cases of euthanasia are not reported. Assisted suicides are not included in the reports on euthanasia in the Netherlands, but they account for nearly 6 % more deaths. In Oregon, where assisted suicide has been legal since 1997, the number of reported assisted suicides has increased by 306%, but it is impossible to know what the real number, because the system designed to collect the data is flawed.",

            "premise": "I was not debating your use of the word. I was actually confused because the three times it was used, 1 use of it fit, while the others did not. I really did not know what you were trying to say until I substituted another word. I was not being disrespectful in any way. I needed clarification. I apologize since you had taken it as criticism for I had not meant it in that respect. I completely understand you are debating active euthanasia. Pain medication is used as an active euthanasia agent at times as I had explained in my last two rounds. It is also legal in Oregon. \"On October 27, 1997 physician-assisted suicide became a legal medical option for terminally ill Oregonians. The Oregon Death with Dignity Act requires that the Oregon Health Division (OHD) monitor compliance with the law, collect information about the patients and physicians who participate in legal physician-assisted suicide, ...\" One of the methods listed here is physician assisted using pain meds, which covers active euthanasia: https://public.health.oregon.gov... The other references, as indicated in the body of the 1st round, are regarding pain medication that is in the amount to relieve pain, but that amount of the drug in most likelihood, will kill the patient. In essence, it is an act of active euthanasia that could pose all the problems I had indicated in my first two rounds. Doctors are not necessarily held liable because it is very hard to prove in court and the patient and family are in agreement to initially suggest the potential overdose of pain medication so as to relieve the pain. That's where the ethics problems come in for them addressed in that 1st round. I am surprised that you seem puzzled if I am pro or con on this issue with all the evidence I have given regarding the negative aspects of euthanasia. I did not, & do not feel I should have to plead an emotional case here. I have given substantial documented reasons that euthanasia is not the course to follow by respected doctors & publications. It is incumbent upon the 2 of us to prove our case to the audience as to the positive & negative aspects of euthanasia. What I personally think on the issue is reflected with the research material I have presented, which reports no lasting positive outcomes have been noted. Yes, I do acknowledge that with death, the pain is relieved from the patient. That is a given. Although, during their last days \"patients are denied final stage of growth. Those involved in hospice work often see healing of family relationships and rediscovery of mutual love. Words are spoken that help sustain those left behind\". (The Life Resources Charitable Trust 2011). And following an active euthanasia, legal or with enough pain medications to relieve the pain but kill the patient, which is questionably legal, there is the ethics dilemma and \" A person's decision to end their life can have profound, often lifelong effects on the lives of others. And with family there may be guilt, anger and bitterness felt by those left behind.\" (The Life Resources Charitable Trust 2011). I had also given many other reasons that euthanasia is not the right choice in the 1st & 2nd round that I would list, but that would be redundant & therefore a waste of space. \"Kevin Fitzpatrick of Not Dead Yet, an organization for disabled people opposed to legalizing assisted suicide, noted perceptively, death is the end of all the possibilities of life. To be dead is more disabling than any injury or disease. Fitzpatrick remarks that \"[w]e have lost our sense of \"terrible beauty\"\", whereby even in the depths of suffering and horror \"there can still be something there for us to find profound, even beautiful\". Suicide is disturbing because it cuts short the possibility for human interaction, for participation in one another's [sic] lives\". www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/why...wrong...",

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia",
            "premise": "In this first round I will merely construe the basic case against euthanasia, as my empirical and other arguments of interest serve a better purpose in the rebuttals sections when my opponent presents his case. Euthanasia is a very intense topic, as one can imagine. Similar to abortion, questions of life and the worthiness of life exist, however, in this case, it is presumably voluntary (I will respond to this in a later round, as we see that in practice this is often not the case). The issue of euthanasia can be compared to the issue of racial equality when it comes to life. Pro-assisted suicide arguments generally rely upon the premise that some lives aren\u2019t worth living. That if the pain is too severe, if the person feels worthless, or if the fix is too costly for a patient that death is a preferable option to life. In other words, certain lives aren't worth living. However, to argue that some lives are not worth living is in direct opposition to the laws which prohibit and struck down racial prejudice laws. The inviolability of human life is the principle which \u2018equal and inalienable\u2019 rights rests upon. It is the failure to understand the intrinsic value of life which leads to a person supporting pro-euthanasia arguments. To respond to this basic premise--of human life--proponents of assisted suicide often use the autonomy argument, but then comes the question: what should the physician do when the patient is incapable of making a decision. Generally, they say it is logical to defer the decision to family members and friends. But as we can see, this is in direct conflict with the autonomy principle which they base their original moral case upon. They are forced to contradict themselves! The simple fact is, if you support physician assisted suicide, you are forced to concede that lives have differing moral values, which is in direct opposition to the foundations of current legal institutions [1]. Doctors certainly agree with the position I am espousing. The Massachusetts Medical Society has voted to reaffirm its opposition to physician assisted suicide. Doctors argue that killing their patients is not their role as a healthcare provider. Deliberate destruction of human life is not acceptable according to their principles--and it should be for any decent human being. To clarify, I am not saying people for euthanasia are evil, I am saying that they need to reevaluate their position in order to support human dignity. Instead, the doctors assert that doctors\u2019 goal should be to alleviate pain and instead make the final days much more pleasant rather than end the life altogether. Let me explain the position a bit more. A physician who helps a patient, even if it means speeding up the time before the patient dies, is not in a morally problematic situation. Death is a foreseeable likelihood but not intended. However if the purpose is to cause death, the doctor is in a precarious situation. The former doctor attempted to help the person--even if it accidentally led to a premature death (or, in many cases, a bearable life, or even recovery), however this doctor is one who chooses death over life. Adam Macleod, Associate Professor at Faulkner University\u2019s Thomas Goode Jones School of Law, argues \u201cA person who purposely chooses to cause death, who makes death a reason for his actions, is not oriented toward the good. \u2026 By choosing life, one becomes a person oriented toward life. By choosing death, one becomes a person oriented toward death.\u201d[2] The World Medical Association also agrees with this testament, stating \u201cThe World Medical Association reaffirms its strong belief that euthanasia is in conflict with basic ethical principles of medical practice, and The World Medical Association strongly encourages all National Medical Associations and physicians to refrain from participating in euthanasia, even if national law allows it or decriminalizes it under certain conditions.\u201d[3] To conclude my basic point, the basic foundations of our society--the equality of human life--as well as principles which doctors abide by are in direct opposition to physician assisted suicide. To support assisted suicide is to favor death over life, and admit that under some conditions lives of people are worth less than others, which demonizes the weak patients who would ask for such a terrible thing. Euthanasia should remain prohibited and seen as a wrong in society. 1. http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com... 2. http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com... 3. http://www.wma.net...",

But even limiting the decisions to licensed physicians in no way, shape, or form is adequate. There is quite a difference between an E.R. Doc and and oncologist, for example. -The process IS arbitrary as long as there isn't a vetting process that would have to include a team of specialists all agreeing. A patient is only \"terminal\" when a doctor says so. Another Doc with the same exact training might disagree, a Doc with more specific training very often would. -Doctor shopping for purpose of getting a 2nd opinion is completely legal. In this case the patient would simply get as many opinions as necessary until he gets the one he wants. -The majority of cases where patients pull out of their illness aren't miraculous recovery, they are usually mis-diagnosis in the first place. The amount of cancer patients who are incorrectly told they are terminal is greater than you apparently realize, for example. I was a training coordinator in a major hospital for 4 years. Doctors incorrectly diagnosing patients and over or under estimating the severity of their illness is very common. It would probably appall you the number of \"medical\" decisions that are made based on insurance coverage rather than best care of the patient. Expanding this out to doctors making decisions such as assisted suicide is a slippery slope best not navigated.",

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia Should be Legal in Medical Practice",
            "premise": "I would like to thank UchihaMadara for accepting this debate for the \"pro\" side. Hopefully the judges will throw away any unbiased opinions toward this matter that they had previously. First off, I would like to define some terms. Euthanasia - the act or practice of killing someone who is very sick or injured in order to prevent any more suffering. There could perhaps be multiple definitions of euthanasia, such as voluntary euthanasia (EV), in which the physician kills the patient based on family recommendations. In other words, the patients themselves may not be in dire circumstance. The other one is \"physician-assisted suicide\" (PAS). Please note that we will solely be using the literal definition of euthanasia in this argument. While you can argue various aspects on the other ones, please refer to the main definition above to guide the debate. With that being said, I would first like to debunk a few things about euthanasia that are very erroneous. First off, many physicians and common people ignorantly refer to euthanasia as \"easy death\" or \"mercy killing.\" In all honesty, little ease or mercy truly arises from this procedure. In all actuality, proponents of euthanasia champion a form of assisted suicide, as a plethora of benefits exist from the termination of life. Physicians begin to naturally think of the benefits they would be accruing to perform this euthanasia, instead of being concerned with the actual patient. This where the Hippocratic Oath comes in to play. According to the [original] Hippocratic Oath (the medical \"constitution\" as deemed by many), a physician, by law, \"Is to neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor to make a suggestion to its effect.\" Though some of the original's tenets have transformed drastically, this one has remained true to Hippocrates and the physicians of old. As reported by Harvard graduate and University of Chicago Medical School professor, Leon Kass, \"In foreswearing the giving of poison when asked for it, the Hippocratic physician rejects the view that the patient's choice for death can make killing him right.\" In other words, physicians are entitled to uphold the utmost respect and reverence to the human body. A Hippocratic physician, which is what all physicians technically are, is not respecting the body by performing this procedure. By nature, ending a patient's life remains completely contradictory to a physician's practice and does not depend on circumstance. (One could render a similar argument against abortion too, but we are sticking to euthanasia here). Restraining from giving the patients lethal doses of poison does not reflect a doctor's views on autonomy or freedom for the suffering. It, however, does demonstrate the sacred devotion of medical practice and the arcane dignity that revolves around human life. Ancient Egyptian physicians, and doctors all throughout history, were thought to have a sacred role in life. Galen himself, the \"medical rebel,\" realized his practice should be taken extremely seriously. Unfortunately, the advancement of euthanasia has also engendered a \"slippery slope\" effect to the legalization of murder. By definition, the euthanasia will not take place unless a patient orders a physician to perform it. This falls under both the voluntary euthanasia and PAS categories as discussed above. However, voluntary leads to involuntary euthanasia, via the lack of delineation between the two. Since euthanasia benefits the doctor's wage by performing the procedure and taking the patient \" out of their misery,\" indirect becomes normal. If murdering one in this fashion yields such incredible comforts, why should a physician even ask for the consent of the patient/family? Essentially, euthanasia enables all physicians, even the unscrupulous, to determine the value of each patient's life and to have the power to thwart it on a whim, if given permission. According to logic standards, one can reasonably deduce that euthanasia no longer prohibits all forms of murder. Thus, its very base parallels that of unconstitutional and illegal activity, and therefore remains unethical and not sacred. However, let us not just think about the legal/moral side of this. Let us look to other aspects of the medical field that have been hurting because of this. Due to the wider prevalence of euthanasia, palliative (end-of-life) care opportunities have dwindled. The Netherlands, for example, demonstrates the disastrous effects that the legalization of euthanasia has caused in regards to palliative care. Wesley Smith, a prominent lawyer for bioethics, claims that a Dutch physician has asked: \"Why should I worry about palliation when I have euthanasia?\" In this way, the entire ethical background has shifted for medical purposes, as doctors view assisted suicide as a means to save their resources and time. Moreover, proponents for the legalization of \"mercy killing\" employ a philosophy that monetary gain and ease of labor are more important than human life. This, in turn, completely comprises the original purpose of medical practice, and now all physicians lose a sense of credibility. Plus, according to the Discovery Institute, very few young physicians seek specialties in palliative care due to the increased talk of euthanasia legalization. Therefore, hospice facilities have rapidly declined, and everyone has to suffer from this upcoming possibility. I don't think having hospice facilities decline all for the sake of legalizing euthanasia is worth it. Do you judges? 1) Kass, Leon, MD, PhD. Committee on Social Thought and for the College.

            "premise": "I think that for the overall success of this debate and for the comprehension of it by the readers, we should begin confident of what all terminology and related terminology mean, some of which haven't yet been covered. So let me take some time to explain the bigger picture. Let's start with regular euthanasia (EUTH); EUTH is most accurately described as the taking of another's life by a doctor in order to relieve them of their chronic and terminal pains or future mental degradation. Very extreme forms of EUTH existed in the Nazi regime, where the societal unproductive, disabled in mind or body, and those of a specific race or cultural background were 'euthanized' aka murdered. The main idea being that these people are deficient and not worthy of life. The normal form of EUTH is of course much, much less extreme, usually it is simply a doctor injecting a patient with a lethal drug or cutting of their life support. Here is where euthanasia splits into 2 different divisions. A, is active/ involuntary euthanasia where the doctor does not have any specific permission from the one being euthanized, it comes from other sources whether it be family, or Nazi regime in the past. In this case, the doctor would do something like inject the patient with a lethal drug.The second division of EUTH, B, is passive/voluntary EUTH; where the patient specifically asks the doctor to end their life and under no other party's directive. The doctor will then: pull the plug on life support/ stop giving them medicine/ let the disease take its course.Now we come to Physician Assisted Suicide (PAS), This is where the patient explicitly asks the doctor to give them: medicine, injection...etc. which they will then inject/breath through mask/drink...etc., specifically with the patient doing the action which ends their life. I will defend that PAS is: very passive euthanasia. I believe so because in regular passive EUTH the patient doesn't even pull their own cord, it is the doctor. So in PAS all the doctor does is give them the ability to pull their own cord, which I think is better, because it gives them much more control....Keep in mind that right now, if a family member wishes, they can pull the plug on say a dying father on his last limb in the hospital. This is true in ALL U.S. states. What is really the difference between PAS and puling the plug? Americans generally support the right to physician-assisted suicide, though the number varies depending on how the issue is framed. As of 2013 it was as high as 71% when the phrase \"end the patient's life by some painless means\" was used. That dropped to 51% when the phrase \"commit suicide\" was introduced.But what about the physicians themselves?According to a survey published Dec. 17 by Medscape, an online professional network and information source for physicians, 54% of doctors answered the question, \"Should physician-assisted suicide be allowed?\" with a yes. click=\"document.location='/TheJuniorVarsityNovice/photos/album/4636/30510/'\" src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/5/4636/226693-4636-e89c3-a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> For this survey, Medscape asked more than 21,000 physicians a list of ethical questions. More than 17,000 of them were US doctors, while 4,000 European physicians responded.Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com...In contention 1 my opponent gives us a truck load of facts, however even though he calls them \"horrible\" he never says why. He wants viewers to assume: A, that these people were simply murdered which is expressly untrue, and B, that this indicates a s but beyond that he has not provided evidence to support this suggested assumption so please do no consider this until it is properly warranted and explained. Also his source for this was labeled as an error which should be in the \"opinions sections\" of the website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... In contention 2 my opponent states that passing laws allowing any form of EUTH leads to massive and involuntary euthanasia however I would actually classify this claim under the Slippery-Slope fallacy because there have only been facts presented thus far, yet these facts alone do not indicate that passive EUTH has lead to involuntary EUTH; he may have stated that but that doesn't make it true. For instance he stated that strict laws were passed supported by medical associations in 1987 and less so in 2001. These are neat facts but that's is all they are, they don't imply actual cause and effect. Please remember that Extraordinary claims require Extraordinary proof! click=\"document.location='/TheJuniorVarsityNovice/photos/album/4636/30510/'\" src=\"../../../photos/albums/1/5/4636/226693-4636-u9ags-a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> In contention 3 my opponent basically states that the sickly just need to take ownership and get over their pain. I state that most people who are terminally ill aren't irrational they are simply regular people who are in constant and unbearable pain, with thoughts still intact. Please provide evidence stating that all people who are chronically ill are irrational, only then can we accept contention 3.Here are quotes which attack statements and assumptions made during the last round:\"There is no evidence demonstrating that the Netherlands has a greater rate of non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia than other Western countries. Indeed, there is a significant amount of evidence demonstrating the prevalence of both voluntary and involuntary active euthanasia in various jurisdictions in which euthanasia has not been legalized, looking at criminal prosecutions, admissions by doctors and anonymous surveys of medical professionals.\" -Penney Lewis, LLM, Reader in Law at the School of Law and Centre of Medical Ethics at Kings College, stated in a Spring 2007 Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics: article titled \"The Empirical Slippery Slope from Voluntary to Non-Voluntary Euthanasia\"Basically there is evidence that the percent of involuntary EUTH is less is the same in countries without legislation on the matter and as will be shown next, the legislation has actually decreased the amount of involuntary EUTH\"look to the Netherlands, where they\u2019ve had progressive laws on assisted dying for over a decade now. In 2005, a study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that only 0.4 percent of all euthanasia procedures were carried out without the patient\u2019s explicit permission. You might argue that that\u2019s 0.4 percent too many, but get this: A 1991 report\u2014written a decade before euthanasia was legalized\u2014put the number at 0.8 percent. In other words, giving a nationwide go-ahead for doctors to legally end their patient\u2019s lives actually halved the number of unwanted deaths. But hey, that\u2019s just Holland, right? They do things differently there. Doctors in a less-hippie-liberal culture would never kill off patients without their consent, right? Well think again. In Britain, a 2012 study discovered that as many as 57,000 patients each year die without being told that efforts to keep them alive have been stopped. Instead, they\u2019re just shoved onto a \u201cdeath pathway\u201d designed to alleviate suffering without ever being told. So basically, doctors in the UK are already practicing euthanasia\u2014only without any of the legal framework to check abuses that would come from legalizing it.\" -http://listverse.com...\"In 2005, of all deaths in the Netherlands, 1.7% were the result of euthanasia and 0.1% were the result of physician-assisted suicide. These percentages were significantly lower than those in 2001, when 2.6% of all deaths resulted from euthanasia and 0.2% from assisted suicide.\" -Agnes van der Heide, MD, PhD, Senior Researcher in the Department of Public Health at Erasmus University As far as the Hyppocratic Oath, the problem arises when \"Do no harm\" is said, however it does more harm to let live in these cases",

I've already briefly addressed the problems with allowing a man to decide when another man/woman \"should\" be allowed to die but I'd like to examine that issue further. To do so makes the process completely arbitrary. Dr. Jack says no so you go to Dr. John. He says no, you go to Dr. Allen and so on until you get the answer you want. This is already practiced by \"patients\" who are drug addicts, what makes you think it wouldn't become widespread among the suicidal? I believe you said somewhere in that dissertation that Kevorkian turned down 5 for every 1 he accepted or some similar % anyhow. OK, so HE arbitrarily gets to decide who lives and who dies? You don't see the problem with this? As long as the decider has a doctorate it's O.K. with you? I literally know a man with a doctorate who is having trouble paying this months rent, should HE be allowed to decide? (dude wants to die, I need the money. Who loses?) If you think this wouldn't play into the situation at all you are quite naive. It seems that most of what you wrote was a glowing support of Jack Kevorkian and his \"cause\". Yet you fail to address standards and practices other than stating \"if they are diagnosed as terminal\". That's your be-all end-all standard, eh? Let me tell you a personal story. My father was diagnosed with a \"terminal\" illness at age 13. He was in constant pain and the Doctors were certain he had less than a year to live. Obviously, since I'm here to write this, that diagnosis was wrong. He did pass at age 58 after fathering and raising 3 children while living most of his life pain free. I tell this story only to illustrate but one of the problems with your fail safe reasons for allowing physician assisted suicide. You see, my father would have qualified under your vetting process when he was 13 years old.",

            "discussionTitle": "Assisted suicide should be illegal.",
            "conclusion": "Assisted suicide should be illegal.",
            "premise": "Note: the status quo = assisted suicide is illegal and deadly drugs aren't available.Debate Overview(1) This debate isn't about making deadly drugs freely available to the public. The debate is about assisted suicide. I argued two potential alternatives to assisted suicide: (1) the status quo, and (2) making deadly drugs available. However, I only need to show that one of these options is better; I don't need to show that both are better. I win as long as one of these options is preferable to legalizing assisted suicide. Con seems to think my entire case is that deadly drugs should be available to the public. But that's only one contention among others. I can drop \"deadly drugs\" and still win through my other contentions. Con doesn't attack the status quo at all. Don't punish me for Con's misunderstanding; extend the full impact of all dropped contentions.(2) The burden of proof is shared. To win, Con has to make out a case for legalizing assisted suicide, which Con hasn't done at all. Instead, Con spent the entirety of Round 2 trying to refute my arguments. But in a debate, unlike football, the best offense isn't a good defense. When the burden of proof is shared, refutations alone aren't enough; even if Con refutes everything I argue, Con can't do better than a tie. Put simply, Con's lack of offense means he cannot win this debate. And at this point, it'd be abusive for Con to offer a case, because it gives me less rounds to refute his arguments than he has to refute mine.Equality(1) Con says life has no value. Instead, only \"life experience\" has value; the better the life experience, the greater the value of preserving it. Con also says this \"value can be based on objective evaluations.\" Don't let Con muddle the issue: this is the same as saying life only has instrumental value (i.e. life only derives value externally instead of having instrinsic value). This view -- when taken to its logical conclusion -- leads not only to the collapse of equal protection (why treat people equally if they're not actually equal?) but also to infanticide (why protect infants if they've acquired no value?) and murder (if someone's life experience isn't valuable enough, there's no reason we can't kill them).(2) Con's criteria is completely arbitrary. How do we decide when someone's \"life experience\" means their life isn't worth preserving anymore? when they have 12 months to live? 6 months? how much suffering? what about the disabled? infants with Down's syndrome? those with Alzheimers? Is their \"life experience\" valuable enough to merit preservation? (3) Con mistakes the nature of informed consent. If blacks could become slaves through informed consent but whites couldn't, we'd still say the law undermines equal protection, because it protects the freedom of whites but not blacks. So too with assisted suicide. Assisted suicide protects the life of everyone but the terminally ill. Informed consent doesn't change that fact, because only the terminally ill are allowed to consent. If consent justifies murder (and that's what Con's arguing), then why limit assisted suicide to the terminally ill? Con's position is inconsistent. When taken to its logical end, Con's analysis says we should allow any murder where victims consent. The law doesn't and shouldn't allow this.Unintended Consequences (1) Con doesn't dispute the risk of abuse in assisted suicide. Extend this point.(2) Con doesn't dispute that there's a risk in expanding the categories for whom assisted suicide is available. Nor does Con dispute that assisted suicide would reduce interference with suicide attempts. Extend both these points.(3) Con says I haven't shown evidence that minority harms translate to assisted suicide. Evidence isn't necessary, because I'm making an analytic argument, not an empirical one. Con admits that minorities receive worse palliative care than nonminorities. Lack of adequate palliative care means more suffering, and more suffering means higher likelihood of assisted suicide. Remember, blacks are 3.5 times more likely than whites to have their limbs amputated, and there's no reason this wouldn't translate to assisted suicide, given the connection between palliative care, suffering, and assisted suicide. Elderly Dutch patients insist on written contracts against involuntary euthanasia, which suggests potential discrimination against the elderly. Con says there's no impact; I disagree. The law shouldn't create conditions that disenfranchise certain groups of people for arbitrary reasons.Freedom(1) Con drops the right to refuse. If assisted suicide is legal, and a patient requests that a doctor pull the plug, the doctor could respond: \"I refuse to assist your suicide.\" This can happen because assisted suicide empowers doctors, not patients. Under an assisted suicide regime, doctors acquire a right to kill patients and a right to refuse killing patients. Doctors aren't obligated to assist suicide. Assisted suicide thus blurs the line between refusing treatment and requesting an assisted suicide, as both are just two sides of the same coin (both lead to death). The result is less control over our own bodies. Extend this argument.(2) Con misunderstands my *involuntary euthanasia* argument. The point is that assisted suicide creates a slippery slope that leads to involuntary euthanasia. I argue the slope is theoretically likely and an empirical reality. Theoretically, assisted suicide is premised on the notion of relieving suffering (Con admits this point); this logic justifies involuntary euthanasia as a means to end suffering. Empirically, the Netherlands legalized involuntary euthanasia after it legalized assisted suicide, proving the slope isn't just probable but also real.(3) Assisted suicide requires state intrusion into death and the deathbed to check for abuse (and Con admits the risk of abuse). Private suicides don't require any state intrusion into our freedoms; they're private by their nature.Corruption (1) Con doesn't address my argument that assisted suicide transforms the role of doctors. In effect, assisted suicide turns doctors into priests who sanctify suicide (i.e. grant patients moral absolution for committing suicide). Assisting suicide doesn't prevent or cure disease; it intentionally causes death. Doctors shouldn't be recommending suicide; as I said before, that's something better left to moral or religious institutions. The problem is that assisted suicide places some moral responsibility with doctors. The law (and medical profession) should prefer a legal regime where moral responsibility for a suicide is placed fully on the individual rather than the doctor.(2) If assisted suicide is legal, demand for pain medication will decrease. A decreasing demand for pain medication could disincentivize R&D -- the numbers are unclear but this is certainly a possibility to be wary of.SuicideNote: suicide is (and should be) legal.Con says suicide should be a medical treatment no more appropriate to moral judgement than a routine surgery. But that mistakes the nature of suicide. Suicide hasn't ever been a medical treatment and it shouldn't be; for most of history, suicide was a sin. Doctors shouldn't be allowed to recommend or preapprove a suicide because doctors don't know what happens after death. Suicide is beyond their scope of expertise. As for the effect on those left behind, that's a purely moral issue. When we judge suicide, it takes on meaning. Romeo and Juliet proved their love. Bouazizi's anger changed the Middle East; it reflected the value we place on life by shocking nations into action. Yes, social messages can be sent through other means, but that's irrelevant. The impact is the meaning we give suicide and life, our ability to judge (and forgive) suicide after-the-fact, and the message that pre-approving suicide sends about the value of human life.Deadly Drugs(1) There are two differences between assisted suicide and my proposal. First, assisted suicide empowers doctors; my proposal empowers individuals. Second, assisted suicide limits drugs to the terminally ill; my proposal doesn't. In my proposal, you'd still need to give informed consent, which would entail completing a psychological exam showing mental competence. Companies already make the drugs (it's the same stuff used in assisted suicide), so practicalities aren't gonna be an issue. Smart regulations solve all problems that Con raises.The net benefits to my proposal are: (1) more equality; (2) more freedom; (3) more deathbed privacy; (4) no slope to involuntary euthanasia; (5) no risk of abuse; (6) no harm to minorities; (7) no corruption of doctors; (8) no loss of meaning to suicide; and (9) less suicides. There's less suicides because doctors can't recommend suicides under my proposal. When doctors can recommend suicide, the suicide rate increases.(2) What are the harms? There are none. The drugs won't increase suicide rates, because anyone can already commit suicide with a little determination. The difficulty in suicide isn't the physical means; the difficulty is the will and determination it takes to kill oneself. Drugs don't affect our will and determination. And, studies show that restricting methods of suicide has no effect on the suicide rate. [1] Other studies show that impulsive suicides almost never involve drugs. [2] As for suicide attempts, there's no indication that those who attempt suicide as a cry for help would use these drugs. And if they did, they'd have to undergo a psychological evaluation and give informed consent, which means there'd be opportunity to interfere before the attempt. So, both theoretically and empirically, my proposal won't increase the suicide rate. Finally, note that every suicide is already a potential murder investigation. My proposal doesn't change that. Nor does it affect deathbed privacy; it only affects privacy after-the-fact, which is a much lower impact than deathbed privacy.[1] http://tinyurl.com...[2] http://tinyurl.com...",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for proposing this interesting debate. I wish him good luck and hope for thoughtful responses. I will present my opening arguments here.1. ImmoralOne of the most famous philosophers of ethics was Immanuel Kant. He came up with a system of figuring out if an action was moral or not called the Categorical imperative. The Categorical imperative is an unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings and is independent of any personal motive or desire. In using the this method Kant condemned all forms of suicide by saying the purpose pain is to protect one\u2019s life [1] , such as taking your hand out of a fire because it burns, and by using pain as a reason to end one\u2019s life was contradictory to the purpose of pain and was therefore immoral. We usually strive to be moral beings, so we should avoid from having immoral acts.2. SubjectivityDue to the laws subjectivity there are never clear answers. In the Oregon Death with Dignity act Terminal Illness is defined as \u201cmeans an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months\" [2] Things such as pain, suffering, or terminal illnesses are all subjective and you could get different opinions between different doctors, and why is the limit six months for physician assisted suicide and not four or eight months? There is no sound medical reason for why six months are chosen. Also, how do you measure pain? Does it include mental or physical? In Belgium people have been euthanized for depression, anorexia, and going blind. [7]Since there is subjectivity, it makes the law hard to enforce and have safeguards for.3. Right to DieThe courts have ruled on physician assisted suicide and there was no constitutional right to die. In the case Washington v. Glucksberg the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that Washington\u2019s ban on physician assisted suicide was not a violation of the fourteenth amendment and there was no constitutional right to die. [3] They ruled the same in the similar case of Vacco v. Quill. As far as the courts are concerned there is currently no legal right to euthanasia or physician assisted suicide.4. Slippery SlopeThe legalization of voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide would lead down a slippery slope to other non-voluntary euthanasia. The Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia in 2001 but have they gone down the slippery slope? In 2004 the Netherlands passed something called the Groningen Protocol. This allows the non-voluntary euthanasia of infants. [4] So, as far as the slippery slope is concerned the Netherlands is well on their way down and there nothing stopping other countries from following.We should not legalize PAS because it will lead to other more damaging things.5. Voluntary?Voluntary euthanasia is not as voluntary as you might think. The most famous euthanasia program was the one that took the lives of eleven million people in the 1940s, the infamous holocaust. The victims of the Nazis were Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, Homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and people with disabilities. In particular the Nazis attacked people with disabilities with a propaganda campaign portraying them as burdens to society and their families. \"The principal reason people in a 1991 Boston Globe survey said they would consider some option to end their lives if they had \u201can incurable illness with a great deal of physical pain\u201d was not the pain, not the \u201crestricted lifestyle,\u201d and not the fear of being \u201cdependent of machines,\u201d but rather that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be a burden\u201d to their families. Family members who support the suicide of a terminally ill patient often unwittingly reinforce the notion that the ill family member\u2019s life has lost all meaning and value and is nothing but a \u201cburden.\u201d\" [5] \"Many elderly people already feel a burden to family, carers and a society which is cost conscious and may be short of resources. They may feel great pressure to request euthanasia 'freely and voluntarily'. These patients need to hear that they are valued and loved as they are. They need to know that we are committed first and foremost to their well-being, even if this does involve expenditure of time and money. The way we treat the weakest and most vulnerable people speaks volumes about the kind of society we are\" [6] So, voluntary euthanasia/Physician Assisted Suicide is almost as voluntary as in Nazi Germany. 6. Pain ReliefPeople say euthanasia provides a way to relieve extreme pain. This is like saying cyanide relieves depression. It is true that they don\"t feel pain anymore abut they don\"t feel good because they are dead. Now try it with the other example. It is true that they don\"t feel depressed anymore but they don\"t feel good because they are dead. There is also ways to relieve pain besides death. \"It is widely believed that there are only two options open to patients with terminal illness: either they die slowly in unrelieved suffering or they receive euthanasia. In fact, there is a middle way, that of creative and compassionate caring. Meticulous research in Palliative medicine has in recent years shown that virtually all unpleasant symptoms experienced in the process of terminal illness can be either relieved or substantially alleviated by techniques already available.\" [6] In countries with euthanasia Palliative care is poorly developed.

The patient takes the drugs independently of the doctor. This procedure differs from euthanasia, in which the doctor administers the fatal dose or performs some other act, such as a lethal injection, that ends the patient's life.\" (1) That being said it is also illegal in every state within the U.S. besides Oregon and Washington. (2) I propose a change to this and make it legal in every state. Who are we to say a patient must suffer until his final breath is taken? We can condemn a man to a death sentence but we will not let him chose his own? If in fact the principals this country was founded on are still upheld today (which, in some perspectives it doesn't seem to be so) then we should have the free will to chose when enough is enough. Don't get me wrong I believe there should be some requirements put on it however I will go into farther detail once my opponent has a chance to make his argument. I wish good luck to us both.

These are the stories of Barbara Wagner, Kate Cheney, and Randy Stroup and they all live in Oregon, a state since 1998 that has allowed assisted suicide to be a treatment for patients. Let's tell the story of Barbara first, then move to Kate and finally to Stroup's story. Barbara was a 64 year old suffering from lung cancer in the state of Oregon. She was on Medicare and she asked the state for to lowered the cost for medicine that she thought she was going to get. Instead of the $4,000 a mouth drug plan her doctor prescribed to her, she was given drugs for assisted suicide that costs around $50. Wagner went on ABCNews and told her story saying that \"I got a letter in the mail that basically said if you want to take the pills, we will help you get that from a doctor and we will stand there and watch you die\" (her words, not mine). Wagner got the medicine she wanted from the state and lived for another year around people she cared about. Kate was a 85 year old women also from Oregon that according to a professional psychiatrist, Kate was cognitively impaired and that means that she could not remember recent events or people and was not mentally stable to ask if her life can be taken away. Sadly this doctor was moved away Kate and the second physician found that she was depressed and that it was treatable. Instead of being treated for her depression, she got in touch with Dr. Peter Goodwin, a medical doctor at the pro-euthanasia organization \"Compassion in Dying\". After battling cancer for 22 years, she died by assisted suicide on March 1998 death. One of the first assisted suicides in the state of Oregon after the passing of the new bill allowing euthanasia could have been preventable with any kind of Antidepressant and a better handling of her mental state. Finally we get to Randy Stroup more happier story. Randy like Wagner applied and asked the State of Oregon to help him provide for the medicine he needed to combat that cancer he had. Like Wagner he was on Medicare and like Wagner was denied treatment. According to Stroup \"(How could they) not pay for medication that would help my life, and yet offer to pay to end my life\". After his story hit the media, the state gave him the medicine he asked for and should be provided for. All three of these people live in the same state, all three had some kind of cancer, all three needed medicine to combat their cancers and yet all three were denied from the start to the right to get health care and all three where instead given the right to die. To me, these stories tell me that the State of Oregon was using something that advocates say will help people die peacefully to really using it so they could not pay for their medicine all three of these cancer patients want. It sounds to me like the State of Oregon is using the Right to Die as a way of avoiding the right health care and medicine. Oregon is also a very rich state and has a small population within the US and if this kind of pro-euthanasia law like this were put in into action in states like New York and California then we could see state saving millions of dollars for health care but killing people that don't really want to die and just want to get to there medicine and treatment. Also studies have shown that 93-94% of people wanting to commit suicide suffer from a mental disorder and that most patients wanting to commit suicide have under gone extreme emotional and physical pain leading them into depression and of those patients many want to seek help to deal with their depression and they use the reason for suicide as way of crying for help. Most disorders for depression are treatable and after the patient gets that treatment they usually never talk or rarely think of suicide again. If patients deal with extreme pain and ask to commit suicide then that pain is very much treatable. According to the a February 1993 in the Anesthesiology, 70-80% to all cases of widespread cancer is manageable by oral administration and that many treatments of pain reduction are blocked or not understood by the medical staff. In 1969, psychiatrist Elizabeth Kubler-Ross outline 5 stages of the dying process, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Since that time Dr. Kubler-Ross has stated that suicide is wrong for terminal ill patients because she states that \"(But assisting a Suicide is) cheating them of those lessons like taking a student out of school before final exams. That's not love, it projecting your own unfinished business\". So that means when a patient is depressed then suicide is not the right answer and leading them to acceptance of that fact that they are going to die is better for that person. My final point will be the legal and moral troubles around assisted suicide. Like in the cases of Wagner, Cheney, and Stroup, states can use the euthanasia laws to not allow people medicine and override the patients right to life and health care. Because of this example, the right to death may conflict to the right of health care or to life leading to a lot of legal and ethnic troubles. Also if we allow assisted suicide to happen, the views on suicide may change from from \"We respect your wishes\" to \"we don't care if you live or die\" allowing suicide outside assisted suicide to be lawful and socially allowed. Personally I think if someone wants to die whether healthy or ill, there is a bigger issue or issues underneath the surface of the plea for death, so instead of allowing that person life we just kill them off instead of helping them through the issues they have. That seems to me that assisted suicide is just a easy way to avid the real problems with someone ill or healthy that want to die.

            "premise": "Thank you midous accepting. Note the rules, if you have not agreed to them yet. Moving on, I will like to provide a real life story on one person using assisted suicide, that will allow me to reason with the viewers. [1] On November 1, 2014, 29-year-old Brittany Maynard ended her life through assisted suicide, lighting the controversy surrounding Death with Dignity, which allow physicians to prescribe life-ending drugs to terminally ill patients. Diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain cancer in January, Ms. Maynard was given 6 months to live. Afraid that she would suffer unremitting pain and cognitive and motor loss, she choose to have assisted suicide, claiming she wants \"death with dignity.\" She stated that it has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear, uncertainty, and pain. From this, I would like to elaborate into my arguments, using this story as evidence proving my points. PAINLESS DEATH Assisted Suicide promises a painless death. Now just a clarification, I am not here to talk about Euthanasia. Euthanasia generally means that the physician would act directly, for instance by giving a lethal injection, to end the patients life from the patients request. Assisted Suicide is provided pills *from* the physician, but taken *by* the patient. From the story provided, the fact that it gives painless death gave the patience comfort because they knew that it would rather be painless. Note that in my definition, I specifically pointed out patients suffering from incurable diseases. Ladies and Gentleman, the thought about having one rather gives me chills up my spine. It is horrifying, knowing that a disease with no cure will take your life. The effects are horrendous, with the gradual inability to function like a normal person from the disease. The patients never chose to get this disease, but when assisted suicide is an option they choose this because they know that this death would rather be painless. Imagine that you were diagnosed with brain cancer, something that can't be cured no matter how much the doctors try. What if there wasn't assisted suicide? The only option would rather narrow down to dying from the disease. It is in fact scary to think about your death yet knowing it will approach in deadly ways from that disease. I cannot stress enough that Assisted Suicide actually comforts the patients. As wrong as it sounds, let me reason with you why. These patients are already shocked by their diagnosis, yet even more frightened by the outcomes of their death. It comforts them because they know that they have these pills beside them, and when the stages start to show, you take one. Simple and quick. But lets again, look at a world without assisted suicide. Shock targets the centre of your brain. It makes you think illogically and from that, you could go insane. It makes you feel limited because you have no option but to go with it. There are possibilities that they would end their life by themselves and without physician assistance people may commit suicide in messy, horrifying, or traumatic ways. With assisted suicide, there is no need for any sort of worry for their future nor the endless pain from suffering. PATIENTS RIGHTS \"It's my life, it's my choice.\" I look at that strongly for this one. When we are making assisted suicide illegal, we are taking away the rights these patients have for their own life. It is basically that the government/law is now taking over that patients life from committing suicide, or rather assisted suicide as the terms in this debate. We are allowing the patients to now decide what they will do with their life. The physicians and doctors told them what *will* happen, the patients can now *choose*. It is wrong that we are taking away ones permission to terminate there life because they decided to. The patients die knowing that it was their choice. They were not murdered. They decided from their own choice. The patients have rights. We live in a country where everyone has their rights to decide for themselves. Why take that choice away from them? Out of all the things the patients can choose, we are taking X rights away and we should never do that to a patient who can decide what to do for her/himself. Overall, even if assisted suicide is morally wrong that does not mean we should just take away another option for the patients. These patients who are diagnosed with incurable diseases have only one option: death but now they can choose how to. Even if miracles happen, what are the chances that it happens to every diagnosed patient? Very slim. Miracles don't happen often, we shouldn't rely on a source that is unlikely. Assisted suicide is reliable and a great possible choice of choosing death. It's either dying from pain and suffering, or dying painlessly. 1)http://www.ascopost.com...",

            "discussionTitle": "Assisted Suicide.",
            "conclusion": "Assisted Suicide.",
            "premise": "The right to assisted suicide is a significant topic that concerns people all over the United States. The debates go back and forth about whether a dying patient has the right to die with the assistance of a physician. Some are against it because of religious and moral reasons. Others are for it because of their compassion and respect for the dying. Physicians are also divided on the issue. They differ where they place the line that separates relief from dying--and killing. For many the main concern with assisted suicide lies with the competence of the terminally ill. Many terminally ill patients who are in the final stages of their lives have requested doctors to aid them in exercising active euthanasia. It is sad to realize that these people are in great agony and that to them the only hope of bringing that agony to a halt is through assisted suicide.When people see the word euthanasia, they see the meaning of the word in two different lights. Euthanasia for some carries a negative connotation; it is the same as murder. For others, however, euthanasia is the act of putting someone to death painlessly, or allowing a person suffering from an incurable and painful disease or condition to die by withholding extreme medical measures. But after studying both sides of the issue, a compassionate individual must conclude that competent terminal patients should be given the right to assisted suicide in order to end their suffering, reduce the damaging financial effects of hospital care on their families, and preserve the individual right of people to determine their own fate. Medical technology today has achieved remarkable feats in prolonging the lives of human beings. Respirators can support a patient\"s failing lungs and medicines can sustain that patient\"s physiological processes. For those patients who have a realistic chance of surviving an illness or accident, medical technology is science\"s greatest gift to mankind. For the terminally ill, however, it is just a means of prolonging suffering. Medicine is supposed to alleviate the suffering that a patient undergoes.Yet the only thing that medical technology does for a dying patient is give that patient more pain and agony day after day. Some terminal patients in the past have gone to their doctors and asked for a final medication that would take all the pain away\" lethal drugs. For example, as Ronald Dworkin recounts, Lillian Boyes, an English woman who was suffering from a severe case of rheumatoid arthritis, begged her doctor to assist her to die because she could no longer stand the pain (184). Another example is Dr. Ali Khalili, Dr. Jack Kevorkian\"s twentieth patient. According to Kevorkian\"s attorney, \"[Dr. Khalili] was a pain specialist; he could get any kind of pain medication, but he came to Dr. Kevorkian. There are times when pain medication does not suffice\"(qtd. in Cotton 363). Terminally ill patients should have the right to assisted suicide because it is the best means for them to end the pain caused by an illness which no drug can cure. A competent terminal patient must have the option of assisted suicide because it is in the best interest of that person. Further, a dying person\"s physical suffering can be most unbearable to that person\"s immediate family. Medical technology has failed to save a loved-one. But, successful or not, medicine has a high price attached to it. The cost is sometimes too much for the terminally ill\"s family. A competent dying person has some knowledge of this, and with every day that he or she is kept alive, the hospital costs skyrocket. \"The cost of maintaining [a dying person]. . . has been estimated as ranging from about two thousand to ten thousand dollars a month\" (Dworkin 187). Human life is expensive, and in the hospital there are only a few affluent terminal patients who can afford to prolong what life is left in them. As for the not-so-affluent patients, the cost of their lives is left to their families. Of course, most families do not consider the cost while the terminally ill loved-one is still alive.When that loved-one passes away, however, the family has to struggle with a huge hospital bill and are often subject to financial ruin.Most terminal patients want their death to be a peaceful one and with as much consolation as possible. Ronald Dworkin, author of Life\"s Dominion, says that \"many people . . . want to save their relatives the expense of keeping them pointlessly alive . . .\"(193). To leave the family in financial ruin is by no means a form of consolation. Those terminally ill patients who have accepted their imminent death cannot prevent their families from plunging into financial debt because they do not have the option of halting the medical bills from piling up. If terminal patients have the option of assisted suicide, they can ease their families\" financial burdens as well as their suffering. Finally, many terminal patients want the right to assisted suicide because it is a means to endure their end without the unnecessary suffering and cost. Most, also, believe that the right to assisted suicide is an inherent right which does not have to be given to the individual. It is a liberty which cannot be denied because those who are dying might want to use this liberty as a way to pursue their happiness. Dr. Kevorkian\"s attorney, Geoffrey N. Fieger, voices the absurdity of curbing the right to assisted suicide, saying that \"a law which does not make anybody do anything, that gives people the right to decide, and prevents the state from prosecuting you for exercising your freedom not to suffer, violates somebody else\"s constitutional rights is insane\" (qtd. in Cotton 364). Terminally ill patients should be allowed to die with dignity. Choosing the right to assisted suicide would be a final exercise of autonomy for the dying. They will not be seen as people who are waiting to die but as human beings making one final active choice in their lives. As Dworkin puts it, \"whatever view we take about [euthanasia], we want the right to decide for ourselves . . .\"(239). On the other side of the issue, however, people who are against assisted suicide do not believe that the terminally ill have the right to end their suffering. They hold that it is against the Hippocratic Oath for doctors to participate in active euthanasia. Perhaps most of those who hold this argument do not know that, for example, in Canada only a \"few medical schools use the Hippocratic Oath\" because it is inconsistent with its premises (Barnard 28). The oath makes the physician promise to relieve pain and not to administer deadly medicine.This oath cannot be applied to cancer patients. For treatment, cancer patients are given chemotherapy, a form of radioactive medicine that is poisonous to the body. As a result of chemotherapy, the body suffers incredible pain, hair loss, vomiting, and other extremely unpleasant side effects. Thus, chemotherapy can be considered \"deadly medicine\" because of its effects on the human body, and this inconsistency is the reason why the Hippocratic Oath cannot be used to deny the right to assisted suicide. Furthermore, to administer numerous drugs to a terminal patient and place him or her on medical equipment does not help anything except the disease itself. Respirators and high dosages of drugs cannot save the terminal patient from the victory of a disease or an illness. Dr. Christaan Barnard, author of Good Life/Good Death, quotes his colleague, Dr. Robert Twycross, who said, \"To use such measures in the terminally ill, with no expectancy of a return to health, is generally inappropriate and is\"therefore\"bad medicine by definition\" (22). Still other people argue that if the right to assisted suicide is given, the doctor-patient relationship would encourage distrust. The antithesis of this claim is true. Cheryl Smith, in her article advocating active euthanasia (or assisted suicide), says that \"patients who are able to discuss sensitive issues such as this are more likely to trust their physicians\" (409). A terminal patient consenting to assisted suicide knows that a doctor\"s job is to relieve pain, and giving consent to that doctor shows great trust. Other opponents of assisted suicide insist that there are potential abuses that can arise from legalizing assisted suicide.They claim that terminal patients might be forced to choose assisted suicide because of their financial situation.This view is to be respected. However, the choice of assisted suicide is in the patient\"s best interest, and this interest can include the financial situation of a patient\"s relatives. Competent terminal patients can easily see the sorrow and grief that their families undergo while they wait for death to take their dying loved ones away. The choice of assisted suicide would allow these terminally ill patients to end the sorrow and griefof their families as well as their own misery. The choice would also put a halt to the financial worries of these families. It is in the patient\"s interest that the families that they leave will be subject to the smallest amount of grief and worry possible.This is not a mere \"duty to die.\" It is a caring way for the dying to say, \"Yes, I am going to die. It is all right, please do not worry anymore.\" Further, legalization of assisted suicide will also help to regulate the practice of it. \"Legalization, with medical record documentation and reporting requirements, will enable authorities to regulate the practice and guard against abuses, while punishing real offenders\"(Smith 409). There are still some, however, who argue that the right to assisted suicide is not a right that can be given to anyone at all. This claim is countered by a judge by the name of Stephen Reinhardt. According to an article in the Houston Chronicle, Judge Reinhardt ruled on this issue by saying that \"a competent, terminally-ill adult, having lived nearly the full measure of his life, has a strong liberty interest in choosing a",

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia",
            "premise": "Arguments For Legal Euthanasia1. euthanasia is \u201cinevitable, so it's better to have it out in the open so that it can be properly regulated and carried out.Murder is also inevitable, so should we have that out in the open and regulate it? The obvious answer is no, and which is why inevitability is never a good argument to propose for anything.2. Euthanasia may provide a cost-effective way of dealing with dying people. Where health resources are scarce, not considering euthanasia might deprive society of the resources needed to help people with curable illnesses.This is repulsive to think we are going to be judging people if they are worth the resources to give them possibly life saving procedures, and there is already evidence of such actions going on in places where the practices are legal. One notable case is Barbara Wagner in Oregon in which an insurance company refused to pay for a drug to help her with her lung cancer, but the company was willing to pay for the drugs for physician assisted suicide [1].3. It is cruel and inhumane to refuse someone the right to die, when they are suffering intolerable and unstoppable pain, or distress.It ignore advancements in medical technology to relieve pain, but euthanaisa are not pain relieving or improves quality of life. Pain relief technology has come a long way \u201cA century ago, high blood pressure, pneumonia, appendicitis, and diabetes likely meant death, often accompanied by excruciating pain. Women had shorter life expectancies than men since many died in childbirth\u201d [2]. Now we have methods like using morphine, which is over 80% effective for everyone at relieve pain; also, we have opiates, which have been effective for chronic pain [3]. Further, euthanasia doesn\u2019t actually relieve pain. To explain, sedation just makes you unresponsive to the pain, but once you wake up the pain would still be there because nothing was done to target the pain. Euthanasia is like sedation in the way that it just makes you unresponsive to pain, and nothing was done to target the pain itself. Medicine should be focused on killing the pain not the patient. To say euthanasia relives pain would be equivalent to saying that euthanasia stops cancer from spreading. In a way they are both sort of right, but no doctor would ever recommend euthanasia to fight cancer, so why they do so for pain? 4. Human beings have the right to decide when and how to die. it is becoming less of a choice and more coercion; further, in countries where VE is legal the quality Palliative care, end of life care, is becoming harder to obtain which is actually limiting choices rather than expand it like proponents claim. For example in the Netherlands where euthanasia is legal there are problems. Although the Dutch government has attempted to stimulate palliative care at six major medical centres throughout the Netherlands, established more than 100 hospices and provide for training professionals caring for terminally ill patients, many physicians choose the easier option of euthanasia rather than train in palliative care [4]. Further, according to Herbert Hendin, MD, \u201cData from patient interviews, surveys of families of patients receiving end-of-life care in Oregon, surveys of physicians' experience and data from the few cases where information has been made available suggest the inadequacy of end-of-life care in Oregon\u201d [5]. Arguments Against Legal Euthanasia1. It is opposed by all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Jainism, Shinto, Islam, and Buddhism. They all believe that human life is a gift from God, and no human being should get rid of such a gift\u201d [6]. Critics will be the first to point out that we have a separation of church and state, and they are partially right. In the United States we still print \u201cIn God we trust\u201d on our money and have \u201cunder God\u201d in the pledge; however, this may give people a personal reason to oppose it, but may not be enough to enforce laws against it. There are also secular reasons to oppose Euthanasia. 2. It is easier for doctors to administer euthanasia, than learn techniques for caring for the dying which undermines the quality of medicine availableThe American Medical Association, along with many other health organizations filed a brief with the Supreme Court during the Washington v. Glucksberg case, stating \u201cproperly trained health care professionals can effectively meet their patients\u2019 needs for compassionate end-of-life care without acceding to requests for suicide\u201d [7]. Dr. Hendin also shown \u201cStudies show that the less physicians know about palliative care, the more they favor assisted suicide or euthanasia; the more they know, the less they favor it\u201d, and \u201cEuthanasia, intended originally for the exceptional case, became an accepted way of dealing with serious or terminal illness in the Netherlands. In the process, palliative care became one of the casualties, while hospice care has lagged behind that of other countries\u201d 3. Euthanasia is un-ethical for the patient and people cease to have strong feelings once a practice becomes legal and widely accepted.. When it comes to normative ethics, there are two schools of thought utilitarianism, and Kantianism. Utilitarianism is \u201cto act in the manner that determines the most positive consequences and the less negative ones\u201d [8]. \u201cThe motive behind this pragmatic approach lies in the finding of a disproportionate growing trend of health expenses in the last month of the terminal patients\u2019 life\u201d [8]. This model of ethics makes it ethical to use euthanasia because it saves medical resources, and unethical to keep living and using those medical resources. This re-enforces the idea that legal Euthanasia actually limits choices and coerces people. Since, in this theory, the focus of moral evaluations is based on the consequences of the action towards others, it is impossible to know if you are doing a moral action. If because a patient chooses euthanasia to save medical resources, and now they are able to save a future mass murder from dying then they would have done an immoral action. This makes this theory a poor way to figure out if euthanasia is actually immoral or not. Further, in this moral theory there is no human rights since any action like murder could be moral if the majority benefited, so this isn\u2019t a moral theory that people would want to follow. The other theory of Kantianism which gives a clearer answer. Kant believed we derive morality from rationality in which he proposed an unwavering moral law called the categorical imperitive [9]. Kant said to determine if an action is moral or not you would have to make that action a universal law that everyone must follow, and if that action caused any contradictions then it is an immoral action. \u201cKant would not agree with anybody who out of self-love decides to take his/her life. This is because this is a system that aims at destroying life; hence this maxim could not possibly exist as a universal law\u201d [9]. This moral theory better explains if euthanasia is immoral or not, and better matches what the average person would believe, since in this theory we have human rights. 4. that it is un-ethical for doctors to give such procedures; such practices violate the Hippocratic Oath, and Voluntary euthanasia gives power which can be too easily abused The Hippocratic Oath was made to define the doctor\u2019s proper role and medical ethics. Hippocrates states \u201cthe doctor to do whatever is for the benefit of the patient, and to give no deadly medicine if asked, nor suggest such counsel\u201d [10]. To have legal euthanasia would violate centuries of well established and respected medical ethics. These medical ethics have been carried on by modern medical associations like General Medical Council, and British Medical Association [10]. Without this rule, doctors can abuse their role as a trusted professional. For example, \u201cThe government-sanctioned studies suggest an erosion of medical standards in the care of terminally ill patients in the Netherlands when \u2026 more than 50% of Dutch doctors feel free to suggest euthanasia to their patients, and 25% admit to ending patients' lives without their consent\u201d [5]. Frankly, it is disturbing that any ending patients\u2019 lives without consent is even accepted little alone so wide spread. Also, if doctors suggest euthanasia, they are essentially giving up at their position as trying to help/cure the patient.

The case of Tony Nicklinson is definitely a sad one, however, it was not a necessity for him to die. Stephen Hawking, like Tony Nicklinson is confined to wheelchair, however he overcomes it, and continues to be one of the greatest scientists of the era. Obviously Mr. Nicklinson would have to of been struggling from some sort of depression after the traumatic event, it is only natural. Killing him would end his potential. Also, new therapies, medicines, and techniques are being invented everyday which could of helped him greatly. He did not need death, he wanted it. He FELT as if it was impossible; he FELT as if it was unbearable; he FELT as if there was no hope, but there was, and it was ended. Those who overcome are always happy they did. Euthanasia and Suicide are closely related topics. You can have suicide without help, but in order for assisted suicide to occur, you have to allow them to kill you, which is ultimately just another form of suicide. However, in cases where they cannot communicate with you in anyway: let's say a family decides it's time for a rich family member who's been in a coma to die in order to inherit money for their own benefit. - Very Flawed. In cases where it is their choice to allow someone to kill them (practical suicide): definitely opens the door to suicide. Mass Euthanasia and Attempted Suicide would occur, because it is now legal. The law makes people think about suicide before it occurs, removing it would make suicide easier. Not only that, but faked suicides would be easier to make. Murders would obviously be easier to make if they claim it was an \"assisted suicide\". Perfect opportunity for criminals. Suicide has devastating effects on family members, can tear them apart, and they will never be the same. It can be a very selfish act. By the way, I would love to hear, what method would make killing your grandfather (or some other relative) \"PERFECTLY comfortable\" for you? Assuming you would never feel any remorse.",

The LAST thing the government needs to administer are death options. The Death penalty is already cruel enough we do not need to give people the option to die if they do not have any painful/ physical problems. Like I said the main cause of suicide is spiked depression. The victim will shut her/himself to outside contact and become a shell and seek a way out.... Many times people just commit suicide to cope with that depression. Also again no qualms about administering asked euthanasia for people with painful tragedies that have no cure. Instead of encouraging euthanisa or the EASY way out we need to encourage rehabilitation. Right now all I hear from you is that they get counseling and lots of time.... but if you don't actually take care of the problem that's all going to be for nothing and they will just choose the euthanasia option. Lots of suicides are prevented by informing the authority and having that person take medical drugs or be in mental hosptals If the euthanasia option was available for that teacher he would've done it. He would have. He wouldn't have his happy life. He wouldn't have his new job or his new wife or his new kid. None of that. Because he took the easy way out",

            "premise": "OV1: If Pro wanted to discuss assisted suicide alone, he could have argued for the status quo from the start. When Pro presented an alternative, he changed the discourse. As a result, what we're comparing is the net benefits of assisted suicide vs. increased availability of deadly meds. That's the debate, and it's still topical, even if Pro wanted something else. On the running two alternatives point, four responses: 1) Pro continues to defend his case, so hold him accountable for it. 2) Pro made it clear in his opening round that he was proposing an alternative. A single alternative. The words \u201cstatus quo\u201d don't even appear in R2. He can't just add a case if he feels like it. 3) Pro expects me to hold to my case as given (which I presented in various rebuttals), even saying that it would be abusive for me to now present a case structure. If I must hold to what I said in R2, he must as well. 4) It is not at all fair, educational or reasonable to force me to argue against two diametrically opposed cases while my opponent need only engage one. I must hold to a single, consistent case. So must he. OV2: Rebuttal can be offensive and can win an equal burdens debate. I'm baffled that Pro is talking about the potential of abuse from me when he's engaged in actual abuse by presenting a double case and adding new planks to his plan. Pro expands his case in an attempt to avoid my harms, adding a psych exam and nebulous \u201csmart regulations\u201d. If abuse is the basis for any vote, it should be against Pro. I. The Case 1) Still vague. Pro says that companies already make these drugs, but doesn't respond to the fact that they're not currently available on store shelves. That's a huge increase in negative visibility. He doesn't address the realities of distribution, opposition from regulatory agencies, or the fact that no company is going to want to stock these. How can these drugs be OTC if they require evaluation? 2) Pro's case is now non-topical. He's legalizing assisted suicide, and just changing who is assisting. In my case, it's the physician and psychologist. In his, it's the psychologist (someone needs to do the psych evaluation) and the government. So either you accept his case expansion and vote him down for being non-topical, or dismiss it and accept my mental illness and informed consent points. You can also vote him down here because these expansions turn most of his impacts by requiring governmental regulation of individual actions on top of psych review. 3) Pro drops my point that many of those with mental illness hide that illness from doctors and families. Some of these will commit suicide without help. Assisted suicide requires that doctors and thus families find out about this illness and make it possible to address it. These suicides apply to all of Pro's cases. 4) Extend that there are almost a million people in the U.S. alone who try to commit suicide, fail, and thus can get the help they need. Pro's [1] only evaluates what happened in Finland after the availability of a single method of suicide was reduced. Pro's [2] actually contradicts this, showing that reduction of OTC drugs commonly used for suicide to sub-lethal quantities reduced successes heavily. Also, we're talking about an addition of a method used solely for the purpose, which is entirely different. However, even if it doesn't increase suicide rates, Pro's method makes attempts into certainties. Pro's [2] actually supports this, showing that those trying to commit suicide turn to less effective means when others are restricted. It even says \u201cSelf poisoning is...often impulsive.\u201d And when the drug being taken is lethal by design (and therefore more toxic and rapid), that precludes medical intervention, making more suicides successful. Pro's argument that most won't use this assumes that every single attempted suicide is solely to garner attention. Psych evaluation reduces incidence of suicide without consent, but it's never going to be as effective as that plus physician visits, consultations, and built-in wait times that come with my case. 5) Even assuming that Pro's tests are effective, my temptation argument still applies. Regular proximity to a drug specifically meant to facilitate suicide creates a desire, and being told \u201cno\u201d won't remove that temptation \u2013 it will merely redirect them to other means. 6) Extend that a government allowing mass distribution of suicide drugs is far more harmful than the rare incidence of assisted suicide.[5] He drops that recommendations aren't regulated like prescriptions, leading to increased abuse by doctors. 7) Extend my murder investigations argument. Pro mishandles it. I'm saying that suicide becomes impossible to distinguish from murder. How do you determine if someone took one of these drugs on purpose or by the designs of someone else? He provides no means by which to do so, and therefore provides the means to murder without detection. He's also admitting that every suicide is investigated, which means that the loss to privacy is non-unique. II. Unintended Consequences Assisted suicide comes with acceptable risks. Recognizing the right of the dying to personally end their suffering is worth those risks. I made clear what the categories are for assisted suicide. Merely presenting a slippery slope without links to my case doesn't explain how those catories expand. If the minority harm is inadequate palliative care and increased amputations, then those are what need to be addressed. Providing access to assisted suicide addresses the pain society has caused better than status quo without imposing any decision. If the concern is that a gatekeeper is somehow imposing, then Pro's case expansion is giving them more reason to worry, as their suicides would now have to be approved by both their doctor and government. If gatekeepers are effectively pre-approving suicide, then Pro's engaging in it on a government-wide basis. III. Corruption Pro ignores my responses on the role of doctors: the lack of assisted suicide undermines the role of doctors by requiring that they cause/prolong further suffering and ignore patient pleas to end that suffering. Remember, doctors have a duty to minimize suffering. Doctors are solely assessing patient demand and eligibility for suicide. There's no recommendation involved here; the patient requests, the doctor either allows or does not allow them access. This is a medical and ethical issue, one that must be handled by doctors. As for R&D, Pro still isn't explaining how is such a small proportion of the population that receives assisted suicide altering the entire landscape of pain medication.[5] Pro's case is far more likely to have this affect suicide as a result of broad accessibility. IV. Suicide The legality of suicide is complex.[6] Pro is requiring that any laws that address it be ignored. Extend my point about mistrust \u2013 it applies even when suicide is legal. I said suicide was medical, not a medical treatment. If treatments are completely failing a person, then suicide becomes an appropriate possibility. It doesn't matter what happens after death, or how the doctor perceives it, since an end to life is what's being decided and not an afterlife. Pro drops his argument about medical aspects being neutral. Extend my point that a beneficial outcome for a patient is a net good, and that their choice of suicide can be that beneficial outcome. Pro doesn't explain why suicide provides any form of unique message that cannot be given by other means (e.g. protest). That means any impact is still non-unique. He doesn't explain how assisted suicide damages the meaning of suicide and life, nor does he explain how his case gives them better meaning. V. Freedom The right to refuse is integral to my case. Pro's example of a doctor pulling the plug once again conflates assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. Assisted suicide requires that the patient have the capacity to administer medication. As a result, both \u201crights\u201d Pro states are wrong. Doctors are not administering the medication or even recommending it, and therefore never engaged in killing. The wishes and actions of the patient are paramount. The doctor can do nothing without the refusal/consent of the patient. The line between withdrawing care and assisted suicide is, thus, drawn by the patient. Pro drops this. The Netherlands example still doesn't establish a link between involuntary euthanasia and assisted suicide; they legalized voluntary euthanasia first. If I'm not empowering doctors to end lives via their actions directly, then they have no legal means for this expansion. \u201cLogic\u201d doesn't surmount basic legal restrictions. Let me put this clearly: intrusion into death and the deathbed are not part of my case. Pro has yet to show how a lack of intrusion can lead to abuse. VI. Equality Pro's twisting my words. I said that life has no instrumental value, not that it has no value. It has inherent value. It's unclear how Pro gets from some lives lack of instrumental value to the collapse of equal protection, infanticide and murder. The inherent value of life ensures that none of these are justified. Pro continues to distort my case. I never said that informed consent should be the only standard by which we decide who should be allowed to receive assisted suicide. And it's not murder either (making Pro's newest slippery slope nonsensical), nor is it inconsistent. It's the legal capacity to end one's suffering when death is in the near future. It's absurd that Pro's attacking my case for vagueness considering his own. The standards are clear: nearing the end of life, undergoing suffering, and capable of informed consent and self-administration. None of these are arbitrary, meaning the law itself isn't arbitrary. Any specifics beyond those standards are decided between a doctor and patient, and those decisions are informed and individual. 5. http://bit.ly... 6. http://bit.ly...",

            "premise": "Contention 1: Unreported Euthanasia and Euthanasia without consent. Now I know that my opponent is against some of these, but this plays a key factor in my slippery slope argument that I will get into next. In 2003, Terri Schiavo recovered from a vegetative state that she had been in for 13 years. She had been dubbed dying, but she began to recover and eventually woke up to be on the O\u2019Rielily Show. (http://www.rense.com...) They had removed her feeding tube and she had been without food and water for a few days even when she began to show signs of recovery. This is an event that occurred in the United States and we can see how this can easily go wrong when we try to give someone a peaceful end. In New York, Dr. Dimancescu's program has increased the ability for patients to get out of comas by a total of 91% compared to regular machines which have only 11%. (http://www.nysrighttolife.org...) For this next part I will argue that of self determination. The reason I say that only those who are faced with death should be able to decide weather or not euthanasia is justifiable for them, but only when they are in the correct state of mind. Those who chose willingly can either be suffering from depression or from that of sickness and that sickness can impair the way they think by forcing an unbearable pain upon them. Under Self-Determination one must first mentally defeat the sickness and then when they are in the correct state of mind then they should be able to make any judgemental decision and it is likely under this case that they would choose life over death. (http://www.vatican.va...) My opponent brings up that the Netherlands case is irrelevant, but the study is still a study. Though they may not have the same culture or morals they are more like US than Africans. (not trying to be racist, but it\u2019s a simple fact) If my opponent still does not choose to accept my Neatherlands graph then I shall present one from Oregon and it shows the exact same trend My opponent brings up that since we euthanize animals then why don't we euthanize humans. The answer to this question is simple when looking at this from a moral standpoint. She is also right to say that you cannot put a price on a life. When religion is applied God gave humans dominion over the Earth and all animals upon it. Thus it is justifiable for humans to kill animals. When it comes to humans it is immoral to play God and kill a human being and determine the day which he meets his/her maker. Hence why one of the 10 Commandments is \"Thou shall not kill\" and we all know that euthanasia is a \"mercy\" killing. We also do tons of crazy things to animals that we do not do to ourselves like testing new pesticides on and desease treatments/testings. Also when you see the new technology coming out everyday to wake people from comas it really makes it irrelivant and irresponsable to kill someone like Terri Schiavo where you only had to wait a while and then she woke up after the doctor had pulled the plug. Contention 2: Slippery Slope Argument My opponent misinterprets my argument by saying that all doctors are to go on a killing spree and that we will have a society like in the Giver where we euthanize all of the senior citizens, because they cannot contribute to society anymore. No this is incorrect. I'm simply showing how legalizing this will lead to more as society gets to accept it as a norm. Like how the process of \"Unwinding\" is gloabally accepted though we would view it as apalling! (Unwind by Neil Shusterman). It's social acceptable, because society has accepted it as a norm and has been used to it for so long. Just like in Belgium now, people are able to euthanize children, which I had brought up last round. You can see how this is becoming socially acceptable as the numbers and the rates of euthanasias are increasing and in some cases doubling. The cases of Euthanasia in both Belgium and Neatherlands have doubled and skyrocketed since they had been able to legalize it and this is proof of this becoming a norm. There is plenty of information on euthanasia avaliable as several European nations have been doing this for years. Now once again, I understand that Pro is against involuntary euthanasia, but the fact is that I have show that by supporting this will lead to the fact of it getting legalized as it has led to the ability for children to be euthanized by the word of their parents in Belgium in 2009. Contention 3: Giving the healing doctor a killing role. My opponent states that my fear of the doctor is irreliant, but pounder this; why are children afraid of clowns? Many actually point to two prominate and well known clowns, Pennywise from It by Stephen King and Bozo the Clown. Bozo the clown who turned out to be a prominate serial killer and Pennywise is a self explanitory one, but these two caused a major fear of clowns and the same can be done to demonize doctors. (http://zidbits.com...) My opponent likes to give statistics here so I'l use her very source to give you some of these facts. Physician-Assisted Suicide [euthanasia]: 42% Had both a \"religious and nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 31% Had \"no objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 21% Had a \"nonreligious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide 5% Had a \"religious objection\" to physician-assisted suicide Physician Characteristics: 79% of Asian doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 71% of Hispanic doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 67% of White doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 65% of Black doctors in the US object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Catholic doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 79% of Muslim doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 75% of Protestant doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 74% of Hindu doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 54% of Jewish doctors object to physician-assisted suicide 39% of doctors with no religious affiliation object to physician-assisted suicide Physicians from the US Midwest are more likely to object to physician-assisted suicide than those from the US South So it appears from Pro's own source that the numbers appear to show that the numbers are actually saying the opposite of what she is trying to say.

Oregon has safeguards in place to prevent abuse of this law by people who may be suicidal or unable to make this very important decision competently. The physician has to educate the patient on all their possible options including pain management and hospice care. The person must be a resident and deemed mentally competent. The patient must make several requests over a period of time giving them adequate time to consider the decision. Since the law was enacted Washington and Vermont have followed suit alone with British Columbia and Quebec. According to a public health publication the majority of patients who took their lives with the DWDA had baccalaureate degrees or higher and were enrolled in hospice care prior to dying. This means that the patient is educated and has tried other options. The majority of patients concerns with their terminal illness were loss of autonomy. It stands to reason that these patients did not want to be a burden to others or lose the dignity of taking care of themselves. This is a reasonable and sane argument for wanting to take ones own life. http://www.nytimes.com... https://public.health.oregon.gov...",

            "premise": "Thank you for your concession. I'm still going to present my opening arguments anyway, mostly to save them for another debate. ==Opening Arguments== I would like to thank my opponent for providing his opening arguments. As a pre-med student, this is one issue that I care very deeply about. I am strongly opposed to any form of PAS or euthanasia. I\u2019m looking forward to an excellent exchange. Observations This debate centers around PAS/Euthanasia. We need to understand that the two are not mutually exclusive and they are not synonyms for each other. Although the end goal is the same (death), the procedure is much different. Euthanasia is usually defined as an intentional act undertaken by the physician that intentionally ends the life of a person at his/her request. PAS, on the other hand, a person self-administers a lethal substance provided by the physician (1). Although these differences appear to be moot and non-consequential, they both have a differing set of ethical questions. For purposes of this particular debate, however, it appears that both of them are being treated as synonyms. Therefore, pro will have to show that both PAS and euthanasia should be legalized. I will, however, attempt to negate the resolution by showing that both PAS and euthanasia should not be legalized under any circumstances. Framework My framework will be centered around medical ethics and the harms that legalizing PAS or euthanasia will cause to the medical profession. Legalizing PAS or euthanasia would greatly harm the medical profession and violates the rights and dignity of patients. Corruption of Medicine Legalized PAS would forever change the culture and purpose in which medicine is practiced. Legalization of PAS would corrupt medicine by permitting the tools of healing to be used for killing. Furthermore, it distorts the physician-patient relationship, and could eventually lead to forced euthanasia. Finally, the risks of misdiagnosis among terminally ill patients are far too great to allow a physician to determine who should live and who should die.The bedrock to medical ethics is the Hippocratic Oath (more on this in the next round) which states: \u201cI will keep [the sick] from harm and injustice. I will neither give a deadly drug to anyone who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.\u201d (2) This is the foundation of medicine. As doctors, we have the responsibility to treat our patients and stay on the side of life. Legalizing PAS would greatly undermine the first roll that a doctor has. Misdiagnosis PAS is seen as a merciful way out for the terminally ill. Under current law in Oregon and other places, the terminally ill can request PAS if they have been given less than 6 months to live. Unfortunately, misdiagnosis among the terminally ill is not uncommon. According to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, medical errors, when added up, may be the third leading cause of death (3). Joseph Perkins asks, \u201cHow many of those patients, depressed by the prospect of imminent death, might ask a doctor to prescribe them lethal medication so that they can end their lives, as euthanasia proponents euphemistically put it, \u2018on their own terms\u2019?\u201d (4)Distorting the Physician-Patient Relationship As noted by Dr. Ryan T. Anderson, PhD.: \u201cPAS changes the culture in which medicine is practiced. It corrupts the profession of medicine by permitting the tools of healing to be used as techniques for killing. By the same token, PAS threatens to fundamentally distort the doctor\u2013patient relationship because it reduces patients\u2019 trust of doctors and doctors\u2019 undivided commitment to the life and health of their patients.\u201d (5) The Duty to Die When does the right to die become the duty to die? Although the laws put safeguards in place to prevent forced PAS, no guarantee is made that it won\u2019t occur and the safeguards are woefully inefficient. Because it is cheaper to kill a patient rather than treat one, insurance companies will be incentivized to cover medication of PAS rather than keep them covered long-term. This happened in 2008 to Barbra Wagner as CNN reports: \u201cIn 2008, came the story that Barbara Wagner, a Springfield, Oregon, woman diagnosed with lung cancer and prescribed a chemotherapy drug by her personal physician, had reportedly received a letter from the Oregon Health Plan stating that her chemotherapy treatment would not be covered. She said she was told that instead, they would pay for, among other things, her assisted suicide.\u201d (7) The slippery slope is real and quite alarming. J. Pereria et al. noted that In Belgium, non-voluntary euthanasia (that is, without explicit consent of the patient) is 3 times higher than the Netherlands and accounts for more than 1% of all euthanasia. Their study concluded: \u201cIn 30 years, the Netherlands has moved from euthanasia of people who are terminally ill, to euthanasia of those who are chronically ill; from euthanasia for physical illness, to euthanasia for mental illness; from euthanasia for mental illness, to euthanasia for psychological distress or mental suffering\u2014and now to euthanasia simply if a person is over the age of 70 and \u201ctired of living.\u201d Dutch euthanasia protocols have also moved from conscious patients providing explicit consent, to unconscious patients unable to provide consent. Denying euthanasia or pas in the Netherlands is now considered a form of discrimination against people with chronic illness, whether the illness be physical or psychological, because those people will be forced to \u201csuffer\u201d longer than those who are terminally ill. Non-voluntary euthanasia is now being justified by appealing to the social duty of citizens and the ethical pillar of beneficence.\u201d (7) This is certainly undesirable and has no place in medicine. Conclusion The great harm that it would cause to the medical profession cannot be overstated. Doctors must remain on the side of life and actively work to preserve life, not take it away. Moreover, the risk of misdiagnosis is far too great to risk terminating life prematurely. Instead of encouraging death, we must work to improve end-of-life care. The resolution is soundly negated. 1. http://www.medscape.com......2. http://guides.library.jhu.edu......3. http://qualitysafety.bmj.com......4. http://www.ocregister.com......5. http://www.heritage.org......6. http://www.cnn.com......7.

That being the case, our decisions lead us to conclude that the asserted 'right' to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\" Patient Suffering at End-of-Life \"Activists often claim that laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are government mandated suffering. But this claim would be similar to saying that laws against selling contaminated food are government mandated starvation. Laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are in place to prevent abuse and to protect people from unscrupulous doctors and others. They are not, and never have been, intended to make anyone suffer.\" Slippery Slope to Legalized Murder \"In a society as obsessed with the costs of health care and the principle of utility, the dangers of the slippery slope... are far from fantasy... Assisted suicide is a half-way house, a stop on the way to other forms of direct euthanasia, for example, for incompetent patients by advance directive or suicide in the elderly. So, too, is voluntary euthanasia a half-way house to involuntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia. If terminating life is a benefit, the reasoning goes, why should euthanasia be limited only to those who can give consent? Why need we ask for consent? Hippocratic Oath and Prohibition of Killing \"The prohibition against killing patients... stands as the first promise of self-restraint sworn to in the Hippocratic Oath, as medicine's primary taboo: 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect'... In forswearing the giving of poison when asked for it, the Hippocratic physician rejects the view that the patient's choice for death can make killing him right. For the physician, at least, human life in living bodies commands respect and reverence--by its very nature. As its respectability does not depend upon human agreement or patient consent, revocation of one's consent to live does not deprive one's living body of respectability. The deepest ethical principle restraining the physician's power is not the autonomy or freedom of the patient; neither is it his own compassion or good intention. Rather, it is the dignity and mysterious power of human life itself, and therefore, also what the Oath calls the purity and holiness of life and art to which he has sworn devotion.\" Government Involvement in End-of-Life Decisions \"Cases like Schiavo's touch on basic constitutional rights, such as the right to live and the right to due process, and consequently there could very well be a legitimate role for the federal government to play. There's a precedent--as a result of the highly publicized deaths of infants with disabilities in the 1980s, the federal government enacted 'Baby Doe Legislation,' which would withhold federal funds from hospitals that withhold lifesaving treatment from newborns based on the expectation of disability. The medical community has to have restrictions on what it may do to people with disabilities - we've already seen what some members of that community are willing to do when no restrictions are in place.\" Palliative (End-of-Life) Care \"Studies show that hospice-style palliative care 'is virtually unknown in the Netherlands [where euthanasia is legal].' There are very few hospice facilities, very little in the way of organized hospice activity, and few specialists in palliative care, although some efforts are now under way to try and jump-start the hospice movement in that country... The widespread availability of euthanasia in the Netherlands may be another reason for the stunted growth of the Dutch hospice movement. As one Dutch doctor is reported to have said, 'Why should I worry about palliation when I have euthanasia?'\" Healthcare Spending Implications \"Savings to governments could become a consideration. Drugs for assisted suicide cost about $35 to $45, making them far less expensive than providing medical care. This could fill the void from cutbacks for treatment and care with the 'treatment' of death.\" Social Groups at Risk of Abuse \"It must be recognized that assisted suicide and euthanasia will be practiced through the prism of social inequality and prejudice that characterizes the delivery of services in all segments of society, including health care. Those who will be most vulnerable to abuse, error, or indifference are the poor, minorities, and those who are least educated and least empowered. This risk does not reflect a judgment that physicians are more prejudiced or influenced by race and class than the rest of society - only that they are not exempt from the prejudices manifest in other areas of our collective life. While our society aspires to eradicate discrimination and the most punishing effects of poverty in employment practices, housing, education, and law enforcement, we consistently fall short of our goals. The costs of this failure with assisted suicide and euthanasia would be extreme. Nor is there any reason to believe that the practices, whatever safeguards are erected, will be unaffected by the broader social and medical context in which they will be operating. This assumption is naive and unsupportable.\" Religious Concerns \"As Catholic leaders and moral teachers, we believe that life is the most basic gift of a loving God- a gift over which we have stewardship but not absolute dominion. Our tradition, declaring a moral obligation to care for our own life and health and to seek such care from others, recognizes that we are not morally obligated to use all available medical procedures in every set of circumstances. But that tradition clearly and strongly affirms that as a responsible steward of life one must never directly intend to cause one's own death, or the death of an innocent victim, by action or omission... We call on Catholics, and on all persons of good will, to reject proposals to legalize euthanasia.\" Living Wills \"Not only are we awash in evidence that the prerequisites for a successful living wills policy are unachievable, but there is direct evidence that living wills regularly fail to have their intended effect... When we reviewed the five conditions for a successful program of living wills, we encountered evidence that not one condition has been achieved or, we think, can be. First, despite the millions of dollars lavished on propaganda, most people do not have living wills... Second, people who sign living wills have generally not thought through its instructions in a way we should want for life-and-death decisions... Third, drafters of living wills have failed to offer people the means to articulate their preferences accurately... Fourth, living wills too often do not reach the people actually making decisions for incompetent patients... Fifth, living wills seem not to increase the accuracy with which surrogates identify patients' preferences.\" Roughly speaking, there are two major views about euthanasia. The traditional view holds that it is always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent human being, but that given certain circumstances it is permissible to withhold or withdraw treatment and allow a patient to die. A more recent, radical view is embraced by groups such as the Hemlock Society and the Society for the Right to Die. It denies that there is a morally significant distinction between passive and active euthanasia allows the former and forbids the latter. Accordingly, this view argues that mercy killing, assisted suicide, and the like are permissible. The issues surrounding the euthanasia debate are tips of a much larger iceberg. www.afterall.net www.google.com I Vote For Con",

            "conclusion": "We should help those who want to commit suicide",
            "premise": "My opponent seems to have constantly misunderstood me throughout this whole debate, therefore I would like to unravel their (quite immensely) flawed argument. Firstly, my opponent rebuts with the quote, \"The person themselves have the right to commit suicide, but is not a right to force someone else to help them cause suicide\". Not once in my argument have I said anything about the \"forced\" assist of suicide but still my opponent seems to decide that this is an adequate contradiction to the documented human right \"dominion\" [1]. This fact alone leaves my opponent's argument almost completely flawed. The title of this debate is 'We should help those who want to commit suicide' not 'We should force doctors into helping those who want to commit suicide'. It's seems my opponent has failed to grasp the concept of this; the idea is choice - people are given a choice in the way they want to live their life [2] and I believe that they should be given a choice in the way they would like to end it too. If a doctor is willing to assist in a patient's suicide then they should. There is no referral to forcing an individual into assisted suicide in my argument, so I would like to ask my opponent where they developed this argument. Con's next shaky argument quotes the Bill of Rights and states that \"We cannot take a persons life; so assisted suicide cannot be used.\" It seems my opponent doesn't know what assisted suicide actually is, which may be why we are on such opposite sides of the suicide spectrum. Assisted suicide is 'The act of deliberately assisting another person to kill themselves' [3] This exact definition or slight variations of it can be found on the NHS website, the Equality and Human Rights Commission website and the US Constitution Rights, which my opponent even quotes from. I agree we cannot take another person's life as this is known as murder [4] (see synonyms below) but there is no claim in the Bill of Rights that assisted suicide is illegal therefore this rebuttal, like the previous, can be swept aside. My opponent then goes on to attempt to disprove my evidently sustained argument. They claim that there is no a safe way to commit suicide and that \"There is nothing safe about that [suicide], when one kills themselves; they do any means of measure to get the job done.\" But where is a source that proves this? There are many sources that show that the most commonly chosen suicide methods are hanging/suffocation and poisoning [5] which disproves my opponent's argument that \"they do any means to get the job done.\"and shows a selective correlation in the ways people commit suicide. As well as this, there are quite obviously more safe ways to commit suicide. Is Con saying that jumping off a bridge onto a busy road is safer than physician-assisted suicide in a controlled area? Con continues with \"What damage will occur if the person is dead? He or she will have no life, and wouldn't suffer any damage except taking his or her own life.\" I can quickly push this argument aside with the quite blatant fact that damage is extremely likely to occur in a suicidal incident. [6] Does a person who jumps off a cliff receive no bodily damage? I would like to answer their question \"What damage will occur?\" Injuries could be sustained to the person taking their own life, e.g. bullet holes, wounds, organ damage, dismemberment etc. as well as those around them who could be similarly injured not to mention damaged mentally or emotionally. Why hurt others in the process rather than keeping it in a conditioned area? As we carry on down my opponent's argument we see the rebuttal, \"a kid will listen 75% of the time but will not listen to all their parents rules.\" Like the previous statement, I see no sources to prove this apparent statistic so we can therefore regard it as Con's opinion. There are no sources that support the argument that a child would not listen to their parents in the situation of suicide and my opponent tries to hide this fact with 'youth suicide statistics' and 'negative emotions in teens when listening to parent'. Evidence of this is when my opponent states that 'a kid' will not listen to their parents rules then supports it with 'teen' statistics. The fact still remains that anyone under 18 does not have independent ownership over themselves [7] and therefore would not be accepted to be assisted in their death. So there is no way that a child could \"get help to die because of a bully\". Con then attempts to counter me with my own opinion, \"I agree that there are multiple programs and different forms of treatment that could help a depressed individual, and that before being allowed to be put to death, a person should take psychological tests to ensure their decision is a proper one\". Yes, I agree that a person should be thoroughly assessed so they don't regret the decision (if it's even possible to regret something once dead) and to make sure that committing suicide is really the final and only solution. In conjunction to this, I would like to address my opponent's earlier quote, \"We should not help those who want to commit suicide freely; but help those who are in physical pain.\" and ask, what is so different about physical and mental pain? In fact, there are several sources which support the opposite view and say that mental/emotional pain is worse than physical pain [8]. Shouldn't a person be given the choice to end their pain? Before concluding, Con states that \"assisted suicide ... causes more harm to the physician than the suicidal victim\" and gives the seemingly legitimate statistic (though when I accessed the source attached there was no evidence of this) that \"30% of physicians kill themselves in a year or so because of grief\". Now, these statistics may seem quite large but in conjunction with other facts, the amount of physicians that die after assisted suicide is minuscule. The Assisted Suicide Bill [9] states that 'In practice, only a very small number of patients have an assisted death' and that 'an assisted dying law would not result in more people dying but fewer people suffering'. [10] The same bill shows that only 0.2% of patients in countries where the Assisted Suicide Bill is legal actually choose to have an assisted death. This means that 30% of physicians out of this 0.2% kill themselves. Which then comes out as 0.00666666666% (0.2 divided by 30) of 14% [11] (the approximate proportion of the world where assisted suicide/euthanasia is legal). If we divide this by the number of people in the world, we find that the number of physicians who actually commit suicide over the assisted suicide of a patient is approximately 339,000 (rounded value). This may seem like a large number but compared to other statistics it isn't. Katy Perry has 46,555,829 followers on Twitter. There are approximately 280,000 rubber duckies lost a year [12]. Approximately 1 million people die from suicide each year, which is one death every 40 seconds [13]. And with the data Con has given us, we see that the 0.00666666666% of physicians that kill themselves (though important) are an extremely minuscule amount and that it is very rare for a physician to commit suicide because of assisting someone else during their death. So to answer my opponent's question \"How is this any better, when its actually causing more harm than just letting the individual him or herself do the action to themselves?\" The harm it is causing to the physicians is quite substantially less than the harm to actual suicide victim and the numbers above support this, therefore it is better.

The doctors thought ha would die but he did not. He showed no signs of recovery and you would know that if you read the article. Also assisted suicide is an exception to the norm. It excepts people who have \"Lived too long\" and \"Should die.\" so you should not make the argument since it too is an exception. According to your logic. Life is suffering and you cannot achieve anything without it. And a lot of people will suffer if their families send the doctor authorization to kill them. Also, A person's inability to function does not make their lives less valuable. So weather or not they can't talk, they should not die.[4] 2. I must \"look at the big picture\" as you said, and if one person is willing to do this, more people are. Or to put it simpler, where one goes, others follow. My judgement is on the entirety of people and I can't just except a few groups of people just because they did the thing I am arguing against. Also, there is doctor Kevorkian. He was a doctor that killed 130 patients. He was arrested for good reason. He killed his patients without even trying to help them in other ways. [1] the definition of euthanasia is \"mercy killing\".[2] murder is \"the killing of another human\" [3] so euthanasia is murder. 3. Alright, so if you go that way I can also say he allowed Hitler to masacher millions of Jews BY EUTHANASIA. However, I do not believe this and neither should you. Gods commandment said \"thou shall not kill\" By definition, euthanasia is killing.

            "discussionTitle": "Assisted suicide should be illegal.",
            "conclusion": "Assisted suicide should be illegal.",
            "premise": "Thanks for accepting the debate, Whiteflame.I'm a liberal, and an atheist, so my approach to assisted suicide isn't religious. I'm gonna argue that assisted suicide erodes basic rights, including equality and freedom. I then conclude with a somewhat libertarian alternative: make deadly drugs freely available to the public. EqualityThe 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection of the law to all people. This guarantee is replicated in Article 14 of the European Convention and in the constitutions and declarations of many other countries. We treat people with equal respect because of their status as human beings, without regard to their looks, gender, race, creed, or any other incidental trait. This commitment to human equality is grounded on the belief that all human beings innately have dignity and are worthy of respect.Legalizing assisted suicide undermines human equality in two ways. First, limiting assisted suicide to certain people -- say, the terminallly ill -- sends a message that certain people are expendable and others aren't. In effect, allowing suicide for some people in certain conditions cheapens the existence of all under those conditions. This is especially worrisome as we expand the categories of people who can request assisted suicides (e.g. saying the disabled should have the right to assisted suicide implies that the disabled live an inferior and expendable life).Second, legalizing assisted suicide suggests that human life only has instrumental value. But the only way to justify equal protection is by recognizing the inherent value of human life. If human life only has value based on its instrumental worth to society, a critical rationale for equal protection drops away. Why treat people with equal respect if we don't really believe that they're equal? If humans only have value based on their instrumental worth to society, why extend equal protection to those with low IQs? the mentally disabled? the autistic? infants with Down's syndrome? Alzheimer's patients?FreedomFirst, legalizing assisted suicide blurs the line between the right to refuse treatment and requesting an assisted suicide. The key distinction is intent. A doctor who assists suicide primarily intends to cause death; a doctor who withdraws care only intends to respect his patient's wishes. Doctors decide whether to administer an assisted suicide; patients decide whether to refuse treatment. If assisted suicide is legal, the line between these two isn't so clear anymore, because the doctor might interpret withdrawal as the flipside of causing death. The effect in both is the same: death. So how can a doctor know whether he or she is assisting suicide or withdrawing care? This undermines the right to refuse, because doctors acquire power over patients in deciding whether to assist suicide.Second, assisted suicide drowns our privacy in safeguards, because assisted suicide requires a transparent process to check for abuse. The deathbed -- like the bedroom -- should remain free from state intrusion. Death isn't a medical procedure that needs monitoring; it's a time for intimacy, family, close friends, personal goodbyes, forgiveness, humility, and reflection. If assisted suicide were legal, anyone at the deathbed would need to justify being there so that ulterior motives could be crossed off. The deathbed scene would need to be recorded. Dying would become a public event. The result is less privacy and less freedom about our own deaths.Third, if human life only has instrumental value (which it must to justify assisted suicide), what's to stop non-consensual euthanasia? This is precisely what happened in the Netherlands: after legalizing assisted suicide for the terminally ill, the Netherlands legalized non-consensual euthanasia a few years later. This is one of those things where a slippery slope has been proven by the evidence (e.g. the Netherlands). Allowing assisted suicide quickly leads to non-consensual euthanasia, because both are grounded on the same justification (i.e. the instrumental value of life). Under that logic, if the value of a life is less than the costs of medical care, then physicians arguably would have a moral obligation to kill patients without their consent.Unintended ConsequencesFirst, there's a real danger of abuse without sufficient safeguards. And even with safeguards, there's still a possibility for abuse. There's also the risk of doctors mistakenly killing persons without their consent, as well as the risk that the patient is being coerced by others (e.g. family members).Second, there's a danger about the message that assisted suicide sends. Once early death becomes a medical option for some people (e.g. the terminally ill), it sends a message that early death is respectable for others too (e.g. the disabled, depressed, or those merely tired of life). The fear lies in extending the categories of people for whom assisted suicide is available. If assisted suicide is available to everyone, it pre-approves all suicides. Eventually, this might even reduce interference with suicide attempts. Why interfere with a suicide attempt if the state has already pre-approved it? That's a scary prospect considering that 95% of suicide attempts don't attempt suicide again, because they're often just a cry for help.Third, the possibility of discrimination against minorities. This fear is also real. Consider: (1) minority cancer patients are three times less likely that nonminoirty patients to receive adequate palliative care; (2) blacks are 3.5 times more likely than whites to have one of their limbs amputated; (3) minorities receive worse AIDS treatment. There's no reason this wouldn't translate to assisted suicide. In fact, many elderly Dutch patients insist on written contracts assuring against non-consensual euthanasia before they will admit themselves to hospitals. [1]CorruptionLegalizing assisted suicide corrupts the medical profession. First, it invalidates the Hippocratic Oath, the standard principle for medical ethics. Assisted suicide intentionally doesn't heal, and it intentionally does harm, completely violating the oath.Second, assisted suicide transforms the role of doctors. Patients can already commit suicide unaided; they don't need doctors to commit suicide. The only thing that doctors do when they assist a suicide is santify the suicide. Doctors don't actually perform anything remotely medical; they certainly don't heal. Instead, when doctors assist suicide, they perform a moral function. In effect, doctors become priests, granting absolution for committing suicide. This isn't a role that doctors should have; the medical profession shouldn't be in the business of santifying suicides. That's something better left to religious or moral institutions.Third, allowing assisted suicide could disincentivize the research and development of better medical care (i.e. why improve painkillers for those suffering if assisted suicide is a cheaper option?). This slope could even disincentivize cures for diseases, since it'll be cheaper to simply kill people off.SuicideMost suicides are hurtful to those left behind. But sometimes, suicide is inspirational, transcendent, and the most beautiful and awe-inspiring act. For instance, Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire in protest after local officials humiliated him and confiscated his wares. He became the \"Hero of Tunisia\" and \"Person of the Year\" in Time magazine. His suicide led to riots and protests just hours after, and it culminated in the \"Arab Spring,\" which ultimately led to the removal of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. [3] A bad suicide makes the world worse; a good one makes it better.A medical treatment isn't good or bad; it's neutral. And that is what legalizing assisted suicide does: it reduces suicide to a medical choice. The question \"to be or not to be\" becomes a medical rather than moral question. Legalization thus removes suicide from our scope of judgment, and in doing so, it deprives suicide of its dramatic power and meaning.Speaking about the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt famously said that it's the refusal to judge that creates evil. Judgment gives suicide its social power, its ability to make the world a better place. Suicide shouldn't be a neutral act. If we don't judge suicide -- as either good or bad -- then the non-existence of another human being means nothing at all. If suicide is just a medical treatment, there's no room for forgiveness, because there's no room to judge the suicide as good or bad. And if suicide is just a medical treatment, then how can we convince the lovelorn twenty-year old that life is worth it? Or encourage the disabled to continue living?ConclusionAssisted suicide undermines equality, liberty, medical care, and the power of suicide. There's also a host of potential unintended consequences. Taken together, all of these points make a compelling case that assisted suicide should remain illegal. And, keep in mind that suicide is something people can do without assistance, so the potential harms from assisted suicide simply aren't worth the risk. That said, I'd like to propose an alternative to assisted suicide: make deadly drugs available to the public, albeit with warnings about what ingesting them will do and perhaps even a waiting period. This solution removes any need for assisted suicide. The few who take deadly drugs wouldn't need the blessing of a doctor, and for those anxious about the way that they'll die, a vial sitting on a shelf might play a reassuring role and help quell their anxiety. Doctor's wouldn't become prists. There'd be no risk of abuse.

            "premise": "Before I present my closing rebuttal and argument, I'd just like to thank 000ike one final time for his prompt responses, as well as for being a very tough opponent in this debate. Final Refutations The Hippocratic Oath 1.Sadly, with this particular argument, I will concede that therapeutic nihilism is indeed not very present in today's medical community. 2. Here, Con contradicts himself in his thinking. While he does agree that \"the hippocrates were hypocrites,\" he also states that this does not detract from the value of the modern Hippocratic Oath. The problem with this is that he immediately counters another argument of mine by saying that the Oath is unchanged. So, one could say that, by proxy, the modern Oath's value is detracted from, seeing as how the previous Oath was ignored, and the modern Oath is in effect, the original. As well, I'd also like to point out another flaw. One of Con's contentions is that PAS's should stay illegal because that would then allow a physician to break his/her Oath. This is why we've been debating this issue of the Oath in particular so heavily. However, if what Con has stated is true, and that the modern Oath remains effectively unchanged, then his overall contention that PAS violates the Oath is proved false. Abortion and surgery, two things which I argued earlier were directly not allowed according to the Oath, are both legal across the US. Of course, I'm not suggesting the two-wrongs-make-a-right argument, but what I am suggesting is that Con's argument using the Hippocratic Oath can be considered null and void. 3. Con declares that I am distorting the Oath here, as well as saying that \"nothing is forced. The patient is not forced to live with it, he can kill himself independently, again, suicide legality is a whole different debate.\" This is not entirely true. People that generally request PAS's either aren't able to commit suicide in the conventional manners, being bedbound and terminally ill, or, to turn Con's source from round 2 into my own, they may commit suicide in much more grisly, painful, undignified, and traumatic ways [1]. To quote this source \"if you were a family member, which would be more traumatic--saying goodbye to a loved one at the hospital or coming home to see his head and brains splattered against the wall from a bullet?\" So, in actuality, the terminally ill, after coming to a conclusion that death is their option, are indeed being forced to turn to a much more horriying path of suicide, or even convince another person to kill them--neither of which, I think we can agree, are desirable. So, if a physician is willing to assist, and the patient is resolved to die, than it seems that a dignified and legal route is ideal. Defense Against Con's Refutations 4 (part 1 of Con's refutations). With this, Con asserts the idea that it is impossible to make sure patients are informed by their doctors accurately, thus leading to unnecessary deaths--therefore, to avoid these deaths, PAS should remain illegal. However, while it is true that error can occur, I believe that the \u201cwhat if,\u201d situation Con has provided is not sufficient to stand against the legalization of PAS. One of the reasons for this is that, while there are physicians that are incompetent or negligent, to say that because there are bad doctors, or doctors who can make mistakes, so PAS\u2019s should be illegal is a stretch too far. A PAS is, in the end, a medical service and procedure, and is extremely close to taking a vegetative person off of life support. And, as with all medical procedures, a patient, even though they have the right to have it (provided said procedure is legal), the patient is also responsible for his/her life, which one contention as to why PAS\u2019s should be legal. As such, he/she must be responsible for making sure that they are informed themselves, of both the law, as well as knowledge of being able to obtain a second opinion, among other precautions. So, while error can happen, I think that people can properly safeguard against such \u201cdisastrous results.\u201d 5 (part 2 of Con\u2019s refutations). Here, Con indicates that \u201cRegardless of law, legalization of PAS all over the country will open the doors to very disturbing scenarios and deviousness from the corporate world.\u201d He also raises a valid point that government and insurance can have gain from PAS. The only issue I take with this argument is that it\u2019s a mere hypothetical\u2014not in the sense of it being a \u201cwhat if,\u201d but this argument seems rather vague to be considered an argument without much support. 6 (Con\u2019s final contention). With this final contention, Con for some reason makes the connection that legalizing physician-assisted-suicide will cause an almost apathetic view of medicine, with our trust in medicine and cures. I find this contention to be very sensationalist. The resolution is that it would be legal for the terminally ill to bring about their own death with dignity, after being informed of all other alternatives. I don\u2019t understand where Con connects this to less people looking for cures. PAS is tragic whatever way one looks at it\u2014making it legal won\u2019t make it any more socially desirable. In fact, one could even make the argument that a legalization of PAS would make support for research stronger. When people suffer so much from a fatal disease that death becomes desirable, surely many would see that as a tragedy, and champion for further research. After all, I am not arguing for people to have PAS\u2019s left and right\u2014what the resolution is implying, on the other hand, is that people will have the right to have one. Conclusion My resolution is for it to be legal for a terminally ill patient of sound mind to apply for, and, assuming there is approval, eventually have, a physician-assisted-suicide. I have argued namely that a person has the right to dispose of his/her life with dignity when they\u2019re in pain, and that it should be legal if a physician is willing to oversee the process. Not only this, but I continue to contend that a physician\u2019s goal is to relieve people\u2019s suffering in the most appropriate manner, even if that includes assisting in a patient\u2019s suicide. My opponent\u2019s arguments have been that the system would be a fall-back, and that it could be easily abused. However, I feel that I have presented an adequate defense for these arguments\u2014that people can effectively safeguard against many negative outcomes, and while error occurs, one cannot name with certainty enough flaws that can\u2019t be countered with legislature. So, I feel that I, as well as the readers, can conclude that in the end, the resolution stands. Thank you. Reference [1] http://www.balancedpolitics.org...",

First and foremost, it would be preferable for this debate if the Instigator to give a precise definition of what a \"tortured life\" and \"terminal illness\" is. Until then, it will not be possible to supply articulated arguments against euthanasia (which I define as physician-assisted suicide). Since these vital definitions aren\"t provided, this opening argument will instead criticize Pro\"s opening arguments, which are flawed. The assertion that people\"s greatest fear is suffering, not death, is insofar unsubstantiated. Also, our intuition of what to do to dogs and what to do with humans aren\"t the same because humans are intrinsically more valuable than a dog (a dog, for example, cannot debate euthanasia on the Internet). The Instigator\"s argument that many of us would our loved ones to die than suffer is also unsubstantiated. Furthermore, being against state-sponsored physician-assisted suicide isn\"t so much about thinking the State is right; it\"s about not letting the State have the legal ability to allow one take another citizen\"s life. Finally, since even medical professions do not have total precision and accuracy of measuring someone\"s lifetime, euthanizing someone would have survived much longer otherwise will inevitably occur.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should legalize Euthanasia.",
            "premise": "Contention 1: Personal Freedom and LibertyMy opponent claims an incorrect fact that \"the right to die\" is Constitutional, but it is not. In the Supreme Court Case Vacco V. Quill in where Brittney Maryland planned to withdraw life support to cause her own death. In the case the Supreme Court ruled in a 9-0 decission that the Constitution did NOT include the right to die. Chief Justice Rehnquist was quoted in his ruling, \"The distinction comports with fundamental legal principles of causation and intent. First, when a patient refuses life sustaining medical treatment, he dies from an underlying fatal disease or pathology; but if a patient ingests lethal medication prescribed by a physician, he is killed by that medication.\"[1] You see here that there is a legal difference between letting a patient die and killing a patient by leathally injecting them. My opponent is highly flawed in his argument and we can see that he is refurring to Assisted Suicide, NOT Euthanasia. Assisted Suicide is the refusial of life support with euthanasia is the lethal injecting to end one's life. My opponent brings up an AngelFire gallop poll, but this poll is first flawed because if you follow the link provided by Pro you'll find that there is no background to who was survaded and their backgrounds etc... This is key in this debate, but we'll get more on that later. My opponent states that these people died anyways, but this is obvious as these people live weeks longer if they weren't euthanized as it is their life support. Remember that this debate is about euthanasia not assisted Suicide. Bellow I will clear up some of the confusion between the two. \"Physician-Assisted Suicide is where patients with a terminal diagnosis (life-limiting disease) formally request a prescription for a fatal dose of a drug which they can administer to themselves at a time of their choosing......It is a patient-initiated and controlled form of dying, to treat an unbearable situation, and is legal in two states in the U.S.A. [2] and in Europe and in the Neatherlands.\" \"Euthanasia is when a physician or other healthcare provider does something, such as administering a known lethal dose of a drug, to deliberately kill a patient, with or without the patient\u2019s consent. It is not legal anywhere in the U.S.A.\" \"Physician-assisted suicide is often confused with euthanasia (sometimes called \"mercy killing\").\" [3] Here I also extend across my moral argument about the Whom the Bell tolls and the utiliarianist argument against euthanasia.Contention 2: Doctors and Public OpinionMy opponent's sourcing is scewed in another way and that is it's wording bellow you'll find a chart showing the US's response to a poll question with this wording and you'll find that my opponent's high percentage is only for a more flowery wording of the poll question. As you see above you'll find that when asked due they support \"Ending the patient's life by some painless means,\" does the poll reach that of 70% support, but when asked to \"Assist the patient to commit suicide\" does it plumet to 51%. You'll find that yes the public overall still barely supports it, but you'll see that the numbers aren't as high as my opponent is asking. [4] We can also see in a study done by the National Institute of Health that a large portion of American minority doctors and doctors tended to have a moral or religious objection to PAS and that's not even including Euthanasia. [5]Contention 3: Oregon Now my opponent brings up close regulation, but I have to once again cross apply my Constructive cass to this argument to once again show that Beligium has done this and regulated this greatly, however, there euthanasia abuse has grown and we have also seen legalization of involuntary and even nonvoluntary euthanasia in Beligium and that's something that my opponent has stated on his own profile that he is against and we can see by supporting said plan that this in turn would be doing something that my opponent doesn't agree with on the subject.Contention 4: ExpenseMy opponent states that the doctors should care for other patients, but we need to remember that these are human beings too and that they also need caring for. They haven't died yet and they shouldn't be killed because their pain is scewing their line of thought which ends up harming the patient in the end. We can only see that we cannot legalize euthanasia for fear of neglecting of the elderly and even the fear of being \"released to elsewhere.\"Sources1.

However, when a patient has lost or is losing their ability to live with dignity and expresses a strong desire to die, they are legally unable to help. To say that modern medicine can totally eradicate pain is a tragic over-simplification of suffering. While physical pain may be alleviated, the emotional pain of a slow and lingering death, of the loss of the ability to live a meaningful life, can be horrific. A doctor\u2019s duty is to address his or her patient\u2019s suffering, be it physical or emotional. As a result, doctors will in fact already help their patients to die \u2013 although it is not legal, assisted suicide does take place. It would be far better to recognise this, and bring the process into the open, where it can be regulated. True abuses of the doctor-patient relationship, and incidents of involuntary euthanasia, would then be far easier to limit.",

            "discussionTitle": "Euthanasia is acceptable",
            "conclusion": "Euthanasia is acceptable",
            "premise": "It devalues human life. This is one reason why euthanasia is not acceptable. Proponents of euthanasia, however, do not believe it degrades life and for them patients who suffer from incurable disease should be afforded with a choice whether or not to end their sufferings. But the problem with that, it is not always the case, not all reasons for accepting euthanasia center on the suffering of a patient, other reasons are decreasing medical costs and other monetary reasons. For example, a report issued by EPAC, the Economic Planning and Advisory Council, a government think-tank. The report discussed the rising costs of medical care for the elderly, and rising hospital costs in general, and actually suggested that euthanasia might be an option in dealing with this crisis. There was no mention of suffering or the humane treatment of dying human beings. Instead, cold utilitarian considerations of cost-cutting were given as the reason to consider euthanasia.1That becomes problem when reasons, other than the suffering of the patient, are given in support with euthanasia. It degrades the life of person by saying that his life is less important than the money that might be saved if euthanasia is accepted. Life is very sacred, accepting euthanasia destroys that sanctity. It may be your life but according to God, you don\u2019t have the right to take it.Another reason against euthanasia, It neither preserve human life nor protect the mentally ill and disabled from medical malpractice and coercionIn Washington v. Glucksberg ,the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously held that a right to assistance in committing suicide was not protected by the Due Process Clause.2Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion for the court. His decision reversed a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that a ban on physician assisted suicide embodied in Washington's Natural Death Act of 1979 was a violation of the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court held that because assisted-suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the 14th Amendment. As previously decided in Moore v. East Cleveland, liberty interests not \"deeply rooted in the nation's history\" do not qualify as being a protected liberty interest. Assisted-suicide, the court found, had been frowned upon for centuries and a majority of the States had similar bans on assisted suicide. Rehnquist found the English common-law penalties associated with assisted suicide particularly significant. For example, at early common law, the state confiscated the property of a person who committed suicide. Like Blackmun in Roe v. Wade, Rehnquist used English common law to establish American tradition as a yardstick for determining what rights were \"deeply rooted in the nation's history.\" Rehnquist cited Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in the opinion.3The Court felt that the ban was rational in that it furthered such compelling state interests as the preservation of human life and the protection of the mentally ill and disabled from medical malpractice and coercion. It also prevented those moved to end their lives because of financial or psychological complications. The Court also felt that if the Court declared physician-assisted suicide a constitutionally protected right, they would start down the path to voluntary and perhaps involuntary euthanasia.4Similarly, in Vacco v. Quill, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a New York ban on physician-assisted suicide was constitutional, and preventing doctors from assisting their patients, even those terminally ill and/or in great pain, was a legitimate state interest that was well within the authority of the state to regulate. In brief, this decision established that, as a matter of law, there was no constitutional guarantee of a \"right to die.\"5Sources:[1] http://www.billmuehlenberg.com...[2] [3] [4] http://en.wikipedia.org...[5] http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia should be legal",
            "premise": "First I will make my argument against euthanasia and secondly I will respond to your original questions. My argument will be based on 3 points: Mixed Messages Further Implications Alternative Options *************************************************************************************************************** Mixed Messages The first point to my argument is that euthanasia sends mixed messages to society about the value of our own lives and the tragedy of suicide. This is because in its essence euthanasia (or doctor assisted suicide) is by its nature suicide. Now put aside the factors that lead people to this decision and ask yourself, is suicide a good thing? I think the answer for most of us is no, as it should be. Since killing ourselves goes against human nature objectively speaking suicide is morally wrong. Now when considering those with serious illness does the morality of the act change? But before one answers this question I think a prior question needs to be answered. Is deep depression a serious illness? I think the answer is yes, and many psychologists and those who study the brain would agree, depression is an illness that can sometimes be incurable [1]. Now take into account how society responds to teenage, middle age, or any depression related suicide. We mourn, and we mourn because we all know that what has happened is a tragedy. We know that regardless of the individual\u2019s illness their life was worth preserving and that this is a tragedy. So what message does this send to people with suicidal thoughts that if your illness is visible it's okay to kill yourself? But if you who are arguably just as sick with deep depression, killing yourself is a failure and a tragedy. As a society we spend millions of dollars (and rightly so) to prevent suicide in our culture. Why then is it okay to also spend millions of dollars to publicly subsides and praise the suicide of others. Who gets to say to the 31 year old with deep depression that he isn't just as sick as the 91 year old with a tumor? Instead let\u2019s promote one unified message to all people, your live if worth living until its natural end, and we will do whatever it takes to make it as liveable as possible. Further Implications In countries that have legalized euthanasia predictable trends have emerged. As I mentioned in my first point, questions start to be raised as to who gets to decide who dies? How can the government tell one person it\u2019s okay and another it\u2019s not? Well in the Netherlands they are learning the hard way that once you deny that suicide is objectively wrong, no one has the right to tell anyone else that suicide isn't a good option for them. Take the Dutch woman, who was allowed to die because of PTSD from sexual abuse. \"A woman in her 20s who suffered sexual abuse as a child has been permitted to undergo euthanasia in the Netherlands. She was given a lethal injection after doctors and psychiatrists determined that her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and continuing conditions including chronic depression and suicidal mood swings could not be cured.\" [2] Or the Swiss woman, who was euthanized because she was \"tired of life\". \u201cShe was not terminally ill, nor was she particularly severely disabled, yet she could not find much enjoyment in living anymore and felt the time was right to say goodbye.\u201d [3] The logical ramifications of saying suicide is not objectively wrong is that no one can say it\u2019s wrong. And going back to my pervious point, if we can't say to young people it\u2019s okay to kill yourself then we can't say it to anyone. Alternative Options My last point doesn't address why euthanasia is objectively wrong but rather why it's not needed as much as we think. Currently there exist options for those in incredible (physical) suffering to be given what is called palliative care. Palliative care doctors concentrate on preventing and alleviating suffering, improving your quality of life, and helping you and your loved ones cope with the stress and burden of your illness [4]. This kind of care can relive many of the symptoms of the terminally ill and provide them and their families with support through the process. This kind of option should it be properly funded would replace the need for euthanasia in our societies. The last point on this is that studies have shown that terminally ill patients have chosen death mostly because of a loss of dignity. \"The primary reason given (in The Netherlands) for choosing euthanasia is \u201ca loss of dignity\". [5] If we can show terminally ill patients that their lives and their comfort do matter through the use of palliative care then we eliminate the desire for euthanasia. Conclusion Euthanasia is wrong because of the mixed messages it sends, the implications it has on society, and the alternatives that make it unnecessary Sources: 1. http://news.nationalpost.com... 2. http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk... 3. http://www.express.co.uk... 4. http://palliativedoctors.org... 5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...; Response In response to you original questions, I think I have answered, that just as we shouldn't allow young people with serious depressing to end their life we also shouldn't let people who have lost their dignity to do so. As far as the personal freedom argument goes we should not be free to do whatever we please but rather only what is right. Do the laws that say you can't chop your own arm off mean you aren\u2019t free? No, because we should only have the freedom to do what is right not whatever we please.",

            "conclusion": "should euthanasia be legalized",
            "premise": "Rebuttal Your argument is very weak. You said, \u201cNot practicing euthanasia at the request of the dying person is violating a person\u2019s rights, creating an economic burden, interfering with a doctor\"s job\u2026\u201d This is a form of a fallacy that begs the question. No evidence is offered to support your claim. You failed to explain how not practicing euthanasia violates an individual right, creates economic burden, and interferes with doctor\u2019s job. All you did was to make evidence your own claim, but in reality no evidence was given or any explanation for those claims. Points It devalues human life. This is one reason why euthanasia is not acceptable. Proponents of euthanasia, however, do not believe it degrades life and for them patients who suffer from incurable disease should be afforded with a choice whether or not to end their sufferings. But the problem with that, it is not always the case, not all reasons for accepting euthanasia center on the suffering of a patient, other reasons are decreasing medical costs and other monetary reasons. For example, a report issued by EPAC, the Economic Planning and Advisory Council, a government think-tank. The report discussed the rising costs of medical care for the elderly, and rising hospital costs in general, and actually suggested that euthanasia might be an option in dealing with this crisis. There was no mention of suffering or the humane treatment of dying human beings. Instead, cold utilitarian considerations of cost-cutting were given as the reason to consider euthanasia.1 That becomes problem when reasons, other than the suffering of the patient, are given in support with euthanasia. It degrades the life of person by saying that his life is less important than the money that might be saved if euthanasia is accepted. Life is very sacred, accepting euthanasia destroys that sanctity. It may be your life but according to God, you don\u2019t have the right to take it. Another reason against euthanasia, It neither preserve human life nor protect the mentally ill and disabled from medical malpractice and coercion In Washington v. Glucksberg ,the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously held that a right to assistance in committing suicide was not protected by the Due Process Clause.2 Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion for the court. His decision reversed a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that a ban on physician assisted suicide embodied in Washington's Natural Death Act of 1979 was a violation of the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court held that because assisted-suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the 14th Amendment. As previously decided in Moore v. East Cleveland, liberty interests not \"deeply rooted in the nation's history\" do not qualify as being a protected liberty interest. Assisted-suicide, the court found, had been frowned upon for centuries and a majority of the States had similar bans on assisted suicide. Rehnquist found the English common-law penalties associated with assisted suicide particularly significant. For example, at early common law, the state confiscated the property of a person who committed suicide. Like Blackmun in Roe v. Wade, Rehnquist used English common law to establish American tradition as a yardstick for determining what rights were \"deeply rooted in the nation's history.\" Rehnquist cited Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in the opinion.3 The Court felt that the ban was rational in that it furthered such compelling state interests as the preservation of human life and the protection of the mentally ill and disabled from medical malpractice and coercion. It also prevented those moved to end their lives because of financial or psychological complications. The Court also felt that if the Court declared physician-assisted suicide a constitutionally protected right, they would start down the path to voluntary and perhaps involuntary euthanasia.4 Similarly, in Vacco v. Quill, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a New York ban on physician-assisted suicide was constitutional, and preventing doctors from assisting their patients, even those terminally ill and/or in great pain, was a legitimate state interest that was well within the authority of the state to regulate. In brief, this decision established that, as a matter of law, there was no constitutional guarantee of a \"right to die.\"5 Sources: [1] http://www.billmuehlenberg.com......

            "conclusion": "Physician assisted suicide should be legal nationwide.",
            "premise": "Physician assisted suicide (PAS) is a controversial practice in which a doctor ends the life of the patient at his or her request. In the United States, PAS is currently legal in Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, and New Mexico [1]. Oregon was the first state to legalize PAS following the enactment of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act on October 27, 1997 [2]. The other four states, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and New Mexico followed suit with the passage of I-1000 in 2008, the expansion of the Rights for the Terminally Ill Act in 2009, enactment of the Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act in 2013, and a 2nd District Court ruling [3]. Contention 1: PAS does not disproportionally affect vulnerable groups. Although a frequently cited British study declares that PAS violates the rights of vulnerable individuals, this study declared competing interests, as two of the authors \"gave oral evidence to the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill on behalf of the Association for Palliative Medicine\" and one being a member of that committee [4]. As a result, this study fails to stand in comparison with the various other non-biased studies that show equality in the application of PAS. Looking at data from Oregon, it is evident that PAS does not affect groups that are considered vulnerable at a higher rate than those that are not considered vulnerable. An analysis of 8 years of data from the Oregon Department of Health showed the following [5]: Individuals who were over 85 made up only 10% of PAS deaths, whereas 21% of the total deaths in Oregon were of those 85 and older. Only 2% of PAS deaths were of individuals with AIDS. Individuals who died by PAS were 7.6 times more likely to have a college degree. No patients who received life-ending medication were found to have a mental illness. Contention 2: Adequate screening for mental illness prevents the misuse of PAS.Terminally ill individuals are often concerned about leaving behind family members and may become anxious and depressed. While there have been studies analyzing the rates of depression in those who requested or received aid in dying, these studies have methodological problems, as targeting the desire for death in a PAS-specific manner invokes social and legal constraints [6]. For this reason, research that focuses on PAS in relation to depression rates are unreliable. As a result, scholars encourage those interested in the demographics of those receiving PAS to look into the desire for death as a whole in terminally ill patients [6]. There have been numerous studies conducted with the aim of gauging the prevalence of depression in individuals with terminal illness. For 25% of those with metastatic cancers depression is a major symptom, however \"80% of the psychological and psychiatric morbidity which develops in cancer patients goes unrecognized and untreated\" [7]. Thus, the key to improving the quality of life with those terminal illnesses is the training of healthcare professional in the identification of depression and providing appropriate treatment. By addressing clinical depression, the likelihood of PAS being abused is greatly decreased. Contention 3: PAS remains rare even in states where it is legal. In 2001, deaths by PAS made up 7 out of every 10,000 deaths in Oregon, which decreased since 1999 even though the number of prescriptions for life-terminating medications increased [8]. Washington state saw a similar occurrence, when in the three years since the passage of I-1000, 255 prescriptions had been written for life-ending medications but only 60% of patients chose to use them [9]. The legalization of PAS has not led to a noticeable increase in the number of patients taking life-terminating medications, dispelling the myth that terminally ill patients rushed to end their lives.

            "discussionTitle": "Euthanasia should be legalized",
            "conclusion": "Euthanasia should be legalized",
            "premise": "== Rebuttal == (1) DefinitionsPro's changing his advocacy. He was arguing that euthanasia as \"the painless killing of a patient (at their request) suffering from an incurable and painful disease.\" This isn't limited to people unable to commit suicide on their own. This includes anyone with an incurable and painful disease. Don't let Pro change his advocacy now after he's argued the entire debate -- including his definitions in Round 1 -- that euthanasia is available to anyone with an incurable and painful disease.(2) SuicidePro's case hinges on restricting euthanasia to people unable to commit suicide. I argue that anyone who can communicate has the ability to commit suicide. If you can communicate, then you can refuse medical treatment, and you can refuse food/water. That's enough to commit suicide. The only way that suicide isn't an option is if someone cannot communicate. But if someone cannot communicate, then they're not able to request euthanasia, meaning that euthanasia isn't available to them. Thus, Pro's position that euthanasia is only available to those who can't commit suicide is incoherent, since voluntary euthanasia simply cannot be available to those who can't communicate.Pro's version of euthanasia is underinclusive. If euthanasia is justified on autonomy grounds (i.e. self-determination), then euthanasia should be extended to anyone who wants it. But in Pro's world, euthanasia is only extended to those who cannot communicate (i.e. those who cannot kill themselves). Thus, Pro's version of euthansia is underinclusive in that most people with an incurable and painful disease can't request euthanasia because they're able to kill themselves. I argue Pro's version of a euthanasia law is totally superfluous, since nobody qualifies for Pro's \"euthanasia only for people who can't commit suicide\" law.(3) Health ResourcesPro seems to misunderstand my argument. I'm weighing \"lower waiting times\" against \"increased suicides\" (i.e. more people choosing euthanasia). In weighing these impacts, there's two things voters should consider: probability and magnitude. The probability for increased suicides (i.e. more euthanasia) is higher than for lower waiting times because lower waiting times are a result of more euthanasia. I win probability. Increased suicides is also of greater magnitude. Lower waiting times has a marginal effect on the quality of healthcare, while increased suicides means more people dead, earlier, when they still had things to live for. More suicides means families left behind hurt by the suicide. My argument is about weighing \"lower waiting times\" against its necessary cause -- increased suicides -- and arguing that increased suicides outweigh lower waiting times.Pro also misunderstands my argument that economic matters shouldn't factor into moral decisions. The decision to request euthanasia should not turn on your feeling of being a financial burden. Pro's logic suggests that someone who's considering euthanasia should consider -- as part of their moral decision to commit suicide -- the resources they'll free up. That's extremely slippery logic that leads down a path to straight utilitarianism. In effect, it equates economic thinking with moral thinking. I'm arguing against utilitarianism, and I'm arguing that weighing goods like \"life\" against goods like \"lower waiting times\" simply shouldn't be part of a person's decision to commit suicide (i.e. to end their life).(4) ProhibitionsFirst, innocents charged for \"assisted dying\" aren't committing euthanasia; they're \"assisting dying.\" Second, these \"innocents\" aren't being convicted of anything, so there's no harm. Pro hasn't shown any harm to innocents, so there's no impact to this argument. Unless there's actual harm to innocents, Pro loses this argument. (5) RightsPro misunderstands the nature of euthanasia. The law isn't about granting or denying rights to patients. Euthanasia doesn't give patients a right to die -- patients are already free to die, by committing suicide, refusing medical treatment, and so on. What euthanasia laws do is empower doctors. I want to be clear about this. The right granted by euthanasia is the right to kill -- and it's a right given to doctors, not patients. I argue that the right to kill shouldn't be granted. I argue that, as a legal principle, there shouldn't be a right to kill (that's effectively murder), and that consent on the part of the victim shouldn't be a defense. Just as a contract regarding slavery isn't and shouldn't be recognized by the law, neither should the law recognize a contract where one person kills another who has agreed to be killed. That's simply not a right that the law should recognize. On the other hand, I agree with Pro that the law should recognize a right to commit suicide, and a right to refuse medical treatments. Those are valuable rights that preserve bodily integrity and freedom, and it's important to preserve those rights while keeping euthanasia illegal. == My Case ==(1) Suicide is and should be legal. That is the only right to die that the law can enshrine. Empowering people to intentionally kill another isn't a right and it shouldn't be enshrined in the law.(2) Pro's euthanasia law undermines equality by restricting euthanasia to certain people. The result is that euthanasia sends a message that some people's lives are expendable and other people's lives aren't expendable. In effect, some people are deemed inferior to others and therefore their life isn't give the full protection of the law. Pro doesn't dispute this. Instead, he just argues that the argument is invalid because of assisted suicide but that doesn't solve his problem. Assisted suicide -- at least as I propose it -- should be extended to all (plus I dropped assisted suicide, implying I'm not supporting it for this debate, and only supported it because of a misunderstanding). Pro also agrees that human life is valuable in and of itself, so any law that allows killing of someone people demeans the inherent value of human life, thereby demanding equality.(3) Pro hasn't given any reason to believe the slippery slope won't happen. I've given both a theoretical and empirical reason to believe it will: (a) the logic used to justify euthanasia (easing someone's suffering; lower waiting times) seems to justify involuntary euthanasia, and (b) empirically, there's evidence the slippery slope is probable because it happened in the Netherlands. Pro gives no counters other than simply calling my argument a \"fallacy\" and a \"red herring,\" but simply calling my argument a \"fallacy\" and \"red herring\" doesn't refute it. Pro needed to actually explain why my argument is theoretically and empirically wrong by giving analytic and empirical reasons of his own. Pro didn't do this, so I win this point.(4) Pro says the \"rate of euthananized people is too small for this to have an impact on the research.\" Pro also says the \"impact\" is too speculative. If that's true, then apply that logic to Pro's \"lower waiting times\" argument: euthanasia has no effect on waiting times because the effect of euthanasia on the economy is negligible, and moreover, the impacts are too speculative to have any relevance in this debate. Pro's argument about \"research\" not factoring into moral decisions simply isn't the reality of the world we live; I agree that'd be nice, but as things are, research and development is dictated by the economy, the flows of demand and supply.== Conclusion ==Euthanasia undermines equality, corrupts the medical profession, deprives suicide of meaning, and leads to a number of unintended consequences (including involuntary euthanasia). The alternatives are much better. The status quo, where euthanasia is simply illegal, is a much better option than euthanasia. On the other hand, making deadly drugs available to everyone is better than euthanasia as well, since it promotes Pro's value -- autonomy -- more than under my Pro's model. My proposal has all the benefits of euthanasia, but it also has other benefits, such as not undermining equality, not leading to involuntary euthanasia, and not corrupting the medical profession. The key problem with euthanasia is that it empowers doctors to intentionally kill patients. And just as contracts for slavery aren't allowed, contracts allowing murder shouldn't be allowed. Again, thanks for the debate, Pro. I urge a strong vote for Con.",

If they are in severe pain they should be able to have the choice of living and death, and when they have no hope left, it would be unnecessary to let them live if they don't want to. Also death is a private matter and no harm to others. If a patient is unable to choose for himself then a discussion between close friends/family and the doctors should take place to decide what's best for the patient. Also the doctors are paid to satisfy the needs of the patient and if a patient wants to die with dignity then it's a doctors duty to do so. When a pet is ill we put it to sleep as well as an act of mercy and compassion. Why not with humans?#2Keeping a person alive costs a lot of money and putting the patient to sleep would spare money to aid other persons. I would like to point out this should not be the primary reason for euthanasia but it is certainly a benefit.#3I see you're a christian so you would oppose euthanasia because god gave life to every person and life is sacred. This is debatable but not the point of this debate. Going by this logic if God wanted a person to die, the doctors should not bother trying to save him since it's His choice.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: Voluntary Euthanasia is Morally Justified",
            "premise": "All right, let's get to it!ARGUMENTSC1. Life is ValuableSC1. Sanctity of LifeEvery human being has worth, regardless of sex, race, identity, physical capabilities, future potential, and personal characteristics. Our inherent value does not depend on anything else. It does not depend on whether we are having a good life or whether others think of us a certain way. Human life ought to be preserved because it contains immanent goodness that cannot be replaced by any other thing. Although one's value does not change whether one's motives are good or bad, innocent lives such as that of sick or injured patients do not deserve to be taken based on their measurement of their life alone.Human life is not a means to an end, but a basic good in itself. Putting life in instrumental terms is dehumanizing to the value people really hold. Immanuel Kant taught that humans are an end in themselves and not a means to something else, such the satisfaction of others or one's personal achievements. The fact that we exist gives us value regardless of any disability we have. One cannot increase or decrease their own value to make it different from someone else's; it remains the same for one's entire life. Because of this intrinsic worth, the deliberate taking of a life other than self-defense or the legitimate defense of others is not justified.SC2. Devaluation of LifePracticed euthanasia indicates that the lives of some are not worth living. It presents the picture that it is better to be dead than sick or disabled, and thus creates the myth that life must not have an inherent worth. This downgrades the status of the disabled and forces society to look down upon those with less ability. The devaluation of life is erroneous because it displays the image that these sick patients are less worthy of living. Societies have come to view the disabled as inferior and a burden on everyone else. Proponents of eugenics have gone as far as saying that the weak should be eliminated. It is unjustifiable to distort the value of life based on the limitations that some people may have, and is simply unethical.C2. InterestsAnother problem with morally justifying euthanasia is that it is impossible to know whether death is the best interest of the patient or whether the patient is in the best position to properly assess him or herself. Is it ethical to place a risky and very hard choice on the person who may not be the best at deciding it under extensive pain and pressure from others? One cannot properly assess themselves psychologically, especially when it comes to the serious issue of dying.Euthanasia is unnecessary because there are many scenarios in which it may done out of a wrong decision. Suppose that life for the patient may not be worth living now but well worth it in the future. Suppose the patient is depressed and thinks life is much worse than it actually is, or that the patient is confused and unable to make sensible judgments. There are also possibilities that the doctor's diagnosis could be wrong or that there are non-fatal options available that the doctor is unaware of. Eugenics is not necessary because neither the doctor or patient, especially the patient, are completely knowledgeable of the situation at hand. Had the patient simply been in a tough passing phase of the disease but felt better afterwards, would euthanasia had been justified earlier? No, and since everyone has such limited knowledge of other means, their mistakes, or of the future, it is safe to say that euthanasia is never justified at all. When one cannot know, the benefit of the doubt should go towards preserving life.C3. Euthanasia and SuicideSome more ethical issues that exist with euthanasia is how it is an extension of suicide. Our society largely condemns suicide baiting and believes that choosing to kill oneself regardless of their circumstances is wrong. Organizations such as the Suicide Prevention Center are dedicated to help people who are severely depressed or in pain. Family and friends become devastated following the self-inflicted death of someone they know and love. If strong evidence shows that someone played a major role in the suicide of someone else, that person may be prosecuted by the law. California Penal Code 401 allows prosecution of people who \"encourage or advise suicide\". [1]The important distinction that should be made here is that the only difference between assisted suicide and euthanasia is that the person who is helping with the death is a physician. Ethics should not be changed based on someone's profession or medical experience, because in both scenarios an innocent life is taken. The role of doctors and physicians is to save life and make life better for others, which means that assisting in death is a direct contradiction of the duty of these medical workers. Suicide baiting is hardly different from family members encouraging a loved one to be euthanized. Euthanasia is not justified simply because a physician is involved, nor is it if the physician is granted legal permission to do so, because I have shown above, humans have intrinsic value that should not be stamped out simply because someone wishes that it ought to be....Now over to Pro![1] http://www.losangelescriminallawyer.pro...",

            "premise": "\"I cannot prove my point without successfully supporting the all three of following points{1} killing, as defined, does not equal murder{2} [therefore] those who physically conduct the euthanasia are not murderers{3} suicide and therefore Euthanasia is legitimate\"Overall, the issue lies in how we defined murder. To get to your conclusion of euthanasia is legitimate then we have to assume that murder is immoral. Otherwise, P2 and P3 does not connect. To restate your premise in simpler terms then your premises are saying: 1) killing is not immoral (double negative, sry) 2) the physician performing euthanaisa is not immoral 3) sucide and euthanasia is legitimate (moral). If we accept that all types of killing are moral, then my argument falls and your premise hold. However, I do not think that the readers will agree that all types of killing are moral. Thus, your premises are not sound and did not justify that euthanasia is legitimate. The fact that you did not defend your case suggests that I have the upperhand in this debate. Lastly, going back to what i stated about all killings = murder, I will admit that I made a blunder and forgot to add \"in the case of euthanasia\" for that sentence. However, even if we go with view that all killings are murder, her statement still does not hold because her premises do not connect without making assumptions to the legality of killing and murder (the premise needs one to assume that killing is legal.) As for the Rachels argument, Con is basing her arguments off of intentions of both the doc and the patient. We are not focusing on the intentions but on the action itself. The physical performance of drowning, or euthanizing the person. Even with consent from the patient and physician alike, it does not strike down the morality of performing the actual killing. My case still stands.\"As to drunk driving and human error, they are irrelevant to this debate, because both examples are deemed to be manslaughter\"That's true: it's manslaughter, from most legal points (what is enough for me here). But it is still killing due to your premise that killing is \"an act that causes death\". Drunk driving is an excellent example, as we have the act and we have the cause of death. The intention (premeditation) behind the act is just the criteria for Murder, not for killing. Manslaughter, as Murder, is only theinterpretation we draw from the pure act of killing. Euthanasia is another one.\" I understand completely, but I was stating that the examples were irrelevlant because you do not give a case as to why euthanasia is not murder. You demonstrated that there are different types of killings but you did not address my argument in R1 where euthanasia is considered murder. 1. Financial burden of being sick will force people into choosing Euthanasia dependently.This purely applies to the American health system. And is therefore dependent itself. Neither is everyone in the western societies part of the american health system nor is this system itself indefeasible. Both, the law concerning Euthanasia and the US health system can be altered and therefore a solution can be found to make them compatible. Reforming healthcare is a big task. It is easy to state that we can change laws or completely dissable the healthcare and start from scrtach, but realisitically, suggestting a radical change can't be easily implemented. This is seen with our current Affordable Healthcare Act.2. Euthanasia is an inappropriate way of cutting the costs for terminal ill patients and would encourage doctors to force that on their patients, therefore go against the Hypocratic Oath. First a doctor that truly believes in his Hypocratic Oath would naturally not encourage his patient to take his life. But as doctors are not perfect human beings it is easy to back it up by law that they are not allowed to encourage it.These were actually two different arguments, you ended up combining both thinking they were the same lol. One of the fears is that leagalizing euthanasia would be a procedure done by doctors as a form of treatment. The hippocratic oath is about saving lives, not taking away lives. As in the doctor's duties are to treat the patient with his utmost capabiliy along with providing the necessary pallapative care. If we combined the two, then your argument suggests that we should establish laws that gives doctors the freedom the choose. This demonstrates that euthanasia affects 3rd parties, a statement that goes against your argument that euthanasia does not affect 3rd party members.3. It will lead to an absurd amount of court cases about grey area cases. Mainly when the law is poorly phrased. Can the consent be proven? If no, the cases prospectively fails prior to the first instances. That's not expensive for the community. And there are at least some cases where doctors helped a patient passively to commit suicide and were sued for it. These cases, as they can be regarded as Euthanasia, would not burden the community any more. I am not saying this will reduce a judges work. But it will not significantly raise it either. Consent would be harder to differentiate if the finacial burden argument is a form of consent. Leagal cases are a huge stress on society with it's finacial costs and time. Adding even 1 case to each state/year totals to 50 cases/year. The supreme court sees 80 courts/year. 4. It's emotionally damaging for relatives and friends if someone is allowed to die. For someone who is terminally ill this means is only robbing his loved ones from months of watching him or her suffering. Someone who knows that he will die and is still physically and mentally fit to spent this time with those he loves will usually not agree to any sort of Euthanasia. If they are immobilized and under pain it's not something pleasant to watch for their relatives as well. And ultimately it's not their decision. The weal and woe of relatives should not be a reason to prevent someone legally from having their will carried out.So you are conceding to the fact that euthanasia does affect 3rd parties. This contradicts your argument that euthansia should be allowed because it does not affect anyone but the person himself, as stated in R1.You say its soley an American attitude for the last two paragraphs, but only 20 out of the 196 countries leagalized euthanasia. That doesn't seem to suggest that it's soley an american attitude. http://en.wikipedia.org...SummaryMy only purpose in this debate was to refute the 3 assertions that Pro made. For me to win, I only need to show 1 of them is at fault for her premise to be wrong. The most prominent one was her argument that euthanasia does not affect 3rd parties of which there were several instances she conceded to my point. At the end, thank you schachdame (too lazy to write it out :P) for the debate.",

I will begin by refuting pro's arguments and then providing my own proof as to why PAS should be illegal. *****REFUTATIONS*****1. \"A physician\u2019s duty to his/her patients is simple: to relieve (as much as possible) his/her patient\u2019s suffering, as well as preserve the dignity of said patient [1]. If a person with a terminal and painful illness is barely mobile, cannot feed his/herself, but can request to be assisted in suicide by a physician, and the physician refuses due to it being unlawful, then his/her duty isn\u2019t being met. The patient is clearly suffering to some capacity (even with pain medication, psychological anguish is present), as well as being robbed of his/her dignity, having to lie in a bed, as others must do things for him/her.\"While derived from a source, I respectfully disagree with my opponent's interpretation of a physicians duty. A physician's duty is neither to relieve as much suffering as possible or preserve the dignity of the patient. A physician's ultimate duty is to prevent death through curing or retarding the progression of ailments. That is the first and foremost reason for the medical system. WHY?:1. This is the historical and universal hippocratic oath of all medical professionals: a. derived from the classical hipporatic oath \"...I will neither give a deadly drug to anyone if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect...\" [1] b. derived from the modern hippocratic oath \"I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.\" [2] Therapeutic nihilism is the belief that an ailment cannot be cured. Hence, it is implied that the oath taken by all physicians and the duty to that effect is to always try to cure one's patient. The option of killing the patient is contrary to this sworn oath. Hence, I would like the readers to extract from these excerpts the point: A physician's ultimate duty is to prevent death through curing or retarding the progression of ailments. They must always try and try again to cure the ailment. Assisting the death of a patient would infringe upon that duty and obligation. 2. \"Any person, whether a medical patient or not, owns his/her body, as well as life. Therefore, he/she also has the right to do with his/her body and life as he/she fits\"This point does not have much relevance or merit in this particular debate. Pro can use this contention in a debate regarding suicide legality. However, this debate is about physicians, the one's we trust most to help us live, assisting suicide. Since the patients are not making the absolute individual desicion and execution of ending their own life, it is done by someone else, pro's point that is quoted above has no relevance. It only applies to those who kill themselves independently. It is a different atmosphere when a physician helps this act. 3. \"Whatever way one looks at it, dying costs money. In fact, a person in Miami will be spending around $23,000 on medical bills in the last six months of his/her life [2]. This cost is for dying without the use of PAS. However, a person, using PAS, would only spend approximately $10,000 (in 1995 dollars) on medical bills [3]. I\u2019d like you to think about that. If a person chooses to have a PAS, this would mean that his/her surviving relatives would have about $13,000 that they didn\u2019t before to put toward a funeral (a traditional funeral ranges from $7,000 to over $10,000 [4]), or other debts that may need to be paid.Once more, I\u2019d like to go back to my hypothetical. Let\u2019s say that this patient who wishes to have a PAS, may have un-wealthy relatives, or he/she may be un-wealthy. Not only is he/she suffering, but he/she is also paying quite a bit of medical bills to be kept alive, especially when he/she doesn\u2019t wish to be in the first place. So, given the opportunity to choose, not only would he/he be relieving his/herself of suffering, but also saving money for his/her relatives or beneficiaries as well.\"My opponent is basically saying that physician assisted suicide should be legal because it saves the families' money. I will not argue against the fact that PAS could save families money on funerals, but I will point out that this is only one practical benefit. I will prove in the following contentions that the moral and practical drawbacks heavily outweigh this one practical benefit. It will hence become my proof that if it is, on the grand scale, both impractical and immoral to legalize PAS, then it should not be legal. *****PROOF OF MY POSITION*****Physician Assisted Suicide is Immoral and Impractical1. It demeans the value of a human life. Death, in this modern age, is sometimes taken lightly by those who do not fully understand its impact on their beings, life, and the people around them. It is the ultimate duty of a physician to protect and defend life. Death cannot be used as a means of escape or an easier option for a physician than working vigorously to cure and help the patient. \" ...human life means something...To stomp out a life because it's not convenient or it's expensive demeans that value.\" [3]2. Physicians are not always correct and can make mistakes or simply do immoral things. In such events, a life can be lost through PAS when such was unnecessary. Legalizing PAS opens the door to such accidents. At an unfortunately consistent rate, doctors misdiagnose their patients. Who's to say that a man or woman won't kill themselves once they mistakenly hear they have cancer? We cannot allow such accidents to even have this slim gateway of possibility. A human life is too dear to risk the possibility of such tragic occurrences ESPECIALLY since that risk isn't critically necessary. Physicians can also be immoral, they may tell their patients that they will die painfully and prompt them to accept PAS when that is not necessary. We cannot allow these possibilities to come to fruition. The best way to ensure this is to keep PAS illegal.3. The government and ensurance companies could also use PAS for immoral purposes. They could pressure physicians to suggest PAS because it would be less expensive and more efficient, when there other are options for the patient. My opponent himself made it a point to outline the financial benefit of suicide. It is a dangerous possibility that companies and the government could manipulate this financial gain for themselves. Keeping PAS illegal would, for the most part, nullify this threat. 4. My opponent said, \"provided that his/her decision hasn\u2019t been influenced by anything other than his/her own personal judgment\"Pain is a form of influence. Pain and pressure can influence people to do things that they may not really want. When a patient is under the influence of suffering and pain, his mind becomes fixated on alleviating that pain at all costs. It is not fair to the patient to readily accept his decisions while under such pressure. It is only the decisions made under more placid conditions that truly reflect the genuine desires of people. Hypothetical situation: A man/woman with cancer will probably experience tremendous pain. He/she may also have a family to take care of. With PAS as an open option, while the patient is not thinking clearly and just wants to feel at ease, he may abandon whatever children or family he/she has waiting at home and choose suicide. The man/woman will have died in vain, because had that pain not clouded his/her judgement, he/she may have chosen to live. Now you have an unnecessary death, and a heartbroken family. Now my opponent could ammend his resolution to say that PAS should be legal when the patient is not influenced by pain, but that would not make sense either. If a patient is not experiencing pain, then out of respect for the value of a human life, and a physician's oath, there would be no justification for administering PAS.SOURCES*read comments",

I'm just saying that if people CHOOSE to commit suicide, it is their choice and you shouldn't interfere with that. The same with euthanasia.#2You were partially right. The definition of murder is killing a person under conditions covered by the law. That means euthanasia is murder in America, but not in Europe. This makes it debatable whether it is really murder. Some think so, some don't. I don't since the person agreed to putting him to sleep.Also Kevorkian carefully picked his patients and judged whether he would commit euthanasia on them, he didn't want anyone to die if he thought wasn't necessary. So I wouldn't call him a criminal, but rather some kind of savior. [1]#3God's commandment says \"thou shall not MURDER\". And I think we've just established it is questionable whether euthanasia is murder. Also the church has killed many people in the name of God, and that was okay with him. Then one ill person who sees no reasons to live should be fine too.Closing argumentMy opponent has heavily relied on exceptional examples which don't occur enough to make it a reason not to agree with euthanasia. I know this is a touchy subject so I'm asking the voters not to vote from your own opinion about euthanasia, but vote for the person with the best arguments.I thank my opponent for this debate.",

            "discussionTitle": "Assisted Suicide Should Be Legalized for those that are mentally stable and suffering",
            "conclusion": "Assisted Suicide Should Be Legalized for those that are mentally stable and suffering",
            "premise": "This final round should be used as a rebuttal to R3 and no new arguments should be introduced as per the rules in R1. Framework By opponent brings up the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. He claims that those wishing to perform an assisted suicide upon themselves are not in a correct state of mind. This is a semantics arguments and contradicts the full resolution of the debate. It states that an assisted suicide should only be performed only when the patient is suffering. Therefore, my framework still stands since it has not been properly addressed. Defense 1: Right To Die Again, my opponent fails to understand the full resolution. My opponent claims that people who seek an assisted suicide are not in the correct state of mind (again). The resolution specifically states that I am only advocating the legalization of assisted suicide for the mentally stable, suffering and terminally ill. My opponent is failing to understand that I agree that assisted suicide should not be allowed for those in the wrong state of mind. This is not a concession because as previously stated, my burden requires me to prove that assisted suicide should only be legalized for the mentally stable. I also agree that we need to protect those in the wrong state of mind otherwise society will crumble but this is besides the purpose of this debate as clearly stated in the full resolution provided in R1. My opponent continues by reiterating voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. The problem with this is the same problem that I had in my rebuttals. This argument does not stand, it argues for euthanasia instead of assisted suicide. I provided a case which I will repeat here (this is not a new argument): \u201c\u201cIn Oregon USA it has been legal for terminally ill, mentally competent adults to have an assisted death for 18 years. In those 18 years there have been no cases of abuse and no calls to extend the law beyond terminally ill adults.\u201d\u201d The key words here are: no cases of abuse. This evidently shows us that if in 18 years there have been no cases of abuse there are clearly differences between euthanasia and assisted suicide. I will now reiterate the difference between assisted suicide and euthanasia, and why they matter. In assisted suicide the patient ultimately kills themselves. In euthanasia the doctor kills the patient. It is evident that it is easier to be killed by a doctor than to be made to kill yourself by a doctor. In euthanasia a doctor can feel as if it is their duty to kill the patient who is terminally ill. The patient is unable to stop them or have any choice in the decision. In assisted suicide the patient kills themselves so the doctor cannot simply kill them because this would be a violation of the definitions. In order for this example to work my opponent must be referring to the scenarios in which doctors may force the patient to kill themselves. This is highly illogical because the much easier alternative that can be made is to just kill the patient themselves (ie. through euthanasia). Since we are not debating the morality and logic in euthanasia this rebuttal is invalid. Defense 2: Hippocratic Oath This isn\u2019t a particularly long rebuttal however I will still address it. In this contention, my opponent refers to the : Holicaust\u2019 I assume that he means Holocaust, so I will assume this especially because of the Nazi references. I do not support the acts of the Nazis in any way and this a big misunderstanding made by my opponent. Firstly, the Nazis did not ask for consent. Secondly, the Nazis didn\u2019t necessarily know if they were terminally ill or suffering - they just executed the homeless and ill generally. Secondly, this is technically another reference to euthanasia. In assisted suicide the terminally ill person provides consent and ultimately kills themselves. I doubt that the Nazis made the patients kill themselves. My opponent supports this by saying that the Nazis executed the sick and homeless. Execution is very different to assisted suicide by definition. I will now define execution to remove any confusion: \u201cExecution is the carrying out of a sentence of death on a condemned person.\u201d Now let us compare this to assisted suicide: \u201cAssisted Suicide is the act of a medically trained professional deliberately providing assistance to help somebody to willingly kill themselves (commit suicide).\u201d This is very different as we can clearly see. The patient kills themselves in assisted suicide and therefore it is extremely rare to find cases of involuntary assisted suicide occurring and that may be the reason as to why examples of involuntary euthanasia instead of assisted suicide. I will not address the Kant argument that has been reiterated again because it is clear that the patient must be in the correct state of mind before making the decision (as stated in the resolution). Defense 3 - 4: Religious Concerns and Living wills My opponent brings up the \u2018Kant Irrationality Argument\u2019 again. The patient must be in the correct state of mind (as proposed in the R1 resolution). I will now show that irrationality does not make sense for the negative case since it evidently cannot be argued per the rules, resolution and definitions in R1. I will now present the definition of mentally stable (as stated in R1): \u201cMentally stable is when you are able to make a justified and [informed] decision without any problems that are affecting your thought processing and frame of mind.\u201d I will now highlight that the definition of mentally stable includes the words \u2018justified decision.\u2019 This is important because we will now observe whether or not this coincides with the definition of mentally stable which was presented in R1. I will present the definition of rationality but add edits in brackets [example]. \u201c[Ir]rationality is the quality or state of being [un]reasonable, based on [no] facts or reason [at all].\u201d I have done this since the definition of irrationality contains the word rationality on multiple occasions which basically meant that the definition of irrationality would have been: \u2018not rational\u2019. Since dictionary.com refers to rationality and irrationality as being antonyms (opposites), this means that turning the definition of rationality into a negative is a reasonable change. The term unreasonable is a synonym to unjustified on dictionary.com and therefore this does not coincide with the definitions stated in R1. The definition of mentally stable specifically states that you must be able to make a : \u2018justified decision\u2019 and unjustified is the opposite of this. Defense 5: Social Groups at Risk of abuse I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail on this since I have addressed it all before. Assisted suicide is not as dangerous as euthanasia for reasons explained in further detail in my first rebuttal. Minorities will not be eradicated because they would have to be killing themselves. Sources The only sources that I have used in this round will be for definitions. Due to the character limit I will link dictionary.com which is where my comparison arguments come from. The rest of my definitions that do not refer to dictionary.com can be checked by simply researching: defintiion of __. I would like to thank my opponent for an enjoyable debate and I hand it back over to him.",

            "premise": "Thanks for the intriguing case bsh1. I hope you don't mind if I borrow your formatting since I'm pretty fond of it. ;)I concur that voluntary euthanasia as opposed to other kinds of euthanasia is the matter at hand, and that for me to successfully negate the resolution I need to show that there is a lack of an ethical or logical base for euthanasia. I will now explain my case.C1. Life is ValuableSC1. Sanctity of LifeEvery human being has worth, regardless of sex, race, identity, physical capabilities, future potential, and personal characteristics. Our inherent value does not depend on anything else. It does not depend on whether we are having a good life or whether others think of us a certain way. Human life ought to be preserved because it contains immanent goodness that cannot be replaced by any other thing. Although one's value does not change whether one's motives are good or bad, innocent lives such as that of sick or injured patients do not deserve to be taken based on their measurement of their life alone.Human life is not a means to an end, but a basic good in itself. Putting life in instrumental terms is dehumanizing to the value people really hold. Philosopher Immanuel Kant taught that humans are an end in themselves and not a means to something else, such the satisfaction of others or one's personal achievements[1]. The fact that we exist gives us value regardless of any disability we have. One cannot increase or decrease their own value to make it different from someone else's; it remains the same for one's entire life. Because of this intrinsic worth, the deliberate taking of a life other than self-defense or the legitimate defense of others is not justified.SC2. Devaluation of LifePracticed euthanasia indicates that the lives of some are not worth living. It presents the picture that it is better to be dead than sick or disabled, and thus creates the myth that life must not have an inherent worth. This downgrades the status of the disabled and forces society to look down upon those with less ability. The devaluation of life is erroneous because it displays the image that these sick patients are less worthy of living. Societies have come to view the disabled as inferior and a burden on everyone else. Some proponents of eugenics have gone as far as saying that the weak should be eliminated. It is unjustifiable to distort the value of life based on the limitations that some people may have, and is simply unethical.C2. InterestsAnother problem with morally justifying euthanasia is that it is impossible to know whether death is the best interest of the patient or whether the patient is in the best position to properly assess him or herself. Is it ethical to place a risky and very hard choice on the person who may not be the best at deciding it under extensive pain and pressure from others? One cannot properly assess themselves psychologically, especially when it comes to the serious issue of dying. When under such pain, patients become less capable of making reasonable decisions, thus signifying the illogical nature of handing patients the choice of elimination. The worse the suffering, the less rational the patient becomes, which means that the decision to be eliminated can be easily influenced by external factors, such as family members encouraging the patient to be euthanized,Euthanasia is unnecessary because there are many scenarios in which it may done out of a wrong decision. Suppose that life for the patient may not be worth living now but well worth it in the future. Suppose the patient is depressed and thinks life is much worse than it actually is, or that the patient is confused and unable to make sensible judgments. There are also possibilities that the doctor's diagnosis could be wrong or that there are non-fatal options available that the doctor is unaware of. Eugenics is not necessary because neither the doctor or patient, especially the patient, are completely knowledgeable of the situation at hand. Had the patient simply been in a tough passing phase of the disease but felt better afterwards, would euthanasia had been justified earlier? No, and since everyone has such limited knowledge of other means, their mistakes, or of the future, it is safe to say that euthanasia is never justified at all. When one cannot know, the benefit of the doubt should go towards preserving life.C3. Unethical SimilitudesSC1. Connection to SuicideSome more ethical issues that exist with euthanasia is how it is an extension of suicide. Our society largely condemns suicide baiting and believes that choosing to kill oneself regardless of their circumstances is wrong. Organizations such as the Suicide Prevention Center are dedicated to help people who are severely depressed or in pain. Family and friends become devastated following the self-inflicted death of someone they know and love. The important distinction that should be made here is that the only difference between assisted suicide and euthanasia is that the person who is helping with the death is a physician. Ethics should not be changed based on someone's profession or medical experience, because in both scenarios an innocent life is taken. The role of doctors and physicians is to save life and make life better for others, which means that assisting in death is a direct contradiction of the duty of these medical workers. Euthanasia is not justified simply because a physician is involved, nor is it if the physician is granted legal permission to do so, because I have shown above, humans have intrinsic value that should not be stamped out simply because someone wishes that it ought to be.SC2. EncouragementWhat can be an influential factor in one's choice to be eliminated is the encouragement from family and friends towards the patient to carry out this deed. For someone to encourage another person to take their own life is widely frowned upon, and obviously unethical. The person has committed a serious wrong, and could even be held responsible for the life that was taken. If strong evidence shows that someone played a major role in the suicide of someone else, that person may be prosecuted by the law. California Penal Code 401 allows prosecution of people who \"encourage or advise suicide\"[2]. Knowing this, we must acknowledge how few differences exist between suicide baiting and someone encouraging an ill patient to be euthanized. If euthanasia is legalized or morally accepted, family members would begin to push others they know to \" just have their life ended\". The only noticeable difference is the presence of a physician to commit the act. Why should a legal offense be looked upon as immoral but the encouragement of a patient to be eliminated be allowed as a decisive factor in eugenic actions?SC3. Slippery SlopeThis argument doesn't necessarily contend that involuntary euthanasia will be legalized, but that the laws will be broadened to allow less and less ethical situations to be legalized in the name of euthanasia. This has happened before with other laws: \"The movement from voluntary to involuntary euthanasia would be like the movement of abortion from 'only for the life or health of the mother' as was proclaimed by advocates 30 years ago to today's 'abortion on demand' even if the baby is half born\"[3]. By giving too much power to those with medical professions, we may end up allowing situations to occur that we will regret. Since it is the nature of society to become more loose on laws, it is logical to say that legalizing euthanasia will result in relatively worse scenarios to occur, which we have already seen with planned parenthood laws. In fact, the Netherlands have already traveled down the slippery slope and have legalized non-voluntary euthanasia which has resulted in the deaths of thousands without their consent[4]. Thus, this argument is valid and legitimate as it illustrates the threats of law broadening.And so I negate.

All this costs taxpayer money, and while I can understand my Opponents reasoning that this would be cheaper than the current system, I don't agree with it seeing how grossly our government overspends and how little fiscal responsibility they have.Furthermore, the costs caused by Medicare and Medicaid is the money doing what it's supposed to do! The purpose of these programs is to provide medical care for people. My Opponent has not shown how many people would request Euthanasia, and thus these costs are still happening and this point has no solvency.=Rebuttal=C1. \" violation of the Hippocratic Oath by doctors specializing in Euthanasia is not important.\" - A) a violation of the Hippocratic oath IS important, for any doctor, and B) what my Opponent is suggesting here is doctors trained in how to kill using Euthanasia, nothing else, therefore they are useless save for one purpose.\"This is why centers would be government run, easier to make sure there is no abuse by doctors.\"- 1. This is placing too much faith in the Government, look at the Nazi evidence I linked. Government Euthanasia has historical precedent of abuse. 2. In the Netherlands, there are many government regulations, that I've already shown in the BBC and Hendlin evidence to be ignored.Government abuse in the Medical industryThe infamous Tuskegee syphilis expirement can be used as a historical precedent of medical abuse, in our own country! The U.S. Department of Health and Human services purposely infected poor, uneducated, black men with syphilis in the name of science![1]. Clearly, the Government cannot be trusted with the power to mandate death over life.C2.\"Once again the centers would be government run, making it easier for the government to monitor and prevent abuse.\" -but the government itself has a history of abuse.=Cross examination responses=1. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, \"Nearly 95 percent of those who kill themselves have a psychiatric illness diagnosable in the months before suicide.....Like other suicidal individuals, patients who desire an early death during a serious or terminal medical illness usually suffer from a treatable depressive condition.\"[2].2. A person in a vegetative state is not the same as a terminally ill patient, it's the difference between passive and active Euthanasia.5. That would be a good point, if people did not already have the right to die. Again, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention patients already have the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment! Also, \"A 1989 Swedish study showed that when chronically ill patients attempted suicide, their overburdened families often did not want them resuscitated. But when social services stepped in and relieved the family's burden by sending in home care helpers, most patients wanted to live and their families wanted them to live, too.\"Again, suicide is not the right choice.6. Government has a history of abuse, both here and abroad.7. So you're affirming that you would assist a perfectly healthy suicidal person to die?8. I've also shown our own government to have done horrible things like that.=His case=C1. Is it wrong to keep a suicidal person from killing themselves?\"Not without the families consent.\" you're saying that just because someone has a mental problem, and their familiy doesn't care that you do not care for their life? That's a terrible thing to say.C2.I've already shown how in the vast majority of suicde cases, a mental condition exists, and you cannot convince me that killing someone just because they have a mental condition and want to die is anything less than murder.=His Question=It's justified because the majority suicide cases are from patients with mental conditions, who, after counseling, would no longer be suicidal. We must value the sanctity of life above all else.=Sources=1. http://en.wikipedia.org...2.

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia should be legal",
            "premise": "You make some very good arguments, I'll try my best to counter them! I think you may have misunderstood what I was saying in regards to the intrinsic/extrinsic social valuing of life. I am not saying that we should keep people alive because we can construe purpose for their lives, I am saying that as a society we should preserve life because it is life, irrespective of the presence of purpose. On a society-wide level, legalising euthanasia establishes that life is only valuable insofar as it is desired, which would make it extrinsic. This is a poisonous attitude to any civil society as it does not respect the human individual, only what they can do or provide. \"Why are you so hung up on making this person want to be alive?\" Because it is a loving action to do, helping someone find enjoyment in life is a better solution than killing them. I am arguing that it would be a negative step to allow people to choose to die when they wish. People may currently hate their existence on earth but death is permanent, once you are euthanised there is no going back. Honestly I find it hard to imagine that someone depressed enough to be feeling suicidal has the right mental capacity to make such a huge and irreversible choice. If someone is so depressed that they don't want to live anymore, then we should help them change their mind and see the endless potential that life has. As Jules Verne said, 'where there is life there is hope', death is the ultimate way to 'give up' which seems irrational in a world where medical science is advancing so rapidly that cures for seemingly incurable illnesses could just be months away at any given time. I'm sure that Stephen Hawking, when he first descended into invalidity, often decided that he would rather die than live with with ALS. If euthanasia had been legal he could have very possibly been killed and the world would have lost one of the greatest physicists of the century. \"However having the option to end your life instead of seek treatment isn't going to cause every single sick person to off themselves.\" Of course, not everyone will choose to be euthanised. But in the Netherlands it is increasingly becoming the norm for cancer sufferers to seek euthanasia instead of fighting through it (1). People with serious illnesses generally aren't particularly optimistic, and many people will be killed by euthanasia whereas if it was not an option they could have survived and lived fulfilling lives, despite them not even considering a good outcome when they were in the depths of their suffering. \"With the medicine we have today, we're able to contain the virus or bacteria or whatever outside of the host's body, so even without a person with the virus, we're still able to conduct tests and research on it.\" True, but there would be little motivation to do so. If it became normal to be euthanised when suffering from a deadly disease then it would seem less important to find cures. Why is this? Because the point of a cure is to prevent death. If people are asking for death when suffering from said disease, what is the point in finding a cure when many people are content to do without? \"If people become less affected by suicide, then good. The way society is evolving is in such a way that moral values should be logically thought out before acting upon them. The death of a loved one will always be upsetting, however if we know they chose this path, and aren't suffering anymore, there should be no logical reason to be upset about it.\" Suicide is one of the most tragic things that exists in this world; that someone can become so depressed and despairing that they decide to destroy their life. It is logical to assert the immorality of suicide because if it was not, depressed people will not feel obstructed to end their life, despite depression being temporary and mentally-incapacitating to the extent that they cannot be responsible for such a huge decision, which suicide is. I very much doubt that you could find a single person who considered suicide, changed their mind and regretted doing so. Sexual consent is only valid when the partner is in the right mental capacity, so why should suicide-consent be different? On a metaphysical scale, it is also an assumption that death is preferable to suffering whilst alive. The experience of death (or lack thereof) is eschatologically verifiable; so how then can suicide or euthanasia be an informed decision when we only know what one of the alternatives is like? \"they wouldn't have helped society anyway. They're happy and we lost someone who didn't want to help us anyway\" That is what I was saying in round 1, legalising euthanasia makes people value human life simply because of the value or help they provide to society, not simply because it is life and is good in and of itself. \"Keep in mind with your example and others like it, that it wouldn't be euthanasia that caused her death. It would be her own choice. She wants to now, she would want to if euthanasia was legalised. If you say she does bring great joy to her family, I'm sure she would be able to gain their acceptance of her choice if she does decide to end it all. Also, this may be very selfish on our behalf, as we expect the elderly to suffer and dislike their existence simply so we can benefit from their knowledge.\" The thing is, she goes through a few weeks feeling suicidal, but then recovers and lives life happily for a few months. If we acted upon her cognitively-doubtful decision when she was depressed then she would be deprived of all the happiness she gets when not under the influence of mental illness. Ultimately, euthanasia is far too big a choice to be assumed to be rationally made by people who are mentally sick. \"Also, judging by how The Netherlands have legalised euthanasia, the elderly wouldn't be able to end it all simply because they're old. There would need to be a lot more going on.\" Yes, they wouldn't be able to end their life simply due to old age, but the vast majority of old people have some ailment or another that could be exploited to justify them seeking to end their life out of martyrdom. \"As you can see in The Netherlands, euthanasia is legal and regulated, with several heavy requirements to follow through [1]. The point that stands out for me is #5 - There must be no other reasonable solutions to the problem. This implies that if a \"cure\" is available, or if it is possible to continue medical research and procedures on the subject, the chance of being accepted for euthanizing is significantly lower. I'm sure we would see similar laws if euthanasia is legalised in North America.\" Theoretically the law works satisfactorily, but evidence would suggest that the Netherlands is sliding down a slippery slope towards more liberal euthanasia laws. (2) This source suggests that we cannot ring-fence voluntary euthanasia killings without overflows into non-voluntary euthanasia. The simple fact is that doctors are only human; giving them the extraordinary power to grant others life and death does not make them into responsible moral agents. Doctors are physicians not ethicists and cannot be relied upon to relate to suicidal people's wishes and inclinations because they simply aren\"t trained for it. This is why in the Netherlands doctors are increasingly being persuaded by relatives and patients to bend the rules or even outright break them, because doctors aren\"t professionally endowed to judge non-medical issues. Continuing on the subject of doctors, to ask them to kill patients is to violate the Hippocratic Oath, the vow that maintains the integrity of their whole profession. When people train to be doctors they say that they want to save lives, not destroy them. (1) http://www.mercatornet.com... (2)http://www.bioethics.org.au...",

            "discussionTitle": "Euthanasia should be Illegal",
            "conclusion": "Euthanasia should be Illegal",
            "premise": "Euthanasia should be illegal. Suicide is wrong. So why are we accepting it? Euthanasia: A legal way to commit suicide. Lets look at 5 main reasons why euthanasia should be Illegal: 1. Euthanasia is murder:Euthanasia, which comes from the Greek word eu thanatos meaning good or dignified death, is the conscious act of ending a life by withholding necessary treatment (passive euthanasia) or performing a procedure that directly and quickly causes death (active euthanasia). Although viewed by some as beneficial, both active and passive euthanasia are considered immoral, sinful, and in the same category as abortion \" a murder. Murder is the act of intentionally taking the life of one person. Opponents of euthanasia, especially Catholics, believe that the practice is wrong because it is murder. Since God is the One who created us, He is also the only One who has the right to take our lives away. In fact, the sixth of the Ten Commandments states \"Thou shall not kill.\" Therefore, any form of killing \" regardless of motives \" is not permissible. The so-called mercy killing or assisted killing is condemned by the Church. Just recently, a Vatican official criticized the death of Brittany Maynard, a cancer sufferer who took her life in November 2014 by assisted suicide. Maynard suffered from a brain tumor and decided to die when her pain became unbearable. Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said in an interview that \"This woman took her own life thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error\" Suicide is not a good thing, it is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission In the world and towards those around us.\" 2. Euthanasia Gives Too Much Power To Doctors To Kill: Doctors are empowered by euthanasia. It gives them the opportunity to play God and most doctors, since many now more regard their profession as an occupation and not a passion, will seize this opportunity. This is especially true for those unscrupulous individuals.Many of us are unaware that a lot of doctors today are taking self-interested shortcuts in order to earn more or make things happen their way. For instance, in case of delivering babies; some doctors coerce their patients in unnecessary caesarian sections on weekdays in order to guarantee an interrupted weekend for themselves. In other medical case, some doctors pressure their patients to undergo a surgery right away in order to finally get rid of the patients. Some do even push their patients to go towards vaccination or take a certain medication, even if it\"s unnecessary, just to make more money. Why, then, would they never be tempted to kill someone in the quickest way if it will benefit themselves in the end \" like avoiding the troublesome case or eliminating the hassle of dealing with importunate family members?A perfect example of this would be Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a controversial pathologist, who took advantage of his patients\" agony and murdered them. According to reports, his goals were to popularize assisted suicide, to harvest organs for transplantation, and the most appalling of all, to experiment the sick and injured patients. Kevorkian claimed that he had helped 130 ailing people end their lives. Imagine? But what\"s worse about it was that he created a machine for suicide, which was called a \"suicide machine,\" that allowed sick people dispense a lethal dose of medication to themselves by pressing a button. Later, the lunatic was convicted for second-degree murder, but unfortunately, he was not the only one who practiced this. In Netherlands, where euthanasia is allowed, thousands of people are killed each year \"without request or consent.\"Doctors, like any other humans, are lazy, selfish, and weak to temptations. In pressing situations, doctors are likely to commit mistakes and make wrong decisions. Therefore, euthanasia should not be legalized. As Dr. Peter Saunders, a general surgeon and CEO of Christian Medical Fellowship, has written: \"Voluntary euthanasia makes the doctor the most dangerous (person) in the state.\" 3. Legalization Of Euthanasia Changes Public Conscience: The law is a powerful tool that can be used to change our beliefs, behavior, and conscience. When a practice becomes legal and widely accepted, it becomes right in the eyes of the society. Even if it is against our personal preference and principle, we eventually practice it and believe that it is perfectly okay. People trust the law because they believe that it is the best for the people \" they believe that the law is always right. One case that demonstrates how law can affect the culture and public conscience was the assisted killing of the twin brothers, Marc and Eddy Verbessem. The two were born deaf and sought euthanasia after discovering that they would also soon go blind from another congenital disorder \" a form of glaucoma. According to the Daily Telegraph, their local hospital had refused to carry out the procedure because the twin was neither suffering extreme physical pain nor terminally ill. Euthanasia is legal under Belgian law if a patient is able to make their wishes clear and suffering unbearable pain, based on a doctor\"s judgment. Critics point out that the twin brothers were not suffering unbearable pain, but Professor Wim Distelmans, a right-to-die activist, took the decision to euthanize them. He even defended his decision and said, \"There was certainly unbearable psychological suffering for them. Though there is of course it always possible to stretch the interpretation of that. One doctor will evaluate differently than the other.\" Dr. David Dufour, the doctor who presided over the euthanasia even said, \"\"It was a relief to see the end of their suffering.\" Then just days after the Verbessem brothers were killed by their doctor, Belgium\"s ruling Socialists tabled a new legal amendment that will allow children and people suffering from dementia to seek permission to die.This just shows that once the society started to see that killing is okay, it is possible for people to do it without feeling any guilt. 4.Euthanasia Encourages Vulnerable People To End Their Lives: Euthanasia advocates promote the legalization of euthanasia as they believe that it is a way to protect \"vulnerable people\" from wrongful death and provide suffering patients their desired, peaceful \"death with dignity.\" Opponents of the practice counter this with the defense that legalization of euthanasia doesn\"t protect vulnerable people, rather it pressures them to make decisions unilaterally.If euthanasia is available, sick and dependent people will be pressured to choose death, rather than suffer and become a burden to their families. Yes, people who are dependent and ill often feel worthless and burden to their families. Since their body is so weak to work, they are not able to help and contribute to their families and communities. This makes them often feel worthless and useless. And this is the very reason why so many suffering people wish to die. But luckily, euthanasia is not yet permitted in most parts of the country and other parts of the world. But if it\"s already available, no one can already stop these people from requesting assisted death. Patients and people with disabilities and problems will think that euthanasia is the only solution. 5. People Who Request Mercy Killing Don\"t Actually Want To Die: In tough moments, especially in the presence of death, patients are highly vulnerable. They lack the knowledge and strength to understand entirely their situation, which usually affects their decisions. Many people think that the main reason why patients seek for physician assisted death is because of the pain associated with the illness, but the truth is it\"s the fear of the unknown. They are terrified about the possible consequences of their illness, including the possibility of surviving without actually living and most of all, its impact to their families. In a survey conducted in Oregon, USA, 66 percent of people who requested euthanasia did so because they didn\"t want to be a burden.But it\"s also true that no one wants to die. Those people who say \"let me die,\" usually don\"t mean what they say, and in fact are thankful when their request is denied.The practice of euthanasia is an unwise and wrong choice. Sure, having an illness and being born with disability is tragic, but killing them is not the answer to their problem. What these people need is love and support from their friends, doctors, especially from their families. If these people will only see that we are caring for them and valuing their lives, they will be encouraged to continue life, no matter how painful it will get.Just look at Ludwig van Beethoven, Sudha Chandran, Tanny Grey-Thompson, and the famous Albert Einstein, as well as Sheryl Crow, Anne Romney, and Hugh Jackman \" all these people suffered from life-threatening diseases and disabilities, but they still have contributed to the society and never thought about killing themselves. All these people encountered pain, but they never considered euthanasia as an answer \" because it is not! Unfortunately Euthanasia is used to murder people that just don't want to live. According to Amy Craft who works at CBS NEWS, on August 4,2015 at 6:39 pm stated. A woman named Gill Pharaoh, who was only 75 yrs old from Britain with no heath issues, decided to end her life at a Swiss euthinasia clinic on July 21 with her spouse who was 25 by her side, begging her not to carry on with this. According to Daily Mail, Her Partner John Southall said Pharaoh had talked with family and friends about someday ending her life. Her decision to die was based on a desire to not grow old. Conclusion: Euthanasia is a hidden way to commit suicide. Do not let it deceive you. Murder is wrong. Young people are starting to commit this suicide. Good people are dying because of Euthanasia.",

            "conclusion": "It is vital that a doctor's role not be confused",
            "premise": "At the moment, doctors are often put into an impossible position. A good doctor will form close bonds with their patients, and will want to give them the best quality of life they can; however, when a patient has lost or is losing their ability to live with dignity and expresses a strong desire to die, they are legally unable to help. To say that modern medicine can totally eradicate pain is a tragic over-simplification of suffering. While physical pain may be alleviated, the emotional pain of a slow and lingering death, of the loss of the ability to live a meaningful life, can be horrific. A doctor\u2019s duty is to address his or her patient\u2019s suffering, be it physical or emotional. As a result, doctors will in fact already help their patients to die \u2013 although it is not legal, assisted suicide does take place. Opinion polls suggest that fifteen percent of physicians already practise it on justifiable occasions. Numerous opinion polls indicate that half the the medical profession would like to see it made law.[1]\u00a0It would be far better to recognise this, and bring the process into the open, where it can be regulated. True abuses of the doctor-patient relationship, and incidents of involuntary euthanasia, would then be far easier to limit. The current medical system allows doctors the right to with-hold treatment for patients. Though, this can be considered to be a more damaging practise than allowing assisted suicide.

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia Should Be Legal.",
            "premise": "Euthanasia is legal in Texas, Oregon, and leaning towards legal in California. Gallup Poll shows that 80% of American agree Euthanasia should be legal (http://en.wikipedia.org...). So Technically Euthanasia is MOSTLY illegal but not completely. However, Euthanasia should be illegal because no law can be made that is perfect enough to ensure no abuses of Euthanasia will exist. 1. Many scenarios can occur where the ill can ultimately be manipulated by family, friends, or outside third parties to ask for Euthanasia. Not to mention that doctors would be receiving money for their work in Euthanasia. Money corrupts people and many scenarios can occur where greed leads to the murder of a human being disguised as Euthanasia. Legalization of Euthanasia would be permissible if all Men had integrity, honor, and compassion for one another. Then their would be absolute guarantee that abuses in the system would not exist. Unfortunately greed, malice, and selfishness do exist in our society. These flaws of man make it impossible for a system of assisted suicide to work flawlessly, and no law can be crafted that can produce a system absent of these flaws. Once you realize the reality of flawed human character and understand how that will breed abuses in the system it becomes a matter of how much we value Human life as a society. 2. You must trust the Government. Many do not trust government and for good reason. Politicians accept money from lobbyists and and create law to benefit those interests. This is a legal practice in Washington. They have written law in a way that is counter-productive to the legislation process. So can the congress pass law that will be counter-productive or corrupt in the case of Euthanasia. Once passed into law, Euthanasia can transform through amendments and interpretation. So years into the future a government can turn Euthanasia into a way of control or manipulation against its people. Like the Bush administration who redefined \"Torture\" as \"Pressure\" and we now have soldiers who water board detainees, force them into stress positions, or sexually humiliate and degrade them. By enacting legislation giving the power to kill in a society of flawed men is very dangerous and risky.",

            "conclusion": "Euthanasia should be legal",
            "premise": "To respond to your acceptance message, I do agree that it would be regulated, however I think it would be naive to assume that this regulation would be without loopholes or insusceptible to a slippery slope. My arguments are mainly sociological, and that legalisation of euthanasia would be detrimental to society. If we allow euthanasia to be legalised, we state as a society that life only has extrinsic, not intrinsic value. What I mean by this is that euthanasia legalisation makes a statement that life is only good insofar as we have use for it or if it benefits society, as opposed to the morally preferable state of valuing life intrinsically; it is good in itself and we should value it even if the owner is ill, elderly or a burden on society. According to most ethical theories it is beneficial to society to value life intrinsically, not extrinsically and so euthanasia is a negative step on the path to an Utopian society. My second point is that euthanasia is simply unnecessary. Pain relief is so advanced nowadays that pain can be relieved without resorting to killing. Why legalise something detrimental to society when it is unneeded? Furthermore, legalising euthanasia is not productive to modern medical progress. If it becomes commonplace for people to commit suicide when suffering from a particular disease then what motivation is there to find a cure for it? Finally, people's moral compass is very much influenced by law. For example, if tax evasion was to be legalised then people would feel less morally guilty for doing it. Therefore, if we legalise euthanasia then suicide will not be considered as immoral as it is now. The terrible consequence of this would be that suicide is seen as an acceptable potential solution to hardship, and therefore more people at the depths of depression will commit suicide. People also have an inclination for martyrdom; the sacrificing of one's life for the benefit of others. With no legal prevention of this, elderly people will feel expected, pressurised or simply altruistically inclined to seek euthanasia when they can. People hate being a burden and so will often opt to 'go quietly' instead of relying on their state or family. This would be a tragic waste of the value and wisdom that the elderly can give to the young. I personally know an old lady who often drifts into suicidal thoughts and, given the legal allowance, would not hesitate to be euthanised when she feels this way. However, she can also be very happy with her family and friends at times, and all this would be snuffed out by euthanasia.",
