            "premise": "(OK so now this is the fourth and final debating round, first of all good luck to my opponent, you have done really well and your information has been really well researched. :) Now I will move away from the whole 'cancer and tumour' subheading as we have discussed that a bit too much. In my fourth and last point I will be talking about additional health risks (no, not cancer) cell phone radiation causes the body in both genders. These are sleep quality, baby development and pacemaker functioning. I will start by explaining how it affects sleep quality. It doesn't just harm your eyes from the powerful light phones emit but can also cause insomnia, headaches and confusion. The radiation may also disrupt production of the hormone melatonin, which controls your body\"s internal rhythms. Baby Development: How it is affected. The national public awareness campaign, called the BabySafe Project, is being coordinated by Grassroots Environmental Education and Environmental Health Trust, and is based on independent scientific research linking exposure to wireless radiation from cell phones during pregnancy to neurological and behavioral problems in offspring that resemble Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. Finally, how cell phone radiation affects pacemakers. For those of you who don't know what a pacemaker is, it is a small machine that helps people with heart conditions like irregular heartbeat and heart block. A pacemaker is a device that gives off electrical impulses to your heart. These make your heart beat more regularly. It consists of a battery, a tiny computer and a generator in a thin metal box, along with wires that connect the pacemaker to your heart. Now for a cell phone's radiation to affect this is a gigantic danger to the person. If it makes the pacemaker suddenly stop working by the cell phone's radiation interfering with the pacemaker's signal it can have even fatal results. The ways they interfere are; -Stopping the pacemaker from delivering the stimulating pulses that regulate the heart's rhythm -Causing the pacemaker to deliver the pulses irregularly -Causing the pacemaker to ignore the heart's own rhythm and deliver pulses at a fixed rate Like I said, this can have even FATAL impacts on the user. So now after all the reasons I have given about how cell phone radiation affects humans, you must be on my side by believing that cell phone radiation is not good for humans. My reasons were, that cell phone radiation can have an impact on brain cancer and tumours, it affects baby development, it affects sleep quality and interferes with pacemakers. These are my reasons why I STRONGLY believe that cell phone radiation is a big NO. Thank you :)",

            "premise": "Yes, scientists might say that the radio frequency the user receives is not enough to cause any harm to them, but the average person uses their mobile phone for more than 5 hours per day. Think about how much radio frequency your body absorbs during those 5 hours! But it's not just that, majority of people sleep with their phones on their nightstand, turned on and receiving wifi, those are another minimum 7 hours of your body receiving more radio frequency plus carrying it around in your purse or pocket all day. Basically you could be with your phone for the whole 24 hours of a day. I derived this information from a reliable website. Even if you don't use a cell phone for hours each day, research by leading brain imaging researcher Nora D. Volkow, MD of the National Institutes of Health, revealed that after just 50 minutes of cell phone exposure, the emitted radiation increases brain cell activity in the region closest to the cell phone antenna. From: https://articles.mercola.com... We keep on hearing that cell phone radiation has NOTHING to do with brain tumours, cancers, etc. but people think and say this because the damage from cell phone exposure can take many years to surface. There are rarely any initial symptoms, taking for example smoking causing lung cancer, it takes about three to six months for most lung cancers to double their size. Therefore, it could take several years for a typical lung cancer to reach a size at which it could be diagnosed on a chest X-ray. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there.",

The amounts are so small, no effects really is going to be done. I recieved this from an official website. \"The only consistently recognized biological effect of radiofrequency energy is heating. The ability of microwave ovens to heat food is one example of this effect of radiofrequency energy. Radiofrequency exposure from cell phone use does cause heating to the area of the body where a cell phone or other device is held (ear, head, etc.). However, it is not sufficient to measurably increase body temperature, and there are no other clearly established effects on the body from radiofrequency energy. It has been suggested that radiofrequency energy might affect glucose metabolism, but two small studies that examined brain glucose metabolism after use of a cell phone showed inconsistent results. Whereas one study showed increased glucose metabolism in the region of the brain close to the antenna compared with tissues on the opposite side of the brain (2), the other study (3) found reduced glucose metabolism on the side of the brain where the phone was used. Another study investigated whether exposure to the radiofrequency energy from cell phones affects the flow of blood in the brain and found no evidence of such an effect (4). The authors of these studies noted that the results are preliminary and that possible health outcomes from changes in glucose metabolism are still unknown. Such inconsistent findings are not uncommon in experimental studies of the biological effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (5). Some contributing factors include assumptions used to estimate doses, failure to consider temperature effects, and lack of blinding of investigators to exposure status.\" Source: https://www.cancer.gov...",

Your site is something I never heard of, and here is another site mentioning the study conducted, and why it isn't conclusive: \"A recent small study in people has shown that cell phones may also have some other effects on the brain, although it\"s not clear if they\"re harmful. The study found that when people had an active cell phone held up to their ear for 50 minutes, brain tissues on the same side of the head as the phone used more glucose than did tissues on the other side of the brain. Glucose is a sugar that normally serves as the brain\"s fuel. Glucose use goes up in certain parts of the brain when it is in use, such as when we are thinking, speaking, or moving. The possible health effect, if any, from the increase in glucose use from cell phone energy is unknown.\" https://www.cancer.org...

Another study found an association between cellphones and cancer of the salivary glands. However, only a small number of study participants had malignant tumors. Another study suggested a possible increased risk of glioma \" a specific type of brain tumor \" for the heaviest cellphone users, but no increase in brain tumor risk overall.\" https://www.mayoclinic.org... It is also a \".org\" Bring me more than an article. When official sites call out that study made and why it's not conclusive, your argument then becomes not conclusive.",

            "premise": "1. When I said they reinvented the phone I meant the smart phone. At the time the BlackBerry was just used by people in business adding these features made getting a smart phone more common and more likable by people who were either younger or people who weren't in business. The iPhone also had more options then just Snake. 2. Still even if the iPhone isn't outselling them all together they still outsell them alone. Also the fact that one phone was outselling all of these large phone companies at once is impressive as well. 3. I am used to people saying \"oh Apple made a smart watch what a copy of the Samsung watch.\" So I would just like to point out that Samsung isn't perfect either and they aren't completely original. Plus Apple also has a completely unique OS. 4. You didn't rebuke the fact that Android has a better market for having features that the iPhone has. Because they make many more phones than Apple makes it easier to find a phone with something that iPhones don't have. When I just listed those phones I was trying to make a point that many Android phones aren't waterproof and don't have removable batteries. 5. Androids are more buggy than iPhones. According to this cite (http://www.imore.com...) Apple has a higher priority for UI rendering which means that iPhones are less prone to lagging and the touch screen is more responsive compared to Androids. Even IOS 5 can run smoother than more recent Andriod OSs. Thanks for accepting this debate, this should be fun!",

            "premise": "1. I missed your point because all you said \"this picture should explain it,\" it was just a picture of snake. By the way that phone is neither android nor iPhone. \"What i meant by the snake game is that all of the features that are now in the phones where in the old ones also to some extend.\" (I think you meant extent which is the correct term.) Yep I remember browsing the internet with that phone. Oh wait.... He said reinvented not invented. They recreated the smartphone so it would be easier and more fun to use is that not correct? I said it reinvented SMARTPHONES go check. Apple tried to give the smartphone a new face, a phone that evryone could use. iPhones made it easier to get apps and games on smartphones first. It created the app store making it easy to find and download apps. 2. I say still because it is a fact that iPhones outsell Samsung, LG, and Motorola individually in the US. Thats a \"true fact.\" (http://www.cnbc.com...) Also according to this cite (http://bgr.com...) \"The note suggests that 50% of Apple\"s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers are coming from other brands, mostly Android. Of the previous Android owners who purchased a new iPhone, it appears most of them have ditched Samsung handsets in favor of the iPhone 6.\" Many Android users are switching brands now. Also \"according to Citi, the iPhone 6 is the No.1 phone in U.S. and China, which are obviously major smartphone markets for Apple, Google and Samsung. However, the phone has convinced just 20% of existing iPhone users to upgrade, suggesting 80% of buyers are new smartphone users or are converting from other platforms.\"(http://bgr.com...) 3. How did Apple and Samsung both get close to the same design if it takes so long to make one? And get the same colors? Based off of your thinking that it takes so long to change what the phone looks like then since the iPhone 6 came out earlier that leaves the possibility that Samsung saw the design ideas before it came out and \"borrowed\" some ideas. 4. You know why that's the case that Android is run on so many more phones? Because they make many more types of phones. Apple only made 2 this year and Android has many more than that. (couldn't find an exact number) IOS 8 did add many things and fix bugs. They fixed face time, added apple pay (where is android pay btw?) and added a new fitness app to go with at the time soon to come out apple watch. IOS 8 takes up 5gb plus the fact that they added 5 more apps with it makes up for it. On my 64gb iPhone I don't find it that annoying and I have barley even used up 20 gbs of data (including the update) after having the phone for 9 months. Also not all of the latest Android phones will be able to update to Lollipop, is that not correct? Oh and 3 phones that are waterproof? Wow so many. You can just buy a case and it will be waterproof. Problem solved. And it says that the deepest a s4/5 should go is 3 feet of pressure. With a Lifeproof case, which I have, you can go up to 12 feet. You can get a waterproof case for those phones too, but all I'm saying is that you can solve the problem. :D So you concede the fact that iPhones have a better UI? :) You didn't even talk about it. :) *Oh and your software on iPhone will always be up to date unlike Android where it varies. If you have an iPhone model that is less than 5 years old then you can update. (http://www.businessinsider.com...) And very few Android phones have as good as a camera as iPhones. (only the Note 4 and G4) (http://www.businessinsider.com...) They by far have the best fingerprint scanners. My friend with the S6 edge constantly complains about it. (http://www.businessinsider.com...) 5. This isn't a debate on the work conditions yes they are bad. But android must treat their well and pay them lots right? (implying you need proof that android treats their factory workers well) ;) I guess they can go work for Samsung and get cancer. (http://www.theguardian.com...) \"However, new investigations by CLW have revealed that the treatment of Samsung\"s Chinese factory workers is far from model. Indeed, the list of illegal and inhumane violations is long, including but not limited to well over 100 hours of forced overtime work per month, unpaid work, standing for 11 to 12 hours while working, underage workers, severe age and gender discrimination, abuse of student and labor dispatch workers, a lack of worker safety, and verbal and physical abuse.\" (http://www.chinalaborwatch.org...) They both treat their employees bad. So drop it and stop acting like Android is perfect. Ask the people with cancer about how they feel about the conditions. 6. Androids are more buggy than iPhones. According to this cite (http://www.imore.com......) Apple has a higher priority for UI rendering which means that iPhones are less prone to lagging and the touch screen is more responsive compared to Androids. Even IOS 5 can run smoother than more recent Andriod OSs. (just putting it again in case you didn't see it :D) 7.I would also like to add that the S6, S6 Edge, G4, and Note 4 all came out later in the year so they can see what Apple had put out so they can upgrade things like camera and the screen resolution so it could be better than the latest iPhone. Your turn ;)))))))))))))))))))))",

            "conclusion": "Cell phones in school",
            "premise": "Cell Phones Improve School Safety Supporters of cell phones in school contend that cell phones improve student safety by allowing students to contact authorities in the event of a school intrusion or medical emergency. Students with cell phones would also be able to contact their parents in an emergency to inform them that they are safe. In addition, schools can program emergency response systems to automatically call or text message students' cell phones with emergency information or instructions. This can reduce panic in an emergency and help schools keep students safe. Cell Phones Enhance Learning Cell phones, especially smart phones, can be used to enhance learning. Smart phones offer much of the functionality of a laptop, but are more portable and less expensive. For example, a class could download an interactive program and use it on their phones. Students doing lab work can take quick pictures with their cell phone rather than making a sketch. Students can also use their phones to record parts of a lecture, make a quick voice note or take a video of a science experiment. Stay Organized With Cell Phone Calendars Supporters of cell phones in schools also argue that students can also utilize the calendar function of the cell phone to stay organized. Rather than requiring a paper planner, students can simply input assignments and test dates into their phones. Convenient Communication With Cell Phones Cell phones offer a convenient way of communication, especially useful for students who have after-school activities. Rather than guessing what time practice will end or using a school phone, students can easily call or text their parents to let them know they need a ride or will be late. Parents and students also have an easy way to contact each other throughout the day if they need to send a message. Cell Phone Use in Schools Many schools struggle to develop policies for appropriate cell phone use. Cell phones have many beneficial uses, like helping students stay organized and keeping students safe, but they can also have negative impacts, including facilitating cheating on tests, texting during class and the spreading of rumors. As in business and social environments, there are always situations during which cell phone use is not appropriate. Parents considering whether to give their children cell phones should contact their child's school to learn the cell phone policies, including the punishments for inappropriate cell phone use during class. http://rebekahrichards.suite101.com... Pros of Cell Phones in School There are numerous positive outcomes that can emerge from permitting children and teens to bring their mobile phones into the classroom. Here are just a few that you should keep in mind the next time you enter a PTA meeting or other public debate. Instant Communication Although you hope that you will never have to do this, you sometimes need to get in contact with your school-aged child while they are in class. This could be because of a death in the family, an accident or other family emergency that may require his or her attention and/or attendance. By being able to call your child directly, you also help alleviate the workload off of the school's administrative team. This is particularly useful during recess and lunch hours when students aren't in classrooms anyways, and it may be more difficult to find your child. The problems with knowing where your children are after school could also be reduced if parents had the ability to call them (and vice versa). Text messages also make this easy (and discrete). Memory Aids Most cell phones have a camera these days, so children can use these to take pictures of things in class. This is great for science class, for example, where they may be exposed to certain creatures, plants and other things that they probably won't encounter anywhere else. This is much more effective that simply producing a quick sketch. Pictures are also useful for any sort of step-by-step process, so that they can later review the photos to better understand the procedure in metalwork, woodwork or other hands-on courses. Better still, give your child a camera phone with video capabilities! Voice Notes Sometimes, it takes too long to write down a note, so why not use the cell phone to record a quick voice note instead? Students may not always have immediate access to a notepad either, so using a cell phone to \"jot down\" important information is also useful. http://cellphones.lovetoknow.com... *** All in all these articles state that cell phones in school are good because they are there when there is an emergency. Cellphones are instant rather than going through the office or school phone to get ahold of a parent or 911. Cellphones are their to enhance many things such a memory and learning content. From a personal experience we had a bomb threat while i was in middle school, and children who had cellphones were able to call their parents or guardian to tell them they were safe and needed to be picked up from the school. Cellphones may be a distraction but there is always a time and place for them to be out and in use. *** Analise Bruno",

And now, on to my stand point. Kids should not have cell phones in school because they are a distraction in the classroom to the teacher and the entire class. If the phone where to go off during a lesson, the teacher would have to stop the lesson just to address the student. This takes away time learn from everyone. Cell phones should also be banned because they tempt kids to cheat. Most cell phones have Internet access as well as a calculator application or installment. this can be a way to find answers to tests and quizzes, which is the stuff they should have known in the first place. and third, cell phones keep students from learning as much as they could without it. The distraction of cell phones causes learning to be restricted. sure they can listen, but paying complete attention causes more learning. I look for to my opponents rebuttal.",

            "discussionTitle": "iPhones are a Scam",
            "conclusion": "iPhones are a Scam",
            "premise": "Thank you for accepting the debate! Your response was not too long and it was very thought out; you make a very convincing argument! I just want to clarify, I'm not calling the company a scam, I actually enjoy some of their products, though overpriced. I am referring to their business practices specifically with the iPhone as a scam, seeing as every year they release a phone with basically the same specifications. For example, in 2016 they released the iPhone 7 with a new processor (A10 Fusion) and took out the headphone jack (unacceptable) and in 2017 they released the iPhone 8 with same processor (A10 Fusion [unacceptable]). The only thing it seems Apple ever makes an effort to do is add 1 new feature that you missed out on with several Android phones they were competing with a few years ago. \"Works very well\" is a broad statement, seeing as the only thing an iPhone does, is be an iPhone. The iPhone 4 worked \"very well\" and every phone after it did, but they all did the same thing, nothing more. You would actually receive more power, features, something significant when a new Android phone came out but the iPhone would still only do the same thing: be an iPhone. Sometimes it seems they spend so much money on advertising that they can't afford any actual improvements, especially when the only advertisements you'll ever see for an iPhone are the fact that it's the new iPhone but don't describe any improvements in the commercial, or they advertise parts they didn't even make, i.e, the camera on the iPhone X (Sony). Where when you actually see an advertisement for LG or Samsung, you will see features, performance, and improvements, or if you reference a recent Samsung commercial, all they did is show every way (every year) the iPhone has been several steps behind and they have always had the features you wanted, but you stayed with an iPhone. Yes I did mention they are exploding regardless of the Samsung epidemic. Neither Samsung nor iPhone are the first cell phone to explode, I agree \"manufacturing problems exist\". The difference is when other companies (like Samsung) have an exploding phone, they compensate and recall, where Apple has done nothing except give you an affordable way to replace it, and continue selling it, regardless of the safety of the customer. This may not be a scam but it is unsafe and irresponsible. \"It\"s not how powerful the hardware is, it\"s how the software uses that power.\" I agree more than you know. However, the iPhone uses it's slightly-increased-yearly power to run the same software with very limited new features. The only features they will actually add are features specific to the phone so-as to make other users think they got the wrong phone because they don't know they have that feature. Truth is, you can download almost any feature on Play Store, for any Android phone, regardless of company. Most users don't know half the things their phone can do, because with Android, anything is possible. \"they can be optimised to work perfectly together.\" This is not my argument. For the older phones, they did make quality parts and the fact they were made specifically for the OS was very impressive, but when they made no effort to improve on these parts and did very minimal work on the software, it gets annoying at some point. Also, Android is optimized and customized by manufacturers to work in a certain way on all Android devices, depending on manufacturer. Not to say I'm biased, but I prefer the way the Android works on Samsung devices because Samsung has features specific to the manufacturer on their OS that I enjoy, such as Ultra Power Saving Mode, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Smart Switch. I may or may not be able to come up with a source proving they barely work properly for a year, this is not an opinion, but it is from personal experience. I've worked for AT&T and Sprint for a couple of years now. On both accounts, I received numerous calls from customers that were having problems with their Apple devices. On very rare occasion I would get calls from people having problems with their Samsung devices (which was literally always a phone with a cracked screen), but not many calls at all from people using phones from other manufacturers (unless it was to say they didn't like the layout and wanted the previous phone back). Also, I don't think it was a coincidence that every time there was a tremendous issue with Apple devices, i.e. the iPhone 6/6S/SE heating up, wearing faster, dying and melting, or the iPhone 7 having the LTE band break for no apparent reason, right after a major software update. Also, as I've been working at Sprint, I've been helping sales reps only, and due to Sprint's security policy, phones can only be activated by calling my department to activate. In my department, I, and my coworkers, get on average 15-25 calls a day from Apple stores. I can't recall ever getting a call to activate a new device or upgrade. I've had Sprint stores call to activate upgraded iPhones, but every call I get from Apple, (EVERY CALL) I am replacing a model with the same model (6 with 6, 6s with 6s, 7 with 7, etc. and most commonly with iPhone X and 8 Plus). The \"exploding\" remark I made was told to me by an actual Apple store employee. I also saw in the opinions section about iPhone vs Samsung or something like that there was a testimonial by someone that actually works at Apple tech support and vouches that the phones are made horribly and almost all employees avoid the brand. I touched on the \"components for their iPhones from different companies\" relating to \"scam\" in the third paragraph. Lastly, \"iPhones just work so well on their own and with other Apple products\". I just want to say, the way that iPhones work well with other apple devices is synonymous with Android devices. Though I'm not sure whom did what first, I do know that I can have a Samsung phone, an ASUS tablet, and an LG watch and have all of my texts, calendars, e-mails, and applications working together in perfect harmony regardless of their manufacturer, because that's what Android was made to do. I'd also like to say I have an Amazon Echo myself, and enjoy it, but Google Assistant (and Duplex) are about to be the most top-of-the-line AI out there. Can you believe they got it to make intelligent phone calls for you?",

I need one because my school never lets students back into the building after they leave and my dad is prone to falling asleep before picking me up and I'm not allowed to walk home. And I would ask someone to use their phone but they always lie and say they don't have minutes but walk away texting someone. I think teens should have cell phones. I would rather have a phone with a QWERTY keyboard though...I can type fast on a computer keyboard so it'd be nice cause on the old phone keyboards with 1abc 2def..etc i can't text more than 3 words a minute.

            "conclusion": "should kids in jr high school have cell phones",
            "premise": "I will be arguing that kids in junior high school should not have cell phones.Unfortunately this is only a one-round debate, so my contentions will go unrefuted, whereas I will have time to address and rebut my opponent's arguments.He first claims that \"If junior high kids did not have cell phones it would not be very fun for the students.\"This is an interesting jump for kids to students, as not all students are kids and not all kids are students -- I think it would be fascinating to find a non-kid as a student in junior high school, but I digress.First, my opponent appears to be suggesting that \"it\" isn't fun for students without cell phones. What is \"it\"? School? If it's school, then the obvious response is that (1) school is not intended to be fun; it's intended as a place to hone young minds and equip them with the tools they need to grow and flourish into responsible, intelligent adults (2) why would you want to use a cell phone in school, where students are already prone to distraction? It would merely enable students to hold background conversations while they should be listening to their teachers and allow them to, if they so choose, cheat and (3) does not contribute to their learning in any way -- if it did contribute, Pro has not provided us with how it does, so we must assume that it dos not.There's also the point that \"fun\" is subjective and some students may find school fun, any way, simply because they love to learn. I happened to be one of these kids, actually.If Pro is simply making a general statement that having cell phones is fun, then the same basic reasoning applies: (1) fun is subjective (2) fun is not an argument unto itself; just because something is fun doesn't mean you should do it. For instance, toilet-papering a house is fun, but that doesn't mean that I should do it (3) it is possible to have fun without a cell phone (4) you can't exactly miss what you have never been exposed to, so saying that \"it would not be fun\" is simply unfounded (5) the negative ramifications -- cheating, distractions, etc. -- outweigh the benefits. Pro then claims that cell phones would be useful tools, but gives us only one example: communication. First, to communicate with whom? Their friends while they are still in class? I've demonstrated why this is potentially dangerous.How about with their parents? This is ostensibly plausible, but not only is there not a need for it -- in junior high school, many students either take the bus home, carpool with their friends, or have their parents pick them up, anyway -- but the negative ramifications, again, outweigh the benefits. Communication during the school day merely invites problems, especially when we're discussing junior high school students, who are by definition young and immature.Now that I have refuted my opponent's contentions, I will offer my own:1. Junior High Students are Young and ImmatureThis merely goes without saying, and people can look back to their junior high days when they were about 11, 12, or 13 and consider what they did when they were in school. This is a matter of trusting these children with a device that is potentially dangerous and could potentially cost their parents quite a pretty penny.2. Monetary Cost-Benefit AnalysisCell phone bills are VERY expensive. While it could be \"fun\" to have a cell phone -- again, fun is subjective -- there is no evidence whatsoever that it is NECESSARY. Young children do not need a fun for communication or for any other reason because they are still minors and their parents still provide for them, so this is simply a waste of money for their parents, many of whom are already struggling amid this economy.This also gets to the point about maturity. Some phone plans -- mine, for instance, because I'm a poor PhD student who effectively lives in the Stone Age -- charge per text. Therefore, the kids are left either without texting, which takes the \"fun\" out of it, or because they're immature and disobedient to authority, they opt to text anyway even if their parents asked them not to, and cost their parents quite a lot of money. 3. Cell Phones are DangerousLet's ignore for a minute the cancer risks from cell phone radiation and so forth. Using a cell phone is effectively using an unbelievable tool whereby you can contact anyone in the world at any point in time. At the same time, people can contact you, can add your number to lists, can attempt to steal your identity, etc. Can we trust young children with that kind of responsibility? Pro has provided us with no reason why we should.ConclusionI have negated the resolution.Please Vote Con.",

So from these websites we can confirm a fact that they are bad for children.The mobiles not only emit radiation during calls.A large amount of radiation is also emitted during the other activities by these cell phones.Children usually gets addicted to these and so the effect of these mobile phones in the children is maximum.

Causes cancer * Cellular telephones emit radiofrequency (RF) energy (radio waves), which is a form of radiation that is under investigation for its effects on the human body (1). * Cellular telephone technology emerged in Europe in the 1980s but did not come into widespread use in the United States until the 1990s. The technology is rapidly changing, so there are few long-term studies of the effects of RF energy from cellular telephones on the human body (1). * The number of cellular telephone users has increased rapidly. As of December 2008, there were more than 270 million subscribers to cellular telephone service in the United States, according to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association. This is an increase from 110 million users in 2000 and 208 million users in 2005. Because cell phones are held near the head when in use, therefore, in theory they may cause: Malignant (cancerous) brain tumors such as gliomas Non-cancerous tumors of the brain such as meningiomas Non-cancerous tumors of the nerve connecting the brain to the ear (acoustic neuromas) Non-cancerous tumors of the salivary glands",

            "premise": "Although my opponent has not posted his or her argument, I shall post mine. Cell phones should not be allowed in school for many reasons. I shall list each reason as a contention. Round 2 I will extend all arguments, and I hope my opponent will return. 1. Distraction There are countless amount of teachers who would strongly vote against cell phones in schools. They would say so because of the big distraction that it has in the studying environment. How can someone learn while watching his or her friends new instgram post? Not only teachers, but the student who is using his or her phone repeatedly, could be a distraction for the whole class. Let's say your in a math class, and you have a test tomorrow. You really need to catch up on everything so you excel on the test. Your doing your math, but oh wait! a bright white screen comes up from someones desk! Lets see what he's looking at! I dont' need to go on, but an obvious argument is that cellphones are a huge distraction for the school environment. 2. Addiction This may seem funny to some people, but those who frequently check their Facebook pages and other peoples, can easily get addicted to using his or her phone. When someone, after every free moment they have, turns their phone on and off to see if he or she got a new text, a repetitive tick forms, and grows into an addiction. That addiction could make people focus less on important things such as the persons' studies and his or her future. 3. Writing Habits Children who begin to use cell phones at an early age tend to have a less of an ability to write neatly. After texting, the student creates a habit of always typing instead of actually writing with a pen and paper, so the student will constantly be penalized for having bad hand writing. 4. Inequality and Profiling This may seem new to some people, but cell phones are commonly used to tell what kind of person someone is. For one thing, cell phones can be expensive. People may profile those without cell phones, as people who are poor and can't afford them. Those who have expensive phones are profiled as rich. This can lead to conflicts which would ruin the school environment. 5. Health People who use their phone commonly, tend to get sick more often because of radiation. Another thing, cyber bullying is increasing throughout the country. People are committing suicide because of cyber bullying. The problem with it is, people carry his or her phone with them everywhere. People are constantly getting mean texts, and they cant escape from it. Those who cant hide from their schools troubles will not have a good future. As you can see, cell phone use in school should not be present. I await my opponents arguments.",

            "premise": "At most schools they are NOT allowed.....and you cant say that ur three points still stand because I am debating this in the state of Tennessee and they are not ALLOWED in schools here... Cell phones in schools can be very useful at many times. They can be used for educational purposes such as: calculators, note taking and to contact a person who is sick or doesn't get the assignment off of the board. Also, it's been proven that children who listen to music while working can study and do work better. Most every cell phone is able to play music. For that reason, children can get work done with a better grade and they won't be talking as much to other students. Many times there are emergencies at school and if the power goes out, the phones there may not work. If there is an emergency how would students be able to contact your parents? They could just simply use cell phones to tell parents that they are ok or to ask to be picked up. If students forgot homework, or maybe a big project that was due today, students could just call a parent, or someone else, to come and drop it off. Also if there was a family emergency students wouldn't want the office to know first! Many students have sports practice, club meetings, etc. after school. If coach's call off practice how would parents know to come and pick their children up when the school closes? Maybe a student was absent last week and missed a test, they could just call their parents and tell them that they're going to test make up today. If a student was incited to a friends home, so they could just call his/her parents and ask for permission. Things like this happen every day, so it could be very useful. Having cell phones in school are very useful. They help students learn and be safe. Why ban them from schools for that reason? The fire alarm goes off, no phones work, call for help with a cell phone. There is no reason to ban them.",

They seem to be the only company with bad publicity in every way, including the iPhone 6. For example, the leaked celebrity nudes from iCloud and the the most recent iPhone Bend/6. I am pretty sure what happened with your dad and the iPhone 6 will happen again and again.

Android phones have more variety but variety doesn't mean quality. Quality determines which phone is better. The higher quality android phones don't have a much variety and only very few, if any, have better hardware than the newest iPhone. The iPhone is the best-selling smartphone of all time and reviewers regularly complement the user interface, features, simplicity, and speed of the iPhone vs. it's competitors including samsung. iPhone is the highest quality smartphone on the market given these qualities and innovative history.",

Cell phones also allow students to do more than text. Students can use cell phones for calendars, calculators, and even stopwatches. Also if you have a cell phone with music on it if we were allowed to listen to it then students might do better in school because music might help us focus. One of the biggest reasons why cell phones should be allowed in school is for safety utensils. Another good reason why cell phones should be allowed in school is so that students can take pictures of an assignment to remember to do it. What if one of your relatives get in a car accident or something and there trying to call you and you don\"t answer because you\"re in class the you feel guilty for the rest of your life.",

            "premise": "Thank you for your response. I\u2019ll just quote my opponent and respond. \u201cOk, so you say that cellphones can be used for east contact, well, schools do have phones for that purpose, so you can use those. You're asking for permission to use you're phone anyways, so why does it need to be done on a cellphone?\u201d The problem with phones that the school supplies is that there often aren\u2019t enough of them. Allowing students to have cell phones on them allows for a quicker way to contact their guardians that is also easier to do. In addition, cell phones are good to possess in that during a dire emergency students may not be able to reach office phones. \u201cScheduling and contacting can't be done without cellphones?\u201d No, what I am saying is that if there is a schedule change or anything of the sort then students will be able to contact their parents when otherwise they could not. \u201cTell me when peoples lives are saved when that cellphone comes in handy.\u201d It is not just school shootings. Cell phones are also useful during times where the ambulance must be called immediately because a student is in grave danger or in anything alike that. The fact remains that cell phones can save lives in dire emergencies, and the safety of students should be very highly regarded in any school. \u201cMost juveniles don't care if they get caught with their cellphone in class. They'll just start texting in class the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that.\u201d Punishing everyone because of the action of a few students is not fair. Anyways, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem because schools have the right to create rules where cell phones cannot be taken out during inappropriate times, and if they are the school has the right to punish the student accordingly. \u201cOk, so if said student has the phone sitting on their desk, what's the point if it being there? Why not just leave it in said students house?\u201d The student could still use in the case of a dire emergency and after school to be picked up, to call for a schedule change, ect. \u201cbecause the teachers would have phones, the main office would have like 5 phones, and said school would be near houses, so if their was an emergency which left teachers AND the main office deprived of their phones, the occupants in nearby houses would be able to contact authorities.\u201d Again, if the situation is grave where 911 needs to be called immediately then it is good for the students to have cell phones on them, especially f they are not any authorities or the office. In addition, the danger does not necessarily have to be very attention grabbing, like a school shooting, where people in the area would know what is going on. The fact is, there is nothing to lose when allowing students cell phones. They provide the benefits of schedule changes, calling parent guardians, contacting authorities ect. while providing a certain safety net for children. If cell phones are being used inappropriately the school has the right to implement strict rules regarding cell phone usage to deter inappropriate use.",

            "conclusion": "Android based Phones are greater than Iphones",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for starting this debate and look forward to a fact filled debate which has plagued smartphone users for years. Before going on to my own arguements, I'd like to address some arguments made by my opponent. \"First off its camera. I would like to blantly say that the Incredible has a 8 mega pixel camera while the IPhone has a 5 mega pixel camera.\" Yes, it is true that the iPhone 4 only has a 5 megapixel camera while the Incredible has an 8 megapixel [1][2]. However, there is a good reason for this and it's name is memory space. Frist, I would like to point out that the number of megapixels your camera is doesn't really effect the quality of the picture [4][5]. Infact, when people were presented with photos of 5, 8, and 13 megapixels, they could not tell the difference, even when the pictures were blown up to 16x24 (inches) and they were allowed to get as close as they wanted. But, one thing that the megapixels do effect, is how much space pictures (and movies) take up. An 8 megapixel photo will take up 60% more memory space than a 5 megapixel photo. And an 8 megapixel movie will take up 60% more memory than a 5 megapixel movie of the same length. All for no improvement of picture quality. So all in all, you are wasting memory space, for no observable improvement of quality. \"Secondly the processor. The Incredible has a 1GHz snapdragon processor, while the IPhone is clocked at around 800MHz.\" Both phones have the same speed processor [1][2], that is 1 MHz. My opponent states that iPhone is underclocked, and this is true. However, he neglects to inform the voters that the Android is ALSO UNDERCLOCKED [3]. In fact, most phones are underclocked in order to save battery life. By underclocking the processor, you can save upto 50% of the battery life. \"Thirdly the application store. We have all been to the Apple's app store and we all know that there are thousands of apps that are absolutely pointless...\" There are many pointless apps, true, but that is up to the consumer to decide. The Android version of the app store also is full of pointless apps, but that is part of a free market. Anyone can put forth their ideas and apps to see if the public wants them, and if no one does, no one is hurt by it being there (this is an obvious pander for the free marketists on this site, lol). \"Forth and last thing i'm discussing in this round is value.\" I would certainly hope that the Droid costs less, considering that it has less of what really matters, such as memory space, screen resolution, support staff and so on, which I will go into in my arguments. Now, for my arguments. The things that I would like to point out that my opponent seemed to have forgotten. 1) Battery Life 2) Screen resolution 3) Memory space 4) Customer service Let's begin 1) Battery life. Battery life has always been an issue with smart phones. We want them to be able to do so much (which requires a lot of energy for the device), yet we want them small enough to fit in our pockets without pulling our pants down from their weight. The iPhone 4 has about double the battery life of the Incredible [1][2]. 2) Screen resolution. The screen resolution matters with every non-phone aspect of a smart phone. From reading books, to watching videos, to playing games, to video calls, to whatever. The iPhone 4 is 960x640, while the Incredible is 800x480 [1][2] (and the iphone can do this while still having better battery life). 3) Memory space The iPhone comes base at 16 gigs, while the Incredible comes at 8 gigs. Both can go upto 32 gigs if you want to pay more for it. [1][2] 4) Customer service This is the biggie. No matter what phone you get, there will come a time when you need assistance with it and you have to call tech support. Apple has won the JD Powers award for best smart phone tech support for 5 years running now [6][7]. No other company can come close to providing such support for their smart phone products. Of course we have other things, like the iPhone 4 has better hearing aid compatability for those with hearing issues (H4/T4 vs H4/T3 for the Incredible) and other such little things. Anyway, I will pass the torch onto my opponent for their next round. Thank you [1] http://www.verizonwireless.com... [2] http://www.verizonwireless.com... [3] http://www.phonearena.com...

And no I've tried the add to screen list option; the calls still come but the phone doesn't ring and calls I 'do' want to receive are impeded. all you need is a phone number; some creeps even dial in random numbers and then wait and see who picks up. Cell phones are even more versatile than public payphones for those who change Sims often; so they don't worry about call tracing. This is why cellphones are central to crime and terrorism. Demo: Get disposable phone; insert disposable Sim Call anyone from anywhere.(fellow criminals, stalker target, person to blackmail etc) Give phone to complete stranger or throw it in a trash bin; from which any random person can pick it up.

            "premise": "Last year the Librarian of Congress warned that texting was responsible for a drastic decline in American sentences, but that opinion wasn't backed up by any scientific evidence. Now, a team of Australian psychologists has come a step closer to proving that mobile phones are destroying our ability to think. The researchers show that children who use mobile phones respond to higher-level cognitive tasks faster, but less accurately, than those who don't. 94% of Australians use cell phones, and the cognitive psychologists were testing for the negative effects of exposure to mobile phone radiation, especially among children, whose brains are still developing. In addition to fears that cell phones cause cancer, one earlier study found that school-age children who had been exposed to mobile phones as infants or in utero were almost twice as likely to be hyperactive or disruptive as those whose parents used land lines. The good news is that radio waves from mobile phones won't fry young brains or turn kids into delinquents. The bad news is, cell phones actually make children dumb (M. J. Abramson, G. P. Benke, C. Dimitriadis, I. O. Inyang, M. R. Sim, R. S. Wolfe, and R. J. Croft, \"Mobile telephone use is associated with changes in cognitive function in young adolescents\" Bioelectromagnetics 30.6 [early view, August, 2009]). Of the 317 seventh-graders who participated in the Australian study, 77% owned their own mobile phone and almost all the rest had used one. The children reported an average of eight calls and eight text messages a week, with heavy users logging as many as fifteen. Even though these figures seem low -- what 13-year-old would acknowledge receiving so few texts? -- those who used cell phones more responded to a battery of cognitive tests much faster, and much less accurately, than those who seldom called or texted, or those who didn't use mobiles at all. Specifically, the psychologists found that as mobile phone use increased, children learned to perform tasks more quickly, but their ability to remember things declined: \"The accuracy of working memory was poorer, reaction time for a simple learning task shorter, associative learning response time shorter and accuracy poorer.\" Findings were the same whether children called or texted, and since texting involves very little exposure to radiation, this suggests that it's the act of phoning, not the radiation, that accounts for decreased cognitive ability. The researchers went so far as to suggest that mobile phone use also correlates with impulsivity, and that cell phone utilities like 'predictive texting' actually condition children to favor speed over accuracy. (For other research on texting, click here and here; for the impact of texting on literature, click here; for its impact on politics, click here; for its impact on language development, click here). But reports that cell phones are destroying our brains are premature. Even the Australian researchers acknowledge that it might be unwise to depend on the accounts of thirteen year olds for accurate information about how many calls or texts they receive each week. Nor is it reasonable to conclude that mobile phones cause children to respond faster to assigned tasks (ever try to get a cell-phone-enabled thirteen year old to do their homework in a hurry?) or to make their answers less accurate (they can text perfectly without looking at the keyboard; can you?).",

This article overall shares the thoughts that teachers have on cell phones in the classroom: Cell phones should absolutely be banned from school, no questions asked. My philosophy is that we lived a hundred years without them and we can live another hundred years without them if we chose to do so. They are nothing but a disruption to class instruction. The student (if he or she is waiting for a call) thinks about nothing but receiving that call, therefore blocking out anything that is being said, and it's simply not a necessity for being successful in school. ERICH OSTROWSKI Fourth-grade Cell phones, like many other electronic devices, can be a distraction. Students need to learn when and where a cell phone can be appropriate. It is rude to the presenter when some person has a cell phone ringing during his or her presentation. Students are often easily distracted as it is, and a cell phone going off in a classroom can end the learning process as effectively as any fire drill. This is one of those life lessons we can teach them. Technology is a wonderful and useful tool when used properly. I can think of circumstances where a student needs to be on call during school. That is where the office and secretaries come in. KRISTOPHER KAUFMAN Spanish teacher, Northern Tioga School District, Pennsylvania As opposed to the two teachers above who believe cell phones should not be allowed in schools at all, Mindy Siddell brings up an good point. She believes cell phones should be allowed in schools for emergency purposes or after school activities, however, in the classroom there is no need for a cell phone to ever be used: Cell phones should be banned from classrooms but not from schools. When classes are in session, cell phones aren't. When a student is maneuvering around after-school activities and pick-up times, cell. phones are extremely handy. The school should not be held accountable if the cell phone is stolen. As with any other possession, it's the student's responsibility. If the student is too young to keep track of a cell phone, the student is too young to have one. MINDY SIDDELL student in teacher education, Seward, Nebraska -Olivia Piermarini",

            "premise": "Despite your atrocious spelling and grammar you are right, the iPhone is one of a kind. Like I said before, it's been one of a kind since the first iPhone. The difference between the iPhone and other phones is that every year a new one comes out and it's the same one of a kind phone you bought in 2004. The problem with that is if you've been loyal to apple since it's first release and bought the new one every year since on release, you've invested on average $500/year into a phone you already have. It may have a great \"user friendly\" interface, but since that's Apple user's only real argument nobody has ever taken the time to try the Android user interface simply because they already know how to use the iPhone and either afraid to try something knew or afraid to see how frail and dim-featured it actually is. The seamless organization of home screens, the option to circle them back at the end, home screen widgets (both built-in, and downloadable), and the fact you can even get launchers to make your phone an iPhone? Revolutionary. Android is the friendliest user interface ever made. All you have to do is set it up and customize it once and it works exactly how YOU want it, not just how it's made. I \"narrowingly\" focus on the hardware because it's LITERALLY what the phone is made of. You can't make a house out of straw or sticks and expect a wolf not to blow it down. If you make your house with bricks, it will stand for a very long time. This is something we learned in grade school. Most Android devices are using AT LEAST a Quad-Core processor. Samsung has been using an Octa-Core processor in mass production since the Galaxy S6. Even the cheaper budget Android device are out performing and out featuring iPhones for less than $200 (with the same easy-to-use user interface). When the \"brand as a whole\" has been swindling people for years into buying the same phone they already have, it's hard to see the appeal. When you \"create a following in the brand\" you start a movement that means something, when all it means is they are never going to make a new phone, and the following is based upon lies, its more like an extreme dictatorship; like North Korea. Also as you stated immediately after, all brands have made a following in the brand. Not just Apple, obviously. Brands that don't have a following don't have sales, so all brands have a following. You also didn't mention \"How?\" Apple created a movement or what it stands for. Additionally, \"how many giggs the thing has\" is a very bleak phrase. The storage in cell phones is measured in gigabytes, Android phones offer you more by giving you SD card capability, and people literally buy iPhones based on their storage (again obviously). You mentioned a second time people buy it for what it stands for but haven't explained what that is. Stating that I am \"looking from an outsiders perspective\" was horribly out of line. Sorry if I forgot to mention that I was an iPhone user first and have experience with them before beginning the argument, I began with the iPhone 3GS and I still today use an iPod 5 and iPad Mini because they are convenient off-hand devices, but the phones are a scam. I realized that ever since the iPhone 5. I don't know if they meant it that way before hand (because the 3GS and 4 were pretty great) but every phone after that was a scam. From personal experience, I work for Sprint. I help sales reps in stores complete transactions, and because of security policies the only way any retailer can activate a replacement device is by calling Sprint Sales Support. I receive on average 40 calls a day (out of 60 total) from Apple stores across America. at least 35 of those 40 calls are specifically replacing a device already active on the account (by that I mean they would usually have an 8, 8 Plus, or X, and are replacing with the same model), and with that in mind, I also work in a room full of people that work the same job and take calls with the same statistic. I, and more experienced agents that work above me, have never received a call from Samsung since I started working here, but the calls from Apple stores are becoming more and more abundant. One call I received, an agent literally told me he had to replace the SIM card as well because the device had exploded. If you actually look online you can find testimonials from Apple technical support workers that exclaim 90% of workers avoid apple products. Their department take back to back calls constantly because there is always something wrong with them. Lastly, your \"intuitive and convenient\" messaging is actually better with android as you get the exact same function, except it works on every device that you can open Google on, including Apple devices.

With students allowed to use their phones in school they all have the ability to call 911 at any moment, giving them a safety net as well as a reassurance. Cell phones also can help to spark conversation and ideas within the classroom. Most cell phones come with internet access nowadays and can be used to search topics for discussion as well as seeing other people's points of view on the matter. It also is a good research tool for studying as well as gaining new knowledge outside of the classroom. Cellphones also can be useful in the classroom with their full calendars that can be used to help keep track on schoolwork, school trips, and upcoming tests and quizzes. They come with a full calculator, and in some cases, come equipped with a full dictionary as well as converters of US and foreign currency. Picture and video capabilities could be used to make projects more exciting and can spark the creativity that a student can't find with simply researching and writing a paper. Education applications can help to study, while making learning fun. They can be downloaded for cheap, and sometimes even free. They cover every subject from reading to math and are accessible to every student with a smart phone. Finally being able to text brings things like poll websites into effect, making class participation easier for everyone and allowing even the shy students to answer questions without fear. It also can be used to take notes and can easily be sent to friends who were missing in class, or just shared for comparison and easy access to what each other has learned.",

            "conclusion": "Students should be allowed to use their cell phones in school",
            "premise": "Responding to my opponent's most recent arguments: 1. Cheating My opponent says that teachers can ban cell phones during tests. This is only possible if students are not allowed to use the tools on their cell phone. If students don't have another calculator other than their phone, how can teachers ban cell phones during tests? My opponent essentially agrees that it's necessary for students to purchase tools other than their phones, like dictionaries and calculators, if they want to use these during quizzes or tests. In addition, if my opponent agrees that teachers have the authority to ban cell phone use in their classrooms, how does this constitute cell phone use being \"allowed\" in schools. 90% of a student's day is spent inside a classroom. 2. Distraction My opponent says that students will \"get their fill\" while texting outside of class. My own experience denies this. When I was in high school, students would routinely get caught texting each other during class. While some \"good students\" would rather pay attention than miss a lesson, many \"bad students\" find class time boring and would rather socialize using their cell phones. Students who choose to text during class would be constantly distracted; they could also \"corrupt\" students who are trying to pay attention by texting them and trying to distract them with a conversation. This is particularly important for elementary school students, when most students still have the potential to learn skills and habits that will make them good students later in life. Younger children have much shorter attentions spans and would be even more prone to distraction by being allowed to use cell phones during class. If they are allowed to use cell phones at a young age, they will learn bad habits and be more prone to partial attention disorder later in life. 3. Safety My opponent says people could just fight outside school. My responses: 1) Students are less likely to fight outside school because fights are usually caused by heightened emotions as a result of close and forced proximity to someone who you don't like. Students are not forced to associate with people they don't like when they're outside of school; thus, fight are less likely to spontaneously occur. 2) Who cares? The cell phone ban policies are not designed to stop all fights. Cell phone bans in these schools are designed to protect the safety of other schoolchildren and the safety of school administrators who have to break up the fights. If a bunch of kids want to meet outside school property to fight, that's between them and the police. Tools: Encyclopedias The only free online encyclopedia is Wikipedia, and I don't think students should be citing this particular source for school projects. Voice recorders: Digital voice recorders are relatively inexpensive. A Sony model only costs $30. [1] Just like you have to buy a calculator if you want to use it in school (since you can't use your cell phone), you also need to buy a voice recorder if you want to record lectures. If you can afford a smart phone that is capable of recording a 45-minute lecture (has enough hard drive space), then you can afford a $30 digital voice recorder. Replacement: Laptops could also be allowed in schools where there is no internet access. Laptops would allow students to access tools, like encyclopedia programs, and digitally record their teacher's lectures, without the harms of distraction (since there is no internet access) and without the safety risks. Other need for cell phones: My opponent claims that students need cell phones to call their friends when they are sick. They can call their friends before or after school to socialize and ask what they missed in class. She also says that parents need to contact kids to remind them about doctors' appointments. Either a) the doctor's appointment is after school, in which case cell phone use is allowed or b) it is during school, in which case the parent must arrange beforehand with both the child and the school for an \"excused absence.\" Parents, as adults, should be responsible enough to remind their kids before school that they need to pick them up early for a doctor's appointment. The courts have also agreed with me that cell phone bans are legitimate. [2] Since cell phones are a MAJOR distraction and can jeopardize a school's safety, I strongly urge a negation of the resolution. [1] http://www.google.com...

            "premise": "Hello, class I am here today to talk about why cell phones should be allowed in school. One of the reasons cell phones should be allowed is because we have freedom of speech according to first amendment news 2011. Cell phones also allow students to do more than text. Students can use cell phones for calendars, calculators, and even stopwatches. Also if you have a cell phone with music on it if we were allowed to listen to it then students might do better in school because music might help us focus. One of the biggest reasons why cell phones should be allowed in school is for safety utensils. Another good reason why cell phones should be allowed in school is so that students can take pictures of an assignment to remember to do it. What if one of your relatives get in a car accident or something and there trying to call you and you don\"t answer because you\"re in class the you feel guilty for the rest of your life.",

            "premise": "I totally agree that children should not be given phones before the age of 14. Nowadays, there are companies which manufacture specially designed mobile phones targeted exclusively to the young children. There are cell phones for kids with pictures of cartoon characters in order to attract the attention of children and increase sales. Kids are a target audience for even mobile phones in today\"s age! When children by phones then it has adverse effects on them like: 1.Teachers in schools are complaining of increasing indiscipline in class ever since young children started bringing mobile phones to class. According to these teachers students who bring cell phones to school talk on the phone during class and send messages. They do not pay attention and play on their cell phones during class hours. They thus miss out on lessons being taught and fall behind the other students. Their entire concentration is on the mobile phone and not on their studies. The teachers say that students with mobile phones are uninterested in studies during class hours. Their attention is more on the mobile phone rather than on the blackboard. 2.According to some children who have a cell phone, it is a status symbol for them among the others. The more the phone is modern and stylish, the better because it increases prestige among friends and other schoolmates. Mobile phones have a major effect on children and can bring about undesirable changes in their lifestyle. These children become so obsessed with the phone. They are constantly checking messages, and do not do the important things that young children should do. Instead of spending time playing sports in the fresh air and engaging in other creative activities and hobbies, they spend most of their time on the phone. According to scientists, keeping in continuous contact with people can get addictive. 3.Studies recommend that mobile phones should only be given to children above fourteen years of age. Children below the age of fourteen should not be given mobile phones since their brain is too sensitive to withstand the effects of mobile radiation. Since the tissues in the brain and body are still developing, these radiations can cause cell damage. Due to absorption of radiation, children can have severe health issues. Although adults also get affected by these radiations it will be more severe in children because of increased absorption of these radiation levels. Experts also believe there is a link between childhood cancer and mobile phone usage among children. 4.There are high chances of misuse of the mobile phone, by children who have them. Children may send and receive vulgar messages and pictures. Children can have access to adult websites. 5.We live in a dangerous world where so many incidents of crime against children. Parents of children having mobile phones must take some steps to ensure safety of the child. Parents should warn and keep children aware of the various mobile phone crimes. Sometimes it is possible for a child to get stalked by strangers over the phone. Parents of young children who have a mobile phone must get a post-paid connection and check the cell phone bill when it arrives. I now wait for my opponent to respond and contradict my statements with specific reasons.",

            "premise": "You are just repeating what I you said when I showed how it doesn't matter. *If after school activities are cancelled, the school will provide a way to contact parents. *Teachers are adults, you are most certainly not. Saying that if they have them, you should have them is a faulty argument. \"That's like saying, teachers are allowed to play movies in class on the projector so we should be allowed to as well\" or \"Teachers don't do homework so we shouldn't have to either.\" That reasoning makes no sense. They are adults. If they make bad choices and get in enough trouble, they are fired. If you make bad choices, they really can't do anything to you but take your phone away. *I understand that cellphones can be helpful but the majority of kids would use it when they aren't supposed to. As it is, the average kid (highschooler) gets/sends 110 texts in class. *I can look up any word in the dictionary in about 10-20 seconds. On a phone, it takes just that long as you have to pull up the app then type it in. Maybe there is a 1-2 second difference. If you can't use it that well, you obviously aren't super good. When I was in highschool (yes almost everybody had phones including modern ones like iPhone 4S, etc) the kids who knew how to use a dictionary and normal calculator generally did better (generally) cause we were never distracted. Yes, we had phones but it wasn't worth it to use it. It is much more convenient to just have a calculator and dictionary. I don't care if your backpack is heavy. Suck it up. My senior year, I had 2 backpacks jammed with books I carried cause we didn't have lockers and I needed all the books for a single school day. *Your points about the teachers seeing the phone, why? If your phone is off, than it isn't going to help you anyway. You also stated in what we would be debating that in phones should be put away in class, \"I would go for phones being aloud in the hall, lunch, and study halls, but during class they have to be put away.\" You also then conceded that study halls should be phone free so you are breaking your own rules you set before hand. *If kids actually obeyed, they wouldn't have phones in school at all. They already text a lot during the passing periods, etc. There is no point in just helping further that cause. Yet again, lunch time, you can socialize on your own. You don't need phones. Go find a friend and sit with them. If you have friends outside of school, then what you will be texting won't be school related and you thus, shouldn't need to talk to them. Socialize with you friends in person, not on a phone. *As for your last point about them spending less time to try and hide them, that's not true. If you are texting during the halls, it could actually increase because you then get into conversations and it is \"so important\" to finish that you text throughout the class. Conclusion: Overall, I have shown how phones would not be good in school. I have cited a source helping my case whereas my opponent did not and I have refuted every point that he has made. Thank you for you time.",

            "conclusion": "Androids Are Better Than iPhones",
            "premise": "Yes, I can agree with my opponent that the Iphone is more advanced than the Android. However, according to statistics, with an android phone, you can acquire much more free applications and save money compared to apple. In 2011, 65.9% of android apps were free compared to the iPhone market having only 33.8% of their apps as free. http://android.appstorm.net... Also, iPhones free apps aren't even that great nor do they have much of a range or variety of decent apps. They limit you to the basics. Yes, I agree that for good quality apps, you should have to pay. However, on the Android market at least, they allow you to try a \"Lite\" version of an application before you purchase it. This allows the customers to check out the game before the spend money on the full app. Also, on an android, your allowed to buy an app and test it for some time (approx. 15 minutes) and go back and click to receive a full refund if you don't like the application. This feature is not on an iPhone. Another popular distinction between the androids and the iPhones are that iPhones need to be synced all the time. With an android, any changes you make via a computer will automatically change on your cell phone or tablet as well. However, for iPhones you always have to sync the device to the computer and enter your username and password for everything. One other flaw to iPhones is that, for the longest time, no one could share their music because of the way iTunes was set up. Nobody could share playlists or songs from their phones because the music was in iTunes. However, they updated a popular app that many people now use called Bump It in order to share music. However, with an android phone, we can share music without having an extra app. All this does is make things a step more difficult for the iPhone users. Finally, according to a NY Times article at the end of 2011, \"While Android was initially overshadowed by the popular iPhone from Apple, its user numbers are now soaring. In 2010, global sales of Android phones reached 67.2 million units, ahead of iPhones, which sold 46 million units, according to the research company Gartner.\" http://topics.nytimes.com... Therefore, in my defense, Android sales and popularity at one point were inferior to iPhones. However, they have shown to improve overall and triumph over them as of now.",

Therefore we must conclude that he agrees with me that nobody under 18 should own a cell phone or he has failed in his burden of proof. My opponent clearly did not examine my source. The National Cancer Institute is far more reliable than a YouTube video. However, I shall better explain it here. According to the NCI, cell phones emit \"radiofrequency energy, a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation\" [1] which, yes, may be absorbed by tissues near the ear. Now, ionizing radiation has been shown to increase the risk of cancer. Non-ionizing radiation, like phones, has not. Again, the NCI states that \"radiofrequency energy...does not cause DNA damage in cells\" and has not been found to \"cause cancer in animals\" or enhance cancer-causing effects [1]. Thus we cannot conclude cell phones cause cancer. PRO dropped my communication point; please extend it, and vote CON! [1] http://www.cancer.gov...",

But yeah i guess you've got a point in there. \"Mobile phones help children have an emergency way to contact people in cases of emergencies\" Kids usually use their mobile phones to prank and/or call 911 for weird and foolish reasons. One thing in special, \"swatting\" became trendy lately and consists of calling 911 to call a swat team to another child house to ruin the game session of said child. Makenna Sewell called 911 to kill a 2-inch spider, clearly not an emergency. 10-year-old Dan David called because he did not wanted to sleep, sounds like a emergency doesn't it? The list goes on and on. \"Mobile phones reduce kidnappings\" They may reduce kidnappings or may not reduce kidnappings im not sure, and can't really tell hence your lack of sources but cell phones do increase general crime and tragedy. Street road accidents because of children using the cellphone while walking on the street. Stealing of wealthy cellphones that if the children resists usually end in murder or violence. Identity thefts also. What about false kidnappings? In Spain some false kidnappers ask children their phone numbers, name and details before a movie and proceed to call their parents for money from their devices to simulate a kidnappings and ask for huge amounts of money, this problem has grown a lot lately not only in Spain but America as well. A point i will also encourage the voters to investigate (Im almost out of characters):http://alturl.com...

In the link that my opponent posted there was a phone that outscored the iPhone, and that phone was the Blackberry Bold 9700 [1]. ~ ///The iPhone is having a stellar year. First, it blasts past RIM's Blackberry in sales. Then it ousts Motorola's RAZR as the top-selling handset of all time. And, now a report from mobile phone warranty firm SquareTrade says that Apple's iPhone is the most reliable smartphone on the market, surpassing both Blackberrys and Palm Treos./// It may be true that the iPhone doesn't crash as much as its competitors, but if the voters would take a gander a bit lower in your cited article they would find some other information that doesn't paint the iPhone in such a good light: \"The study focused on handset malfunctions and not accidental damage caused by the consumer, though. And accidental damage is where the iPhone trips up. Due to its sleek, slippery design, the iPhone fails due to accidental bang-ups [>>>]33 percent[<<<] of the time. Twelve percent of iPhone owners reported accidental damage in comparison to the other two companies, which reported 9 percent. [2]\" ~ ///Apple recently released lists on iTunes of the Top 10 most downloaded paid and free iPhone apps of 2008/// That doesn't really mean anything, you can only get iTunes applications on Apple products. ~ Now for my counterargument: Contention 1 There are many things that you can't do on an iPhone because it is an Apple product, such as: * Use a phone carrier other than AT&T * Install unapproved 3rd party applications * Customize the iPhone's interface * Control what your iPhone does [3] ~ Contention 2 Apple is currently working on a software patten update for their products that will force its users to view un-skippable advertisements that require user interaction at the cost of locking up your product until you comply with the advertisement [4]. They also are able to, with the use of periodic software updates remotely disable your phone if you are not using it in a way that Apple wants you to [5]. ~ With that I conclude my rebuttals and arguments and await a response from my opponent.

            "premise": "Thanks to the pro, which has given her personal idea about the topic, although there were no reference and any other supporting point, therefore i would like to take rebuttals first, then i would post my supporting points as a con; Rebuttals: \"Quote\" \"I also think that they should be allowed because if there is an emergency you can contact parents or authorities. I was in school once and there was a fire and a kid called 911 and was able to get them there because our connection to the fire house was down. Because that kid was able to have his cell phone he was able to save us and our school from a fire.\" \"Unquote\" -Pro has mentioned only one example by which she supported the topic, that mobile phones should be allowed, which is somehow logical point, although only one example can not make the whole topic. Phones are the ease of contact but the parents can reach to their children through their advisory, school principle, but they can not destruct the class calling their child to talk to them. Mobile phones can totally destruct the class and it would decrease the interest of kids for studying. Mobile phones should be banned, because the disadvantages are more than advantages; 1. Mobile phones are destruction to the class. 2. Mobile phones are destructing the educational system. 3. Mobile Phones are used only for entertainment during school and this would decrease the interest of kids for studying. 4. Mobile phones are used to watch immoral videos/porn videos, and there hence the pornography would increase. 5. Mobile phones are used as cheating tools. Furthermore, giving more details about the mobile phones should be banned; i would like to give a live example; When i was studying in school, i met a friend who had a mobile phone which was the latest model, and sometimes he used to bring it in school, one day he was caught up at the end of the class while he was busy and he was not looking relaxed, the teacher got him and he was so afraid, the teacher asked him to explain why he brought the mobile in school, and if he brought, why did he bring it in the class, even though he brought in the class, why were he busy? our friend's face was turning red and he was not able to see to the eyes of the teacher. Suddenly the teacher asked him; what were you busy with? he was badly afraid and he didn't say the reality, and the teacher asked my other friends to search his mobile, and OMG it was shocking! because he was watching porn videos inside the class! and the boy was failed! Concluding my live example, i would say; mobile phones should be banned in school, because; a. It is misdirecting kids to bad ways of using it. b. It makes the kid far from studies. c. It disturb the class. d. It causes failure of the students. e. It destruct the educational system. Further i would like to mention one more thing; Mobile phones are more harmful in school than its advantages!",

            "premise": "Alright final round. I will conclude with the following. Pro, you have not been able to fully rebut my arguments, other than providing some smiles. [I'll give you one also at the end :)] The debate was revolved around whether or not iPhones are good phones. I have given reasons as to why iPhones are just like any other phone out there, the only difference being price and operating system \"name\". In essence they all do the same thing and at no point does one overtake the other in quality. These are all branded items meant mostly for entertainment. Since it is as such, there will always be different perspectives since everyone can be said to be \"entertained\" differently. I suppose the votes will show who had better conduct and evidences. Good luck and thank you for the debate. PS. I apologize for the spelling mistakes, hope they didn't confuse you too much.",

He called the ban stupid. Some parents would prefer a policy that lets students have cell phones but prohibits their use in classes. Students insist that most classmates use their cell phones responsibly, and they brush off criticism that previous generations got along fine without them. \"It's kind of ridiculous that we think we can't survive without a cell phone when people did it for thousands of years,\" said Elisa Muyl, 14, a freshman at Stuyvesant. \"But now that they have this invention, we should use it.\" Cell phones in schools http://www.cellutips.com... The Good Feeling of security \u2013 Knowing that your children are reachable anytime is quite reassuring for a parent, especially after events such as the Columbine shooting and the September 11th tragedy. It brings families together \u2013 Families don't seem to have much time to spend together anymore. With overtime and after-school activities, having the ability to communicate with any one of your family member helps bringing families together. Cellphones are convenient \u2013 Everybody is more busy nowadays. Students are involved in activities after school, and practices and meeting time tend to vary a lot. It is very convenient for a student who does not have access to public transportation to call their parents for a ride when they need one. Morgan Warner",

            "conclusion": "teen's should not have cell phones!!",
            "premise": "Accepted. I will argue that teens should indeed have cell phones, because of these reasons:1. Emergencies and safety. I believe this is the biggest reason. Teens must need cell phones so they can call the police if for example someone try to kill them or something. They will also need it if a accident happens, especially teens, because most teen begins driving. So a teen should have a cell phone for safety, if a accident happens, or for life threating emergencies. Just these 3 reasons alone is enough to any rational person to know that a teen should indeed have a cell phone. And also, some cell phone companies offer GPS tracking programs that can help parents know the teenager's location. This can be very helpful if the teenager has been lost or kidnapped. 2. No excuses. Teens should have cell phones because it will eliminate the excuse for not calling home when they are going to be late or to ask permission about something. If teens have cell phones, they can\u2019t use none of these excuses.3. Busy schedules. If teens have cell phones, the parents can call to let them know if they are running late or if there\u2019s been a change of plans etc. This is very important because of the fact that many families have such busy schedules these days. This basically becomes a important and very helpful issue for the parents.4. Communication with Friends. Its very important to a teenager to be social. Basically, having a cell phone allow teenagers to communicate with their friends regularly, and encourage them to take time to sustain and grow relationships with their friends.5. Responsibility. Giving a teen a cell phone teache teens responsibility. It also gives them a kind of independence. They are almost adults and they can't even have cell phones? Teens are almost adults and should therefore be ready to it. Giving your teen a cell phone is a perfect way to do so. He learns to take responsibility and becomes more ready for the adult life. just because your dad got his first phone when he has 40, it doesn't mean you have to follow his footsteps.6. Impact on teen lifeA majority (57%) of teens view their cell phone as the key to their social life. 80% say their cell phone provides a sense of security while on the go, confirming that the cell phone has become their mobile safety net when needing a ride (79%), getting important information (51%), or just helping out someone in trouble (35%). Second only to clothing, teens say, a person\u2019s cell phone tells the most about their social status or popularity, outranking jewelry, watches and shoes.ConclusionWe are living in the modern age, not in the stone age. Teens should indeed have cell phones for their own safety and for they own happiness. Thank you and I'm looking forward to your round.Sources The statistics showed at 'Impact on teen life', are from: http://www.marketingcharts.com...http://www.phoneservice.org...",

Same thing with cell phones Since you bought it you have the right to use it where ever you want just like that calculator. So since I showed this my opponents contention 3 does not matter. because it must be both a right and must be hindering the institutions. 1. in an emergency a cell phone used by a student would be quicker then the school calling. As you know there are a large number of students in a school. They can go everywhere. The faculty is a much smaller amount. So obvioulys if an emergency began to happen the students would know first. If they had their cell phone then they can call the authorities and have the problem dealt with.",

            "premise": "My opponent said himself that students will need much more advanced calculators that cell phones have to provide so students will be able to use those on their tests. However, I said that teachers can tell their class that they can't use their cell phones during quizzes/tests but I did not say that they can't use them in class. So therefore, students won't cheat but can still use the tools their phones have to provide for class assignments. As for the distractions, when you said that students always got caught texting, well, the same happens at my high school but then again, these high schools do not allow students to use their phones so unless you went to a high school where they allowed students to use their cell phones, you can't use that as an example because you don't have a personal experience with students being allowed to use their cell phones in school. My opponent says that fights are caused by heightened emotion. Well, when two students want to fight but can't then the hightened emotions won't just leave. They'll still have those emotions. I know two people that wanted to fight but couldn't so they met at a park to fight so you can't say that students are less likely to fight outside school. Also, if two students really want to fight and want to call some people to help them, not bei granted permission to use their phones at school isn't going to stop them from calling whoever they want to help them fight. especially if they're going to get in trouble anyways for fighting at school. As for laptops as a replacement, that isn't much better than a cell phone because kids can still email or use social networks which would be a distraction and having access to social networks and IM would still have safety risks. As for being able to contact their friends, if they contact their friends at their own time in school like lunch or passing time there's really no problem. Students should also be able to use their phones to contact their parents if they're sick. they can contact their parents first and while they're waiting for their parents, they can sign out at the office. Students shouldn't have to wait all that time when they're sick. They would have to wait after calling their parents then if there's a line for the phone they would have to wait for their turn to use the phone, as well.",

            "premise": "Firstly, it has been found by some studies that cell phone use does not have a statistically significant impact in the reduction of car wrecks.[1]\u00a0This might be plausible because being able to call ahead to work for example and tell them that you will be late reduces the chance that people will speed on the roads.\u00a0 It also reduces the chance that you will attempt to weave between traffic to increase your speed even where acceleration might not be possible. Further, given the societal benefits from cell phone use in cars, such as better organisation for the entire population, it seems that a ban on the use of cell phones should not be implemented because the cost of doing so is too great when compared to the benefits allowing phones would confer.[2] [1]\u00a0Paul Tetlock, Jason Burnett and Robert Hahn. \"Ban Cell Phones In Cars?\".

            "discussionTitle": "Teens should have cell phones",
            "conclusion": "Teens should have cell phones",
            "premise": "Hello, my name is Justin Graves. Background: I'm sixteen, can't drive, but I do own a phone. Though, I feel I could drop it down a storm drain and be perfectly fine.My position in this debate is that phones are not necessary. They can also be harmful. This is not coming from an \"overprotective parents\" point of view, but from a teens point of view. Therefore, ad hominem attacks in this debate should be near nill. OK, I'd like to present my argument before I rebuttal my opponent's contentions.1.SurvivalCell phones are not necessary for human health. Not physically. Not mentally. Not emotionally. Not socially. Teenagers have had plenty of fun and done just fine for a long time before cellphones. They are not necessary parts of a teenager's life.2. MoneyCell phones cost money. Period. First there is the cost of the phone. And then the cost of the actual wireless plans. The cheapest text and call wireless plan from AT&T costs $60 a month, or $720 a year. That's some good cash that could be spent elsewhere. Especially if it is not the teen's money. Even if it is, over the course of their teen years, that would be $4,320. Wow. That's like a full quarter of tuition costs for college down the tubes.3. Sir, can I use your phone please? If I needed to call my parents, I did two things. a) I asked a stranger for the use of his cellphone. Or b) I went into a local business and asked to use their phone. It worked rather well and built social skills. No personal cellular device required.4. The dangers of cellphone use.A. This comes from some personal experience: Teens texting=Saying things you think no one will ever know about=BAD! One time, a guy \"friend\" of mine started asking me to \"rate\" girls on a scale of one to ten based on their looks via text. I said no at first, but he started naming some off and I foolishly did as well. Turns out he not only told some of the girls what I said, he forwarded the texts to people. He specifically asked about my girlfriend. I gave her a high number, but, apparently, I gave one girl a number that was .1 higher. So, he took advantage of this and told her I thought another girl was better looking, but thought that she was the most beautiful girl in the world. Needless to say, that relationship ended recently, and guess who she choose next? Yep, my backstabbing friend.B. Here is another: Sexting. According to the FBI, 20% of teens have sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves to others. 1 in 6 have received such pictures. The consequences of this can be dire. There are cases of teen couples going to prison on the charge of possessing child pornography. It can and does happen. It is a danger.Those are my contentions. On to my opponents\"I need one because my school never lets students back into the building after they leave and my dad is prone to falling asleep before picking me up and I'm not allowed to walk home. And I would ask someone to use their phone but they always lie and say they don't have minutes but walk away texting someone.\"I cannot imagine that your school does not let students back in after they leave the building. And aren't there adults around SOMEWHERE? Even if all these facts are true, how about this solution: Go to the school office and call your dad BEFORE you leave the building?\"I think teens should have cell phones. I would rather have a phone with a QWERTY keyboard though...I can type fast on a computer keyboard so it'd be nice cause on the old phone keyboards with 1abc 2def..etc i can't text more than 3 words a minute.\"This contention makes about as much sense as Bill Clinton while he is drunk. Which is to say: None. I would like to draw the reader's attention to these quotes:\" I don't have my own phone and I never have.\" \"Okay overprotective parents, go ahead and tell me why teens shouldn't have cell phones.\"My opponent seems to have a serious personal issue with her parents. And authority in general if she is willing to bad mouth a parent who has yet to accept an argument whom she has never interacted with. This seems more about wanting a phone for social reasons than to contact parents (My opponent's need for a phone for calling her dad has nothing to do with how fast she needs to text.)Regardless, I have shown some real dangers that can come from teen cellphone use and I have shown why teen use of cellphones in not necessary. I await my opponent's response.Oh, this has nothing to do with who is right, but I feel it is needed to be said. For the voter, this has nothing to do with positions or arguments in the debate, but just one more thing for my opponent: I see that you claim to be a Christian. I would like you to read Ephesians 6:1-2a \"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother.\"If you don't feel like accepting not having a cellphone just because your parents say so and because the Bible says to obey your parents: Sources:http://www.fbi.gov...http://www.att.com...",

            "conclusion": "Cell Phones Should Be Allowed In School",
            "premise": "Now, let's see the cons of cell phones in school: 1.\"Rules are meant to be broken.\" ~ Anonymous http://www.answerbag.com... Many kids will bring their phones into class, even if there was a rule. Just like some schools say to pick up trash, but almost nobody does. This is considered rule-breaking, which could be similar to the cell phone at class argument. Furthermore, we have a nagging feeling on the back of our heads that has the urge to turn on a cell phone during class. Besides, some people take notes with their cell phone. However, if ASB shall bring this up, I will simply refute it with an argument: You have stated that cell phones cannot be shown in class, or bring it to school without using it in class. However, if you took notes with your cell phone, you might feel the punishment of theft. Moreover, most kids would like to show off their \"awesome\" phones: Blackberry Storm, LG Touch Pad Phones, IPhones, you name it. This \"show-off\" could lead to the kids without cell phones or with a \"boring\" cell phone feel bad or lonely, which could lead into arguments and students sitting in a corner with a few friends. 2.As so, kids could suffer from addiction outside of the classroom. However, the kids would love to just show off their phone or show a new application to everyone else: Angry Birds, I guess, or other applications. Games could be played in class, while some phones are taken away by the teacher for using it in class, which could lead to a child sulky and grumpy. However, kids will continue to use it in class, no matter what the rule. 3.This is, generally, not the parents' fault. Ideas can run wild. You cannot stop a child from having personal ideas. Furthermore, if the parents took away the phone, the child would throw an enormous tantrum, (which is never helpful), or play on someone else's phone. Parents cannot stop this. 4.\"Cell phone use in schools has many advantages. With the help of cell phones, students can be in touch with their parents, relatives and friends.\" ~ ASB As you can see, students can be in touch with friends. Being friends could lead someone helping another, right? Which is unfair to the people who do not have cell phones, because some kids with cell phones will text each other answers during a quiz or test. 5.Although I have to agree with you about the \"late\" advantage, children can always use the school's phone. Besides, cell phones could be lost easily or easily damaged when bumped into. This provides a fact that having cell phones during the school is not helpful to the parent and the child. 6.I believe ASB will provide this argument, so I will refute it: \"Obviously, teachers need phones to communicate with each other quickly.\" Phones ring, correct? This can provide a big distraction when the teacher would have to answer it. However, some schools use a walkie-talkie to communicate, which is really helpful compared to the cell-phone use in schools. If there was a case of disaster when the teacher's son or daughter had an emergency, most computers will have a notification device saying: \"You Got Mail!\" This can easily be read and kids cannot easily read it or hear it, compared to using cell phones. ==>Conclusion Overall, the cons of cell phones in school outgrow the pros of cell phones in schools. However, I would like to thank ASB and the readers for reading or posting arguments, in this exciting debate. Thank you.

Well most of us have to take a bus to high school and or any other school. And not a school bus, public transport- Subway, bus, taxi. Some kids in my school like in Manhattan which means there are some unsafe neighborhoods. My sister who is now in college, when we lived in Manhattan she almost got jumped a few times. Luckily we have some spare money and we were able to have phones and if she hadn't been able to call the police she may have been jumped. my point really is in New York City you never know what's behind the next corner. we have to pay a dollar each day at my school to put in a truck. I feel it's unsafe knowing you don't know where that truck goes or what might happen to it during the day. also for 265 days or so let's say you bring your phone to school every day. That's $365 right there just because the school doesn't want phones on school grounds. We also have metal detectors at school so you can't even try to sneak a phone in.",

Second, you can easily talk to your friends at lunch or before school. There is no reason to do it AT school. That really doesn't make sense to me. For the halls, like I stated before, you can get to class early and 1. Make sure you are prepared for class 2. Do other school to try and work. The second you let kids actually use cell phones at school (let's be honest, everybody has them anyway), the amount of use they get when they aren't supposed to be used will increase. It's bad enough that schools are letting kids have iPads and Chromebooks without having restrictions as to downloads (ie. no games). If you let kids start to use phones, it will only get worse. By letting kids use phones encourages usage. 65% of kids say that they use phones at schools anyway and about 110 texts are sent during class. Yet again, letting kids use phones in school will increase those numbers. Yes I understand that only 1,013 teens were used but the margin of error is given as only 3.1%. Just because something already occurs doesn't mean it should just be let to happen, or worse, more encouraged. Source: *http://usatoday30.usatoday.com...",

            "premise": "Thank you for your response. \u201cI am currently in school and I do not have a cell phone. I am in over 7 school clubs, some of which meet after school and I still use the school phones. My point is students just do not want to use the school phones and make excuses to their parents about it. Students now, at the age of 6, have cell phones and it would be best to define this as spoiling a child. A more detailed definition can be found here\u201d My opponent commits an argument fallacy from personal experience. Personal experience cannot be verified, nor proved, and in turn can therefore not be taken as a legitimate argument. Just because something may personally work a certain way for you, does not mean that that is the general case for everyone. It is irrelevant when a child gets a cell phone because that is a parents decision, and that parents\u2019 decision should be based of whether or not their child is responsible or ready for a cell phone. Ultimately, my opponent\u2019s contention that students are too young are irresponsible to have cell phones is irrelevant to the debate resolution at hand, because whether or not students are ready to have cell phones depends entirely on the parents\u2019 of those students and is irrelevant to whether or not the school should allow cell phones to be used in school. \u201cBut also, in your previous argument, you said that parents use cell phones as a way to teach children responsibility. Some children do not get the point of responsibility and in turn, lose the phone and get their parents to buy them a new one. This cycle repeats over and over again if the parents really spoil their child.\u201d Like stated in my last response, it is the parent\u2019s decision to decide whether their child is ready for a cell phone or not, and it is certainly not the school\u2019s fault if that child turns out to not be responsible enough for a cell phone. However, my point still stands that through trial and error regarding cell phone usage, students will mature regarding appropriate cell phone usage, even if they must be punished in the process. \u201cSome parents will actually press charges on the school for their child's phone being stolen because it was somebody in the school and the school was not responsible enough to keep his/her child's phone safe. There are many other ways to press charges and you never know what could happen in a democratic government system. There are quite a bit of stupid rules put in place.\u201d As stated last round, this is not the fault of the school nor is it a fault of allowing students to possess their cell phones on school grounds. Rather, it is the fault of a flawed justice system. Therefore, the blame cannot be placed on schools that allow cell phones so this argument is therefore dismissed. \u201cCyber bullying is another large topic when discussing the use of phones by students. Many students do not know the full impact of a text or IM or anything else. Here is a link with further information:\u201d Irrelevant. Cyber bullying is not the fault of schools that allow students to use cell phones. Anyways, your own source states that cyber bullying happens even outside of school. \u201cAbout 20 years ago (or less) students did not get phones until about 15 or 16 years old because it was not necessary and it still isn't today\u201d I am not arguing that cell phones are necessary; what I am arguing is that all the benefits cell phones bring are great, and students can have those benefits while schools also deter the negatives that cell phones may bring through strict rules on cell phone usage. \u201cwhy would anyone need to call their parents in a school shooting? Should they not be more worried about the shooter in the school or calling the police?\u201d The point is that in the case of a dire emergency, students will be able to communicate to anyone they need to, which could very well save lives.

            "premise": "Even though there are many gains to giving a child a cell phone, there are just as many drawbacks. One big one is the prevalence of bullying. Technology can facilitate this behavior even more since the Internet enables users to comment anonymously and post messages that stay up \"forever.\" Giving a kid a cell phone could be like giving them a loaded gun when it comes to being tormented\"or even tormenting others\"online. Thirty-four percent of Niche high school and college students report having been through 5 or more cell phones in their lifetime, which means cell phones are being used at a very young age. When a child is in school, his or her purpose there is to learn. Young people can be easily distracted from their studies - and having easy access to a mobile phone during class can make it easier for them to lose focus. If they become bored with the class material, it doesn't take much for them to take their cell phone to play some games or to check their newsfeed on Facebook or Twitter. How can you expect a child or teen to absorb the knowledge they need to learn if they're not even paying attention? Obviously, kids won't be able to take out their cell phones and talk to one another in the classroom during an exam, but the concept of \"passing notes\" has stepped into the age of technology, thanks to text messaging. Texts can be sent quite discreetly while in the classroom. Taking it one step further, a student can excuse himself to go to the washroom, only to use that time to send text messages and leave voice mails. It's also important to bear in mind that cell phones are advancing and improving faster than ever. Smartphones can surf the Web, providing high-tech ways for students to look for test answers online. Some models have advanced calculators, and depending on the software, may even be able to run custom applications that can contribute to academic dishonesty. The possibilities for cheating and copying are literally limitless when students have access to cell phones in class. oung people can be very competitive, fighting for popularity among their peer group. This can manifest itself into stealing if a particular individual brings an especially expensive cell phone to school. The last thing you want to do is to tempt the would-be thieves by sending your child to school with a piece of equipment that make him or her a target. Lockers are more likely to be broken into, for example, if they know there is something of value in there. Kids will be kids, so with hormones raging during their school days, there is a distinct possibility that some students may take pictures that they shouldn't be taking. Given that nearly every cell phone these days has a built-in digital camera, it becomes too easy to take a picture of someone without the person even noticing. These photos are also easily uploaded and shared over the Internet. Can you imagine the uproar if pictures were to arise of girls in the dressing room or boys in the locker room? Many students use the internet or access social media sites without teacher or parent supervision. These students can be targeted by predators. Predators lurk in chat rooms, on social media sites and other websites that are of interest to students. With the use of smartphones and other devices, it can be hard to monitor a student's online activity.",

            "premise": "Bullying does occur even without cellphones and children should tell their parents, but the responsibility does not rest solely with children. If parents are not involved in their children\"s lives and rely on cell phones to know where they are and what they are doing then they will miss some or all of the signs you pointed out. The fact is that staying involved in your children\"s life may be one of the hardest things you'll ever face; studies show that it's also one of the most significant things you can do to ensure your child makes it to a happy adulthood. Parents often cite safety as a major reason for wanting to give their child a cell phone. They believe that the ability to easily reach their kid and vice versa means it is somehow safer. But I think the result is exactly the opposite. Giving a child a cell phone creates a false sense of security and that can cause parents to be less diligent about the details of their child's life. And while it's true that a cell phone makes it easy for you to reach your child anytime, anyplace, it also makes it easy for everyone else to reach your child, anytime, anyplace. And this easy access and exposure can dramatically reduce your child's safety. Behind the concern over children's safety lies an important question: Where is your kid going that is so dangerous? If your child's daily life involves situations like school and extracurricular activities, there are probably plenty of phones around at any given moment. When your kid is at school, there is a phone in the school office and chances are there's one in every classroom they sets foot in, on top of all that there are cell phones in every teacher's pocket or purse. When it comes to extracurricular activity, if the activity is in a building, like a dance studio or a gym, that facility surely has a phone. Even if the activity takes place outside like on a sports field, I am sure that the coach and all of the other parents have cell phones. Rather than giving your child a cell phone, do something that will really make a difference in terms of her safety and quality of life. Make an effort to get to know the teachers, coaches and other parents well enough to exchange contact info and even cell phone numbers with them.",

            "discussionTitle": "cell phones in school",
            "conclusion": "cell phones in school",
            "premise": "Distraction: Since today\"s cell phones have more than one application, students will always get distracted in the quest of trying to discover and try out new cell phone applications. Female students are more likely to get distracted by mobile applications like Pinterest.com, Facebook or twitter, then for the male students, they can get distracted by cell phone game applications or video streaming applications. This continuous distraction will affect a student\"s concentration in the classroom, and it can also distract other students around them. At the end of the term these students will fail their exams because during classroom hours they where playing games or watching youtube.com videos. Cheating of exams: Since student X was watching videos during classroom hours, when it comes to exam time, they will resort to cheating. So they can decide to scan their notes on their cell phones or use text messaging service to cheat exams. Then some students can Google exam questions and copy whatever they find online, and in most cases this data published online is not correct which results into exam failure. According to my view, cell phones are more helpful to students. The two major cons \"\"Distraction & Cheating of exams \"\" can be controlled with strict guidelines on how and when to use cell phones in schools. Educators should not ban cell phones in schools, but they have to teach students on how to use cell phones to improve their grades, teachers can create some phone text based quizzes to ensure that students are always alert at all time in the classroom. A cell phone as a gadget is not bad, so we just have to find better ways of using it. Harmful effects of digital devices: There are concerns from the EPA about long-term exposure to wireless devices and computer screens. While there is no direct evidence of harmful effects, the EPA would discourage too much exposure for students who have video screens in front of their faces or computers in their laps. If students frequently use these devices at home, additional exposure at school could be viewed as harmful. Inappropriate materials: While schools can limit the availability of websites that can be viewed on their network, students may find links that slipped through the system. There will also be times that students will not be accessing the Internet through a monitored network. Distraction from schoolwork: With the temptation of social media and texting in their hands, students may focus solely on their social life instead of the lesson plan. Child predators and cyberbullying: Child predators are a problem everywhere. Using digital devices at school creates just that much more exposure and potential danger for students. In addition, cyber bullying is also an increasing issue. Permitting use of digital devices in the classroom could potentially lead to more of it. Provide a \"dis-connect\": While some believe digital devices make for greater connections for students, there are those who believe too much time with digital devices provide a disconnect of students from face-to-face social activities, family communications and nature. Digital devices in the classroom would probably lead to an even greater such disconnection. Even though there are many gains to giving a child a cell phone, there are just as many drawbacks. One big one is the prevalence of bullying. Technology can facilitate this behavior even more since the Internet enables users to comment anonymously and post messages that stay up \"forever.\" Giving a kid a cell phone could be like giving them a loaded gun when it comes to being tormented\"or even tormenting others\"online. Thirty-four percent of Niche high school and college students report having been through 5 or more cell phones in their lifetime, which means cell phones are being used at a very young age. When a child is in school, his or her purpose there is to learn. Young people can be easily distracted from their studies - and having easy access to a mobile phone during class can make it easier for them to lose focus. If they become bored with the class material, it doesn't take much for them to take their cell phone to play some games or to check their newsfeed on Facebook or Twitter. How can you expect a child or teen to absorb the knowledge they need to learn if they're not even paying attention? Obviously, kids won't be able to take out their cell phones and talk to one another in the classroom during an exam, but the concept of \"passing notes\" has stepped into the age of technology, thanks to text messaging. Texts can be sent quite discreetly while in the classroom. Taking it one step further, a student can excuse himself to go to the washroom, only to use that time to send text messages and leave voice mails. It's also important to bear in mind that cell phones are advancing and improving faster than ever. Smartphones can surf the Web, providing high-tech ways for students to look for test answers online. Some models have advanced calculators, and depending on the software, may even be able to run custom applications that can contribute to academic dishonesty. The possibilities for cheating and copying are literally limitless when students have access to cell phones in class. oung people can be very competitive, fighting for popularity among their peer group. This can manifest itself into stealing if a particular individual brings an especially expensive cell phone to school. The last thing you want to do is to tempt the would-be thieves by sending your child to school with a piece of equipment that make him or her a target. Lockers are more likely to be broken into, for example, if they know there is something of value in there. Kids will be kids, so with hormones raging during their school days, there is a distinct possibility that some students may take pictures that they shouldn't be taking. Given that nearly every cell phone these days has a built-in digital camera, it becomes too easy to take a picture of someone without the person even noticing. These photos are also easily uploaded and shared over the Internet. Can you imagine the uproar if pictures were to arise of girls in the dressing room or boys in the locker room? Many students use the internet or access social media sites without teacher or parent supervision. These students can be targeted by predators. Predators lurk in chat rooms, on social media sites and other websites that are of interest to students. With the use of smartphones and other devices, it can be hard to monitor a student's online activity.",

As it is stated \"mobile Phone\", students will bring it wherever they are such as, in the toilet, library, cafe, or even class. It grows the mobility and flexibility between parents and their children. Why mobility and flexibility are so important? In case their parents are sick, or someone important for them is dead, or most cases, the students needs their parents help to bring something important that they forget, mobile phone is the first help to access, unless there is no even an account in their cell phone. Even if there may be a phone center in any school, yet it is still not as flexible as mobile phone. If the case is about class disturbance, it does not mean that we have to completely ban them. we can just simply establish a helpful school policy. For example, during the class the teacher shall ask student to put their cell phone in front of the class, or near the teacher. Then, student will have no chance to make use it wrongly that may disturb the class session. So overall, cell phone helps student to shorten the range between their parents. Parents can still control them. Parents still have their capability to inform anything important.",

            "premise": "I'm very glad to be facing my opponent and do value his opinion however the resolution as stated ought to be affirmed. If I can prove the benefits outweigh the possible negative prospects of having cell phones in school then it is only logical that pro should be the victor of this debate.First let me state that I do agree that cell phones have the potential to be a distraction in school. But anything can be a distraction in school like other students, food,teachers, etc.. but this distraction can be a positive thing. Cell phones have many educational purposes in the class room. As technology and smart phones are improving technologically students have more access to tools to help them educationally and in some other situations. The benefits are as follows1.Cell phones improve school safety.As we know schools can never be 100% safe. In the event of an emergency where students safety is at risk or there is some sort of emergency. Students can let the police or fire department know much faster than the school can. In the event that a violent subject is actually in the classroom threatening the student body and if police cannot get information or line of sight on the target students can send videos to give the police an idea of how to further approach the situation. Students can also get advise from negotiators if they are faced with hostile situations. If a student is in some area of the school where no one else is around they can contact someone to help if they have an asthma attack. Students also have the option of texting police in an emergency. As we can see cell phones can be a very comfortable option to emergencies in the school. Especially if you have a personal life or death situation and no one is around. Cell phones can also be used to get a ride after school and to notify parents of spontaneous after school meetings.2. Cell phones can improve organization and save students money while helping the environment .Cell phones have calendars and memos witch helps students remember homework and report due dates therefore possibly raising students grades. Students can take pictures of notes and reference them later or take pictures of a reading assignment and read it when they have free time. Students can also record a lecture and possibly fall a sleep if they want to( I don't know if this is good or bad but I just wanted to throw it out there.) Students can also now take notes on their phones witch means they save trees and money because students wont need to buy as much paper thus reducing the deficit on the environment and save trees. So as we can see cell phones have a good economic advantage to students. In these tough economic times every penny we can save can help families economically. Lastly on this point if a student has a free period they can use their phones to keep track of the time so they can get to their next class on time.3. Cell phones provide Internet access and calculators.Some schools may not have good Internet access or none at all. These cell phones can connect to the Internet witch gives students additional educational resources. Internet access also means that students can instantly look up any information they can understand. Like if the teacher is using many big words the student can quickly find definitions via their phone rather than taking a long time and missing parts of the lecture while trying to find definitions from a dictionary. Cell phones also offer calculators. Calculators are expensive and schools may not be able to buy scientific calculators for advanced math and science. Most if not all cell phones have very advanced calculators. If the schools cant afford calculators why not let the students use their own? If students have access to calculators teachers have more time to teach materials due to decreased problem solving time.Closing statement.as we can see cell phones have multiple benefits. This resolutions benefits outweigh its prospective negative aspects. Cell phones improve school safety, improve organization and saves money while helping the environment, and they also provide Internet access and calculators to take advantage of for educational purposes. As we can see cell phones are a good thing to have in schools therefore this resolution ought to be affirmed according to my case and this debate.",

            "premise": "You missed my point Pro. What i meant by the snake game is that all of the features that are now in the phones where in the old ones also to some extend. Due to technology advancements, the phones were upgraded to smartphones being able to process more data and have access to internet as well as other options. But in essence it has the same roots. All phones are at the core the same. 2. You used a fact that was not accurate then you say \"still\"? Make sure you formulate your debate on true facts, or if you do not wish to at least use intuition. Do not add a quote and say it took it from here where in fact the information on that website is not correct. 3. As i said in the previous round. It takes time to develop a new \"design\". If they match that does not mean that they copied from each other since the steps necessary to reaching the final product, in this case the watch, it will take more than a few weeks or days. When other people tell you that apple stole the design from Samsung just mention that is not possible. Give them the reason above as to why. 4. Here is the proof that android is more versatile than Apple: [1] [2] With the Android the user has more capabilities at managing his/her apps which apple lacks. Android is run on over 84% of the smartphones world wide, whereas Apple is only 12%. So you can see that the history is on the Android side. [1] The difference between iOs 8 and 7 are almost non-existant, whereas the new lolipop update, Andrioid will be incorporating all of the bugs that were found in the previous builds into a new update, which i find it very good. Another thing i will add is that during upgrades from X to X.1 (ie. iOs 7 to 8) apple requires an extended (sometimes 20gb) of memory whereas to android is very minimal. 5. Just to summarize, and i hope this will give you insight into how the Apple is being created/manufactured, which is based on child/young labour. As you might be aware [3] [4] of the below human conditions that people are being treated in these manufacturing plants, as well as their denial of human rights (some factories have suicide nets to prevent people from jumping) further promote a culture of self-interest of the creators and senior managements and presides of the Apple corporation. So when you say iPhones are good phones, go to china and ask a child that works as a slave what he/she thinks of it. :) Your turn :) [1] http://tech.firstpost.com... [2] http://www.greenbot.com...

            "premise": "My opponent states, \"If the point of distraction is the only point of argument you have, then I think this conversation is through.\" Actually I have listed several points, the issue of distraction has not really been countered but the conversation is through because we are on the final round. \"Like I said, cell phones are INSTANT access to anyone.\" Exactly, they therefore have no role in the classroom where a Student should only be able to communicate with education staff and fellow students. \"It actually takes a while to get through to the office phone.\" Well that is entirely dependent on how well the school is administered, they is generally someone in the office or failing someone for a parent to talk to if they turn up out of the blue. \"People are more likely to keep up with a cell phone than a paper agenda. I myself would rather have an electronic organizer.\" But there is no real qualitative difference, students are not running financial empires, they need to remember quite basic things such what lesson follows what and if they have homework. A paper agenda serves this purpose very well, so does a cell phone, but the later comes with a number of problems. \"I don't think that a cell phone being used would be as much of an interruption as a school intercom calling little \"Timmy\" to the office. Sure, the student would have to stand up to a teacher, but all the student has to do is show the teacher the text message from the office\" So the phone rings/vibrates potentially disrupting the lesson. The student checks to ascertain from whom the call is from. Disrupting the lesson. The student answers the phone/reads the text message, disrupting the lesson. The student interrupts the teacher, disrupting the lesson. The student explains the situation to the teacher, disrupting the lesson. The teacher must decide whether to take the student on his/her word, to speak to the parent in question or to independently verify whether or not it is a genuine emergency call. In addition for every legitimate emergency call there will be what... a dozen examples were students have forgotten to put their phones on silent or are using them when the teacher is distracted, or complaining they are stolen etc etc. My opponent has failed to explain how this would be superior to the momentary intercom message, or a simple knock at the door and 'can Timmy come to reception'. Prior to the widespread adoption of mobile phones no one ever argued that each school desk be fitted with a ham radio or a land line. The benefit of mobile phones is instant communication, this is totally unnecessary in a classroom for reasons I have already explained. In addition to being unnecessary such phones will cause distraction and secondary problems. Thus I strongly urge a vote for Con. Thank you for the debate.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his arguments, and lets get startedFrameworkBoP is on Con, he has the burden to prove why children should not have a IPhone before they are a teenager. I will be making 3 rguments, one is emergencies, and the second one is that a Phone can be educational, the other one is that it is useful, and I will make my plan. The plan is that you can lock some apps with a special app. I will explain more of this later, and I will go onto this later. I will not go on my rebuttalsDefinitionsPhones: a telephone [1]Okay, lets think of what IPhones have. They have calling, texting, music, games, educational games, internet, etc. Argument 1: EmergenciesAs I said in my definitons phones have calling. Lets think of one example. You are lost in the city. You don't know where things are. Well, that is a bummer when you go to your home. You can't call the police, your mom, or look at the maps to see where you are. There are many reasons to have a phone, and it is to be safe. A phone can make you call people when you don't know where you are, and come get them, texting also. You can look at a map in your phone. Con might say that you can buy a map, but then be realistic. Almost no one or know where gives or sells the things that looks like a GPS. However, you have everything in a phone. That is why you need a phone, for safety and emergencies.Argument 2: EducationalMy opponent says that it can distrupt learning, certaintly, but that will be mentioned in the counterplan. My argument is that phones can be educational. As I said in the definitions, there is the Internet. Also there are educational games. Phones have lots of info. in them, so they are educational, making teens who need to learn good.Argument 3: UsefulAlmost everything in a phone is useful. You can search many links at the Internet, play brain games, search in dictionaries. There are much more benefits of actually having a phone. Because phones are very useful, children should have it before they are a teen.Counterplan 1: LockThere is finally a app in google play where you can download it and pick certain games with password. So this makes them not play, and if the parents let them, the parents can unlock the code. This is a useful way, and good way so that they don't play games, and they are safe with a phone.Sources[1] https://www.google.co.kr...Thank you, vote for Pro!",

            "premise": "I'd like to thank my opponent for the quick response, \"There are other ways to distract someone than a phone. Talking is one of the biggest distractions.\" This is most certainly true, extraneous conversation is a distraction and also generally prohibited. This has no relevance on the issue of mobile phones. \"-Well, it shows disrespect for the students when the teachers begin using their cell phones.\" Maybe it does, but the implication of my opponents opening statement suggested that we were to debate the issue students and their phones. If it is disruptive for a teacher to have access to a cell phone in school then how much more is it to allow the students access to them as well? Besides the teacher being an adult professional can be trusted to decide how to use his phone. \"I think cell phones should only be used (other than emergency) or can be useful when it comes to calculators, and organizers. Not everyone carries a paper organizer or agenda with them. Cell phones have alarms and reminders, which could come in handy.\" But cell phones also come with the disadvantages already mentioned, they can easily and cheaply be replaced in these roles by paper organisers and agendas that come with no real problems. \"If a cell phone goes off (not on vibrate), then the teacher should be ably to take the phone for the balance of a day.\" This disciplining action denies the use of the phone for instant communication in the case of emergency, (which is moot anyway as I have outlined a superior alternative). In addition by confiscating the phone you may have denied the student his calculator, alarm and reminders, (as he has as you argued become reliant on these features when other alternatives exist) thus disrupting his education. How much easier would it be to simply ban the objects from the classroom in the first place? \"Treat cell phones like scissors. If a kid runs with scissors, you punish the kid, you don't take all of the scissors away.\" Scissors are required for certain lessons, phones are not. \"Office phones are not all that great for emergencies. An emergency may be private, and the presence of other students in the office may cause \"talking\" such as rumors. When talking to your family, such things should be kept private.\" If a parent phones through with a family emergency they can merely tell the school receptionist/telephonist, \"We have a family emergency I am coming to pick up Timmy\". Should the teacher be distracted by Timmy answering his phone he will naturally demand an explanation. It is generally easier for a parent to assert their right to privacy over the phone to the school than it is for a child to stand up to a teacher. Thus I feel that the presence of mobiles is still unnecessary and detrimental.",

            "conclusion": "Android phones are better then Apple's",
            "premise": "Hi! I use both phones too. I think that android phones are more customizable but it isn't always about decorating. There is way more to it than that. Such as apps and games. We know that most popular games and apps are on both platforms but there is more iphone only apps than android only app. Even if the apps are on both platforms they tend to be better looking on iphones and the apps get updated more frequently such as snapchat and spotify. They both have more features than the android versions of them. You are saying that iphones are more expensive. Obviously they are. Do you know why? Well it is because iphones have way more features than androids(even more than samsung.) Since they have way more features they are worth the price. Another point iphones get updated to the latest ios version up to three years. For example the iphone 4 has ios 9 and the iphone 5 has ios 10 but androids are only up to 18 months so if you want android nougat you may simply have to get another android phone. So if you talk about the price two androids are the same price as 1 iphone so as i say the price is worth it. What do you say to that?",

One fact why I think we should because the school could save money on supplies like calculators or/and computers. The student could have fun on their phones during recces break and during class they could be monitored if they are staying on track with their work or fooling around and if they were to fool around they would get are phone taken away and have their parents called. To be honest kids in school already sneak their phones during class I've seen it myself and sometime I even do it but teachers don't see it so might as well just let them use their cell phones then just keep sneaking it behind their teachers back.",

            "premise": "So we've reached the end of our debate. Clearly there are speculations and concerns issued by many incuding parents, teachers, peadriticians and scientists in regards to our motion. I however still am subscribing to the belief that that the advantages for children to own smart phones outweigh the minor disadvantages that come with it. To sum up, my three points that have been taken into account of our debate are to promote the intellectual development of children ,parallel to The Children's Right, economic and financial reasons and lastly to assimilate the element of latest technology among children to mould technology-savvy generation. Now for my opponent, I am well aware of the fragility of children's biology and how they can be obsessed with smart phones. That's why I did mention parents' role in this matter earlier. They should always control the internet and calls usage by their children. Parents should always remind their children of the danger of phones-oriented radiation to them and make sure that at night when they are sleeping their smart phones are placed at a safe distance. Besides that, if inability to stay focus in class becomes a problem, simple , parents should take away their phones and keep them during school hours return to them after school. In a nutshell, parents should allow their children to own a smart phone. Bear in mind that everything if used excessively can be dangerous and that applies to this situation. With enough control and support by parents, I believe that children can benefit the best from having this wonderful piece of technology! That's all from me, thank you for your time! I really appreciate it. Ps: to con, radiation doesn't \"'flow\"\"' in blood vein. It penetrates through your clothes and if powerful enough ( with strong penetrating power) through your skin.",

            "conclusion": "The Iphone 7 have no headjack for AUX cords",
            "premise": "Alright, time for my argument. I'm glad to see Pro has posted his. Pro lists off some benefits to removing the port/jack for earbuds. These include: Potentially more hard drive or battery, which could increase battery life, memory, etc. Increasing screen size Removal of the home-button One step closer to becoming waterproof Now, I will admit, some of these do seem reasonable, however, I believe there are more downsides to the idea than there are benefits. Keep in mind: Pro stated that \"The IPhone headjack is an unnecessary waste of space that should be removed from the IPhone 7 and be replaced with headphones that plug into the charging hole\" Some negative effects I can see from this idea include, but are not limited to: Inability to charge and listen to music at the same time. \" self explanatory A need to make completely new earbuds. Only apple earbuds made specifically for that phone could be used. Other earbud companies would either still use the regular earbud plug (which would render them useless on the iPhone 7), OR they'd have to start making earbuds that worked for the iPhone 7, as well as regular plugs for other devices that still use the regular jack (wireless earbuds are another matter). The design of wired plugs is actually important. The screens are already big enough (they\"re getting too big, if you ask me). So let's start with some of the above points. 1. Inability to charge and listen to music at the same time. Now I'm not completely sure how apple plans to go about this, or if they even plan to do what you suggested, but that's not what the debate is about. Continuing on, with my current phone, let's say I'm listening to music. Suddenly, I realize my phone is low on battery. So what do I do? I go and plug it into the charger, and then continue listening to music. However, if my phone required that the earbuds be plugged into the same port as the charging port, then I could only do one or the other. That's pretty self-explanatory. 2. A need to make completely new earbuds. Yeah yeah yeah, Apple provides a pair with each phone they sell. They've made new designs and all. Personally, I don't like apple earbuds, but that's just me. Sure, apple could do it again, but they'd have to still make regular earbuds for older models, since they're still being bought. 3. Only apple earbuds could be used for that specific phone. Now this one is probably easy to realize. Sure, there are wireless earbuds, but again, this is about earbud plugs and jacks. So let's put wireless out of the picture for now and assume all the earbuds are wired. This is where we have a big problem. There are a lot of people who don't use apple earbuds, me being one of them. So what would happen if I were to buy the iPhone 7 without an earbud port? I'd have to use the earbuds that came with the phone, and I'd be constantly stuck with that pair unless: A. I spent a lot of money on wireless earbuds B. Other earbud companies began to make earbuds that worked with the iPhone 7 Therefore, earbud companies would have to alter their products to work with the iPhone 7, as well as continue with their regular model for older phones/other brands of phones. This could cost them a lot of money, don't you think? 4. The design of wired plugs is actually important. Now, I actually didn't know this until I decided to google up the plugs, and I found this to be quite useful if you'd like to read through some of it: https://en.wikipedia.org...(audio) 5. The screens are already big enough. Now, of course, this is more opinion based, but let's take a look at this. Some of the first cell phones were almost a foot tall. For a long time, it was about making phones smaller. Even with the iPod and iPod nano, or iPod shuffle, it was about getting smaller. Now, we've kind of switched. Now, since we have touch screens, it's all about how big we can get our screens. Here's a picture of the current iPhone sizes, starting at the iPhone 4 size: http://www.debate.org... Now, it seems that the iPhone 7 will be the same size as the 6, and the 7 plus the same size as the 6 plus (in terms of the screen). As you can see, the screen is already large, and that's just the screen. What need is there for more screen? Also, wouldn't getting rid of the home button rid of the ID-unlock thumb button? Continuing past that, I'd also like to point out to con that there are waterproof cases. Sure, the phone itself being waterproof would be cool, but how would removing the port for your earbuds make a difference? Furthermore, there are waterproof cases for as low as $20-40, some of which are cheaper than apple earbuds themselves. Not only that, but most of these cases act as protection from falling too, which the iPhone alone wouldn't have. So yes, the idea of the phone itself being waterproof is great, but I don't believe removing the port would help very much. Overall, while there are some good ideas in play for removing the port, I believe there are more down sides to the idea that rule out removing it. Of course, this is apple we're talking about. They'd probably do it anyway...

Accumulating evidence indicate that microwave radiation from mobile phones may cause serious diseases and disturbances in the physiology.

Mobile phone radiation and health concerns have been raised, especially following the enormous increase in the use of wireless mobile telephony throughout the world.\" --> A claim that is not backed up with a link or a reference to verify such a claim.

The school definitely has phones that you may use and they are there for you to use them. Many students think that bringing their cell phones means they can call their parents but the truth is that they just don't want to ask the office to use those phones. Parents do not need to use an expensive cell phone as a way to teach children about responsibility. Rather, doing chores to get time on the computer, watching TV or working harder in school to earn privileges. Many people think that they may use the computer or the television to their enjoyment but that is a privilege as well. Some of the main reasons schools ban cell phones is because they get stolen/lost easily. If kids lose their cell phone at school, the school may also be put in charge of this when, actually they did not do anything. But since the phone was lost on school property, charges may be pressed. That is why the school tries to avoid these situations. Sometimes, they may also get stolen and again, the school is in charge of this. Similar to the previous situation, the school would like to avoid these things.",

Here i pasted it for you \"apples-iphone-overtakes-android-in-us-sales-for-the-first-time-since-2012\". Another thing to indicate is that the rise was due to iPhone 6 was released, resulting in that spike in sales. These have leveled now however. 3. Although i do agree that they look similar on the outside, they have however different operating systems. Just because geometrically it made sense to create them (perhaps the way the internal board is being created it matches eachother) it does not mean that Galaxy was copied from the iPhone. This development might have taken months perhaps even years. They cannot go and reinvent their size just because the competitor has a device that looks the same. These are company secrets and standards that cannot be copied.. 4. Well those are just the ones that aren't \"water proof\" (although that is not even a correct term). Here are some that are [1]: Galaxy S4/S5 Galaxy Xcover3 Sony's Xperia Z3 So don't pick the ones that don't have and compare with the i platform from which none have...

            "premise": "I forgot to mention this earlier but two companies make the whole phone, for example Samsung provides the phone and Android makes the OS. This makes it easier for Samsung to just focus on the phone and Google just to focus on the OS giving it an unfair advantage. (you said announded, the \"correct term\" is announced.) 1. I'll list the ways it redefined the smartphone -could be used as a music player -It had no buttons -you didn't use a stylus (was popular at the time) -it had better stores for a better experience buying one (android stores???) -It was much faster than phones at the time -Oh and the Play Store has ads now (http://techcrunch.com...) I'll pay for apps over having ads. 2. I guess you have nothing to say about the Android users switching over. And I just want to end the money argument now because Apple is the biggest company in the world. \"A item that is newly introduced into the market place, with the correct amount of marketing and vogue distribution, the produce will be successful. This type of behavior has been tested and researched into. [3] Due to Apple products receiving a periodic update (usually in their appearance) of the geometry of the device,minimal internal improvements (I am aware of the iOs8 changes which should have been corrected long time ago), the individual will want something that looks new.\" What does this have to do with my second argument? And what you said about how iOS 8 isn't everything people wanted, at least people can upgrade the software of the phone they just bought. (Don't say we should be disappointed when many Android users can't even upgrade.) 3. Again, nothing to do with what I said.... (the \"correct term\" is overtaken not oertaken) I guess point 7. is your response. The S6 came out in April, which is 8 months. That's a lot of time.\" 2 weeks before your released your product it does not mean you copied.\" But that's none of my business... :) And what you said about how iOS 8 isn't everything people wanted, at least people can upgrade the software of the phone they just bought. 4. It's hilarious how many ways i can rebuke this so I'll make a list - that stat is from 2012 :) -they make more types of phones and they make those cheap ones you find in the grocery store, so people who can't afford iPhones there only option is Android. :) -with a two year contract that price drops to $199 for iPhone 6 and $299 for the 6+ (why would you buy a phone that can't even make calls?) :) -Apple is also newer to the scene of phones, only having made smartphones :) 5. they are both terrible so don't act like Android is perfect ( just repeating this to show Samsung is bad too,\"100 hours of forced overtime work per month, unpaid work, standing for 11 to 12 hours while working, underage workers, severe age and gender discrimination, abuse of student and labor dispatch workers, a lack of worker safety, and verbal and physical abuse.\") Also I haven't heard about people getting cancer from iPhone factories. 6. you concede :) 7. The only thing that isn't true for is the G4, the rest came out months later giving them more time to work on it and see what Apple did. :) Your turn!1!!!111!!1!!!1!1",

            "conclusion": "It should be illegal for people to use cell phones while driving",
            "premise": "Contention 1: The original study [1] also says that \"Decisions about regulation of such telephones, however, need to take into account the benefits of the technology and the role of individual responsibility.\" Many drivers with cell phones were able to quickly call emergency services; there are many other unrelated benefits of cell phone usage. According to a large study done by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [2], the risks associated with talking on the phone are no worse than those associated with performing any other similar task in the car, such as eating. If cell phone usage were to be banned, it would be necessary to also ban many other similar tasks. In addition, the cost of banning cell phone usage is rather high [3]: \"the cost of banning cell phone use while driving is about $700,000 for each quality-adjusted life year saved. That is 30 times more expensive than achieving the same public health benefit with driver airbags, and ten times more expensive than achieving that benefit by keeping the speed limit on interstate highways at 55 instead of 65 MPH.\" Contention 2: This is nothing but a statistic; it lacks proof. Many crashes may be caused by cell phone usage, but this is outweighed by several factors. For one, there is the economic cost of preventing potentially crucial calls from being made while in the car. Yes, life is more valuable than simple economic costs, but at what point do we draw the line? Would we be willing to bankrupt a nation just to save one individual? No, and this is exactly why the economic cost is important. Two, we must take into consideration the entire population. There are billions of people who ride in cars every day; only 600,000 or so per YEAR get in an accident, and barely half of those even involve any injury. The cost of cell phone usage is rather small. To help balance my opponent's statistics, it is worth noting that someone with a blood alcohol content of 0.1% (only just above the legal limit for operating an automobile [4]) is five times more likely to get in an accident than someone who is talking on the phone. Contention 3: The core of this argument is very similar to the core arguments of #1 and #2, so my arguments can be cross-applied. But to add something extra, I ask, why is this a reason to ban cell phone usage? There are surely more economical ways to reduce the risk of an accident. Education and encouragement are powerful tools that we ought to utilize. Simply making cell phone use illegal is invasive, excessive and unnecessary, not to mention an infringement on personal liberty. Contention 4: No direct source to this fact has been given and I cannot find the original source, so it is difficult to respond to. However, it has been found that banning cell phones would cause a great deal of economic hardship [3]. Contention 5: This is an example of an appeal to authority; it is fallacious [5], and should be disregarded. Contention 6: False. See rebuttal to contention 2. In conclusion, the side effects of cell phone conversation while driving are minor and the costs of banning cell phone use are great.

            "premise": "I will use two arguments for this debate1) It is still disputed whether or not cell phones cause brain cancer2) Something cannot be the leading cause of brain cancer if it does not cause it, or if it is simply not the LEADING cause1) There have been countless studies trying to see if cell phones do cause brain cancer.... And there is very conflicting evidence showing any correlation between cell phone use and brain cancer. Sources below all show how cell phones are not linked to brain cancer\"In the largest study yet of its kind, Danish researchers have found no correlation between use of cellphones and risk for brain tumors in adults.\"http://www.theblaze.com...\"Tumor rates in northern European countries have remained steady through 2008 despite widespread cell phone use\"http://www.mobiledia.com...\"One of the largest and longest studies on the subject finds no more brain tumors among people who had cell phones over 17 years than among people who had no cell phones.\"http://news.yahoo.com...\"350,000 people ages 30 and older and found there was no difference in cancer rates between longtime cell phone \"subscribers\" and those who didn't have a phone,\"http://health.usnews.com...\"to date there is no evidence from studies of cells, animals, or humans that radiofrequency energy can cause cancer.\"http://www.cancer.gov...\"The research team analyzed the survey data and couldn't find any link between cell phone usage and brain tumors\"http://gizmodo.com...\"It's highly unlikely that cell phones cause cancer because they emit \"non-ionizing radiation\" which is very weak and doesn't really affect living cells\"http://articles.businessinsider.com...;\"A long-term study of Danish mobile phone use has unequivocally determined that there is no connection between mobile phone use and various cancers of the brain\"http://www.itwire.com...\"Further research has been published suggesting there is no link between mobile phones and brain cancer.\"http://www.bbc.co.uk...\"In most studies patients with brain tumors do not report more cell phone use overall than the controls.\"http://www.cancer.org...\"A new study has revealed that children and adolescents who use mobile phones are not at a statistically significant increased risk of brain cancer compared to their peers who do not use mobile phones.\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com...\"Many experts agree that to date, there is no conclusive evidence that links cell-phone use to brain cancer\"http://www.usaweekend.com...-\"5 billion cell phone users globally, representing nearly three-quarters of the world's population. However, the incidence and mortality rate of brain and central nervous system cancers has remained virtually flat since 1987\"http://abcnews.go.com...So the point is, Cell phones do not definitively cause Brain Cancer2) The second thing I want to address is the current list of leading causes of Brain cancer in no particular order - Exposure to radiation like nuclear power plant workers - Exposure/Use of Formaldehyde, - Exposure to Vinyl Chlorides that affects people who manufacture certain types of plastic - Exposure to Acrylonitrile that affects people who manufacture certain types of textiles and plastics - Studies thus far have not found an increased risk of brain tumors among people who use cell phones.http://www.medicinenet.com...http://cancer.emedtv.com...So cell phones are not proven to cause Brain cancer and as of right now it is most certainly not the leading cause of brain cancer.",

            "premise": "\"Radiations being at number one. When you are giving that innocent toddler a smart phone, you are actually giving him/her a radiation emitting box of terror.\" Are you not aware that many things in are every day life emit radiation? Processed foods, medical xrays and even air. If you walk outside in an urban environment you will soak in just as much radiation as you would being on your phone. Even are sun gives off MORE radiation than a cell phone, this argument is not concerning as the radiation a cell phone emits is VERY little in comparison to objects in our everyday lives. http://www.livescience.com... \"Substituting physical activities and human interactions with smart phones would never do good\" Bear in mind that a toddler is between the age of 0 and 5, and toddlers cannot participate in any official sport till the age of 6. Children will also by natural run around and play, the phone will not provide an obstacle for the children if the parents manage it properly. Children can also learn a lot from IPad applications, I work in the special needs department at my school and we give them phones/ipads to give them educational and brain games. This only helps there social interaction and makes them learn something new. \"Most people, CAN NOT multitask. Switching between two tasks is something that takes up a lot of energy, especially when the task which needs to be switched from is an addiction\" Procrastination can be controlled by the parent and its there responsibility to dictate phone time. Banning phone use will negate a lot of opportunities a lot of present day applications use. Education brain games can be crucial and can help a lot of developing kids, as technology if used properly will make people smarter. Books can be used yes, but googling can allow you to scroll through the information faster and become more multi perspective. http://www.usatoday.com... \"The age 5 - 10 involves stuff like brain development, learning social skills, learning important values amongst family and friends, starting to know which field best matches with your interests \" In the article above the school uses smart phones to help kids with brain stimulating activities, it can also provide benefits to many children as well, as it can help them learn a wider array of topics. Learning important values among family members and friends will come through social interaction. Regardless if you have a phone or not, you will be able to develop social skills as elementary schools will enforce it. Family values do not correlate to whether someone has a phone or not, I actually do not see how you can even find that compatible. Family values should be taught by the family members, and I was able to learn and adapt to my family's expectations even getting a phone at the age of 10. \"AGE 10 - 15 ('Tweenagers') Apart from the health problems and lack in social skills, the problems which prevail more in this age group are things like increased 'FOMO' (Fear of missing out), sleep disruption, procrastination and increased stress (I had a smart phone for a week when I was in my 'tweens' and I gave it back myself, because I noticed, IN JUST ONE WEEK, how my life was being affected in a bad way from it!) \" So you make the ignorant claim that you threw your phone out because of negative affects and it should be enforced on other individuals? Lets look at any device, a computer. If you're on the computer for to long, the same affects will develop. Being on the computer will disrupt sleep, make you procrastinate and increase your stress. However phones have also debunked my stress because I use it to communicate with friends, talk to family members from faraway lands and use it to learn. A flip phone will prevent you from communicating from long distance relatives as well, unless you want to pay extra money. So are you also saying that teenagers shouldn't have computers? \"Moreover, these kids are more likely to be opened up to things they should not be watching or doing (pornography, etc.). \" I don't know what household you grew up in, but by the age of 14 most parents have responded that it was okay for there children to watch pornography, unless you align yourself with a different religion. It actually has a lot of benefits and can help kids understand what it really is. You may be saying it puts them in a different mindset, but they will be brought into the mindset regardless as teenagers and their surroundings, if you truly dislike that mentality, send your kid to a private school. http://sexuality.about.com... In your last argument, I will state that a simple flip phone will be bad for business. No one wants to manufacture them and its a waste of money, all in all a cell phone an is unconstitutional and should be left by the parent. I will conclude there",

            "premise": "Alright I will address the final points that were made before we head into the realm known as the voting period. \"Another good reason cell phones should be in school is because they are very fast at stuff. If there was a fire at school and all the school phones burned, would you want to call or text your mom/dad on your cell phone or walk the (sometimes) long way home? They are fast access to the Internet and parents. Sometimes if something private happens and your mom/dad call your school it's not that private anymore. Most of the times you won't talk to them on the phone, the office just gives you a message. That makes it unprivate.\"If there is a school fire, the teachers, principals, and police have ways of contacting the parents. [Not an argument but I would like to point out that there is a concern over students pulling fire alarms, perhaps to get out of class, and then using cell phones to \"call parents\" and meet up for illegal activity while everyone is confused and scared. Missing children in that situation would be doubly harmful to the overall environment.]Now if there is a private emergency oftentimes the school will let you out of class to deal with it. [from personal experience, when my mom slipped and broke her knee, I stayed on the school phone for hours with my stepdad under being told \"family emergency\", until he was able to pick me up from school.] If there is an emergency calls can be sent to the office, minor incidents can wait until after school time.\"It's also saving paper and ink. Instead of the school making around 1000 planners/agenda books that are around 20-40 pages long, you could have a cell phone to use as an electronic organizer/agenda since most kids don't use their planners/agenda books anyway.\" Schools could also save paper and ink by using personal log ins to track progress, notes, and dates using the school computers, rather than sending personal agendas, so the point does not address the earlier rounds in which cell phone usage was compared to that of computer/laptop usage for students.In fact it would be far easier to organize such things on a laptop loaned to students, than it would be on most personal cell phones.",

            "conclusion": "Students Should be Allowed to Have Their Cell Phones at School",
            "premise": "Thank you for your response. Yes, it is quicker to contact guardians, but for what reason? As I've stated, they can simply use the office phones. What kind of emergency could be so dire that all teachers, student assistants, and the main office lose full phone connection? A student could contact a guardian for any reason, a schedule change, to be picked up perhaps from a different spot than previously changed, ect. Anyways, many students do this, and if a school averages about 500-700 students then 5 office phones will seldom be enough. Fact is, why use office phones when cell phones are simply just easier? As I\u2019ve already argued, if students use their cell phones inappropriately the school can simply implement strict rules on cell phone usage. Also, not all emergencies occur in the classroom or even in a school building. When walking on campus, perhaps from one classroom to another or to deliver something to another teacher a student could be put in a dangerous situation where there are no authoritative figures in the immediate vicinity. \u201cLike I said, use an office phone. NEVER have I seen or experienced a line in my schools main office for the use of one of it's 5 phones.\u201d Argument fallacy from personal experience. Logically, a school which holds 500-700 students on average will likely have many students needing to call their parents for something. \u201cAs I've reasoned and stated, said students don't need their cell phones at school. Their not being punished, the educational facility is just taking a extra precaution for the welfare of the students. Cell phones are distracting to students, therefore it can hinder a students focus in class.\u201d There is no reason for students to not have their cell phones with them at school. Cell phones provide a plethora of great benefits and every negative consequence of cell phones can simply be deterred through strict rules regarding cell phone usage. \u201cHonestly, what situation could PLAUSIBLY render the phones in the main office ineffective? And what do you mean by \"authorities\"? Do you mean teachers? I doubt there is any situation where ALL teachers would be absent of the building, and they would leave ALL students in by themselves without supervision, it's also absurd to think an emergency could happen in those EXACT few moments when they are vulnerable. Since that theory is highly implausible and ludicrous, we can say that that point has been countered completely.\u201d Any situation where a student is not in the vicinity of a teacher or the office phones is a situation where the use of a cell phone could save a student\u2019s life. This situation is plausible, especially when considering a school shooting where a student vacates the campus and calls from their position, a deadly allergic reaction in which a student should call 911 immediately, a student getting dangerously y hurt while on campus but not in a building; the possibilities are endless and in a school\u2019s effort to put the safety of the student above all things, schools should allow students to have cell phones with them. \u201cYeah, there is actually a LOT to use when ALL students have access to their cell phones, their focus! Schools serve the purpose of educating students with life skills and technical skills, and texting and chatting on their cell phones helps that purpose how?\u201d As already stated, every instance of inappropriate cell phone usage can be deterred through strict rules on cell phone usage. Thank you for this debate. I hope it was at least somewhat intellectually stimulating.",

Although, the effects of being on a small screen do cause bad eyes etc., if there is a chance that these companies have the abilities to fix that problem, then it would push technology one step further onto the safer side. For example, I saw a stranger cross the road a week or so ago, and they was being shouted at due to the fact she was nearly hit by a car. That shows that being oblivious isn\"t something that can be fixed by Samsung or Iphone, but taking phones away will ruin businesses and would throw technology backwards. It is not the phones being detrimental, because if it wasn\"t bad for your eyes and brain, then it is just the idiocy and desperate need of phones. So it is us taking one fad to an extreme, which causes people to blame the phones for distracting them. I believe that if people had more self control, then they wouldn\"t be getting distracted by the irresistible buzz of phones. My conclusion is that people have made a fallacy out of phones, believing that phones are relied on to keep us sane. For example, when my Dad was a child, the only phones were either in red boxes, or attached to a wire. When he was in his early 30s, they were bricks, and now, he acts like they have a completely different purpose.",

            "premise": "My opponent states that having these downloading apps for his ipod (I personally don't care if it is jailbroken, I worked for apple as ipod touch and iphone tech support and I refused to get an iphone with AT&T) is \"more than a minor inconvenience.\" Appart from being a personal opinion rather than a factual opinion, I can only say that the only reason to jail break an ipod touch is to alter the software (as opposed to for the iphone, it was mostly to get away from AT&T and not alter the software). Altering the software can effect how apps work on that device. My opponent also states that with the widgets, you can take the concious effort to save battery life, which is true, and is encouraged for pretty much all smart phones as they all have battery issues (as mentioned earlier). And pretty much all smart phones have battery extention cases. The one that my opponent points to is $70 bucks (minus 1 penny) and that will actually bring the cost of that phone to more than the iPhone 4. Regarding the word \"moot.\" I am using it with the meaning of \"doesn't matter\" (I think that was #5 in the link). The iPhone has the ability to tether, just like the Incredible, however AT&T locked that feature because they didn't believe that their network could handle it. Other carriers in other nations have opened up tethering with the iPhone. Since this is a debate about the device, and not the service providers, any limits placed by those providers doesn't matter to this debate. Thank you,",

Any ways, as I have said before, phones can allow students to contact parents if there is an emergency go home, sports or other after school activity's get canceled, or if you need to stay after to get help from a teacher on an assignment you are having problems on. In my school ALL the teachers have their phones out doing who knows what. if the teachers are allowed to have them then we should to. when we ask them why there allowed to have their phones they say in case something bad happens, but they have them out when nothing happened. another thing is that if we need to look up a word really quick in class we can just take out our phone and look it up and then put it away, and if your allowed to use calculators in class, most phones have calculators on them. Also with the phones being a distraction during class, all students can show the teacher their phone is off and has to put it were the teacher can always see it, so the teacher knows their not texting someone. Another thing is that if students are allowed to use phones in the hall and at lunch then they will be less likely to text during class, and they will spent less time trying to hide them and actually pay attention.",

            "conclusion": "Apple iPhone 5 VS Samsung Galaxy Note II",
            "premise": "You didn't say I couldn't so I'll start arguing now.Let's get the facts out of the way:Note 2 has 2 GB RAM, an 8 MP camera, 16 GB of ROM, and a quad core processor. There is a removable battery and space for a Micro SD drive. The screen is 5.5 inches.iPhone 5 has 1 GB RAM, an 8 MP camera, up to 64 GB ROM, and a dual core processor with quad core graphics. There is no removable battery, no Micro SD drive, and a 4 inch screen.Just from that, logic would tell you that the Note 2 is slightly better in some areas with ties in other areas. I disagree with that.Flaw 1: Screen The screen on a Note II is acceptable at best for the majority of cell phone users. A screen of that size is unwieldy, unlikely to fit in pockets, and downright ridiculous for a device that has the main purpose of operating as a communication device. In addition to this, the majority of consumers declare the screen is the worst asset of the phone, because it scratches so easily in comparison to that of the iPhone 5. An iPhone in comparison has a reasonably sized screen that is less likely to scratch or shatter. A shattered iPhone 5 can still be used, by the way. A shattered Note II usually needs to be replaced.Flaw 2: CasesThe selection of readily available cases for the iPhone easily trumps that of any other phone due to its unique shape. Usually, the only case a person can find while purchasing a Note II is the crappy flip case that does nothing to protect the phone if dropped. A case can always be bought online, but that would either lengthen the time between now and buying a new smartphone, or would bring the risk that one might drop the phone before the case arrives. Again, iPhone emerges the winner.Flaw 3: App StorageSamsung doesn't allow you to save apps to SD card anymore. The Note II to my knowledge does not come in 64 GB, so by buying a Note, you foreit some app storage that you would get easily with an iPhone 5.Flaw 4: Personal assistant sucks'Sucks' is not very academic language, and for that, I apologize, but sucks is the only way to adequately describe the assistant you get with Note II. Siri is superior in both functionality and voice recognition. I believe CNET actually said in their review of the S3 that S Voice disappointed as a con of the S3, and S3 and Note II have the same personal assistant. A very evident flaw.Flaw 5: Google PlayGoogle Play is littered with malware. The App Store is perfectly clean. That peace of mind is priceless. And even if you are careful, you have to accept the fact that the App store get all the cool apps first.Flaw 6: UpdatesUpdates are not dependent on carrier for the iPhone 5, and you can update the same phone a bunch of times without the need to buy a new phone. Android phones are lucky if they get from 4.0 to 4.1. Flaw 7: Price16GB iPhone 5: $199 16GB Note II: $299In the light of these obvious flaws with the Note II, I believe that the additional 1 GB of RAM and removable batteryis not worth the above. The iPhone 5 is a better buy for the majority of the public, and they should go with Apple over Samsung for their next smartphone.",

In other words, they're a way to block your child's access to anything and everything you deem inappropriate for them based on their age and sensitivity, and your own best judgment [...]\" But this does not prevent them from entering and changing the restriction, but you can put passwords on the restricted mode to prevent the kids entering and changing the restricted mode. My conclusion: that Kids could and should have their own cellphone",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for this debate.I will start by stating that the cell phone can have many uses, however replacing school materials is not one of those uses.Addressing my opponent \"Cell phones should be aloud to be used in school because they are light weight and cheaper. \" Cheaper than what exactly? A cell phone plan can cost anywhere between $30-$500 per month. [1]Cell phones themselves can come free but often require you to sign into a contract with costly monthly bills, and often costly penalties for leaving the company, paying late, or going over the limits as well as other hidden fees you should be aware of first. [2]Cell phones (without discounts) cost between $70-$650 [3]Cell phones have one more additional cost that should be mentioned: replacing them, even with care they often need replaced, especially some of the more popular cell phones, which \"wont last three months\". [4] \"The school could save a lot of money not having to buy over 1000 computers and laptops so everyone has one.\"If the school bought every student a cell phone, they would need to deal with overage charges, monthly bills, and buying the cell phones anywhere between 1-6 times in a two year span. While business computers tend to last around 4.4 years. [5]\"They are light, the average computer weighs about 20-50 pounds and the average laptop weighs about 6 pounds. \"Being lightweight is simply not very important as far as making school decisions, effective, educational, and usefulness all come far above being lightweight, computers fit the bill far better than cell phones.Additional argumentComputers are used for research, storing files, and in some cases, even taking the classes. Cell phones simply cannot perform these factions, and the few that can are far less efficient. Cell phones are good for their purpose, communication, being portable, and being easy to use perhaps doubling as a portable music player; cell phones simply are not currently able to replace the usefulness that computers provide for schools and companies.ConclusionCell phones cost more than computers, they need replaced more often, monthly maintenance and fees are far higher than for computers, and they are no efficient for the purposes that schools often use computers for.Sources[1] http://www.mobileburn.com...
