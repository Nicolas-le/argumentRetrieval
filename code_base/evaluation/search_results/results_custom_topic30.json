            "premise": "I, being the pro,am going to affirm the resolution and prove why people should be allowed to carry arms. I will ask that voters cast their vote in this round based on who debates the resolution better and not based on your own personal decisions. Keep in mind that I have no strong views on either side, but want to practise my debating skills. Thanks! In this debate, I am going to prove to you why adult individuals should have the right to carry a concealed handgun. On to my case - I wish to offer 2 points in this round to show that the decision to make carrying arms in the US a legal right was a good one. Firstly, Criminals are less likely to attack someone that they believe might be armed. The deterrent effect of concealed carry benefits the individual carrying a handgun as well as the general public because criminals never know who is armed. With the right to carry arms in place, the general public can move around the country without having to worry about criminals, and areas that generally contain a lot of people who commit crimes. This is further proved by the fact that, according to a study by Dr. John Lott, \"shall-issue\" laws have reduced homicides by 8.5%, aggravated assaults by 7%, and robberies by 3%. Lott argued that if states that did not permit concealed handguns in 1992 had permitted them in 1977, 1570 murders, 60,000 aggravated assaults, and 12,000 robberies would have been prevented between 1977 and 1992. These figures may seem insignificant at first, but when you're part of one the 1,570 families who lost someone they loved, it suddenly matters a WHOLE lot more. Secondly, One of the arguments against giving the right to carry arms to adults is that the public isn't ready to handle the responsibility of a gun, and that they might take to shooting and use the tool made for self-defence to harm other innocent civilians, but, most of the adults who own concealed handguns are law abiding. This is proved by the fact that according to a report by engineering statistician William Sturdevant published on the Texas Concealed Handgun Association website, the general public is now 5.7 times less likely to be arrested for violent offenses, and 13.5 times less likely to be arrested for non-violent offenses, in comparison to before. This, therefore, refutes any argument about the public not being able to handle the responsibilities of a gun. I now give the (online)stage to my opponent, and wish him/her good luck.",

            "premise": "To start out carrying a concealed handgun in public is permitted in all 50 states as of 2013, when Illinois became the last state to enact concealed carry legislation. Some states require gun owners to obtain permits while others have \"unrestricted carry\" and do not require permits. Proponents of concealed carry say that criminals are less likely to attack someone they believe to be armed. They cite the 2nd Amendment's \"right of the people to keep and bear arms,\" and argue that most adults who legally carry a concealed gun are law-abiding and do not misuse their firearms. Opponents of concealed carry argue that increased gun ownership leads to more gun crime and unintended gun injuries. They contend that concealed handguns increase the chances of arguments becoming lethal, and that society would be safer with fewer guns on the street, not more. The only state/district in the USA that prohibits carrying and concealing firearms (Washington DC) has more than double the highest violent crime rate in the US. This does not include American Samoa and the north Mariana islands. SOURCES:/ http://www.usacarry.com... https://www.census.gov...",

            "conclusion": "Right-to-Carry",
            "premise": "States with right-to-carry laws have lower overall violent crime rates, compared to states without right-to-carry laws. In states whose laws respect the citizen's right-to-carry guns for self defense the total violent crime is 13% lower, homicide is 3% lower, robbery is 26% lower and aggravated assault is 7% lower. (Data: Crime in the United States 1996, FBI Uniform Crime Reports) Right-to-carry license holders are more law-abiding than the general public. In Florida, for example, the firearm crime rate among license holders, annually averaging only several crimes per 100,000 licensees, is a fraction of the rate for the state as a whole. Since the carry law went into effect in 1987, less than 0.02% of Florida carry permits have been revoked because of gun crimes committed by license holders. (Florida Dept. of State) Research reports printed in \"More Guns, Less Crime\", John R. Lott, Jr., the John M. Olin Visiting Law and Economics Fellow at the University of Chicago, examined data ranging from gun ownership polls to FBI crime rate data for each of the nation's 3.045 counties over a 1977 too 1994 time span. Lott's research amounts to the largest data set that has ever been put together for any study of crime, let alone for the study of gun control. Among Prof. Lott's findings: While arrest and conviction rates being the most important factors influencing crime.... non discretionary concealed-handgun laws are also important, and they are the most cost-effective means of reducing crime. Non discretionary or \"shall-issue\" carry permit laws reduce violent crime for two reasons. They reduce the number of attempted crimes because criminals can't tell which potential victims are armed, being able to defend themselves. Secondly, victims who do have guns are in a much better position to defend themselves. Concealed carry laws deter crime because they increase the criminal's risk of doing business. States with the largest increases in gun ownership also have the largest decreases in violent crime. And, it is high crime, urban areas, and neighborhoods with large minority populations that experience the greatest reductions in violent crime when law-abiding citizens are allowed to carry concealed handguns. There is a strong relationship between the number of law-abiding citizens with permits and the crime rate--as more people obtain permits there is a greater decline in violent crime rates. For each additional year that a concealed handgun law is in effect the murder rate declines by 3%, rape by 2% and robberies by more than 2%. Murder rates decline when either more women or more men carry concealed handguns, but the effect is especially pronounced for women. An additional woman carrying a concealed handgun reduces the murder rate for women by about three to four times more than an additional man carrying a concealed handgun reduces the rate for men. The benefits of concealed handguns are not limited to those who carry them. Others get a free ride from the crime fighting efforts of their fellow citizens. The benefits of right-to-carry are not limited to people who share the characteristics of those who carry the guns. The most obvious example of this \"halo\" effect, is the drop in murders of children following the adoption of non discretionary laws. Arming older people not only may provide direct protection to these children, but also causes criminals to leave the area. The increased presence of concealed handguns \"does not raise the number of accidental deaths or suicides from handguns.\" thanks charles h mousseau jr NRA member",

And if the gun owner actually got to the point where he had to use it, most likely it would go wrong. Police take weeks, maybe even months to train with their guns, while gun owners usually train for a day or two. Also what would happen if that gun went off accidentally? Someone or some people could be seriously injured or worse killed. Leave the gun handling to the professionals.

            "premise": "\"If I see any semantics on this point you automatically lose.If there is any semantics with the title, you automatically lose.If you use semantics on the following definition, or this sentence, you lose:\"Concealed carry, or CCW (carrying a concealed weapon), refers to the practice of carrying a handgun or other weapon in public in a concealed manner, either on one's person or in proximity.\"http://en.wikipedia.org......The definition on conceal carry handgun laws is common knowledge, so no trolling.\"My opponent is clearly opposed to semantics, a sentiment I share. He has, however, failed to define an important term in this round: \"concealed carry handgun laws.\" He defined \"concealed carry, or CCW\" but neglected to discuss the \"law\" component of his proposition. Thus, I will take the liberty of defining this term to be \"any law which imposes limits or restrictions on concealed handgun carry.\" I feel that this definition is fair and reasonable, and will result in an educational, fruitful debate.\"No semantics, on the things mentioned above. If you do auto FFNo trolling, sorry imabench ;) [or the real trolls] If you do auto FF1st round acceptance, if you fail to do this I get conduct.1st round definitions, rule making (by instigator) and other things, no arguments.\"I agree to abide by these rules.\"Violent crime: rape, murder, assault, robberyBOP even.I need to prove 3/4 of the things above, and that definition expanded as long as it is actually considered violent crime.Neither side must prove 100% decrease or increase. But voters, look in who makes it more convincing.Good luck!!\"I also accept these definitions and stipulations, and wish my opponent the best of luck.I will now discuss the proposition itself: that concealed carry handgun laws (as previously defined) reduce violent crime.My opponent's support for this is rather brief and lacking in substance. I will take the time to refute it before continuing on to my case. His argument is as follows:\"I am NOT saying the law itself reduces crime, but its outcome does. The reasoning here is clear.\"This argument is a non sequitur, as the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The first premise in his argument is that \"the law does not reduce crime (A)\". I entirely agree with this, as laws in and of themselves are powerless. It is the enforcement of the law, not the law itself, that determines the outcome or effect of said law. However, the conclusion, \"the outcome of concealed carry handgun laws reduces violent crime (C)\", does not follow from premise (A). This is because my opponent is assuming the second premise - that \"concealed carry handgun laws will be successfully enforced (B)\". This premise, unlike premise (A), is woefully false. It is naive to assume that just because concealed carry handgun laws are enacted, we will be able to enforce them by ensuring that nobody carries a handgun. Admittedly, lawful citizens who wish to carry a handgun will be refused the opportunity to do so, but the illegal gun trade affords criminals the opportunity to acquire weapons (including handguns) and proceed to carry them concealed. Because the illegal gun trade and the concealed carry of a small handgun are both impossible to enforce completely, the outcome of concealed carry handgun laws will not match up to their intent. While the intent is noble - to eradicate handguns from the streets completely - the enforcement of concealed carry laws cannot ensure that criminals do not carry concealed handguns.I will now discuss my case, which is composed of 4 contentions:Contention 1: Concealed Carry Handgun Laws increase violent crime.I support this contention with historical, empirical data.\"During the years in which the D.C. handgun ban and trigger lock law was in effect, the Washington, D.C. murder rate averaged 73% higher than it was at the outset of the law, while the U.S. murder rate averaged 11% lower.\" [1]\"In 1997, Britain passed a law requiring civilians to surrender almost all privately owned handguns to the police. More than 162,000 handguns and 1.5 million pounds of ammunition were \"compulsorily surrendered\" by February 1998. Using \"records of firearms held on firearms certificates,\" police accounted for all but fewer than eight of all legally owned handguns in England, Scotland, and Wales. ...the British homicide rate has averaged 52% higher since the outset of the 1968 gun control law and 15% higher since the outset of the 1997 handgun ban.\" [1]\"In 1982, the city of Chicago instituted a ban on handguns. This ban barred civilians from possessing handguns except for those registered with the city government prior to enactment of the law. The law also specified that such handguns had to be re-registered every two years or owners would forfeit their right to possess them. In 1994, the law was amended to require annual re-registration. ...Since the outset of the Chicago handgun ban, the Chicago murder rate has averaged 17% lower than it was before the law took effect, while the U.S. murder rate has averaged 25% lower. Since the outset of the Chicago handgun ban, the percentage of Chicago murders committed with handguns has averaged about 40% higher than it was before the law took effect.\" [1]Contention 2: Concealed Carry Handgun Laws are Unconstitutional.The 2nd Amendment of the Constitution provides that \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Clearly, by their very nature, concealed carry handgun laws infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms, because these laws limit citizens' access to handguns. This position is supported by the Supreme Court, which struck both the DC and Chicago handgun bans on grounds of Constitutionality.Contention 3: Concealed Carry Handgun Laws Protect the Innocent.While one may think that concealed carry laws remove guns and thereby protect the innocent from harm, the opposite is true. As I discussed in my refutation of my opponent's argument, the enforcement gap essentially disarms the law-abiding citizens while leaving the criminals unaffected. The result is a world where armed criminals can shoot and kill unarmed and helpless citizens. This contention is supported by a poll done on felons in the United States:\"A 1982 survey of male felons in 11 state prisons dispersed across the U.S. found: \u2022 34% had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\" \u2022 40% had decided not to commit a crime because they \"knew or believed that the victim was carrying a gun\" \u2022 69% personally knew other criminals who had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\"\" [1]As you can see, handguns can aid innocent people by giving them protection from armed (or unarmed) criminals.Contention 4: Concealed Carry Handgun Laws Weaken the United States.We see this in two points:Point A: Handguns (and other guns) preserve American accountability.This nation was founded on the principle that government is evil and must be held in check by the people. By limiting access to handguns, concealed carry laws forfeit the people's ability to protect themselves from a potentially oppresive government.Point B: Handguns (and other guns) preserve American strength.The US has 3 million military personnel, half of which are active. But even this number pales in comparison to the over-300-million people in the United States. One of the reasons why the 2nd amendment was drafted was to protect America from foreign invasion and by restricting access to handguns, my opponent would decrease the capabilities of America's most reliable and most important defense: its people.In light of this, I urge a CON ballot and eagerly await my opponent's response.[1]\"Gun Control Facts.\" By James D.

            "premise": "Unfortunately, it is clear that we agree.Furthermore, it is obvious that this disagreement stems from a misinterpretation of the term \"concealed carry handgun laws\", which I defined in round 1, contrary to the definition that my opponent never provided, but was apparently assuming. For clafification, the definition that I provided, and which was not responded to, was that a concealed carry handgun law is \"any law which imposes limits or restrictions on concealed handgun carry.\" My reasoning for assuming my definition are as follows:Without any \"concealed carry handgun law\", there would be no laws regarding concealed carry. And just as there are no laws regarding changing lightbulbs, everybody would be free to concealed carry (or change lightbulbs, whatever floats your boat) in absence of a \"concealed carry law\". Upon introducing such a law, the only way to go is downhill - in other words, if we can concealed carry with no limitations when there is no law, it follows that any \"concealed carry handgun laws\" would result in the opposite of that - restrictions on concealed carry.In light of this reasoning, it is more sensible to label the PRO side as arguing the position that concealed carry laws (which restrict concealed carry) reduce violent crime, and to label the CON side as arguing the position that these laws increase violent crime. Thus, our mutual agreement should result in a CON vote.Also, my opponent's failure to provide a concrete definition of the most important term in this round is detrimental to this debate. Not only did it result in a debate with no clash, but by choosing a resolution that was vague and undefined, my opponent could choose to agree with whichever side I picked. In other words, since the resolution is so vague, had I argued that concealed carry restrictions decrease crime, he could have easily said \"I agree with that!\" This ambiguity is harmful to debate, and is another reason to vote CON.In conclusion, I have established that the vagueness of the resolution and definitions provided (or not provided) by the instigator essentially render fruitful debate impossible. Additionally, if you define \"concealed carry handgun laws\" as I have, for the reasons I provided, our mutual agreement is agreement with the CON side. I therefore urge a CON ballot.I wish my opponent the best of luck in creating concrete, precise resolutions in the future.",

            "conclusion": "Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for creating this debate. First off, my opponent offers a definition of right to carry: \"mean the ability to have a concealed firearm on said persons in public areas.\" I concede to this definition and would like to have it now noted that the affirmation has to abide in this definition in evidence and arguements. Example of Campus allowing concealed carry, and then not allowing concealed carry. Board Chairman Patrick McConathy explained the board's decision to disarm all law abiding adults on campus by stating that the \"members of the CSU system board believe this is a reasonable, rational and responsible decision for our system.\" The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators agreed, stating \"there is no credible statistical evidence demonstrating that laws allowing the carrying of concealed firearms reduce crime.\" My opponent suggests that if, in referrence to the Columbine Shooting, people were armed there could have been a halt to the shootings. We actually do not know this. In an experiment by 20/20, selected students from a college were chosen to take part. The students, varying from age, fire-arm training, and ethnicity were given a pistol loaded with paintballs and told to sit in a lecture hall with other students listening to a class session. (Note, one at a time these students were tested). The subjects were told that they would need to use a gun to defend themselves, but not when. When the attackers barged through the door, none of the subjects could kill or even down the intruder before being shot and killed. This experiment suggests that even if people were armed at the Columbine Shooting, they could never recieve the training needed to act accordingly in a life or death situation. My opponent mentions earlier that I neglected that he stated, \"with correct instruction\". However, as I have shown, one can never fully prepare themselves in life or death cases such as this. Even then, you can't expect the instructee to pay full attention. Example, driver liscenses. Teenagers are required to take a test and go through training, but why do teenagers make up the most of the car crashes that are reported in the United States? Because you can not fully know what the intentions are of a person when they want to get something. My opponent provides this as evidence. \"Florida enacted a right to carry law in 1987, these are the statistics of crimes rates in Florida to the rest of United States from 1987 to 1997 Homicide rate dropped 36% in Florida and went down .4% as United states as a whole. Firearm Homicide rate dropped 37% and went up 15% as a nation. Handgun Homicide rate dropped 41 & and went up 24% as a nation. 1998 NRA Fact Card.\" Viewed in January of 1999 on the National Rifle Association web site, http://www.nra.org...; I would like to ask first off, is this a concealed carry law? I can't affirm that because the source my opponent provided is blocked on my webbrowser. Second off, in order for this to work in favor of my opponents case, it must be assumed that every number in this piece of evidence is in direct correllation with the Right to Carry Law enacted by Florida in 1987. With that aside, notice these pieces of statistics that contradict my opponents case: \"Firearm Homicide rate dropped 37% and went up 15% as a nation. Handgun Homicide rate dropped 41 & and went up 24% as a nation.\" As a result of the Right to Carry Law, Firearm Homicide went up 15% as a nation? Handgun Homicide up 24%? The increase of homicides in these areas, which relate to the resolution, show that because of this Law, homicides went up. The increase of homicides in 49 states, far outweighs the decrease in 1. \"If you believe that giving a gun to some one to carry might cause crime rates to go up then, from 1987 to 1999 221443 right to carry permits where given out, out of those 220000 plus people only 18 crimes where committed by these persons.\" (Lott, John R. Jr. and Mustard, David B. \"Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns.\" University of Chicago School of Law, 7/26/96.) I would like to note that there is a fallacy within this piece of evidence listed above. If this evidence came from the source posted after it, then it is not credible. The book was written in 7/26/96, so the year 1996. The evidence notes that it incorporates statistics from 1987 to 1999. Because this is an obvious contradiction, unless I am mistaken, this piece of evidence is not credible and can not be used. I will now state my opinion. It is the job of the government to protect our rights. To protect our natural rights. How is this justified if the government allows all of the nation to carry weapons? How safe will our society feel then? It is the obligation of the people to give up a portion of their freedom so that they can have the government protect their rights. Examples of this are the United States Navy, Army, Airforce, State Police, and County Police. By advocating for concealed weapon carry, one is saying that the government is not doing their job in protecting the rights of America. What would the need of a sheriff be, if every person in town carried a weapon. It would not turn our country into a safe haven. Likewise, concealed carry laws would create tension among everyone. My opponent advocates concealed carry. It can be the will of the negation to propose a better fitting solution. Since concealed carry is extremely unreasonable, I advocate for the allowing of weapons to be allowed in houses, but not concealed carry. I believe that in this respect, no one feels tension of being shot in public, because the guns are in the houses. I believe that this is a more suitable explanation of how it can reduce crime better than concealed carry. =Experiment= 20/20 provided another experiment. They sent one of their correspondents into a gun show, with no gun liscence and a set budget. Within a few hours, the man had purchased several firearms, without ever being asked for his liscence. This shows that if someone wanted a gun, they could get a gun. Concealed carry will inevitably create a negative effect and cause tension among people, it will also allow people with hurtful intentions to easily aquire a firearm. I understand that I have not posted any sources, aside from 20/20. That is because my computer has blocked every website that has to do with guns. I have disproved one of my opponents sources, which should hurt his credibility somewhat. For these reasons and many others, I still stand in firm negation of the resolution.",

The resolution states:\"Conceal handgun laws reduce violent crime\"\"You can see my logic in my round 2 post, where I compared \"concealed carry handgun laws\" to \"lightbulb changing laws\". Obviously, in the absence of concealed carry laws, we are free to concealed carry. So what happens when we introduce \"concealed carry handgun laws\"? Either nothing changes, or these laws place some kind of restriction on concealed carry.

My opponent basically uses logic that does not exist nor relate to the resolution.\"It is clear that my opponent is arguing for the resolution, but he is not PRO \"conceal handguns reducing crime\". He is PRO \"conceal handgun laws reduce violent crime\". Concealed handguns are a far cry from laws regarding concealed handguns, and so he is clearly arguing a different resolution.\"I also clarified with my source page, as many of my sources easily explain my position. Look at this source:Lott, John R. More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun-control Laws. 3rd ed. Vol. 1. Chicago: University of Chicago, 2010. Print.If I was arguing that it raised crime the book \"more guns less crime\" woudl not be a source.\"Unfortunately, he introduced this source after the first round, at a time when it is too late to be clarifying his true stance. In fact, I introduced my sources before he introduced his, which (by this \"whoever clarifies what they're really arguing first wins\" logic) means that I should win. But that's not how debate works. We need to know the bounds of the resolution before the instigator makes them up in the second round by using a certain source.\"Also, I am the instigator, my opponent thinks he knows more about the debate, when he is a newcomer to DDO and I made the debate myself. Anyone that read the resolution then reads I am pro would logically assume I am arguing that it decreases crime.\"Yes, my opponent is logically arguing the PRO side of the resolution. I am not that stupid (nor am I new to debate, I have debated team policy debate in high school for several years). However, my opponent says \"I am arguing that it [concealed carry handgun laws] decreases crime\" without defining \"it\" in the first place. He fails to define concealed carry handgun laws, expects me to know what they are, and then rejects my reasonable definition in favor of his non-existant definition.\"he states: \"Also, my opponent's failure to provide a concrete definition of the most important term in this round is detrimental to this debate.\"No semantics, on the things mentioned above. If you do auto FF - Rule oneOne of the things you will not semanticise is definitions, whether or not who wins my opponents red herring argument, he already auto FF'd/\"My arguments are not semantics. I am merely stating that good definitions are neccessary for good debate, and that my opponent has failed to provide good definitions and has rejected the good definition that I provided.Wrapping up, my opponent does not acknowledge that definitions are crucial to debate. Instead, he issues an incredibly vague and ambiguous resolution and clarifies his position in the second round, leaving me in the dark all the while. Vote against vague resolutions, vote against bad debate, and vote against the instigator.",

            "premise": "Being Side Con, I wish to counter my opponent\"s claim that private citizens should be allowed to carry firearms. I concur with my opponent\"s criterion for judging this debate and ask all voters to not consider any outside information not explicitly brought up in the debate or the sources. That being said, Side Con\"s three contentions are as follows: 1. Concealed firearm use leads to lethal violent crime. 2. Concealed firearms easily find their way into the hands of convicted felons. 3. Concealed firearms are not adequate self-defense. Contention 1: Concealed firearms lead to lethal violent crime. The NRA loves telling the public stories of heroic storeowners hiding guns in their desks, successfully taking down thieves and various other assailants with lethal or non-lethal blows. Concealed firearms are thus portrayed as saviors. The NRA, however, does not tell every story. Meet Philip Davis, an Alabama police officer on duty on December 3rd, 2009. Davis pulls over pharmacist Bart Johnson for speeding. As Davis gave Johnson his ticket, Johnson \"fired one shot\" (1) from a concealed firearm, killing Davis instantly. Johnson had \"obtained a concealed weapons permit in 2007,\" a permit he had renewed in 2009. Davis is one of 516 people killed by individuals with concealed weapons, weapons legally concealed (2). Looking at an even broader scale, we find an alarming amount of violence arising from handgun use. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, handguns were the weapons used in 70% to 80% of all homicides committed from 1993 to 2011 (3). Using the lower number, 70%, we can therefore estimate criminals killed 148,676 people with handguns. And this does not include non-lethal shootings, nor the violence of the past year. Considering the weapons themselves, we find a very dangerous prospect: handguns are exceedingly easy to use. This is not to say a knife or a baseball bat cannot be deadly, but a semi-automatic handgun has a greater range and ease of use than either. All one needs to do is pull back a safety and pull the trigger repeatedly. Furthermore, the clip size of handguns can lead to multiple deaths in mere seconds. An AR-24 Armalite 9mm pistol has a 15 magazine; assuming the gun-wielder is a poor marksman, needing two shots to kill someone, he/she could still take out 7 people (4). So how does this link to the resolution? Quite simply, as useful as concealed firearms seem for self-defense, they are definitely used for criminal, homicidal purposes. They are a threat to public safety. And though some lives have been saved by handguns, just as many, if not more, have been lost. Contention 2: Concealed firearms easily find their way into the hands of convicted felons. Most would not have a problem with law-abiding citizens owning a concealed handgun. Yet, often times, the handgun user is NOT a law-abiding citizen, but a convicted criminal regaining his/her gun rights. Several states, such as Washington and Cleveland, allow released felons to regain their gun rights as long as minimal requirements have been met. Since 1995, 3,300 convicted felons in Washington have regained their gun rights (5). 13% of these felons have engaged in further criminal activity with these firearms including first-degree murder, drive-by-shootings, and child rape. The process barring these individuals from acquiring firearms is atrocious. Aside from those felons incarcerated for first-degree murder and other such crimes, \"judges have no discretion to reject petitions\" (5) for criminals regaining their gun rights. The federal government can do little to stop this gun proliferation; due to the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the federal government must leave gun restoration policy to the states. And, as we've seen, many of them are not doing good jobs. Contention 3: Concealed firearms are not adequate self-defense As this contention clashes directly with my opponent\"s first contention, this suffices to rebut his argument. First, we must realize guns are rarely used for self-defense. The NRA claims guns have been used to stop approximately 2.5 million crimes a year; analysis by the National Crime Victimization survey actually finds handguns are used for self-defense a mere 67,470 a year. In 2010 alone, there were 8,275 firearms based homicides, as compared to 230 justifiable self-defense homicides (6). My opponent brings up an alleged deterrent effect, as \"criminals never know who is armed.\" There are a few problems with this analysis. First off, an exposed firearm is far more intimidating than a concealed one. If anyone saw someone with a Glock strapped to his/her ankle, they would likely stay away. Second, this analysis assumes every criminal will make the logical step, assuming anyone might have a gun. This is far from likely. If a criminal is mentally ill, he is not likely to take this logical step. The same applies to a criminal addicted to malevolent substances, such as PCP. This also ignores criminal desperation; if a criminal needs the money to satisfy a drug addiction, or even to put bread on the table, he will disregard the possibility of any random person having a gun. Finally, my opponent cites the research of Dr. John Lott, a \"shall-issue\" law enthusiast whose research is often cited by pro-gun advocates. Yet there are flaws in Lott\"s analysis as well. We must consider the possibility of a conflict of interest, as Lott\"s research was funded by the Olin Foundation, a subsidiary of the Olin Corporation, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the country. Secondly, Lott based his theories on econometric data points, rather than psychological data taken from case studies, surveys, and experiments with criminals; the latter data is far more compelling. Even if we look at the study itself, a revised data set of Lott\"s study indicated the effect of \"right-to-carry laws\" had no statistical significance (7) on violent crime. Thus, this change was due to factors beyond the controls established by Lott\"s analysis. Finally, concealed handguns have limited stopping power and poor accuracy in the hands of an untrained marksman. The entry and exit wound on handguns is smaller than for other weapons. Most don\"t have a scope.. Even gun advocate Chris Bird notes a handgun is \"the least effective fire-arm for self-defense\" (8). Since these weapons are so rarely used for self-defense, rarely deter criminals, and are poor self-defense items in the first place, right to carry laws are not the best way to promote public safety. With this in mind, I would like to refute my opponent\"s other argument, his second contention; Pro Contention 2: The public isn't ready to handle gun responsibility. I will keep this refutation brief for sake of clash in other rounds, but the main issue with my opponent's argument is a false correlation. Not only does correlation not assume causation, but the statistics my opponent asserts may not even have to deal with gun responsibility. The statistics only suggest people are less likely to be arrested for violent crime. This does not mean people are \"better\" or \"more responsible.\" Dozens of other factors come into play. The recent economic crisis (thus limiting funds to purchase guns), the possibility of increased law enforcement, or decreases in drug abuse could all be responsible for this trend. The confounding variables severely hamper the validity of these statistics. With that, I close the first round.

            "premise": "First of all, thank you for debating me. While we completely disagree on this issue (and evidently many others from a view at your profile), it'll give us each an opportunity to express our beliefs in a fun, educational manner. You mentioned in your post that it would make you very uneasy to know that anybody walking around you might have a concealed firearm. What about when you walk out in public at stores, restaurants, and maybe even work? There's a good chance that you have passed many people who are concealing, and college campuses should not be different from any of these other establishments. The people with the CC permit are responsible and have had much training and extensive background checking to ensure that they are of sound body and mind. Here is a list of what most states require: \u2022 The holder being at least 21 years of age \u2022 No felony convictions; or Class A or B misdemeanors within 5 years \u2022 No domestic violence conviction \u2022 Being a legal citizen of the United States \u2022 Not chemically dependent (ie. Known alchoholic or drug user) \u2022 Not delinquent in child support payments \u2022 Is legally allowed to purchase a handgun \u2022 Has no court protective order or restraining orders against them \u2022 Has not been diagnosed by a physician as suffering from a major psychiatric disorder or hospitalized for psychiatric problems While these requirements do not guarantee anything, they set a very low possibility of the wrong people getting their hands on a permit. I am confident that one clean shot is an attainable goal for a skilled shooter and would not be an issue, regardless of how stressful the situation. The assertion you made about these folks loosing their concentration tells me that you personally have had little or no experience using a firearm. While it is possible that a crazy criminal(and very tricky one at that) could get their hands on a CC permit, why would they go to the trouble. If they're crazy enough to shoot someone, than who cares if they have a permit or not, they're going to shoot someone either way - permit to carry a gun or not. A look at the statistics shows that more guns does equal less crime. While it is simple to say fighting fire with fire won't work, it simply isn't true. Since the fall semester of 2006, state law in Utah has allowed licensed individuals to carry concealed handguns on the campuses of all public colleges. Also, concealed carry has been allowed for several years at both Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) and Blue Ridge Community College (Weyers Cave, VA). This has yet to result in a single act of violence at any of these schools. Numerous studies, including studies by University of Maryland senior research scientist John Lott, University of Georgia professor David Mustard, engineering statistician William Sturdevant, and various state agencies, show that concealed handgun license holders are five times LESS likely than non-license holders to be arrested for violent crimes. I agree with you that when the Founding Fathers wrote the Right to Bear Arms amendment, they were not thinking about schools. However, these are VERY different times. The thought of a student taking a gun into a school back then never even crossed their minds. The idea that did cross their mind was the right for citizens to protect themselves from danger regardless of their location, and that's exactly what allowing guns on campuses will do.",

            "conclusion": "Concealed carry laws help reduce violent crime",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for hosting this debate. I will show that concealed carry laws do not reduce violent crime in any significant, measurable way. Many states have \"shall issue\" laws, mainly because it is considered a fundamental right. I am not against this. However, the idea that such laws actually reduce crime is an illusion. Although there may be a deterrent effect of concealed carry laws, there are also other effects that cause an increase of violent crime. Let me mention a few: Obviously, concealed weapons are used in crimes. Take for example road rage. Michael Dunn, a concealed weapon carrier, was convicted of first degree murder when he shot into an SUV with teenagers because of loud music. Nearby in my state Michigan, a father was shot in front of his family after a road rage confrontation with a concealed carry permit holder [4]. Murder by CCW holders are relatively rare, but they do happen. Another, in my opinion more important, factor is that concealed carry laws leads to more risky and confrontational behavior of the concealed weapon carrier. Studies have shown that carrying a weapon makes a person more paranoid [2]. Take for example the well publicized George Zimmermann case [3]. He followed Trayvon Martin which led to a violent confrontation. A violent crime was committed, although one may argue who the perpetrator was. It seems unlikely that Zimmermann would have followed Martin had he not been armed. The (false) sense of security of a concealed weapon may lead to more confrontational behavior that can lead to violent crime, but the concealed carrier, or by someone else. Almost all studies do not take this kind of behavior change into account. Criminals have several choices. Instead of being deterred, they could also react to a concealed carry law by arming themselves more, to have the upper hand in a possible confrontation. Such behavior would lead to more violent crime. This effect has also not been taken into account in all the studies that have been cited. In particular, deterrence theory will give only a lopsided picture, because it assumes that the criminal only has 2 choices, either commit a crime, or not. So now we have some reasons of why concealed carry laws may increase violent crime, and also one reason why it might reduce violent crime. So which effect is greater? The National Academy of Sciences, THE authority in science matters, reviewed the science on this question (including the work of John Lott) and found \"There is no credible evidence that \"right-to-carry\" laws, which allow qualified adults to carry concealed handguns, either decrease or increase violent crime.\" [5] The Academy studied 253 scientific journal articles, 99 books and 43 government publications.

Open carry is better Accidents Note the resolution states violent crime, and only his open carry (deterrence) applies. I will refute them all, though, as these gun myths annoy me. --> why cant I know? The question is why should you care, CCW permit holders are law abiding. --> Open carry He starts out with I do not want a phsyciatrist with a gun. Well first there are many requirements to obtain a gun. Most of which prevent this. Here they are: 21 years of age Backround check Mental check Training This lowers the point largely. Meaning it is statistically impossible. Also, note his argumentation here is an appeal to probability fallacy. He takes a probability (which is very low, and of the millions of permit holders not one has done anything) he assumes it to be absolute. Therefore his argunment is null and void. Now open carry would not deter. At all. They know whose armed and who to avoid. They will see the gun and waltz away. Now with concealed carry they don't know whose armed. In open carry the risk is seen and avoided, no risk. With concealed they can't avoid it. They can't say \"look she's armed\" and leave without a scratch. I'm conceal carry they have to guess. Guess where they are. If they mess up they get shot. The logic is clear? \"The case for concealed handgun use is similar. The use of concealed handguns by some law-abiding citizens may create a positive externality for others. By the very nature of these guns being concealed, criminals are un- able to tell whether the victim is armed before they strike, thus raising crim- inals' expected costs for committing many types of crimes\"(1) Even if it deter it is a red herring as it does not prove CCW is bad. --> Accidents 1. Irrelevant, this has nothing to do with violent crime. 2. Never has happened, I am not denying it won't happen, but it has never happened 3. Does not hurt anyone. Watch: 0 CCW accidents have occurred (that involve death). Pretend 100 have happened, 10 in death. 10 dead because of the law. **also note (FYI) police accidentally kill 350 ppl every year. Wanna ban police? The reduction in murders with CCW was 8 times higher then the accidental death rate. (1) Let's make it into numbers you can understand. Small city of 1000 people. 10 deaths via accident 80 lives saved (minus 10) = 70 lives saved 7% decrease in murder with these fake numbers based on real ones.(1) Meaning lives are saved. -summary- 1 First con arg irrelevant 2 fallictic and refuted 3 irrelevant and refuted -my opponent dropped my argunments- Detterence Data -> aka he dropped all of it Args - pro his case is irrelevant and was refuted.

            "conclusion": "Right to carry arms",
            "premise": "As my opponent forfeited the previous round, the final round of debate, it is my job to formally end this debate. Since this is the final speech of the round, I would like to condense all the issues in this debate into two central questions. 1. Do concealed handguns deter criminals from crime? 2. Do concealed handguns save more people than they kill? On Side Con, I proudly believe the answer to both questions is NO; Side Con has a clear COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE on both of these issues. With that in mind, let\"s examine the first question: 1. Do concealed handguns deter criminals from crime? As my opponent brought up in his first speech, \"Criminals are less likely to attack someone that they believe might be armed.\" The logic is simple: \"if anyone could have a gun, then I shouldn\"t attack anyone for fear he/she might pull a gun on me.\" The Instigator then defended this point with studies from Dr. John Lott. Yet, as we saw in my previous two speeches, my opponent\"s logic does not hold up. First and foremost, Dr. John Lott\"s studies have been found invalid due to a lack of statistical significance. The findings he had could have just as easily arisen from pure luck due to a large number of confounding variables in his study. The controversy behind the funding of his research is only a cherry on top. Furthermore, my opponent did not adequately respond to arguments put forth in the 1st and 2nd Con speech: openly shown firearms are a far more effective deterrent. Once again, whom would you rather rob? The old lady who might have a gun or the old lady who has a gun? The answer is clear. My opponent also ignores the psychological elements of crime, such as criminal desperation and drug addiction. Many won\"t make the logical leaps my opponent assumes they will. The conclusion is simple. In a shall-issue law world, there will still be muggings, rapes, and murders. There are better, safer alternatives to this scenario my opponent failed to refute. With this in mind, we can safely say the answer to this first question is NO, favoring Side Con. 2. Do concealed handguns save more people than they kill? There has been a slight back-and-forth over this issue over the course of debate. Yet, looking over the previous two speeches, Con definitively emerged triumphant. The comparisons Side Pro made in Round 2 between the VPC and David Burnett were not \"apples-to-apples\" comparisons, as noted in Side Con\"s Round 2 speech. To this day, individuals with legal concealed weapons permits kill citizens across the country. Such records are often incomplete, as not all crimes are reported. People such as Philip Davis have no chance to flee, giving the ease of use of a concealed handgun. My opponent claims \"citizens should have the same advantages as the criminals who attack them.\" While, ideally, neither the criminal nor the average citizen should have a gun in the first place, a concealed weapons permit makes it far easier to kill a person with malicious intent than to defend oneself from an attacker. As discussed in Con\"s Round 1 speech, the most common concealed handguns, namely the 9mm, are horrendous for self-defense. While they are rapid fire, the stopping power is minimal, especially when put in the hands of an untrained marksman. A criminal, on the other hand, is more likely to use the handgun as a threat, holding someone up for valuables. Or, if murder is the design, the criminal is far more likely to have practiced using the gun than the everyday citizen. These handguns are far more practical as murder weapons than self-defense. This point was not questioned at ALL by Side Pro. Side Pro also failed to properly refute Con\"s second contention: convicted felons do regain their gun rights, and do kill again. In Washington ALONE, 429 felons have engaged in crime after regaining their gun rights, using their weapons as either leverage or as murder weapons. Even if denying these people of their gun rights would prevent practically the population of Nebraska from owning concealed handguns, this is still a step towards the safety of the American citizenry. If we look at the deaths and the nature of concealed firearms, we overwhelmingly find the answer to the second question is NO. Thus, who has the comparative advantage? Side Con. Side Pro may like the theory behind \"shall-issue\" laws, but, in practice, these laws have not markedly improved pubic safety. If anything, they make our world LESS safe. As Side Con has repeatedly shown you, voters, concealed firearms should be illegal for US private citizens. So, for the good of restricting gun proliferation, vote Con. For the safety of the American people, vote Con. For the family of Philip Davis, vote Con. Thank you.",

            "premise": "quote = lol. Guns save more lives then they take away.Deterrence (use with argument below)A common misconception throughout Europe is less guns equal less crime, and the same argument applies in current US media, all claiming guns and conceal carry are evil.Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers, as if the gun is hidden they may be attacked back without warning (polices warning is the uniform).Now, lets look at a thing Lott calls a \"hot burglary.\" This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries where hot. In contrast, 13% in america where hot. Now what is the reason? Because they think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Now, lets use some examples of deterrence. Lott uses the literal example of apples and oranges. He says if the price of apples increases while the price of oranges decreases apples sales will decrease, while orange sales will stay the same or increase. This shows the human oh it has consequences effect.Is open carry and conceal carry different, when it comes to deterrence? When a concealed carry permit holder has a gun, it is harder to actually tell if they have a gun. Criminals wont know if they are attacking an old lady, or an old lady packing a .45 Springfield in her purse. This raises the risk to criminals, hence also their preservation. Whereas open carry is much less scary, as you know who not to annoy, and not to annoy anyone around him (as he may help the other person). The conceal carry laws threaten the criminals more.The empirical data Law Passed Murder fell 7.7%, Rape fell 5.3%, Aggravated assault by 7.01%, robbery 2.2%, Burglary .5%, Larceny 3.3%, Auto 7.1%. [1] (1977-1997 data)Other data, his 1999 data, shows a better outcome of a 10% decrease in murder, and the other categories too had a larger decrease in crime, hence CCW in hi later data was slightly revised in new data sets. Lotts early data can be found in #2. Now lets look at PA. They had a drop in murder of about 26%, and overall violent crime drop of 5.3%. Now, one of the criticisms of this basic trend is just because the drop happened after the law, we can also look at other variables, the most common one is arrest rates. Lott makes many dummy variables, tables, and to the best of his ability shows CCW laws where a significant portion of the decrease. [1] Another reasons he concludes the drop is because when there is a spike in people who have permits there is a decrease in violent crimes. To get more local statistics, lets look at his findings in some states. In Oregon, for example, murder dropped 37% after the law was passed. Now, there are other variables he accounted for in the third addition making his data superior to the first. He did other dummy data sets, and still finds CCW had a large portion of the deterrence an drop in crimes. [1] Now, it is logical to assume they actually decrease crime due to my deterrent argument above. The CATO study also finds similar reasons why it would actually decrease crime. They also fund similar accounts of data, and they conclude the Florida CCW law was positive and the other states that passed these laws also had a positive showing. Another question that must be answered: would it increase or decrease mass public crimes? Now, as this is a valid fear, see the recent shootings in Chicago I believe, or Virginia tech. But to define shootings/killings, we must look into what is defined by. It is defined as a public shooting in a place where 2 or more people are killed or injured. Now based n his data in figure 5.1, he found the likelihood of a state to have this happen was about 60%, a little more. After the conceal carry law was passed, data and trends suggests the state now has only a 1% chance of these types of shootings in areas where conceal carry holders are allowed. [1] I may have misphrased the argument here: the likelihood of deaths or injuries when the crime occurs. Essentially saying conceal carry laws make it harder for the psycho to kill when in the area where a conceal carry permit holder resides.Now, another question would be does it lower crime committed with guns? This argument used is common amongst people trying to go against conceal carry laws. But this is not the case. In the new 2010 edition of source 1, it finds a 9% decrease in murders with guns after non-discretionary laws are passed. Murders with non handguns dropped at a similar rate, 8.9%.\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [2] (1997 study)Summary of argument: source: [1], and \"the conceal handgun debate\", john lott.

            "conclusion": "Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime",
            "premise": "Thank you for accepting this debate. I will start my this round by saying that obtaining a firearm is different in every state, it would be unwise to assume that the gun control laws are the same for every state. For instance, in Illinois you must be 18, to legally purchase a long gun (any gun with a barrel longer than 12 inches), and 21 to purchase a pistol. You must also have a FOID (Firearm Owner Identification) card, obtaining a FOID card requires an application to the IL state police where they perform a back ground check, after you have a FOID car you must wait 24 hours after purchasing a gun to pick it up. Logic would presume that this is not an easy way to obtain a firearm. Granted my opening statement was short and open to debate on the argument it would ensue, right to carry has nothing to do with obtaining firearms, that is not what is discussion is about. It is about whether or not right to carry reduces crim my opponent provided no evidence that people who own fire arms that carry them in on them would not reduce crime. Has I am now realizing this being my first debate I should have defined Right to carry, but I believe my opponent to mistaken in his definition, Right to carry mean the ability to have a concealed firearm on said persons in public areas. Housing firearms is merely owning firearms, and due to the fact that in 1993 49% of homes had at least one firearm in them (Study: \"Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun.\" By Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (Northwestern University School of Law), 1995. Accessed at http://www.saf.org....) I do not believe that 13 year old are the main issue when it comes to Right to carry. My opponent also neglected the fact that I stated \"with correct instruction\", I do not have enough time to provide detailed information about gun safety this link should be detailed enough (http://www.nrahq.org...). As for the columbine school shooting, those firearms where obtained by adults and given to young adults who had the intent to cause arm to people, if some one is that determined to cause harm, will have a gun really stop them. Think of any public shooting, however sad they are, could each one have not been stopped if a trained person carried a firearm, could many of lives have not been saved? The argument could be made that couldn't the lives be saved if guns where band, and I would like the audience know that this is not the issue at hand. If my opponent would like to argue that I would be more than happy to right after this. My opponent asked for evidence that crime would actually be reduced well Florida enacted a right to carry law in 1987, these are the statistics of crimes rates in Florida to the rest of United States from 1987 to 1997 Homicide rate dropped 36% in Florida and went down .4% as United states as a whole. Firearm Homicide rate dropped 37% and went up 15% as a nation. Handgun Homicide rate dropped 41 & and went up 24% as a nation. 1998 NRA Fact Card.\" Viewed in January of 1999 on the National Rifle Association web site, http://www.nra.org... If you believe that giving a gun to some one to carry might cause crime rates to go up then, from 1987 to 1999 221443 right to carry permits where given out, out of those 220000 plus people only 18 crimes where committed by these persons. (Lott, John R. Jr. and Mustard, David B. \"Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns.\" University of Chicago School of Law, 7/26/96.) \"As of 1999 no permit holder has ever shot a cop and, in many cases permit holders have protected polices officers life.\" Lott, John R. Jr. More Guns, Less Crime. The University of Chicago Press, 1998. Pages 1, 11, 43 I will hold further arguments for now I apologize for the opening argument, due to the fact that I haven't spent much time reading debates, I viewed it as more of a opening statement to purpose a debate and not an opening argument. But thank you for providing a formidable opponent for this debate.",

That is like saying gasoline should be controlled and only kept available to certain qualified people because there are arsonists that will uses the gasoline to start fires potentially killing people. Qualified citizens having guns is not just a right but the opposite of a problem. Taking away the right to keep and bear arms will only cause more crimes to be committed. People will start illegally importing guns at much more of a vast rate and continue selling them to everyone including murderers or people who should not own guns. Statistics show that when gun control is implemented violent crimes increase. Example: Washington DC Sources: http://gunvictimsaction.org... http://www.justfacts.com...",

            "premise": "**Note my opponent broke the acceptance rule****Note he argued my side.***Rebuttals* C1: Conceal Carry Increases crimeIf you actually read his argument, he is not even relating too conceal carry, rather he is arguing that gun control increases crime, I have no reason to think this helps him on a deterrence aspect. He concedes many of these gun control laws actually increased the crime rate..... So he actually concedes banning guns or controlling them is bad, his argument makes no sense also because it does not even utter a word of conceal carry. C2: Conceal carry laws are unconstitutional My opponent thinks conceal carry laws are unconstitutional, by saying: \"This position is supported by the Supreme Court, which struck both the DC and Chicago handgun bans on grounds of Constitutionality.\" Well, conceal carry does not ban guns... His argument is FALSE AND UNTRUE, if anything conceal carry increases the right to weapons, as it says your allowed to own guns and carry them hidden.... My opponents arguments on gun bans are not true... His case is a red herring!!C3: Protect the innocentI agree, the innocents can now fight back... Your arguing the wrong side. C4: ???Your arguing my side!!! They make us stronger, as first you say gun control and gun bans are bad, conceal carry is less control and more gun freedom!! You are arguing my side. He then goes on guns are good, I agree I think I own over 20. Well guess what, you argued my side. You must argue guns are bad, I stated this: Conceal carry laws reduce crime, I am pro, I am arguing that they REDUCE CRIME. My statement on the NOT was not me saying I argue con. It was saying I dont think a piece of paper does nothing, rather the effects of the law do. Either concede as you argued MY SIDE, or argue that they have no effect on crime or increase it. --Case--Deterrence (use with argument below)A common misconception throughout Europe is less guns equal less crime, and the same argument applies in current US media, all claiming guns and conceal carry are evil.Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers, as if the gun is hidden they may be attacked back without warning (polices warning is the uniform).Now, lets look at a thing Lott calls a \"hot burglary.\" This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries where hot. In contrast, 13% in america where hot. Now what is the reason? Because they think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Now, lets use some examples of deterrence. Lott uses the literal example of apples and oranges. He says if the price of apples increases while the price of oranges decreases apples sales will decrease, while orange sales will stay the same or increase. This shows the human oh it has consequences effect.Is open carry and conceal carry different, when it comes to deterrence? When a concealed carry permit holder has a gun, it is harder to actually tell if they have a gun. Criminals wont know if they are attacking an old lady, or an old lady packing a .45 Springfield in her purse. This raises the risk to criminals, hence also their preservation. Whereas open carry is much less scary, as you know who not to annoy, and not to annoy anyone around him (as he may help the other person). The conceal carry laws threaten the criminals more.Empirical DATALaw Passed Murder fell 7.7%, Rape fell 5.3%, Aggravated assault by 7.01%, robbery 2.2%, Burglary .5%, Larceny 3.3%, Auto 7.1%. [1]He also draws preliminary conclusions in the introduction [note he used to be pro gun control if I can recall] using deterrence theory mentioned above. He finds a significant correlation that whenever a conceal carry law is passed, crime rates decrease significantly. In the third addition, the source I am using, he finds his original study said 7.7%, he says after new data and averages from the state and county level he saw a 10% decrease in murder. He also finds if one state/county passes a conceal carry law, the bordering states and counties also gain a crime decrease. He finds based on assaults per 100,000 people went from about 340 to under 320 on average [based on the neighbors passing the law]. [1] Now before I proceed with the empirical evidence, we must ask why does this occur, why does the county overs laws effect my crime rate? Border wars. When gangs fight they fight each other and attack other bystanders. If the bystanders are armed they are then scared to fight as the victim can always fight back [possibly] without warning if they had a conceal carry license. The famed Lott/mustard paper as well as my #1 source find in each of the studies find if each state passed a conceal carry law, it would prevent:\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [2]Also two other studies confirm the lott results saying \"there is a deterrent when passing conceal carry laws\", and \"the lott mustard data is not biased\", and they acquire and replicate lotts results. [3] [4]Another question that must be answered: would it increase or decrease mass public crimes? Now, as this is a valid fear, see the recent shootings in Chicago I believe, or Virginia tech. But to define shootings/killings, we must look into what is defined by. It is defined as a public shooting in a place where 2 or more people are killed or injured. Now based n his data in figure 5.1, he found the likelihood of a state to have this happen was about 60%, a little more. After the conceal carry law was passed, data and trends suggests the state now has only a 1% chance of these types of shootings in areas where conceal carry holders are allowed. [1] I may have mis-phrased the argument here: the likelihood of deaths or injuries when the crime occurs. Essentially saying conceal carry laws make it harder for the psycho to kill when in the area where a conceal carry permit holder resides.The last question is accidental deaths, it decreases. the suicidal deaths rose by 2.67% after the law, and decreased other methods by 6%. Other statistics show an essential double of that, 4% increase for guns decrease 10% for other methods. http://www.debate.org...http://polyticks.com...CONCLUSION:Conceal carry laws reduce crime, my opponent actually ARGUED THE PRO SIDE, MY SIDE. Vote pro. Like really, with the resoluion and I am pro, I argue it reduces crime, you said it decreased it, therefore conceding. So, please, argue the other side. http://www.debate.org...",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent, Hades, for this debate. I wish her well in this debate. I will presume the debate is in the context of the United States. I will start with some rebuttal. ===CON:=== >>Rather than a protective figure the teachers will become an overpower and feared figure to students.<< ===REBUTTAL:=== I fail to see how this would ultimatley have a net negative effect. Firstly, it will root out any teachers who aren't mentally stable enough to be allowed to teach. It thus shows flaws in the application system for teaching, and therefore countermeasures to prevent such instances are brought in. Secondly, most teachers don't even raise their fists to a student, let alone point a gun at them. ===CON:=== >>Not to say that as many cases before unexpected teachers might use the weapon to intimidate, and impose power over a student.<< ===REBUTTAL:=== I would like my opponent to give proof of such acts. Until then, it has no weight upon the case. ===CON:=== >>My second argument is the economic aspect of this act. Allowing school teachers to carry guns, will lead tot he School Board having to pay for the license, ammunition, and the gun.<< ===REBUTTAL:=== The resolution doesn't imply the state would be obliged to fund the purchase of a handgun for teachers. It states they should have the right to do so. If they have the right, they would be allowed use their firearm in an event of an attack. The idea isn't that all teachers are given a gun. ===CON:=== >>Asides form that will have to reenforce safety like where to store the gun and high explosive ammunitions.<< ===REBUTTAL:=== The gun would obviously have to be kept on the person of the teacher at all times, holstered (They must carry it, as the resolution states). In terms of story \"high explosive ammunitions\", a teacher wouldn't be allowed more than one magazine (The one in the gun) and only standard ammunition, as special ammunition types would not be needed, therefore diminishing the risk of highly explosive ammunition. Now, onto my points: ===PRO ARGUMENT #1: SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND THE TEACHERS:=== Over the years, there have been many school shootings. Here is a map of school shootings in the U.S. : http://www.schoolshooting.org.... The truth of the matter with these shootings is that the police are rarely unable to stop the deaths. There have been cases where the students and/or the teachers top the assailant before excessive harm is done. Such an example is Yitzhak Dadon, at the Mercaz HaRav Massacre (http://www.jpost.com...). He, a student, utilised his handgun to stop the attacker in this scenario. Furthermore, Yitzhak is a 40 year old man, which places him closer to the roel of teacher than student. In the Pearl High School shooting, the assistant principal used his handgun to subdue an attacker who killed 2 and injured 7. However, it took him 5 minutes to reach his car to get his gun because of the Gun Free Zone in the school (http://www.cnn.com...). The above cases support my case that giving teachers the right to have handguns in school is more beneficial than negative.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate. As Robert Cottrol, JD, PhD, Professor of Law and History at George Washington University, wrote in the article \"Gun Control Is Racist, Sexist, and Classist\" published in the Sept. 1999 issue of American Enterprise: \"In recent years a majority of states have passed laws permitting honest citizens to carry concealed weapons, and the results tell us much about self-defense and the responsibility of the average citizen. Once it was passionately argued that such laws would turn minor altercations into bloody shoot-outs; now we know better. Over 1 million Americans have licenses to carry firearms, but firearms misuse by this group has been utterly negligible. Criminologists now debate not how much harm has been caused by concealed-carry laws, but how much good... [A right to bear arms] says the individual is not simply a helpless bystander in the difficult and dangerous task of ensuring his or her safety. Instead, the citizen is an active participant, an equal partner with the state in ensuring not only his own safety but that of his community. This is a serious right for serious people. It takes the individual from servile dependency on the state to the status of participating citizen, capable of making intelligent choices in defense of one's life and ultimately one's freedom. This conception of citizenship recognizes that the ultimate civil right is the right to defend one's own life, that without that right all other rights are meaningless, and that without the means of self-defense the right to self-defense is but an empty promise.\" In other words, concealed carry laws are very beneficial to the community. It allows people to protect others. Here are some statistics from Campuscarry.com: 1. At the start of the 2010 fall semester, 14 Colorado community colleges (38 campuses) began allowing licensed concealed carry on campus. 2. Since the fall semester of 2006, Utah state law has allowed licensed individuals to carry concealed handguns on the campuses of Utah's nine degree-offering public colleges (20 campuses) and one public technical college (10 campuses). 3. Concealed carry has been allowed on the two campuses of Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO, and Pueblo, CO) since 2003 and at Blue Ridge Community College (Weyers Cave, VA) since 1995. 4. After allowing concealed carry on campus for an average of more than three years (as of June 2011), none of these 26 colleges (71 campuses) has seen a single resulting incident of gun violence (including threats and suicides) or a single resulting gun accident. When we look at the concealed carry movement as a whole, from its beginnings in the late 1980s to the present, we see a huge increase in the number of people with carry permits, from around one million in 1987 to around six million today. Now here's the kicker: during this same time frame, violent crime has fallen to record lows in America, hovering nationwide at rates not seen since the early 1960s. Historic numbers of guns in the hands of private citizens, who are increasingly carrying those guns in public, and a dramatic, ongoing drop in violent crime. Now there's something to think about! Tactically speaking, the element of surprise is a great thing. If someone doesn't know you have a firearm, then they can't tactically adjust them selves for that. If they were to try and rob you and you pull a firearm they didn't know about, that surprises most criminals, not all, but most. Something they were not expecting has the potential to rattle cages. Plus when you are out in public I think people are less likely to be jumpy or nervous if they don't see a firearm on your side and no badge on your shirt. Again, not all people would respond that way I wouldn't think, but some might. http://concealedguns.procon.org... http://www.campuscarry.com... http://blog.chegg.com... http://www.usconcealedcarry.net... http://www.usacarry.com...",

            "conclusion": "Concealed Carry Laws Decrease Violent Crime",
            "premise": "We are talking about concealed carry laws in the United States of AmericaViolent Crime:\"A violent crime or crime of violence is a crime in which the offender uses or threatens to use violent force upon the victim. This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective, such as murder, as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end, (including criminal ends) such as robbery.\"MY CASE1. Concealed Carry Laws Deterre CriminalsMany European nations and the US mainstream media believe that less guns means less crime. This is incorrect.Before going into crime, we should ask if concealed carry laws deterre crime. The answer is yes. Many economic studies have found that when increased punishments are given to crime, criminals may not committ the crime because the costs outweigh the benefits of committing the crime. Getting shot is a punishment for committing a crime. Many surveys conducted prove that criminals are more scared of people with guns rather than police officers. You can see a police officer, but you don't if a civilian is carrying a gun. Now let's look at something called \"hot burglary\". Mr. John Lott calls the act of a criminal robbing a house when a person is already at home \"hot burglary\". In the United States, 13% of all the burglaries were hot while in Canada and England almost half thew burglaries were hot. The reason is because people would rather go rob places were they know people have no guns (in England and Canada there are strict gun laws) rather than places were someone might own a gun (in the United States people can have guns in their houses). This proves that criminals fear guns. Concealed carry is also better than open carry. A criminal can see someone openly carry a gun, but he or she cannot see someone carrying a concealed gun. How do you know the person you are going to rob is not armed? This proves that concealed carry is better than open carry. So concealed carry threatens criminals more.2. The Data Proves that Concealed Carry Reduces CrimeThe first data from Mr. Lott, spanning from 1977-1997 shows that murder fell by 7.7%, rape fell by 5.3%, aggravated assault fell by 7.01%, robbery fell by 2.2%, burglary by .5%, larceny by 3.3%, and auto by 7.1%. [2]The second data from Mr. Lott, which is from 1999, shows that murder fell by 10% and the other crimes fell more greately as well. CCW in his later data slightly changed. [3]Let's look at some states. In PA murder fell by about 26% and overall violent crime fell by 5.6%. Mr. Lott has proved that CCW laws specifically caused this decrease. The CATO study also finds this. In FL and many other states. [1,2,3]Both murder with guns and non-guns has dropped considerably from CCW laws (9% and 8.9% respectfully). In addition, CCW laws have prevented mass shooting such as Virginia Tech and then Colorado movie theater. [1]\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [2]The basis of the argument: ConclusionI have proven that concealed carry laws reduce crime rather than increase it through deterrence and data.Sources1. http://en.wikipedia.org...2.

            "conclusion": "Right to carry arms",
            "premise": "In this second Con speech, I will examine the arguments in Pro\"s second speech, demonstrating why they are not as powerful as my opponent believes. I must note my opponent never defended his own arguments. This significant drop should be considered by the voters. All of the arguments put forth against his second contention, namely that of correlation v. causation, still apply. Now, let us examine his rebuttals to Side Con\"s contentions in full. C1: Concealed firearm use leads to lethal violent crime. My opponent first clashes with my critique of NRA reports of self-defense using firearms. He correctly claims this point has nothing to do with Side Pro's argument. The purpose of said paragraph was giving context to the political environment, not to add a false source to side Pro - mere stylistic flair. That being said, Side Pro then produces evidence from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Apparently, there were no murder convictions for Texas permit holders in 1999. My opponent has selectively chosen this number. In that same year (1), CHL holders were found guilty of 4 charges of aggressive assault with a deadly weapon, 1 case of sexual assault, 53 cases of assault causing bodily injury, 15 cases of deadly conduct, 5 terrorism threats, and 34 cases of unlawful carrying of arms. Furthermore, my opponent only looked at statistics from 1999. Considering more recent statistics, namely 2011, there were not only murder convictions, but manslaughter, robbery, child sexual abuse, and multi-murder convictions for CHL holders. There were four murders by CHL holders in 2010 alone. A full swath of CHL holder crimes can be found here (2). My opponent also asserts \"Florida statistics show only 18 crimes involving firearms by license holders, out of 221,443 licenses issued between October 1987 and April 1994.\" This claim only looks at a time period far prior to a more modern, nuanced view of gun proliferation in Florida. Namely, prior to 2005, Florida\"s firearm-involved murder rate never topped 3.5 people per 100,000. Since 2005, the number of murders has been higher. In 2011, 70% of all Florida murders involved handguns. Equally alarming is this fact: though Florida has the most concealed gun permits of any state, it still has the 13th highest firearm-involved murder rate in the state (3). Deterrent? The numbers disagree. Later, in support of his first contention, my opponent brings up a quote by David Burnett: \"We have 153 documented cases across 26 states with at least 550 lives saved.\" At first, this 550 seems 34 lives higher than the 516 killed by CHL holders. Pro seems to win, but the numbers don\"t match up. Burnett\"s research was not confined solely to concealed carry self-defense instances, but ALL self-defense instances in the 153 documented cases. Thus, comparing this number to the 516 is an apples-to-oranges comparison. Under this comparison, Pro\"s self-defense number pales to the total number of ALL handgun murders, including concealed carry murders, a whopping 8,275 in 2010 alone. Burnett's figures for purely concealed carry safety measures are undoubtedly smaller. When the 516 concealed carry murders nearly equal the same number of total self-defense instances found in 26 states, we have a problem. Finally, my opponent claims my statistics involving all handgun deaths are invalid and irrelevant. I profoundly disagree. The resolution states we have a \"right to carry a concealed handgun\" (Pro 1). If that is the case, we must consider the possibility if every person in the US decided to take up that right; otherwise, we would be adopting the resolution without looking through all possibilities, a prospect my opponent fears. Thus, when we look at the total number of handgun murders, we see how the US population tends to use semi-automatic handguns. Sadly for Pro, criminals are the guns\" primary users, as outlined in my first speech. Thus, all points brought up against my 1C have been refuted. 2C: Concealed firearms easily find themselves into the hands of convicted felons. First, allow me to elaborate upon this point. Giving a gun to a convicted felon, especially one convicted of violent crime, is tantamount to giving a cocaine addict cocaine upon his becoming sober. It makes no logical sense, giving the criminal the ability to engage in crime yet again. My opponent correctly asserts I wish guns to prevent convicted felons from acquiring guns. However, he counters on two fronts. For one thing, he claims most will find illegal ways to regain guns. While illegal options are certainly viable, this does not make a legal option for them to obtain firearms any less immoral. Such an option still puts weapons in the hands of convicted felons, who, as my first speech demonstrates, do commit violent crimes. Since the legal option does not decrease the number of crimes these felons commit or the number of illegal arms purchased, it only serves as a detriment to the general public. My opponent\"s second counter-argument is even more interesting. \"If all convicted felons were restricted from obtaining a gun, there would be around 1.8 MILLION people who committed small crimes but were not able to obtain guns legally. That\"s almost the state population of Nebraska!!\" My response: why not? So what if 1.8 million people cannot legally own a gun? I thought the fewer guns you have, the fewer murders you have! After all, if Australia has shown us anything, limiting the number of guns available to the population has lowered the number of gun murders to mere triple digits (4) as opposed to the US\"s quintuple digits (5)! Since my opponent has failed to demonstrate why preventing these felons from having their gun rights is wrong, this entire counterargument remains utterly unconvincing. Preventing 1.8 million convicted felons from acquiring guns is a huge boon to public safety. Thus, with both arguments countered, my 2C stands. 3C: Concealed firearms are not adequate self-defense. My opponent counters this in two ways. First, he claims the deterrent effect of \"shall-issue laws\" is very much real, due to statistics in Florida gun violence. Sadly, my opponent utterly ignores the argument I previously put forth: correlation does NOT equal causation. Hundreds of factors \" economics, politics, racism, education \" affect the reduction in violent crime. Furthermore, the drop in violent crime occurred from 2007 to 2011. Since Florida\"s \"shall-issue laws\" came into effect in 1987 (6), why didn\"t this drop in crime happen earlier? Secondly, my opponent attacks a world I promoted in my 3C, where people must reveal their firearms on their person. My opponent believes people could be frightened of innocent civilians. This would be true, but this is not as important as the greater deterrent effect. For an instant, voters, put yourselves in the criminal\"s shoes. Who would you rather rob? A. An older woman walking down the street who MIGHT have a gun. B. An older woman walking down the street who visibly HAS a gun. My opponent also claims this would also make the US a \"terrorist country.\" This is false; having a firearm exposed does not make you a terrorist or the US a terrorist country. Soldiers and police officers often have highly visible firearms; they are not terrorists. Such a world is far from IDEAL (a world with NO guns), it certainly deters more crime than the world Pro supports. Unless side Pro can adequately respond to all these arguments, along with those not addressed earlier in the round, Side Con must win this debate.

            "conclusion": "Gun Control/ Assault Weapons Ban/ Concealed-Carry Ban",
            "premise": "I thank pro for his kind words and civility. Now to the arguments. Concealed-Carry Laws: I don't think a very minute difference like that would be conclusive evidence, Because correlation does not exactly mean causation. In the research I've done, Concealed-carry holders commit crimes 16% less than police officers. That is how law-abiding they are. [1] In addition, As concealed-carry goes up by the thousands, In the past 20 years, Violent crime in America has decreased by 50%. [2] Gun Laws: Of course they will not have more GUN crime, But people use other things like knives. For this reason, I think you should compare OVERALL murder rates BEFORE and AFTER gun bans, Because each country is different in its level of crime and murder. In this case, Gun bans have proven not to be effective in decreasing murder rates, And sometimes murder spikes after they are banned, Like what happened in England. [3] \"Assault Weapons\": Before I start, There is no official term \"assault weapon. \" That is a made up term. What guns are in the \"assault weapon\" category? Automatic guns have actually been banned since the 1930's, So this is an ivalid argument. In addition, Semi-automatic weapons are basically any gun, Like handguns, Pistols, Shotguns, AK-47, AR-15, Etc. So your \"assault weapons\" are my average gun, Because semi-automatic weapons which you constitute into this category is almost every gun. Therefore, You basically want to ban all guns. There actually is evidence that guns deter crime. According to an unpublished CDC study, [4] there are almost 2. 5 million Defensive Gun Uses per year(DGU's). As stated by a Kleck-Gertz study, 15. 7% of people who were involved in a DGU (Defensive Gun Use) said they almost certainly saved theirs or someone else\"s life. In addition to that, Another 14. 6% said they probably saved a life. Since I want to be conservative with my numbers, Let\"s say that everyone who said they probably saved a life are wrong. Since they surveyed 222 participants, The margin of error with a 95% confidence level calculated to be plus or minus 4. 8%. This signifies that at bare minimum 270, 000 lives are saved by guns, Up to over 500, 000 just counting the \"almost certainly people. \" If all the \"probably\" people are right, Then that number goes beyond 800, 000. Moreover, For every firearm homicide, At least 20-70 lives are saved by guns. If all gun deaths are counted, Then 8-23 lives are saved per death[5]. Most mass shootings, And gun homicides overall, For that fact, Are done with handguns. There are over 2. 5x as much handguns used in mass shootings than any rifle. If we are talking about the number of incidents, Handguns are used 2x as much as rifles. [6] Rifles of ANY TYPE make up less than 300 gun murders per year. Hand guns are the main cause of gun death. The Second Amendment: I agree on background checks and restrictions on guns, Only law-abiding people should get them, Yes, But here is what you later say- \"These similar restrictions would also apply to an automatic and semiautomatic weapon because these rifles were also made for the use of military combat, To kill as many people as possible. \" Automatic guns are already banned, Which I have explained previously, And semi-automatics are DEFINITELY NOT MADE for MILITARY COMBAT. You would be a fool walking into the military with a handgun or AR-15. An \"assault rifle\" is defined as a fully automatic machine gun, Which military would use. An AR-15 could be confused with a military M-16, But they are completely different and military rifles are not sold to the public. [7] I would argue concealed-carry is protected by the second amendment, Because the right to protect yourself doesn't just extend to home-defense, But wherever you go in public. Again, Assault rifles are not legal and a very vague term, So that argument is invalid. Finally, My opponent states \"A document written hundreds of years ago to dictate a government that had just escaped tyranny and was radically different from our own in modern times, Is nothing more than an appeal to authority. Just because it\"s an important law doesn't mean it\"s subject to scrutiny. \" The Constitution is still in tact and just because it was written 200 years ago does not question its validity. They wrote it knowing that they themselves could go tyrannical. They believed in the basic right to self-defense, And their is a lot of validity to that claim. Just because freedom of speech was made 200 years ago does not mean we should not consider it because the Constitution is too old. Without the second, Their is no first amendment. We have to protect the freedom expressed in the first amendment. I do not think banning guns is a necessary answer to gun violence, But rather mental-illness screening, Promoting gun safety, And making sure the police do their job efficiently. I thank my opponent for making good arguments that I could think about and research more. This is probably the hardest argument I have gotten, So props to my opponent for that as well. Thank you for your patience and civility, And if the sources do not go through, I will provide them through a google doc in the comment section, Like armoredcat, My opponent, Did in round one.

            "conclusion": "Concealed carry laws decrease crime",
            "premise": "Deterrence (use with argument below) A common misconception throughout Europe is less guns equal less crime, and the same argument applies in current US media, all claiming guns and conceal carry are evil.Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers, as if the gun is hidden they may be attacked back without warning (polices warning is the uniform).Now, lets look at a thing Lott calls a \"hot burglary.\" This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries where hot. In contrast, 13% in america where hot. Now what is the reason? Because they think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Now, lets use some examples of deterrence. Lott uses the literal example of apples and oranges. He says if the price of apples increases while the price of oranges decreases apples sales will decrease, while orange sales will stay the same or increase. This shows the human oh it has consequences effect.Is open carry and conceal carry different, when it comes to deterrence? When a concealed carry permit holder has a gun, it is harder to actually tell if they have a gun. Criminals wont know if they are attacking an old lady, or an old lady packing a .45 Springfield in her purse. This raises the risk to criminals, hence also their preservation. Whereas open carry is much less scary, as you know who not to annoy, and not to annoy anyone around him (as he may help the other person). The conceal carry laws threaten the criminals more.The StatsAccording to these numbers, the Florida murder rate was 36% lower after the conceal carry law was passed. [2] Similar results in Texas, where it average 30% lower after the law was passed. [2] Then Michigan has smaller results, 45 lower after the law was passed.Lott's findings:Law Passed Murder fell 7.7%, Rape fell 5.3%, Aggravated assault by 7.01%, robbery 2.2%, Burglary .5%, Larceny 3.3%, Auto 7.1%. [1]He also draws preliminary conclusions in the introduction [note he used to be pro gun control if I can recall] using deterrence theory mentioned above. He finds a significant correlation that whenever a conceal carry law is passed, crime rates decrease significantly. In the third addition, the source I am using, he finds his original study said 7.7%, he says after new data and averages from the state and county level he saw a 10% decrease in murder. He also finds if one state/county passes a conceal carry law, the bordering states and counties also gain a crime decrease. He finds based on assaults per 100,000 people went from about 340 to under 320 on average [based on the neighbors passing the law]. [1] Now before I proceed with the empirical evidence, we must ask why does this occur, why does the county overs laws effect my crime rate? Border wars. When gangs fight they fight each other and attack other bystanders. If the bystanders are armed they are then scared to fight as the victim can always fight back [possibly] without warning if they had a conceal carry license. The famed Lott/mustard paper as well as my #1 source find in each of the studies find if each state passed a conceal carry law, it would prevent:\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [3]Now, another question would be does it lower crime committed with guns? This argument used is common amongst people trying to go against conceal carry laws. But this is not the case. In the new 2010 edition of source 1, it finds a 9% decrease in murders with guns after non-discretionary laws are passed. Murders with non handguns dropped at a similar rate, 8.9%.Another question that must be answered: would it increase or decrease mass public crimes? Now, as this is a valid fear, see the recent shootings in Chicago I believe, or Virginia tech. But to define shootings/killings, we must look into what is defined by. It is defined as a public shooting in a place where 2 or more people are killed or injured. Now based n his data in figure 5.1, he found the likelihood of a state to have this happen was about 60%, a little more. After the conceal carry law was passed, data and trends suggests the state now has only a 1% chance of these types of shootings in areas where conceal carry holders are allowed. [1] I may have misphrased the argument here: the likelihood of deaths or injuries when the crime occurs. Essentially saying conceal carry laws make it harder for the psycho to kill when in the area where a conceal carry permit holder resides.To get more local statistics, lets look at his findings in some states. In Oregon, for example, murder dropped 37% after the law was passed. Now, there are other variables he accounted for in the third addition making his data superior to the first. He included arrest and conviction rates to this data, and the study concluded arrest rates lead to .34% drop in the overall murder rate, and the conviction only held .3%. So the arrest rates and the conviction rates lead to nothing essentially of the overall drop. He concludes the conceal carry law did, based on statistics and deterrence [above]. [1]Now lets look at PA. They had a drop in murder of about 26%, and overall violent crime drop of 5.3%. Now, this too had the same variables accounted for, and said a 1% increase in arrest = .79% decrease in overall violent crime. So if we look at it neither of these variables account for the drop. [1]Now lets look at Florida. Before the law the crime decreased at a .15% per year, about. After the law, it dropped by .35% each year. At the same time the amount of permit holders was almost 100,000. [1]The last question is accidental deaths, it decreases. the suicidal deaths rose by 2.67% after the law, and decreased other methods by 6%. Other statistics show an essential double of that, 4% increase for guns decrease 10% for other methods. The statistical difference actually large enough to decrease these whoops moments.Summary of argument: http://tinyurl.com... http://polyticks.com... CONCLUSION:These laws have a strong deterrent effect on murders with or without guns. Despite the difference on gun ownership of women and men, it also has the significant deterrence in rape and other crimes relating to women. The law also does not raise accidental rates, and maybe decreases them. I could do more, but am out of room.VOTE PRO_____[1] Lott, John R.

            "conclusion": "Concealed Carry on College Campuses",
            "premise": "My goal with this argument has been to show that violent crimes occur on college campuses and that allowing permit holding students to carry firearms while on campus, just like they do elsewhere, can help prevent those crimes from happening. Throughout this argument, my opponent has twisted facts in an attempt to win this argument, and to take his words at face value may prove to be a dangerous mistake. In Point 3 of Round 1, my opponent gives this statistic: \"Compared to criminal homicides using guns, the VPC data shows justifiable homicide with a gun in 2010 was a tiny fraction: 230 of them compared to 8,275 criminal gun-related homicides.\" He tries to twist these words to say that the 8,275 criminal homicides were committed by concealed carry permit holders when the statistic says no such thing. In 2010, there were 8275 criminal murders that involved a gun. In that same year, 230 people defended themselves with a gun. This statistic says absolutely nothing about concealed carry. CON claims that I believe the consequence of sexual assault should be death. I simply believe that if a woman is being attacked, she should be able to defend herself with a gun. That does not mean that she has to shoot anyone. In fact, simply seeing a gun will scare away many criminals as seen from my statistic in Round 2. If it comes down to the woman having to shoot her attacker, I believe that she has the right to do so in defense of herself and the law would agree with me. \"To be legally justified in killing an attacker, a rape victim must reasonably believe that the rapist intends to kill or grievously injure her. In many rape situations, the threat of severe physical harm is clear; the rapist is armed or threatens death or grievous injury. Situations where a rapist does not explicitly or implicitly threaten physical harm beyond forcible intercourse are less clear regarding the victim's right to use deadly force against the rapist. Current law does not clearly articulate a basis for the right to use deadly self-defense when a person reasonably believes that harm will be limited to forcible intercourse. One factor which can justify the use of deadly force against a rapist who does not threaten the victim with death or grievous physical harm is the high frequency of murder and serious injury incident to rape. This could properly lead any rape victim to assume that her life and health are in serious danger. A second factor that could justify the use of deadly force is the high rate of physical injury and psychological trauma attending rape. The threat of venereal disease, an unwanted pregnancy, and psychological debilitation can be taken together as a threat of serious harm. Overall, rape can be viewed as a grievous physical and psychological attack that may be resisted by any and all means\"[1] While the citation for CON's argument against the validity of rape statistics leads nowhere, I would still like to address his idea that one woman being able to defend herself against a rapist should be prohibited due to his fear of guns. My 25% statistic was a completely different statistic than the one he tried to disprove. My statistic said nothing about 1 in 4 women being raped throughout her lifetime and did not come from a feminist. My source was the US Department of Education and it said that if there are 100 crimes on a college campus, it is likely that 25 of them will be rapes. He is trying to discredit a statistic that I did not provide. Now let's look at violent crimes on college campuses. College campuses are not immune to crime. Just last year, Florida State University was attacked by an armed man. Here are some numbers provided by the FBI about crimes in schools (not just colleges). Between 2000 and 2005, there were 67,597 violent \"crimes against persons\" to include assault, rape, and murder. [2] According to collegeparents.org, \"Students aged 18 to 24 report about 526,000 violent crimes each year, according to the Violent Victimization of College Students report. Of those, 128,000 'involved a weapon or serious injury to the victim.'\" The same site provides that 5.8% of female students had reported being raped between 2003 and 2004.[3] It is clear that violent crimes do occur on college campuses, but can concealed carry stop them? \"Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.\" \"States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%.\" [4] Here are some instances of concealed carry permit holders defending themselves: \"Arizona, October 16, 2008 A University of Arizona student shoots two intruders in self-defense. South Carolina, August 9, 2008 A Citadel military school student successfully scares off a bat-wielding road rage driver by brandishing a handgun in self-defense. Michigan, January 20, 2008 A University of Michigan student shoots and kills two intruders in self-defense. Utah, September 18, 2007 A Utah Valley State College licensed to carry a concealed weapon shot a pit bull that was attacking him. The animal survived the shooting, and at the student\"s request, no charges were filed against the dog\"s owner. California, April 25, 2007 University of Southern California students overpowered a man, taking away his firearm and holding him at gunpoint for police. The man had become violent and threatening towards a female at a student party and refused to leave. Ohio, April 24, 2007 After a man demanded entry to a University of Akron student\"s apartment and threatened him with a gun, the student returned fire with a roommate\"s gun. The suspect then fled the scene. Texas, January 25, 2007 A Texas Tech student with a concealed carry permit grabbed his gun and hid when he heard someone trying to break in to his house. When the perpetrators successfully gained entry, the student took aim at the intruders. One fled, the other was detained for police. Texas, January 24, 2007 A Texas Tech student with a concealed carry permit returned home to find his car and home broken into, with the perpetrators still inside the house. The student fired two warning shots, causing the would-be thieves to flee. Florida, September 8, 2006 Two South Florida Community College students were attacked outside their apartment, but one used a .45 handgun to shoot one of the attackers in the chest. The other fled. Virginia, December 10, 2005 A Virginia Commonwealth University student was initially charged with murder after shooting an armed gang member in a confrontation outside a coin laundry business, but was cleared by authorities two months later when it was learned he acted in self-defense. Georgia, September 19, 2005 After dialing 911, a Mercer University School of Law student shot and killed a man that had broken into his home. Kentucky, May 2, 2005 A University of Kentucky student was cleared of wrongdoing after shooting a Louisville man who was robbing him outside a Lexington apartment complex.\" [5] If any doubt still exists, examine this article from Students for Concealed Carry http://concealedcampus.org... I hope that I have been able to accurately present the need to allow students to carry concealed weapons while on campus. This is truly an important concept to consider. Will concealed carry allow students to defend themselves in the face of a violent criminal? [1]https://www.ncjrs.gov... [2]http://www.fbi.gov... [3]http://www.collegeparents.org...

            "conclusion": "Conceal carry laws decrease violent crime",
            "premise": "As noted, I argue that conceal handgun laws LOWER violent crime. Deterrence (use with argument below)A common misconception throughout Europe is less guns equal less crime, and the same argument applies in current US media, all claiming guns and conceal carry are evil.Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers, as if the gun is hidden they may be attacked back without warning (polices warning is the uniform).Now, lets look at a thing Lott calls a \"hot burglary.\" This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries where hot. In contrast, 13% in america where hot. Now what is the reason? Because they think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Now, lets use some examples of deterrence. Lott uses the literal example of apples and oranges. He says if the price of apples increases while the price of oranges decreases apples sales will decrease, while orange sales will stay the same or increase. This shows the human oh it has consequences effect.Is open carry and conceal carry different, when it comes to deterrence? When a concealed carry permit holder has a gun, it is harder to actually tell if they have a gun. Criminals wont know if they are attacking an old lady, or an old lady packing a .45 Springfield in her purse. This raises the risk to criminals, hence also their preservation. Whereas open carry is much less scary, as you know who not to annoy, and not to annoy anyone around him (as he may help the other person). The conceal carry laws threaten the criminals more.The empirical data Law Passed Murder fell 7.7%, Rape fell 5.3%, Aggravated assault by 7.01%, robbery 2.2%, Burglary .5%, Larceny 3.3%, Auto 7.1%. [1] (1977-1997 data)Other data, his 1999 data, shows a better outcome of a 10% decrease in murder, and the other categories too had a larger decrease in crime, hence CCW in hi later data was slightly revised in new data sets. Lotts early data can be found in #2. Now lets look at PA. They had a drop in murder of about 26%, and overall violent crime drop of 5.3%. Now, one of the criticisms of this basic trend is just because the drop happened after the law, we can also look at other variables, the most common one is arrest rates. Lott makes many dummy variables, tables, and to the best of his ability shows CCW laws where a significant portion of the decrease. [1] Another reasons he concludes the drop is because when there is a spike in people who have permits there is a decrease in violent crimes. To get more local statistics, lets look at his findings in some states. In Oregon, for example, murder dropped 37% after the law was passed. Now, there are other variables he accounted for in the third addition making his data superior to the first. He did other dummy data sets, and still finds CCW had a large portion of the deterrence an drop in crimes. [1] Now, it is logical to assume they actually decrease crime due to my deterrent argument above. The CATO study also finds similar reasons why it would actually decrease crime. They also fund similar accounts of data, and they conclude the Florida CCW law was positive and the other states that passed these laws also had a positive showing. Another question that must be answered: would it increase or decrease mass public crimes? Now, as this is a valid fear, see the recent shootings in Chicago I believe, or Virginia tech. But to define shootings/killings, we must look into what is defined by. It is defined as a public shooting in a place where 2 or more people are killed or injured. Now based n his data in figure 5.1, he found the likelihood of a state to have this happen was about 60%, a little more. After the conceal carry law was passed, data and trends suggests the state now has only a 1% chance of these types of shootings in areas where conceal carry holders are allowed. [1] I may have misphrased the argument here: the likelihood of deaths or injuries when the crime occurs. Essentially saying conceal carry laws make it harder for the psycho to kill when in the area where a conceal carry permit holder resides.Now, another question would be does it lower crime committed with guns? This argument used is common amongst people trying to go against conceal carry laws. But this is not the case. In the new 2010 edition of source 1, it finds a 9% decrease in murders with guns after non-discretionary laws are passed. Murders with non handguns dropped at a similar rate, 8.9%.\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [2] (1997 study)Summary of argument: source: [1], and \"the conceal handgun debate\", john lott.

[1] My opponent says I failed to define, but as a rule states no semantics with definitions, therefore he breaks the terms of the debate. He automatically FF's, and any voter can see this.\"Au contraire, definitions =/= semantics. Definitions are the framework for this debate, and essentially are what this debate has boiled down to. Furthermore, he says that \"other sensible people agree\", however, it appears that there are only 2 of these other people. This is not a significant number or a compelling reason to vote PRO.\"Also, as stated, it was easily clear to what I was arguing with the resolution and the side I took (PRO), so my opponent seems to be just derailing a perfectly good debate.\"And as stated, it was not clear at all. There are good laws and bad laws, restrictive laws and freeing laws. When he says \"concealed carry handgun laws\" he leaves it up in the air to decide what laws he is talking about, and what they do. \"As paradigm lost said:\"Point out that he [my opponent] is playing a game of semantics and thus is derailing a perfectly good debate. Sensible voters will be able to see what the resolution is and how it's argued.\"\"Again, just because there is another DDO user who agrees with the instigator, doesn't mean that \"any voter would vote pro.\"On the Definition:Throughout, my opponent has not defined \"concealed carry handgun laws\". I provided a reasonable definition in the 1st round, which he rejected out of hand, labeling it as \"semantics\". He has dropped my logic and analysis that which demonstrates that any law pertaining to concealed carry must either (a) do nothing, or (b) impose restrictions on concealed carry. Since I am CON, I am against concealed carry laws, and without concealed carry laws, it is obvious that anybody can concealed carry. This equals more guns and less violence, as my opponent agreed.In close, my opponent has accused me of derailing this debate, but he has in reality derailed it from the beginning by picking a resolution that is highly amiguous. He has then proceeded to drop my reasonable definition without proposing an alternative. I urge you to vote for my definition, vote against concealed carry laws and thus for concealed carry freedom, and vote CON.",

            "premise": "I accept. In this debate, I will show that CCW laws cause more harm then good. Rebuttals first. \"When they go to place there not usually from they may liker to have it or when ever traveling down the road and break down you never know if what someone might do to you.\" Do you have any evidence that concealed carry weapons will reduce attacks on stranded drivers? Is this even a problem to begin with? \" If they stop somewhere and people that have kids see it they make a big deal about and how there kids shouldn't be seeing that kind of stuff.\" - I don't get this point. You explained a possible counter argument, but failed to rebut it. Extend. \"You never know what kind of people you may run into when you are out on the road and now a days I would be scared at times and places I go.\" - As I will point out later, CC will actually make these situations worse. Do you have any evidence to back up your claim? \"That is why I think that they should not be harassed about carrying a gun into public places.\" -This is a problem. The resolution is about CCW laws, but now you make a point about harassment. Please extend. Now onto my arguments. C1: Increased Crime. - A common claim by gun rights activists is that guns will decrease crime, as citizens can stop criminals. This is false. A study done in 2012 by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that states that had \"shall carry\" laws had a 2% increase in murders and a 9% increase in violent crime [1]. A 1995 study published in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminalogy found that states that passed \"shall issue\" laws had a 4.5 person per 100,000 increase in the gun homicide rate [2]. So allowing CC is increasing the crime risk. C2: Increased risk. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that people who carried guns were 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault then people who don't carry guns [3]. This is more of a rebuttal of the gun rights activists' claims that guns will keep you safe. C3: Restrictions don't stop crime. You state that we should place restrictions on concealed carrying. However, these laws do not work. From 2007-2014, 636 people were murdered by people legally licensed to carry firearms [4]. Even worse, the Violence Policy Center states that CC handlers were arrested for gun offences 81% more in Texas [5]. Plus, just in 2007 Florida, 1400 felons, 128 active domestic violence perpetrators, and 216 people with active warrants held CCPs [6]. So how can you say that restrictions will keep criminals away? C4: Public opinion. You may think guns will make people feel safe. This is false. First, after Illinois passed a law allowing CC, a poll found that over 52% of the population felt less safe [7]. Plus, 79% of college students would not feel safe if people had firearms on campus [8]. Finally, 57% of the US population felt less safe after learning people could conceal guns in public [9]. C5: Criminal reaction. When it is easier for people to carry firearms, it is more likely for criminals to carry guns. 75% of convicted felons carried guns because they fear their victims could be carrying guns [10]. What does this mean? Victims who are not carrying could be at risk of being shot because of others. To conclude, I have shown that CC laws should not exist, due to my 5 contentions. I have proved the CC makes people feel less safe, cause more crime, and restrictions don't keep criminals from carrying guns. I await my opponents response. Sources: [1] http://www.nber.org...

            "conclusion": "In the United States, private ownership of handguns ought to be banned.",
            "premise": "To my esteemed debate colleagues, casual readers and of course my venerate opponent...I would like to thank anotherwolf for creating this debate. With events involving guns becoming more numerous every year, it is important we discuss weapons and gun control. If I may begin...As the opposition, negative or \"con\" in this round it is my burden to prove that the resolution is NOT true. Pre-Round Analysis: Please disregard any information presented without sourcable evidence as is holds no strength. \"A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined...\" George Washington, First Annual Address, to both House of Congress, January 8, 1790. It is with this quote from one of the greatest men in American history that I stand in opposition to the resolution: \"In the United States, private ownership of handguns ought to be banned\". To analyze this resolution I would like to point out that we are ONLY disscussing private ownership of HANDGUNS. Another resolutional analysis is that we are talking about the US alone. Voters please disregard all arguments that have to do with commwealths, states and countries that are not part of or have not been annexed by the United States of America as of 2015. Definitions:Private ownership: Operationally defined as the use or ownership of an object by one person or group of people. Handguns: \"Any firearm that can be held and fired with one hand; a revolver or a pistol.\" By Dictionary.com\u00b9Ought: \"Used to express obligation, advisability, natural expectation, or logical consequence.\" By Meriam-Webster.com\u00b2Definitional Analysis: Ought is interchangable with \"should\" and \"should\" entails reasons: I should eat the cake because it's my birthday. Therefore mine opponent, the government, affirmative or \"pro\", must not only uphold his side of the resolution but he must also prove his side and completely wipe away mine analyses. My value for this round is Human Rights. Human rights are defined as the inherent right to Life, Liberty and Property. Keep these in mind as I go into my arguments. Notes: A value is a worldview that should be used to judge the round. For example I am using Human rights because I think that that is what guns protect. Contention 1: Guns Uphold Human Rights:Let us address every one of the human rights individually. Life in correlation to gun control. Let us say someone breaks into your house and runs into your room with a knife. Most likely if you are not trained in martial arts you are probably going to die from punture wounds. However, if you happen to have a gun, you are able to defend yourself. Guns protect the right to life by protecting life itself. When people are disciplined, background checks performed and police enforcement enhanced, guns can protect life.Guns in relation to liberty. If we look back up to our quote by George Washington (Scroll up) we see that he states that a society that values liberty and freedom above all needs to be able to arm and defend itself from potentional home invasion and government tyranny. \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\u00b3 What this sacred ammendment is essentially saying is that it is the right of the citizens of the united states to bear arms to uphold freedom. In fact this year gunsnfreedom.com released an articleS08; that stated how two men had attempted to attack an elderly women in a home invansion. Due to her right to bear arms given to her by the 2nd Amendment she is well to this very day. Finally guns in relation to property, one of the Human rights. Taking away guns is by its very nature is denying human one of their inherent Human rights, property. Guns protect the other two human rights and in and of themselves count as a basic human right, by our definitions above (See Definitions). Guns can protect against robbery: On June 18 gunsnfreedom.com released another article about guns being used to protect property. When a chainsaw-wielding thief broke and entered a San Antonio home, the armed homeowner was able to save is property and his life by defending himself with a firearm. Contention 2: Banning Guns Does Not Promote Human Rights:When you ban weapons or if you make something illegal it immediatly creates a market for that banned product. Because drugs are banned people buy them off the black market and such is one example. If liberals and other politically new idealists succeed at gun control and a handgun ban, you immediatly have the \"illegal gun market\" created. \"...Kates and Mauser looked at and compared data from the U.S. and parts of Europe to show that stricter [gun] laws don\u2019t mean there is less crime.\"S09;. Essentially what their saying is that in studies from the U.S. gun control does not make crime go down. Banning guns still allows people to invade a home with things like knives and be able to attack and kill and steal property from people who, without guns, have no defense. As you see having guns may have a few incidents, but according to guncite.com in an articleS10; over two million instances of gun related self defense occur per year. All in all banning guns does not help save lives, it does not help people protect their property and taking away guns certainly does not give people more freedom. Keeping guns helps save lives! Keepings handguns free to own with licenses and such allows for freedom and democracy, two of the foundational values on which the US was made on.I will now respond to mine opponent's arguments. Mine opponent stated that handguns are there to protect the owner from danger and this is correct. Mine opponent essentially agreed with my main point of Human Rights, protecting the owner = protectin his/her life, before I have even given my case. Mine opponent then goes on to say that the first reason why people should not be allowed to carry guns is because nobody can tell who is going to kill someone wiht his/her gun. I would like to respond to this by saying that a plethora of gun violences have, in fact, been stopped by background checks at gun purchasing centers. To carry a gun around you need a concealed carry license. To get one of those you have to go through too many background checks and investigation to count and you also have to get months of training. The resolution is talking about private hangun ownership, but my opponent is talking about concealed carry. My opponent has not presented any arguments on personal/private ownership. I urge the judge to disregard all arguments thus made by my opponent becuase they do not link in directly and have not been applied to the resolution directly. Lastly my opponent goes on to state that there is no guarrentee that people will not get shot. I would like response by saying that gun ownership and furthermore concealed carry is made to defend the person carrying the gun, as my opponent stated earlier in his/her opening statement. I believe I have given sufficient evidence to prove that my opponents last point, that to reduce crime guns ought to be banned, has no force.

            "premise": "The dictionary define \"vigilante\" as \"a member of a self-appointed group of citizens who undertake law enforcement in their community without legal authority, typically because the legal agencies are thought to be inadequate\". My opponent states that he was not eluding to arming people with more guns, but someone trained.... see his comment: \"Who I do say should be in the room with a gun is a trained individual of either in law enforcement, or someone trained to handle the job. Either that or allowing an adult to be able to carry a concealed handgun.\". Or maybe his comment at the end..........\"or allowing an adult to be able to carry a concealed handgun\". For what purpose? To protect himself, or others. Vigilante as defined by the dictionary, is exactly applicable. Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this debate. People feel the protection is inadequate and want to protect themselves and others in a way they see fit. To make this debate fun, I offer a well thought out article called\" Batman and the Problem With Vigilante Justice: A Love Story\" http://the-artifice.com...; Dont' all spiritual warriors have a little batman inside of them? After all, guns represent power. And Batman is POWERFul. Probem is, its a comic strip. The article contends that : \"Batman is a character that takes matters into his own hands. He does not wait for approval and effectively answers to no one. When a problem arises, he rises to the occasion and remedies the situation, often times to the chagrin of the local authorities. Lastly, and most importantly, Batman is problematic to the government because he gives the people back their power. The citizens of Gotham feel as if they have been completely stripped of all of their power, of their voice, to stand up against the injustices committed against them both by criminals and the government itself. Batman\u2019s public display of vigilante justice provides an outlet for the public to understand that they do not have to hide in the shadows and feel as if they are perpetual victims of an impotent system that fails to protect them\". I offer to my opponent that there are many statistics about gun deaths, shootings, etc - none of which are more credicble than the next. So I will purposefully, not reply to his cited statiistics. We can go back and forth all day about who's stats are right. Isn't that what the people are doing now? It's getting us no where in terms of progressive solutions to move us forward. Everyone has natural fear. But our fear is growing daily, as each massacare and world political war stage becomes more and more violent. Kids, and teens, angry because they don't have a girlfriend (Oregon shooter \"I will die a virgin and without a girlfriend\", (http://www.dailymail.co.uk...). Children die, and adults respond with \"more guns!\". What the heck? These are reactions of emotional people driven by frustration and hate for something, someone, somewhere. No well-adjusted person is filled with rage and unaffected by the loss of human life (at least seemingly so by either failure to address it, or give it much relevance). And you want to put a gun in the hands of more frustrated people?",

For an arsonist it takes a longer time to kill someone, but for a murderer it's just hit and boom the person's seriously injured or dead. Plus to be an arsonist you have to place the gasoline, which plenty of people can see them while they do it. The fact that we can't prove that something will or will not happen, scares people. When people are scared or worried, we do what seems right and to people, banning firearms is the right thing to do. Washington DC is where the president lives, not everyone likes the president. Which can lead to higher violent crimes, people trying to kill the president, people just showing their hatred, and etc. The .0054% of murderers that were committed by legal gun owners, is a problem. People still have to watch their backs where ever they go, they have to wonder: Does that guy have a gun I can't see? Will he kill people? What if he does? It is a huge problem!",

            "conclusion": "Gun usage in some parts of the United States should be allowed.",
            "premise": "My argument will focus on two points - guns' positive effects on crime, and the constitutional right to bear arms as per the second amendment. I. Crime Criminals do fear guns. This can be illustrated with the concept of hot burglary. This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries were hot. In contrast, 13% in America were hot. What is the reason behind this? Because criminals think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Even think of it as something as simple as apples and oranges. In a closed market of only apples and oranges, if the price of apples increases, the demand for apples decreases, and the demand for oranges increases. Apply this to guns and robberies. If the amount of guns increases, the incentive to rob decreases, and there is less crime. A common misconception is that more guns are used in crime than in defense. However, defensive handgun use is more widespread than crimes committed with guns: \"In sum, DGUs are about three to five times as common as criminal uses, even using generous estimates of gun crimes.\"[4] This is what two seperate studies conclude:John Lott summarized, \"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\"[1] Police studies conclude, \"After controlling for an array of factors, including trends before and after the law went into effect, I show that states that enact concealed carry laws are less likely to have a felonious police death and more likely to have lower rates of felonious police deaths after the law is passed. This result is statistically significant in seven of the nine specifications, and the difference between the before and after trends is significant in over half the specifications.\"[2] This graph shows that more guns mean less crime: [5]Here is a chart detailing concealed carry laws's effects on each crime bracket: [1] And finally, here is a very informative graph on the effect of conceal carry laws on crime: [1]Guns do reduce crime, and thus, should be legal.II. Constitutionality \"On its face, the second amendment's language, 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' suggests an intent to guarantee a right which people can effectively enforce. This was invariably what the Founders described on the numerous occasions in which they indicated what they meant by 'militia' and that is how the identical \"right of the people\" language which appears in the first and fourth amendments has always been construed. The following points are offered to support the contention that the language of the second amendment must be taken at face value: 1. The Founding Fathers praised the individual ownership of firearms in terms that would seem extravagant even from today's pro-gun organizations, and thus there is no reason for assuming that individuals were excluded from the right to arms the Founders wrote into the Constitution. 2. There is no support for the assumption that the right is only a collective one because all the political philosophers cited by the Founders affirmed that the individual's right to possess arms is his ultimate guarantee against tyranny. 3. By \"militia,\" the Founders meant \"all (militarily capable) males ... bearing arms supplied by themselves\".4. When what was guaranteed by English common law (and confirmed by the English Bill of Rights of 1689) was unequivocally an individual right to keep and bear arms, there is no cause for assuming that its American successor guarantees only an exclusively \"collective right\"--something that did not exist in any legal system with which the Founding Fathers were familiar.5. Last, if the Founding Fathers had intended to guarantee an exclusively \"collective right,\" they would not have done so in language which (in light of the English and American legal background) their contemporaries could only--and uniformly did--construe as preserving an individual right. The evidence for the individual right interpretation is so overwhelming that the existence of an argument which (by studiously ignoring that evidence) degrades the second amendment into a meaningless \"collective right\" is inexplicable. The readily available explanation is that this \"collective right\" argument has been written under the influence of a violent antipathy to firearms and a profound belief that their eradication will somehow reduce violence. The effect of that belief upon the discussion of second amendment issues has been so great that a brief consideration of the criminological issues is imperatively necessary, even though it is theoretically irrelevant to the legal considerations involved.\"[6][7][8][9][10]Therefore, the ownership of guns is a constitutional right and thus should be legal. I have provided two proofs as to why guns should be legal - they reduce crime and are protected by the U.S. Constitution. Sources [1]: Lott, John R. Jr., and David B.

Wright and Peter Rossi surveyed 2,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons across the United States. Wright and Rossi reported that 34% of the felons said they personally had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\"; 69% said that they knew at least one other criminal who had also; 34% said that when thinking about committing a crime they either \"often\" or \"regularly\" worried that they \"[m]ight get shot at by the victim\"; and 57% agreed with the statement, \"Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\" James D.

Rev. 513-596 [1994].\" --Concealed carry permit (CCW) holders can/have saved lives during mass shootings I had 8 links to incidents where armed resistance ended a shooting but they would not work in this format unfortunately. See the bottom of this page for a few URLS. According to FBI statistics: When civilians stopped a shooting event there was an average of 2.3 deaths. When law enforcement responded, at an average time of 3 minutes, 14.3 deaths occurred. --As a group, those with a CCW permit commit a disproportionately low number of crimes My apologies that this is a copy and paste. I have to wake up for work in 5 hours. \"A front-page story in today's New York Times tries to stir up alarm about liberalized carry permit laws, which let people carry concealed handguns if they meet a short list of objective criteria. To illustrate the hazards of that policy, the Times cites crimes committed by permit holders in North Carolina. How many crimes? Excluding traffic offenses, the Times counts 2,400 over five years, of which 200 were felonies. More relevant (since critics of nondiscretionary permit laws worry that they contribute to gun violence), \"More than 200 permit holders were also convicted of gun- or weapon-related felonies or misdemeanors, including roughly 60 who committed weapon-related assaults.\" That's a dozen gun assaults a year. How many permit holders are there in North Carolina? According to the story, \"more than 240,000.\" So 0.2 percent of them are convicted of a non-traffic-related offense each year, about 0.017 percent are convicted of a felony, and only 0.005 percent are convicted of a gun assault. The Times concedes that the number of permit holders convicted of crimes \"represents a small percentage of those with permits.\" More like \"tiny.\" By comparison, about 0.35 percent of all Americans are convicted of a felony each year--more than 20 times the rate among North Carolina permit holders. It seems clear these people are far more law-abiding than the general population, a finding consistent with data from other states. Such data are not surprising, since law-abidingness, as measured by a clean criminal record, is one requirement for a carry permit.\" http://www.kgw.com... http://www.frontpagemag.com... http://www.theblaze.com... http://www.buzzfeed.com...",

            "premise": "As Pro, I wish to start by contesting Con\"s first argument \" Concealed firearms lead to lethal violent crime \" 1) My opponent starts his first argument by saying that the NRA loves to tell stories about concealed handguns to say they have saved lives. However, the information I give is not produced by the NRA, but by the Texas Department of Public Safety & Florida state records. The Texas Department of Public Safety released a study in 1999 that showed that in that year the rate of murder convictions for permit holders in Texas was zero percent. There were NONE. Florida statistics show only 18 crimes involving firearms by license holders, out of 221,443 licenses issued between October 1987 and April 1994. 2) My opponent then gives an example of a killing by a citizen with a concealed firearm, which is followed by the fact that 516 people have been killed this way. This may be true, but according to a study by criminologist Gary Kleck of Florida State University, there are approximately 2.5 million cases of people using firearms for self-defense in America each year. However, this study was disproved and it was shown that he was greatly exaggerating. I tell you this to confirm the authenticity of the information I am about to give you. Another study from the same period, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), estimated almost 70,000 defensive gun uses annually. \"We have 153 documented cases across 26 states with at least 550 lives saved\", says David Burnett, who tracks incidents of defensive gun use. This shows the difference between the lives saved and the lives lost are definitely in favor of saved. 3) My opponent then says that we have an alarming amount of deaths from handgun usage. This point says nothing against the negativities of concealed carry, those are figures related to handguns in general. Therefore his argument is invalid. Next, I wish to put forth my second point - Citizens should have the same advantages as the criminals who attack them. Since this point clashes with my opponent\"s second point, I will rebut it in this way. According to my opponent\"s argument, convicted felons are also allowed to regain gun rights, and therefore this becomes a danger to the rest of the population. So, ideally, my opponent wishes guns to be banned from convicted felons. 1)Firstly, most criminals would not bother to get a concealed carry gun permit. There are many ways for criminals to get guns without obtaining a permit. 2)Secondly, this idea for guns to be banned from all convicted felons can be put down another way - in the US, as of 2010, there were a little more than 2.3 million convicted felons. Out of those, 700,000 were for violent offenses. Out of these, 400,000 commit crimes for the second time. If all convicted felons were restricted from obtaining a gun, there would be around 1.8 MILLION people who committed small crimes but were not able to obtain guns legally. That\"s almost the state population of Nebraska!! In my opponent\"s third argument, he discredits the \"alleged\" deterrent effect and proceeds to advise that the guns should be exposed instead of concealed. There are 2 flaws in my opponent\"s reasoning. Firstly, the \"alleged\" deterrent effect, as my opponent calls it, has reduced crime all over the country. For example, the report from ABC News shows that in Florida, where there are more concealed weapons permits than anywhere else in the country, violent crime has dropped to the lowest point in history. Firearm-related violent crimes in Florida have dropped by one-third in just four years, 2007 to 2011. I don\"t think it can still be called the \"alleged\" deterrent effect. It is real, and it definitely works. My opponent\"s second flaw is that if guns were allowed to be exposed, people wouldn't\"t be warned of criminals coming their way, as he could be an innocent civilian as well. Also, think of the effect it would have on our nation. The United States of America is not a terrorist country, for people to be walking around with, and I quote my opponent, \"with a Glock strapped to his/her ankle\". The government considers all these effects before putting a law into place, and I think my opponent should too. With that, I close my argument for the second round. I wish my opponent good luck.",

With concealed carry since most citizens aren't carrying criminals are unlikely to suspect that you are carrying. You want to avoid trouble in the first place if you can. That's why open carry makes more sense than concealed carry in deterring crime.Furthermore there is the risk of accidents and the right for citizens to know you are carrying so they can avoid you to avoid accidents.",

            "premise": "Guns. What are guns? We should all know the answer to this question. But what is a gun in anyones hands? Is it a harmful device, or a protectful gaurdian? That is the question. The answer, not as simple as it may sound. How do guns being concealed decrease crime rates? I aim to answer that question in the following two contentions. Not only that, but i also aim to prove my opponent wrong, therfore, i contend the resolution. Obsv. 1: What are the types of Concaled and carry laws? Many of us are not as familiar as others with this topic so i shall present the following observation. There are three Concealed carry laws, all of wich are explained below. All of these observations are from source [1]. Unrestricted: (Sometimes this is referred to as \u201cConstitutional Carry\u201d) requires no permit to carry a concealed firearm. \u201cShall Issue\u201d: These are the most common type of conceal and carry permits. Shall-Issue states require applicants to meet certain criteria defined by the law, but once a citizen meets the criteria the granting authority has no discretion to withhold permits. Typically states require residency, a minimum age, finger printing, background checks and attendance in a certified training program / firearm safety class. \u201cMay-Issue\u201d: These states require citizens to obtain a legal permit by meeting state requirements (similar to Shall-Issue states) but the granting authority has discretion to add additional requirements or withhold the permit if they do not feel sufficient cause warrants the permit. Typically these additional restrictions can include providing evidence that there is justifiable need for the permit. Contention 1: Violence does not decrease.In fact, I will be able to prove that violence tied to colcealed carry laws actually INCREASES. When guns are available to any citizen that passes the said tests, crime tends to increase. There is no option but to agree that when guns are involved, there will usaly be something bad tied to said gun. Moving on, GUNS are not to be taken lighlty. ANYONE with a gun can be considered dangerous. For example, if someone thinks he or she is doing good by trying to detter a criminal by using a loaded weapon, the events may escalate if the said \"good guy\" fires one to many a shot and harms an inoccent person. Furthermore, anyone with swift acces to a gun can lead to violence. Opponents of shall-issue licensing laws generally argue that such laws might raise levels of criminal violence, primarily by increasing the number of persons with easy access to guns in public places. According to this theory, assaults are often impulsive acts involving the most readily available weapons. Since guns are especially lethal weapons, more guns might result in more firearms-related homicides and injuries.[2]Now, let us take a look at some statistics: 31,593 people died from gun violence[3]How can one dissagree that if guns are redily and legaly available to citizens, this number would not increse? Take this for example, people engage in fights every day, be it verbal escalations or violent escalations. Now that citizens have direct acces to hiden firearms, these verbal and phisical escalations may step up a level and end up in the involvment of guns. These escalations range anywhere from a person caught cheating to a person pushing someone on accident. Our human minds are very mysterious to say the least. We fight for seemingly stupid things all the time! Just today, i got in a fight with a friend because he took my pizza.Furthermore, what if one of these stupid conflicts ends up in a phisical fight. What if one of the assaliants returns later on with a gun in his hand and disposes of the other party. Now, what if everyone had access to a loaded gun? Would you not agree that the assaliant would just skip the last step as a whole and take care of the other party then and there? All the assaliant has to do is pull out his LEGAL weapon and shoot the other party. There is nothing stoping these events happening. Now, this allows me to move on to my next point. My opponent clearly states \"decreases crime\" in the resolution . What type of crime? How can my opponent prove that concealed carry laws decrease the illegal use of marijuana? A crime is any act or omission that violates a law which results in a punishment [4]. Thus, my opponent fails to elaborate as to WICH crimes will be lowered. In their 2003 study published in the Stanford Law Review, Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue concluded that a proliferation of laws that permit concealed-carry licenses based on specific criteria (\u201cshall-issue\u201d laws, as opposed to laws that permit licenses based on proof of need) does not reduce crime and instead correlates to higher crime rates. Their study was in response to a 1998 book, More Guns, Less Crime, written by John R. Lott of the Yale Law School [5].Contention 2: Lotts research is not accurate enough.My opponent bases his case off of John Lotts study of this topic. But, i say to the voter that John Lott has been proven wrong many times. In a 2003 article, Yale Law professors John J. Donohue III and Ian Ayres have claimed that Lott\u2019s conclusions were largely the result of a limited data set and that re-running Lott\u2019s tests with more complete data yielded none of the results Lott claimed [6]. Lotts reaserch is also faulty due to the following reasons: Lott\u2019s research did not account for the large increase in crack cocaine use from 1977 to 1992. As Ayres and Donohue point out, crack was likely more prevalent in urban areas within states that were reluctant to pass \u201cshall-issue\u201d laws than in more rural states that adopted \u201cshall-issue\u201d laws. If so, Lott may have erred in failing to recognize that crack was more directly linked to increased crime than was an absence of \u201cshall-issue\u201d laws. Ayres and Donohue point to several flaws in Lott\u2019s reasoning that concealed weapons held by law-abiding citizens make criminals act more cautiously and, thus, deter crime. With concealed-carry laws, criminals could be more inclined to pack heat and be quicker to shoot. There\u2019s also the concern that heated arguments can escalate into shootings [7].Thus, one can now conclude that Lotts studys are not entirely accurate. More Evidence:Using publicly available media reports, the Violence Policy Center claims that from May 2007 through the end of 2009, concealed carry permit holders in the U.S. have killed at least 117 individuals, including 9 law enforcement officers (excluding cases where individuals were acquitted, but including pending cases). There were about 25,000 murders by firearm that period, meaning that concealed carry permit holders committed less than 1% of the murders by firearm. Furthermore, a large number of the victims were killed in extended suicides, most of which took place in the home of the shooter, where arms can be possessed without special permits.[8] Ironically, putting more guns into the hands of law-abiding citizens means that more guns will end up in the hands of criminals. Mark Duggan of the University of Chicago estimates that 500,000 guns are stolen annually. Stolen guns mean more gun violence[9].In conclusion:I am down to 400 characters, so i shall be breif. There is no possible way one can prove that conceled carry laws decrese crime. Just because these so called \" law abiding citizens\" are in possesion of wepons that have the power to save lives, there is no way to prove that those same weapons have the power to DECIMATE a life. Thank you for even taking the time out of your day to read my case. Good luck to my opponent in his next round.

            "conclusion": "THBT teachers should not have the right to carry concealed weapons in the classroom.",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity for this debate.I agree with the definitions except a concealed weapon will be a licensed weapon that is concealed appropriately WITH necessary training. My contentions rebut my opponents arguments.Contention 1As stated with my disagreement of definition of concealed weapon. The teachers should have adequate training before being able to carry a concealed weapon on campus. Many scenarios require violence to combat violence. This is a cold hard truth. The difference is, the school teachers would be combating IMMORAL violence with MORAL violence. For example, if a school shooter came into a school with the intention to kill 20 innocent people in the school. Perhaps this school shooter makes it in the school and starts shooting, he shoots 11 people, at that point a concealed weapons carrier fires and kills the shooter. In this example 12 people would be killed, but 20 were intended to be killed. In reality, the concealed weapons carrier killed one person but saved 9 lives. What is more moral, letting more people die without killing, or killing to save lives? The point is, if a mentally deranged person has an eager intent to shoot up a school, they'll probably do it, the teachers should have help in saving as many lives as possible.Contention 2There are also teachers with psychological problems. Firstly, I would suggest that all teachers who are legible for carrying a concealed weapon on campus would be subject to a psychological test. Secondly, it is possible even after the psychological test the teacher still has some problem. So one day in an extreme and unlikely scenario they do pull a gun on one or several students and start shooting. Easily near by teachers can come and shoot the out of control teacher before more innocent lives are taking, thus saving lives of the innocent.Contention 3Our governments do not have enough police officers to have multiple officers per campus. The average amount of police officers per capita is 265.7 per 100,000 people. (1) With a low amount of police officers they will not be able to take out the offender and save lives quick enough since they'll have to cover a lot of ground on campus. If most of the teachers on campus had a concealed weapon and were trained accordingly they could save more lives from being taken from the offender as opposed to a few police per each campus. Enforcing security gates more closely will help prevent but will not be a 100% guarantee of prevention. My opponent has also stated 3 in 4 gunmen turn on their own community and claims it from TIME magazine but doesn't give link to the article. I can't be sure if its true but if it is, as I stated earlier in Contention 2, if a teacher turned on the students, there would be enough sane teachers to take out the out of control teacher. My opponent has stated we should have rehabilitation for the suspect in question. I agree with this if we know the suspected offender potentially has plans of having a shooting spree in a school. However, we can't always know if somebody has this terrible plan of killing innocent people in school. So when such a person comes along into a school without notice, the teachers should have to potential to save as many lives as possible.My opponents concludes by stating we should not add another aspect of violence. I have already differentiated the difference between immoral (unnecessary) violence and moral (necessary) violence. Moral violence saves lives more than it takes.(1) http://www.nationmaster.com...",

            "conclusion": "Allowing Citizens to Carry Handguns Reduces Crime Rates",
            "premise": "Con makes a distinction between foresight and hindsight. While we do not have the advantage of analyzing the future from the perspective of hindsight, we can apply lessons learned from the past to future expectations. With an increase of people carrying guns, we haven't seen a dramatic increase in crime rates, as Con would have us expect. Instead, we have seen drastic reductions in murder rates. This serves to show that it is not strictly a probability that a person will commit a crime. People are individuals, not probabilities, and a peaceful person won't become violent simply because they have a handgun.Con's position is that we should limit the accessibility of handguns, but we have already established a baseline of regulations to keep handguns out of the hands of citizens who have shown themselves to be irresponsible. Not allowing citizens to carry handguns in this instance will only reduce the number of responsible citizens with handguns. Criminals will still be able to get handguns from illegal sources.It is clear that having a handgun doesn't change a person's propensity toward violence or crime. If that were the case, we would expect to see a higher percentage of police killing and robbing than ordinary citizens. Indeed, with the drastic increases in carry permits available to the public, we haven't seen crime rates soar. Instead, we have seen murder rates fall 42% since 1987. This fits in place well with the study by Kleck and Gertz showing that guns are used 2.5 million times a year to stop a crime.In conclusion, we can see that citizens carrying handguns can reduce crimes in many ways. Firstly, it allows citizens to defend themselves when attacked. Secondly, it allows citizens to help defend others who are in peril. Thirdly, the more guns responsible citizens carry, the more hesitant a criminal will be in trying to rob somebody. I have not only provided hypothetical explanations, but statistical analysis of murder rates, and reports of defensive gun uses. Con's position is based mainly off of probabilities, but a framework of probabilities that is at odds with actual occurrences must inherently be erroneous.",

            "premise": "Handguns are specifically worse than most other weapons. They are weapons which are both concealable and portable. Shotguns and Rifles can easily be identified from a long distance making it easier to avoid those who are carrying them or conversely for the authorities check their motives for carrying arms. Handguns, being ranged weapons (as opposed to knives), prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them. Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given \u00a0that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4",

            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for his acceptance. Throughout this posting, I will state three contentions in favor of the motion. I will also define the terms within the motion now: Teachers will be any certified instructor within a school system. Concealed weapon will be a lisceneced weapon that is concealed appropriately, without any necessary training. Classroom will be anywhere on the school campus. FIRST ARGUMENT It is understood that school shootings are a rising threat. Yet is this the correct way to combat violence? With more violence? Essentially, to arm a teacher is to add more bullets, more violence, and more death to the scene. Already, policemen have trouble hitting a target, yet what of an untrained, nervous teacher tasked with saving his/her students? What should we do in response to violence? Add more violence? perhaps arm the whole school to the teeth? which leads into my SECOND CONTENTION What about the teachers that sexualy harass students, or feel agression towards them? Although these are extreme cases, think of all of the stressed-out teachers. When armed with a tool with the ability to end multiple lives, a certain physcological effect takes place. Although it would be egregious to say that if a student is upsetting a teacher the teacher will immediately pull a gun on the student in question, possesing a gun in stressful situations makes the user more confident, and endows the posessor with a misleading sense of power. Let us discuss an extreme (but too common) circumstance. If a shooter invades a school and takes a student hostage. A teacher without a gun will call for backup. A teacher with a gun will be much more likely to use it to save the student, although a violent response to a person with violent intent will certainly trigger a chain of events, for hit rates against live targets are low even among policemen, and kill rates low as well, perhaps leading to even more unessecary deaths. Again, fighting violence with more violence simply adds fuel to the flame. Perhaps a different approach is called for. THIRD POINT Already, policemen are seen on campus of many schools. At least these policemen are trained, more detatched, and have more tools at their disposal. Policemen also carry exposed weapons, which may serve as a detterent to any potential shooter. Instead of funding weapons for teachers, enforce security such as gates more closely, or hire more professional policemen. 3 in 4 gunmen (TIMES magazine) turn on their own community. This shows that the problem comes from within. Instead of tearing ourselves apart with the accumulation of even more weapons, more effective ways and programs to rehabilitate the person in question before the violent act is commited would be the most effective in stopping these unessesary deaths. In conclusion, granting gun rights to teachers worsens the situation by adding another aspect of violence to the scene. Also, already-pressured teachers who are granted a gun are more likely to use it. And finally, more peaceful and efffective methods are available.",

            "premise": "My opponent claims I argued his side, but it was clear that I am for conceal carry, and it appears he is trolling as well. One reason we can assume I am for conceal carry is because both of my parents have the license, I own multiple guns, and any DDOer knows I am against all gun regulations, well most should know that. Also if you look a tmy past debate history you see constant support for the lott mustard data. (http://www.debate.org...) (http://www.debate.org...) My opponent then claims, without any logic, we can assume pro is for controlling weapons, which is false. The resolution states: \"Conceal handgun laws reduce violent crime\" As I am labeled pro, it is EXTREMELY clear that I am arguing for the resolution, I am PRO conceal handguns reducing crime. My opponent basically uses logic that does not exist nor relate to the resolution. Then my opponent states we have a mutual agreement, NO WE DON'T. I am arguing that it decreases crime, my opponent must not have reading comprehension, as I am labeled pro vs the resolution, which is clear what I mean. I also clarified with my source page, as many of my sources easily explain my position. Look at this source: Lott, John R. More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun-control Laws. 3rd ed. Vol. 1. Chicago: University of Chicago, 2010. Print. If I was arguing that it raised crime the book \"more guns less crime\" woudl not be a source. Also, I am the instigator, my opponent thinks he knows more about the debate, when he is a newcomer to DDO and I made the debate myself. Anyone that read the resolution then reads I am pro would logically assume I am arguing that it decreases crime. he states: \"Also, my opponent's failure to provide a concrete definition of the most important term in this round is detrimental to this debate.\" No semantics, on the things mentioned above. If you do auto FF - Rule one One of the things you will not semanticise is definitions, whether or not who wins my opponents red herring argument, he already auto FF'd/ CONCLUSION: My opponent argued the wrong side. urge all voters to take a logical look at my past, no gun regulations, and the PRO resolution relation: If I am pro and the resolution is \"Conceal handgun laws reduce violent crime\", it is simple to assume I am arguing it lowers violent crime. My opponent has: 1. dropped my arguments 2. argued the wrong side 3. Persists I argue the wrong side, yet this indicates he has not read the resolution, and the pro resolution relationship is simple enough to hint I am arguing it lowers crime 4. Ruined this debate by his red herring on the who argued what, and refuses to read the resolution 5. Vote pro, as he is not making a case and arguing the wrong side, and to say is with full attitude: its pissing me off. He is essentially trolling a possibly good debate.

            "conclusion": "Choose a Gun Resolution Debate",
            "premise": "I would like to thank Firewolfman for accepting this debate. I will be affirming the resolution that guns should be legal in any capacity.The sphere of my argument is going to revolve around two things: guns' effect on crime, and the constitutionality of guns. First, guns' effect on crime.I. Crime Criminal do fear guns. This can be no more explained than with the concept of hot burglary. This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries were hot. In contrast, 13% in America were hot. What is the reason behind this? Because criminals think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Even think of it as something as simple as apples and oranges. In a closed market of only apples and oranges, if the price of apples increases, the demand for apples decreases, and the demand for oranges increases. Apply this to guns and robberies. If the amount of guns increases, the incentive to rob decreases, and there is less crime. A common misconception is that more guns are used in crime than in defense. However, defensive handgun use is more widespread than crimes committed with guns: \"In sum, DGUs are about three to five times as common as criminal uses, even using generous estimates of gun crimes.\"[4] This is what three seperate studies conclude:John Lott summarized, \"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\"[1] Police studies conclude, \"After controlling for an array of factors, including trends before and after the law went into effect, I show that states that enact concealed carry laws are less likely to have a felonious police death and more likely to have lower rates of felonious police deaths after the law is passed. This result is statistically significant in seven of the nine specifications, and the difference between the before and after trends is significant in over half the specifications.\"[2] Further evidence concludes, \"In this paper, we use a Poisson-lognormal model to analyze intertemporal and geographical variations in the effects of right-to-carry laws on murders, rapes, and robberies. For each of these crime categories, our estimates suggest the existence of statistically significant deterrent effects of right-to-carry laws for the majority of the 10 states that have adopted such laws between 1977 and 1992.\"[3] This graph shows that more guns mean less crime: [5] Here is a chart detailing concealed carry laws's effects on each crime bracket: [1] And finally, here is a very informative graph on the effect of conceal carry laws on crime: [1]Guns do reduce crime and thus should be legal. II. Constitutionality On its face, the second amendment's language, \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\" suggests an intent to guarantee a right which people can effectively enforce. This was invariably what the Founders described on the numerous occasions in which they indicated what they meant by \"militia\" and that is how the identical \"right of the people\" language which appears in the first and fourth amendments has always been construed. The following points are offered to support the contention that the language of the second amendment must be taken at face value: 1. The Founding Fathers praised the individual ownership of firearms in terms that would seem extravagant even from today's pro-gun organizations, and thus there is no reason for assuming that individuals were excluded from the right to arms the Founders wrote into the Constitution. 2. There is no support for the assumption that the right is only a collective one because all the political philosophers cited by the Founders affirmed that the individual's right to possess arms is his ultimate guarantee against tyranny. 3. By \"militia,\" the Founders meant \"all (militarily capable) males ... bearing arms supplied by themselves\". 4. When what was guaranteed by English common law (and confirmed by the English Bill of Rights of 1689) was unequivocally an individual right to keep and bear arms, there is no cause for assuming that its American successor guarantees only an exclusively \"collective right\"--something that did not exist in any legal system with which the Founding Fathers were familiar. 5. Last, if the Founding Fathers had intended to guarantee an exclusively \"collective right,\" they would not have done so in language which (in light of the English and American legal background) their contemporaries could only--and uniformly did--construe as preserving an individual right. The evidence for the individual right interpretation is so overwhelming that the existence of an argument which (by studiously ignoring that evidence) degrades the second amendment into a meaningless \"collective right\" is inexplicable. The readily available explanation is that this \"collective right\" argument has been written under the influence of a violent antipathy to firearms and a profound belief that their eradication will somehow reduce violence. The effect of that belief upon the discussion of second amendment issues has been so great that a brief consideration of the criminological issues is imperatively necessary, even though it is theoretically irrelevant to the legal considerations involved.[6][7][8][9][10]Therefore, the ownership of guns is a constitutional right and thus should be legal. I have provided two proofs as to why guns should be legal - they reduce crime and are protected by the U.S. Constitution. Sources:[1]: Lott, John R. Jr., and David B.

            "conclusion": "In the United States, private ownership of handguns ought to be banned.",
            "premise": "(I would like to apologize now if it takes me a while to respond because I am currently taking classes). I do not believe that banning handguns would better America, make it safer, or reduce the violence that seems to dominate many American cities. Point 1- In America, it is estimated that there are more than 200 million firearms owned by more than 80 million people. Many of these are hand guns. Which brings me to my first point. How are all of these handguns to be removed from the public? If the government attempted to get private handgun owners to turn in their handguns, I have no doubt that most law abiding citizens would do just that. What about criminals that use guns to commit their crimes? Would they be as willing to turn them in? Probably not. That would give the criminals even more opportunity to commit crimes since they know that the citizens are unarmed. The government could try to forcefully try to take the guns away from the citizens and criminals alike, but what stops the guns from being sold illegally. America has been battling with the illegal drug trade for many years yet drugs still pour over our borders. I have very little faith that the government could completely remove handguns successfully. Point 2: I have heard stories of children accidentally shooting and killing a sibling or parent. This brings me to my second point. Accidental death. However tragic, easily preventable. The easiest way to prevent accidental shootings is to acquire a lock safe of some kind that is out of reach of children and has a combination. Parents that do not take the proper precautions to ensure that no harm can come to their children should be locked up and stripped of any right to buy a weapon in the future. Point 3: Although handguns are used in many murders, banning them in the United States would not make the streets safer. If hand guns are outlawed, people with the intent to murder someone would resort to other alternative weapons such as knives, shotguns, rifles, and even blunt objects like baseball bats. Banning handguns will, no doubt, make the streets safer, but it will not completely rid the streets of violence. Point 4: Handguns do make suicide easy, but would banning them really decrease the suicide rate? Many people that own a handgun own some kind of rifle, shotgun, etc. as well. Would it not be just as easy to shoot yourself with a shotgun as it would a handgun? As you said, people with a handgun that have suicidal thoughts are more likely to commit suicide. I, however, think that somebody intent on taking their life will use any firearm that is readily available. Point 5: Some people think that handguns are to easy to conceal. There is a simple fix to that. Require open carry. If a person is carrying a handgun in public, make it a law for them to carry it openly where everyone can see it. That would decrease the amount of handgun murders because people will be more aware of who exactly has a gun. It will allow them to be more prepared if someone does try to attack them. In conclusion, I do not believe that private ownership of handguns should be banned. There is a solution to every problem but the banning of handguns is not the correct solution to America's violence problem.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: The UK police force should routinely be armed with handguns.",
            "premise": "Okay, I'll save my rebuttals for the next round and I'll use this round solely for arguments. Britain and New Zealand have adopted an uncommon style of policing. Their cops typically don't carry guns on the job. You might assume this would lead to more officer fatalities, but that's not the case. In Britain, this tradition stretches back to the 19th century. When the Metropolitan Police force was formed, people feared the military and wanted to avoid a police force that was oppressive, according to the BBC. If police officers don't have guns, then they can't use firearms against citizens. Moreover, police can't have their own guns used against them. By only allowing some officers to be armed \u2014 like a firearms unit in every police force in Britain and cops who patrol security-sensitive places like airports, for example \u2014 the logic goes, there's less of a risk of gun violence overall. A New Zealand police commissioner wrote in an editorial in 2009: I have no doubt that carrying handguns would compromise officers' ability to do their regular work, because when you carry a weapon, your primary concern is to protect that weapon. If this was balanced by a clearly demonstrable increase in personal protection, it would be a price to consider paying. But the protection offered by a firearm \u2014 particularly a pistol \u2014 is more illusory than real. This has actually worked out quite well. The UK and New Zealand fare rather well compared to other countries when it comes to violent crime. They have some of the lowest homicide rates in the world: Gun deaths are lower in Europe and Oceania overall, too: Police shootings are far less prevalent in Britain than they are in the US. In the wake of the Michael Brown shooting in August, The Economist noted that British citizens are about \"100 times less likely to be shot by a police officer than Americans.\" Protests erupted in Ferguson, Missouri after a white police officer shot and killed Brown, an unarmed black teenager, during a routine patrol, leading to a national conversation about police brutality and use of force. What helps Britain and New Zealand pull off unarmed policing is that gun ownership rates in these countries are much lower than in the US, which means that fewer criminals are armed with guns. And police in Britain do have access to tasers to subdue suspects, which is a much safer alternative to guns. HANDGUNS IN GENERAL The first reason handguns should be outlawed for ordinary citizens is because their main purpose is simply to kill other human beings. Why would our country allow us to have the right to own an object that is deadly? Our government seems to want to protect us. For example, seatbelt laws and motorcycle helmet laws were created to protect our lives. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces pollution laws to keep us safe and healthy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspects food and tests drugs to make sure American citizens are not harmed by nasty food and dangerous drugs. Yet, our government allows just about anybody to own and walk around with guns. It does not appear our government really cares about our safety. If it did, handguns would be outlawed for the general public, because their only purpose is to kill people. Second, we should ban the possession of handguns, because the homicide and robbery rate in the U.S. is much greater than in Canada where there are stricter handgun laws. From 1987 to 1996, 52% of all homicides in the U.S. involved handguns while only 14% of all homicides in Canada involved handguns. Also, between 1987 and 1996, firearm homicide rates increased by 2% in the United States but decreased by 7% in Canada. Furthermore, handgun homicide rates in the U.S. are 15.3 times higher than in Canada. Finally, firearm robbery rates in the U.S. are 3.5 times higher than in Canada. Obviously, homicide and robbery rates involving handguns are higher in the U.S. where handgun laws are not as strict as in Canada. Our high crime rate is another reason handguns should be banned. The third and maybe biggest reason that citizens should not possess handguns is because handguns can easily get into the hands of little children. For example, about one and a half years ago, a six year old boy in the Beecher School District took a loaded handgun to school and shot and killed a six year old female classmate. This young boy may not have understood the concept of death. However, because he had easy access to a handgun, he was able to hurt someone he didn't like. This has happened all over the country, like at Columbine High School and many other places. It is sad that this happens, but we shouldn't be shocked. After all, the law allows us to own guns, guns made simply to kill. \"More guns, more mass shootings, coincidence?\" I tried to keep my arguments short in order to keep this a fair debate. Rebuttals should be posted in the final round and hopefully my opponent has time now to make this a fair debate.

            "conclusion": "Giving Teachers Guns",
            "premise": "Teachers would not go out and just shoot a student because they are scared. If this was a scenario then the teacher would instead call the office or police. Teachers may definitely make mistakes and may misuse guns but if it was a teacher against a student the teacher would not or should not be silly and pull out a handgun to shoot a student. Now, say the student has a gun. This is why teachers need handguns. If somebody comes in with a gun what can they do? Sit there while children get shot when they could be doing something? No. Teachers can take action on an active shooter and end the shooting. Now, you stated that \"The idea also fails to take into consideration the fact that teachers are by no means saints who would never misuse guns\". If teachers would misuse guns, any gun owner could misuse a gun. If that is the case, should we just ban guns altogether, causing a riot, a worse black market for guns, and protests? That would be going against our freedom and amendment two, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\". Teachers are civilians and people, too, meaning they should have the right to carry a gun. If teachers have not chosen this program then that is their choice. It will be putting teachers and students at risk but, if the teachers believe that way, we could always arm custodians, principles, or custodians, seeing as they are usually and if not always up and walking around the school, with handguns. But, let's say none of them are comfortable with a gun, since they would not be putting in the money for training for teachers, they could put in money for one or two security guards. I took a look at Isreal and how they prevent their school shootings. They have one armed security guard and have one had half a dozen terror attacks since 1974. Since that is one security guard, wouldn't that mean we only need one armed adult with a conceal and carry and training at schools? ( https://www.cbsnews.com... )",

            "conclusion": "Gun Control/ Assault Weapons Ban/ Concealed-Carry Ban",
            "premise": "Round 2! Thank you for this debate Con, This may be the best one I\"ve ever done. --Concealed Carry Laws -- \" In the research I've done, Concealed-carry holders commit crimes 16% less than police officers. That is how law-abiding they are. [1]\" This is completely irrelevant to the debate. We are not arguing over how safe concealed-carry holders are, We are arguing over whether concealed carry increases crime, Which it does. Let\"s say you put 10 groups of 2 people in rooms, And give them all knives. Let\"s say in 9/10 rooms, Nothing happens, But in one room, Someone gets stabbed. In retrospect, It would still be better to not give these people knives, Even if most of the people are safe, Peaceful, And not accident-prone. \"As concealed-carry goes up by the thousands, In the past 20 years, Violent crime in America has decreased by 50%. [2]\" Unlike the carefully correlated full study that I have presented as the second source in my first argument, [4] Con simply shows a set of 2 statistics. This is the definition of correlation does not equal causation. We can find tons of other reasons for this change, Such as the aging U. S. Population, [1] and the legalization of abortion, [2] which have both decreased crime. --Gun Laws-- You said this: \"I agree on background checks and restrictions on guns, Only law-abiding people should get them, Yes, \" And yet you are arguing with me on gun control. Con is contradicting himself here, By arguing against gun restrictions but agreeing with them at the same time. Is he afraid that if he says that he agrees with me that background checks and mental health checks are necessary he will be conceding this point? Because I can assure him that he is not, And I will object to any vote that is given on that basis. For the record, The two things we disagree on are these: 1)I am against concealed carry, He is for it And 2)I am for a ban on semiautomatic rifles, He is not. For the record, The U. K. Does not have a ban on semiautomatic rifles, Although they do have some restrictions. [3] I suggest that for greater clarity we throw this section out of the debate. --Assault Weapons -- \"Before I start, There is no official term \"assault weapon. \" That is a made up term. What guns are in the \"assault weapon\" category? Automatic guns have actually been banned since the 1930's, So this is an ivalid argument. In addition, Semi-automatic weapons are basically any gun, Like handguns, Pistols, Shotguns, AK-47, AR-15, Etc. So your \"assault weapons\" are my average gun, Because semi-automatic weapons which you constitute into this category is almost every gun. Therefore, You basically want to ban all guns. \" Although it is true that I misphrased, This is nothing short of an incredible leap of logic. Allow me to explain: By \"assault weapon\", I mean semiautomatic rifle. I apologize for the disparity, But I thought that it was a given. Apparently, I was wrong. However, Saying that I want to ban all guns even though I have explicitly clarified to you in this debate and through private messages that I do not want to ban all guns is just a ridiculous statement taking advantage of a technicality. \"There actually is evidence that guns deter crime. According to an unpublished CDC study, [4] there are almost 2. 5 million Defensive Gun Uses per year(DGU's). As stated by a Kleck-Gertz study, 15. 7% of people who were involved in a DGU (Defensive Gun Use) said they almost certainly saved theirs or someone else\"s life. In addition to that, Another 14. 6% said they probably saved a life. Since I want to be conservative with my numbers, Let\"s say that everyone who said they probably saved a life are wrong. Since they surveyed 222 participants, The margin of error with a 95% confidence level calculated to be plus or minus 4. 8%. This signifies that at bare minimum 270, 000 lives are saved by guns, Up to over 500, 000 just counting the \"almost certainly people. \" If all the \"probably\" people are right, Then that number goes beyond 800, 000. Moreover, For every firearm homicide, At least 20-70 lives are saved by guns. If all gun deaths are counted, Then 8-23 lives are saved per death[5]. \" This argument is now irrelevant because there is no evidence from this data that implies that assault weapons account largely for these lives saved by guns, Or that the owners of these guns would have been any better off with an assault weapon than a pistol. Since we agree that all guns should not be banned, These statistics are useless. I once again apologize for the disparity in my language. Here are some arguments against semiautomatic rifles: Pragmatically, Due to their faster firing speed, Semiautomatic rifles are much better able to take down a large number of people in a short period of time. This advantage outweighs any advantage (for which I cannot think of any) for which it could be used in home defense over a pistol. Studies confirm this. Louis Klarevas in his book \"Rampage Nation\" has studied the effects of the 1994 U. S. Ban on semiautomatics. He found that mass killings where 6 or more people were killed decreased by 37% when the ban was instituted, And the number of fatalities decreased by 43%. The ban expired in 2004. When this happened, The mass killing rate skyrocketed to 183% and fatalities also skyrocketed by 239%. Con cannot argue that this could\"ve been replaced by another weapon because for one, These were mass killings, Not mass shootings, And secondly, I doubt that doing this with a pistol or a knife would\"ve had nearly as much effectiveness. [5] \"Most mass shootings, And gun homicides overall, For that fact, Are done with handguns. There are over 2. 5x as much handguns used in mass shootings than any rifle. If we are talking about the number of incidents, Handguns are used 2x as much as rifles. [6]\" For one, There seems to be a disparity in our evidence, Because the Mother Jones Analysis points to rifles as the main weapon. My analysis may be better because it accounts for the most recent shootings as well. [6] Secondly, Okay sure, Handguns account for more homicides but I\"m sure my opponent can agree that there are many more handguns than rifles in America. I\"ve already addressed in the paragraph before this that although there are more pistol killings than rifle killings in America, Rifle killings do contribute to crime and banning them would decrease crime, Which is what we are arguing about. Con seems to consistiently confuse what percentage of crime is done by certain things (which we are not debating about) with would my bans on concealed carry and assault weapons decrease crime (which we are arguing about). --The Second Amendment -- \"I would argue concealed-carry is protected by the second amendment, Because the right to protect yourself doesn't just extend to home-defense, But wherever you go in public. \" Uh\". Source? Explain your reasoning? Where does it say that? Con drops literally all my arguments about Supreme Court rulings and decisions with regards to these subjects and my arguments supporting them. Literally every. Single. One. \"The Constitution is still in tact and just because it was written 200 years ago does not question its validity. \" But it does! It absolutely does! Rules are up for questioning, That\"s why we have rules! Moreover, The constitution was written in a radically different time where a tyrannical government (Britain) did post a threat to American democracy! It was written at a time when the government wasn\"t powerful enough to resist a people\"s militia, Which it now is! We can\"t just blindly follow rules. I have explained that trusting the constitution for it\"s own sake is a ridiculous argument in the previous round. \"They wrote it knowing that they themselves could go tyrannical. \" I ask my opponent: If they were to go tyrannical now, How would a disorganized mass of Americans across the country with guns stand up to the U. S. Military? It\"s like saying we need wooden sticks to break metal walls. We don\"t! \"Just because freedom of speech was made 200 years ago does not mean we should not consider it because the Constitution is too old. Without the second, Their is no first amendment. We have to protect the freedom expressed in the first amendment. \" We have gone back on Constitutional amendments before, Like with the 18th amendment, Which was Prohobition. Did we violate free speech then? Why not revise the document? For the record, I am not opposed to the Constitution or the 2nd Amendment. I think, In fact, That our current provisions for the Second Amendment permit my suggestions for legislation. But if it was ruled that it wasn\"t, I would like to revise the amendment. -- \"I thank my opponent for making good arguments that I could think about and research more. This is probably the hardest argument I have gotten, So props to my opponent for that as well. Thank you for your patience and civility, And if the sources do not go through, I will provide them through a google doc in the comment section, Like armoredcat, My opponent, Did in round one. Now the torch is passed back to you, My friend. \" Same to you. You truly are a very impressive debater, And I was blown away by your argument. This is the hardest debate I believe I have done, And I look forward to continuing it. Also, And I do not want to expose your privacy, But per our online discussions previous to this debate, You are a very kind person who has put up with my technical difficulties. --- In conclusion, I have proved that allowing concealed carry is detrimental, And the allowing of semiautomatic rifles is detrimental. Con has dropped my arguments on the Constitution and I have proven that it is not only allowed by the Constitution, But bringing the Constitution is revisable. Back to you. I have added my sources to the original google doc.",

            "discussionTitle": "Citizens ought to possess handguns.",
            "conclusion": "Citizens ought to possess handguns.",
            "premise": "Although I will admit that not everything is always used with its original intention, the purpose of citizens owning handguns is to protect them. As to harming society in general: Society is not hurt because individuals own handguns. Society is hurt by individuals. You cannot condemn the hammer because the wielder misuses it: in the same way, you cannot condemn a gun as \"bad\" because individuals choose to misuse it. You can't justify taking away a citizen's right to their own protection by saying that others will cause them harm with the same thing they use to protect themselves. Even if handguns were to be legalized, there are ways of getting around laws and regulations that people who intend to harm others will be able to access that regular citizens will not. Example: the black market. Another point: we're arguing handguns specifically. However, there are many other different types of guns. Even if handguns were to become illegal, people who seriously intend to cause damage to others have easy access to OTHER types of guns, such as rifles. All you'd need to do is walk into a hunting/sports store. So arguing that guns are empowering, thus citizens ought not carry HANDGUNS won't benefit society either way: illegalizing handguns for that reason would be pointless. Taking away a citizen's right to owning a handgun will not decrease the potential for crime - it will decrease the potential for defense against crime. Society will be harmed, not helped. You argue that children could potentially get into the guns, or even other people. That is a nonunique arguement. That reasoning could be applicable to any dangerous item in a house, and is not proper justification for the illegalization of a handgun. Lighters were originally intended to do just that: to light. However, they were used as a means of torture by gangs, and the potential for danger when using a lighter is high. However, they are sold over-the-counter. Say a child finds a lighter on a table and accidentally severely burns himself. Should lighters then be illegalized? I think there's another important point to bring up: When a government tells it's citizens that they have no right to carry arms, to protect themselves, and going against its own Constitution in doing so, what message does that send to the citizens? When a government does not adhere to its own laws then its citizens cannot be expected to do the same, which could potentially send us into a state of either anarchy or tyranny. From history we know that anarchy leads to violent revolution, and tyranny leads to death and governmental abuse, and as we're valuing societal welfare in this debate, we cannot take away that right to bear arms because the society will always be harmed.",

            "premise": "According to a 1995 study entitled \"Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun\" by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, published by the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology at Northwestern University School of Law, law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year. That means that firearms are used 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to shoot with criminal intent. Of these defensive shootings, more than 200,000 are by women defending themselves against sexual abuse. About half a million times a year, a citizen carrying a gun away from home uses it in self-defense. By this we must realize that the original reasoning for the right to bear arms still holds precedence in today's debate: the negatives are far outweighed (60 times to be exact) by the benefits of security and self-protection. In New York City, long known for strict regulation of all types of weapons, only 19 percent of the 390 homicides in 1960 involved pistols. By 1972, this proportion had jumped to 49 percent of 1,691. In 1973, according to the New York Times, there were only 28,000 lawfully possessed handguns in the nation's largest city, but police estimated that there were as many as 1.3 million illegal handguns there. Vermont has the least restrictive gun-control law. It recognizes the right of any Vermonter who has not otherwise been prohibited from owning a firearm to carry concealed weapons without a permit or license. Yet Vermont has one of the lowest crime rates in America, ranking 49 out of 50 in all crimes and 47th in murders. (Via Benedict DeMarte) By this we can see that criminals obviously don't have that high of a concern for the law in the first place. Anti-firearm restrictions have no consistent or direct relationship to crime rates. Concealed carry laws have reduced murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them. According to a comprehensive study which reviewed crime statistics in every county in the United States from 1977 to 1992, states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their rate of murder by 8.5%, rape by 5%, aggravated assault by 7% and robbery by 3% (John R. Lott, Jr, University of Chicago) It's pretty obvious that criminals are going to commit crimes when they feel that they have a considerable chance with getting away with it. When criminals fear that they might be on the losing end of the 2.5 million defensive uses of handguns annually in the US, they think twice before committing crimes, and it shows in the statistics. I now leave you in the hands of my opponent.",

            "premise": "I would like to point out, as stated, first round was acceptance. That is also customary on DDO. I will not rebut my opponents arguments until third round, as he broke this rule and DDO... How do I say this, norm? So my opponents arguments are irrelevant until his second round post. I also ask for conduct. The first part of my case will be essentially C/P'd from my blog. I will link too avoid plagiarism of myself ;)http://the-dp-is-good-always.blogspot.com...DeterrenceA common misconception throughout Europe is less guns equal less crime, and the same argument applies in current US media, all claiming guns and conceal carry are evil. Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers, as if the gun is hidden they may be attacked back without warning (polices warning is the uniform). Now, lets look at a thing Lott calls a \"hot burglary.\" This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries where hot. In contrast, 13% in america where hot. Now what is the reason? Because they think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns. Now, lets use some examples of deterrence. Lott uses the literal example of apples and oranges. He says if the price of apples increases while the price of oranges decreases apples sales will decrease, while orange sales will stay the same or increase. This shows the human oh it has consequences effect.Is open carry and conceal carry different, when it comes to deterrence? When a concealed carry permit holder has a gun, it is harder to actually tell if they have a gun. Criminals wont know if they are attacking an old lady, or an old lady packing a .45 Springfield in her purse. This raises the risk to criminals, hence also their preservation. Whereas open carry is much less scary, as you know who not to annoy, and not to annoy anyone around him (as he may help the other person). The conceal carry laws threaten the criminals more. The Stats According to these numbers, the Florida murder rate was 36% lower after the conceal carry law was passed. [2] Similar results in Texas, where it average 30% lower after the law was passed. [2] Then Michigan has smaller results, 45 lower after the law was passed. Lott's findings:Law Passed Murder fell 7.7%, Rape fell 5.3%, Aggravated assault by 7.01%, robbery 2.2%, Burglary .5%, Larceny 3.3%, Auto 7.1%. [1] He also draws preliminary conclusions in the introduction [note he used to be pro gun control if I can recall] using deterrence theory mentioned above. He finds a significant correlation that whenever a conceal carry law is passed, crime rates decrease significantly. In the third addition, the source I am using, he finds his original study said 7.7%, he says after new data and averages from the state and county level he saw a 10% decrease in murder. He also finds if one state/county passes a conceal carry law, the bordering states and counties also gain a crime decrease. He finds based on assaults per 100,000 people went from about 340 to under 320 on average [based on the neighbors passing the law]. [1] Now before I proceed with the empirical evidence, we must ask why does this occur, why does the county overs laws effect my crime rate? Border wars. When gangs fight they fight each other and attack other bystanders. If the bystanders are armed they are then scared to fight as the victim can always fight back [possibly] without warning if they had a conceal carry license. The famed Lott/mustard paper as well as my #1 source find in each of the studies find if each state passed a conceal carry law, it would prevent:\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [3]Now, another question would be does it lower crime committed with guns? This argument used is common amongst people trying to go against conceal carry laws. But this is not the case. In the new 2010 edition of source 1, it finds a 9% decrease in murders with guns after non-discretionary laws are passed. Murders with non handguns dropped at a similar rate, 8.9%.Another question that must be answered: would it increase or decrease mass public crimes? Now, as this is a valid fear, see the recent shootings in Chicago I believe, or Virginia tech. But to define shootings/killings, we must look into what is defined by. It is defined as a public shooting in a place where 2 or more people are killed or injured. Now based n his data in figure 5.1, he found the likelihood of a state to have this happen was about 60%, a little more. After the conceal carry law was passed, data and trends suggests the state now has only a 1% chance of these types of shootings in areas where conceal carry holders are allowed. [1] I may have misphrased the argument here: the likelihood of deaths or injuries when the crime occurs. Essentially saying conceal carry laws make it harder for the psycho to kill when in the area where a conceal carry permit holder resides. To get more local statistics, lets look at his findings in some states. In Oregon, for example, murder dropped 37% after the law was passed. Now, there are other variables he accounted for in the third addition making his data superior to the first. He included arrest and conviction rates to this data, and the study concluded arrest rates lead to .34% drop in the overall murder rate, and the conviction only held .3%. So the arrest rates and the conviction rates lead to nothing essentially of the overall drop. He concludes the conceal carry law did, based on statistics and deterrence [above]. [1]Now lets look at PA. They had a drop in murder of about 26%, and overall violent crime drop of 5.3%. Now, this too had the same variables accounted for, and said a 1% increase in arrest = .79% decrease in overall violent crime. So if we look at it neither of these variables account for the drop. [1]Now lets look at Florida. Before the law the crime decreased at a .15% per year, about. After the law, it dropped by .35% each year. At the same time the amount of permit holders was almost 100,000. [1]The last question is accidental deaths, it decreases. the suicidal deaths rose by 2.67% after the law, and decreased other methods by 6%. Other statistics show an essential double of that, 4% increase for guns decrease 10% for other methods. The statistical difference actually large enough to decrease these whoops moments. CONCLUSION: These laws have a strong deterrent effect on murders with or without guns. Despite the difference on gun ownership of women and men, it also has the significant deterrence in rape and other crimes relating to women. The law also does not raise accidental rates, and maybe decreases them. I could do more, but am out of room. VOTE PRO__________[1] Lott, John R.

            "premise": "Conceal carry laws exacerbates cop violence particularly against black and minorities. By private citizen being allows to conceal their lethal firearms, cops are forced to assume that ANY ONE could be carrying a gun, be they man, women, adult or child. Therefor they are naturally inclined to shot first in order to protect their lives if they feel threatened in the slightest which does not take much because of their own prejudice and police training teaching them to value THEIR lives over citizens. Minorities are greatly affected because even if they are a lawful gun owner in a open carry state or have a conceal carry permit, the majority do not exercise this right cause the majority of cops racial profile and shot first before asking questions so they do not want to take the chance. Criminals on the other hand are forced to conceal because they are acting in a criminal manner and add to the racial prejudice and skewed thinking, even against whites if they are judge to be poor due to their dress, appearance, or speech. Therefor if an officer happens to see a person with a concealed weapon or believes they have a concealed weapon, they are most likely to shot without warning or while warning cause they assume the person is a criminal. Though I don't think private citizens need to go around carrying guns for their protection, as that there are non lethal means available and you are more likely to be shot by friendly fire from another citizen or the cops mistaking you for a criminal or from an angry ex or shooting yourself while cleaning the gun rather then from an ACTUAL CRIMINAL IN THE PROCESS OF A CRIME, and there is the police which we are paying for in the first place, I don't think we need to carry guns at all unlessl for hunting food but I would rather it be open carry instead of conceal if anything at all.",

And 3 accidentally discharged a gun, no one was hurt. [1]My opponents claim only works if he can totally link conceal carry to a portion of gun violence, this is imposable. You find conceal carry permit holders save lives, and not destroy them. Now, my opponents argument is irrelevant unless he links it to his C2. My opponent then continues to the liberal what if argument, not to be rude, but it gets old. The arguments on what IF they fight and shoot one another, well guess what? Since 1977 it has NEVER happened, not once. [2] Your argument fails as conceal carry permit holders are more law abiding then the average citizen,[1] and it has never happened. [2] You might claim \"what if it does\", that is nearly statistically impossible, and even if it happens once or twice, we must ask if it kills more people then it takes away, it does not, it saves more lives, and it takes away none. Your argument fails on a factual basis. Also, you cite marijuana, if you are caught intoxicated with your gun you are arrested. Not to mention it never has happened.[2]C2: Lott's research is not enough My opponent claims one study is not enough, note I cited 3 studies earlier. He essentially forces a counter study, which is a viable refutation, but does not work. He claims his data was small, yet he had the largest study ever done on it, 1977 - 1997, then 1997 - 2000, then 2000-2010, then he compiled the data. [1] If you read his work, he used the LARGEST data set and the MOST data, whereas other studies continually cut out data. [1]My opponent then cites the famous crack problem, this would increase crime preternatural causes, but in states that had CCW laws there was less of a rise, and some still decreased. Now, the argument also fails as his study went also through 1997, hence does not even refute his data. A study done by Plassman, looks into the viability of the study (finds Lott's work 100% correct), Plassman does the job for Lott in refuting the drug question, and actually notes the Lott study did account for the crack variables. They used dummy variables, that likely make the results evade that problem. Also, your quote does little to explain how cocaine would ruin the results, as if that was true there should be an increase of crime, but Lott found a decrease, hence the argument fails, helps my side as it shows CCW prevailed even under drug increases. Further, the book I am using of Lott is a newer edition, that uses new data from other studies as well that do account for the cocaine usage. [1] So, really, your argument fails to refute Lott. Now one can conclude the Lott data is totally accurate.More evidenceHe uses the most bias source, violence policy center, to explain the results. He thinks more guns = more crime and suicides. First it is not true CCW always increases the gun count, as many go to the training. Second, the training these people get teaches them how to store them properly, and lastly many permit holders have their gun with em 24/7, your argument fails. So, my opponent mainly claims I am ignoring the cost of gun violence. I admit guns are in violence, but you miss the point. CCW laws do not really kill people, they save lives time and time again. [1] You keep citing gun violence, but never prove CCW laws are responsible or even a part of it, hence your arguments are invalid.

            "premise": "It sounds like you agree with me on a lot of issues on gun ownership in general lol Yes if stricter laws are implemented that weed out the crazies before hand there is LESS to fear but JUST doing that will not necessary curb cops and other citizens fear that generally anybody on the street can be hiding a lethal weapon, legally or otherwise. Criminals HAVE to conceal carry firearms in order to perpetrate their crimes. A bank robber who openly walks across a busy street carrying an AR rifle, even not wearing a ski mask/hoodie to conceal their identity, will cause a few heads to turn due to fear. As snakes, spiders, brightly colored animals and insects that are poisonious, great heights, and predator animals have been instill over our time during evolution to trigger our fight or flight/danger response, so has guns due to TV, movies, video games, many having personal and usually deadly traumas connected to gun violence, and the media coverage of crimes committed using guns. Though many teens and young child have a numbness to DEATH because of TV, movies, and video games and the miraculous reset after death, they still recognized that guns CAUSE death. Concealing your weapon triggers innate psychological and social fears connected to criminals, even if the person carrying appears to be an upright and law-abiding citizen, though that view is skewed towards white men/women almost exclusively while minorities, no matter how proper they dress or act, will 95% be watched even more closely and with suspicious eyes full of racial prejudice. Cops see a lot of color on color, black, hispanic and asian, crime day in and day out. Although mass shooting and cop violence are saturating the media, the statistics are that most killings are from gang violence, assault and robberies by perpetrators and victims of the same color or another minority. Most use illegal guns that therefor has to be concealed right up until the crime happens and then usually turned on the cops when they are making arrests. Because of this, they have an even more heightened fear of concealed weapons and put more faith, however biased, in the possibility of a person carrying a lethal weapon that can be used against them, especially when engaging minorities. I believe that repelling conceal carry laws will help lessen the incidences of police violence - maybe not right away but as cops will no longer have the defense that they shot a person, usually minority, because they feared they were carrying a weapon or felt threatened by the possibility of a concealed weapon when that person comes towards them or has their hands anywhere but in the air or the ground. The offending cops should therefor should be convicted in greater numbers and other police officers and leaders will take notice and demand stricter training on assessing the situation and using non lethal force on suspects = less deaths.",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his opening arguments. In keeping with the rules of the debate, I shall post my opening arguments first. 1. Gun ownership leads to lower crime ratesStatistics show that an area with easier access to guns will have lower crime rates. Within the U.S., the 31 states which allow the concealed carry of firearms have \"a 24 percent lower violent crime rate, a 19 percent lower murder rate and a 39 percent lower robbery rate than states that forbid concealed weapons.\" [1]. Examples have shown that greater gun control does not lead to lower homicide rates, in fact, the opposite occurs. When Washington D.C. banned handguns, the murder rate shot up from less than 30 per 100,000 to 80 per 100,000. The homicide rate increased, and only decreased following a removal of the ban on handguns, at a time when the homicide rate nationally was decreasing. [2]. Another example is Chicago, where a handgun ban led to a 17% decrease in the homicide rate (lower than the national average of 25%), and a huge increase in the murders committed with handguns, going from just over 40% before the ban to close to 80% in 2007 before the ban was repealed [2]. This shows that within the U.S. more gun control in fact means more crime and greater gun rights, less crime. In terms of international examples, the rule of more gun control leading to more crime still holds true. Countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Germany, Austria and Denmark have a high number of guns per capita ratio while having low homicide ratios compared to nations such as Luxembourg, Holland and England with draconian gun control laws and high homicide rates [3]. In England an increase in gun control has constantly led to an increase in crimes, with England in the late 1800's having virtually no gun crime with little gun control to over 10,0000 gun related offences in 2005/2006 with a large amount of gun control [4] [5].The truth is that gun control laws deprive citizens of guns for self-defence while not affecting criminals other than allowing them to operate under easier conditions. Gun control laws take guns away from people who are using them for non-criminal activities, not criminals. With guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens, they can protect themselves. Guns are used for protection annually 5 times more than they are to commit crimes, and 56% of felons admit that \"A criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.\" It is clear that gun ownership reduces crime and on that account the individual should have the right to possess a firearm.[1] = http://www.cato.org...[2] = http://www.justfacts.com...[3] = http://gunowners.org...[4] = http://reason.com...[5] = http://news.bbc.co.uk...",

            "conclusion": "Gun rights in the US",
            "premise": "C1: Gun bans increase crimeNow, we must look into the facts on gun bans that have happened in the US, as there is always the crowd that calls for ban. Lets look into DC and Chicago, as John R. Lott writes in one of is online articles:\"But it is not just D.C. that has experienced increases in murder and violent crime after guns are banned. Chicago also experienced an increase after its ban in 1982.\" [1] Also, lets look into farther into DC crime rates. In 1976 is when the handgun bans went into effect. At the same time, however, there where major increases in crime. Although the population and density was declining, there where only a few years where the crime was lower or the same as the year 1976, with this information we see the ban had an overall increase in crime. [2] Using a general trend line, we see a C shape, on its side. Before the law was passed, crime was declining slowly, after the ban we saw a continual increase in crime. This shows the cities gun ban actually rose crime. [2]What about other bans? Similar results. Lets look into Chicago. In the eight years before the law was passed, murders per 100k people decreased from 39 to 22, the years after the law we saw increases to 23, with continual rises. In the years following, we saw a similar trend as in DC, only 1 year after the ban was passed did it lower to under the pre-ban crime rates, but this means a general raise in crime trend. [2] How about foreign countries? We also see similar trends. When England banned handguns we saw a 340% raise in gun crime. [2] Other crime rates, robbery etc. Have also soared. In Jamaica, when they banned guns, their crime rate exploded and became one of the highest in the worlds, and double of many of the other Caribbean countries. Gun bans raise crime. C2: Conceal carry laws reduce crime If I can prove this, we can assume they [criminals] are scared of guns, and therefore we should allow guns. Having no guns means we would have no conceal carry laws. If I win this argument, I win the debate as then we should allow conceal carry laws due to their value to society. I will just post a graph:http://www.debate.org... (the computer wont let me post it :(])see source 3 http://polyticks.com...http://www.debate.org... C3: More guns less crimeMy logic stands with deterence. Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers. [2]Also, we should look at robbery. In the US, a small percentage of burglaries are \"hot\", \"hot\" burglaries = robbin a house with people inside. In england, almost 50% of burglaries are \"hot\". We now must ask, why does england have so many more \"hot\" Buglares? Unless my opponent can prove without guns americans are buff studs that scare the crap out of criminals I will hold to the thesis: Guns. Lott has asked criminals, do you rob at night, the usual response is \"No, thats a good way to get shot\". [2] (at night peopel are usually home). With this response we can assume they are afraid of people armed. C4: Second amendment \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"Now, the phrase we get caught up upon is militia, yet the funny thing is that ignors the historical proof that militia was people. in the 1700s the phrase militia actually rarely meant militia, and was more aimed at people. [4] So, historically speaking the document means more of a people not a militia meaning. Now look at the next statement; \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms\". This says flat out right of the people to keep and bear arms, not right of the soldiers. And the last phrase; \"shall not be infringed.\" With this statement, it assumes this is a right that already comes with the job, so to speak. So it assumes the right already exists. Also it was commonlife back then to own a guns, it would be, well, irrational to claim they meant militia. It is unconstitutional to ban total gun rights. Conclusion: If we ban guns, crime raises. If we ban guns, concealed carry goes away and crime raises. If we ban guns it is against the constitution. And havign guns is a benefit to society (crime).

Anyway, on to your points: FIRST AND FOREMOST, just because making something illegal creates the risk of black market sale of said item, doesn't mean we ought to keep the item legal. Further, just because I argue against the resolution, doesn't mean I argue that we should make handguns illegal. You bring up the hammer argument, but it doesn't address anything I said. I'm talking about whether people should have guns, not whether guns themselves have any inherent impact. I know that whole \"guns don't kill people, other people do\" thing, and I agree with it. And it doesn't at all weaken my case. You also mention other types of guns. If guns are to be used as deterrents and/or just for self-defense, what reason is there to conceal them? And then, in response to my concern for child safety, you bring up lighters, saying they were originally intended to light. Guns, as I stated, are originally intended to kill. Not open cans, not power devices, not light a fire. To kill. So no, Ms. or Mr. Sarcasm, lighters should not be \"illegalized,\" because first of all, there's no such word, and second, there's no reason to make them illegal. It is a non-sequitur. And what has this to do with anarchy or tyranny? The right to bear arms says nothing about concealed firearms, and it was written at a time when firearms were weak, inaccurate, unwieldy, and, in short, good for nothing but hoping to deter an enemy identified from a distance. What kind of enemy can be so identified? A soldier in a bright red uniform. So the next time the United States of America is invaded by brightly dressed soldiers, I will be glad to reconsider my position.",

            "conclusion": "Allowing Citizens to Carry Handguns Reduces Crime Rates",
            "premise": "I appreciate Con's arguments, and will begin with direct rebuttals.1 - Con asserts that by limiting accessibility of handguns we will prevent outcomes that are inevitable as explained by the framework of meta-ethics. Con is suggesting that the presence of a handgun can act as a cause for an inevitable outcome. I propose Con hasn't provided any logical reasoning for this viewpoint.2 - I fail to see any connection between regulations and increased crime rates. Con is stating that regulations assert his position, yet these regulations serve to prevent those who have shown themselves criminally-inclined from obtaining handguns.Con's Rebuttals1 - Con asserts that differentiating moral values serves to show that any regulations we put in place only assert that each person is capable of crime. Yes, every person is capable of crime, but whether or not a person becomes a criminal isn't a matter of odds. It is a matter of choice. The regulations only serve to keep handguns out of the hands of people who have already shown themselves inclined to act violently. In this regard, it can be said that those who are approved for permits are more likely to not commit crimes, because the average probability of that particular pool of people has been reduced by removing criminals with a higher probability. Con also fails to provide any reasoning why lack of a handgun would reduce probability. I propose that even without a handgun, a person will still be just as capable of committing crime.2 - Again, capacity to commit crime is not the same as probability. If this were the case, we would see constant instances of people, who have led a peaceful life, suddenly deciding to become criminals. This is clearly not the case. People with a history of criminal activity are more likely to commit crimes than people without a criminal history. This is because people are not walking chance. A person who is trying to be a good citizen doesn't have a random number built into their minds that can roll 'criminal' at any given time. And, Con still hasn't shown why handguns would increase crime rates. The assumption is that Con is stating that handguns increase the likelihood that someone will commit a crime, but I can easily show this to be false. In Florida, the number of citizens with carry permits has increased from nearly 0 to over 800,000 from 1987 to the present time.[1] Despite the dramatic increase, there hasn't been an increase in murders. In fact, the murder rate has fallen 54%.[2] According to Con's argument, the increase in the number of handguns available should have increased the probability of murders. Con's attempted meta-ethical arguments aren't in line with historical statistics, and I assert that the reality of what the murder rate is from year to year is more correct than any meta-ethical argument about the probability of what the murder rate should be.Con stated:\" Indeed, having easier accessibility of firearms/handguns will not only decrease crime rates, but for the values concerning ethical subjectivity that I have shown, will only aggravate and increase probability of crime rate.\" Con states that increased accessibility of handguns will decrease crime rates, but will only aggravate and increase probability of crime rate. This clear contradiction holds no value to Con's assertion.2 - Pro states that the perpetration of a crime depends on the existence of the handgun. We can clearly show that crimes are committed without handguns. Indeed, the hijacking of airplanes on September 11 was done without the use of handguns, or firearms in general. Obviously, crimes can still be committed without weapons. Pro also fails to realize that even if all guns were completely banned, criminals would be able to get access to illegal weapons. After all, drugs are illegal, yet millions of pounds of drugs are smuggled into the US every year. In any case, the issue at hand is not a total firearm ban, but allowing citizens to carry handguns on their persons. Con fails to address my presented situation with two banks, one armed and one not. I assert that a criminal is more likely to attack an unarmed bank than one which has guns inside.Con presents statistics that actually argue the Pro position. From 2000 to 2007, with the number of handguns increasing in the US, the total number of firearm deaths decreased.Again, Con starts to argue that the solution to firearm deaths is the complete removal of firearms. This is not the debate. Con's position is that allowing citizens to obtain permits to carry guns increases crime rates. I have shown the crime rate to decrease as the number of guns carried increases. This refutes Con's position that increased guns would increase crime rates.My previous point 7 showed unequivocally that when the number of handguns carried increased, the murder rate decreased. Con's position is that if the number of handguns carried increases, crime rates would increase. Con doesn't address the study by Kleck and Gertz, showing that citizens use handguns 2.5 million times per year to prevent crimes. In addition to this study, I present as evidence a study by the Department of Justice that determined guns are used between 1.5 and 4.7 million times per year.[3]\"By saying that individuals who have the capability to commit crime and perpetrate such an act are not extremely likely to do so goes against our rational framework on a whole as well as even the resolution itself.\"I propose that it is irrational to say that someone is 'extremely likely' to commit a crime simply because they are capable of it. If that were the case, the vast majority of Americans would be criminals. I assert that handguns can be, and are used by responsible citizens to prevent crimes, as supported by the cited studies.[1]http://licgweb.doacs.state.fl.us... [2]http://www.disastercenter.com...

            "conclusion": "mass murder weopons should be banned by statute",
            "premise": "Dairygirl, Throughout your whole argument you fail to see one thing: Guns don't kill people; the people behind the guns kill people. You say that AK47's are a \"mass murder weapon\", but why are they more so then any othwer weapon? Simply because they are able to fire faster? I don't think this is a logical argument. In the virginia tech shooting 32 people were killed, and many more wounded. Did the shooter use an AK47? No, he used hand guns. Handguns, or any other weapon for that matter can potentially do just as much if not more damage then an AK47 can. Anyone can conceal a handgun, bring it into any random store and start gunning people down. The same cannot be said of an AK47, simply because it is larger in size and cannot be concealed. As long as the person behind the handgun is a good shot, he could carry two of them and have twenty people dead without reloading. I don't know about you, but I have never gone to an arms dealer and had a gun jump off the shelf and start shooting at me. You cannot logically say that guns kill people, therefore, because the gun is not the one shooting. One gun will not kill you and deader (if you will) then the next. It is the malicious intension of the person behind the gun that kills. There are always the people in the world that are messed up enough to murder another person, and there is no way to stop this. If you take AK47'a away, they will use hand guns. If you take handguns away, they will use long-range rifles. You cannot win, then, unless you remove the right to bear arms completely. This, however, would mean the complete removal of one of our rights as American citizens. Why the should it stop there? Why should it stop at the removal of the right to bear arms? Why should they not remove the right to religious freedom? Or the right of free speach? You see, one cannot take away the right to bear arms, because it would lead to more than just the right to bear arms, but the removal of just AK47's and the like would not help our cause at all. Actually, instead of making AK47's illegal, quite the opposite might have a more powerful affect. If everyone was encouraged to carry a weapon like an AK47 around, then shootings like what took place in Virginia tech would dramaticly decrease I think. Most people in the world are not so messed up as to kiil other people, so why would those who are that messed up start shooting madly into a goup of people when most of the people will start shooting back with the same weapon? They generally woud not, unless they are suicidal. It is these suicidal shootings that you cannot prevent then. You can reduce them having people who are that depressed get medical/mental help, but you cannot eliminate them entirely. However, those people that are so depressed as to commit a murder suicide generally do not use \"mass murder weapons\". Generally tey use weapons that can be concealed until the intended time of use; namely handguns. You say that these mass murder weapons make mass shootings easier, but once again, you are wrong. Yes, they can shoot faster, but that does not really mean anything. After 9/11 security in places like airports increased dramatically, and it would be impossible to get any gun passed their security, let alone a weapon as big as an AK47. The murders committed in places like airports decreased, then, with the increase of security. Where do the murderers go then? To places like Virginia Tech. What weapons do they use? Weapons that they can conceal. Your whole argument is based on the fact that AK47's can kill more people, but I have proved that false. They can shoot more people at once, and therefore kill more people on the battlefield, but not in the case of a murder. Thanks for the debate topic! Renzzy",

Columbine and Virginia Tech are only two among multiple other shooting rampages that took place on school campuses. While police responded as quickly as they could, they were unable to stop the shooter(s) before they could kill dozens of students and teachers. Had there been a student or teacher on the school's grounds however, there is a very real possibility that the shooter(s) would have been stopped in the very early stages of their tirade. 2) Utah was the first (and I believe only so far) state to universally allow citizens with concealed carry permits to carry while on college campuses. Thusfar they have had no major incidents that have resulted from CHL holders on college campuses. Other individual college campuses around the U.S. (Ex: Colorado State University) allow concealed carry and have similarly suffered no major incidents from CHL carriers. 3) The only people who would be allowed to carry concealed while on college campuses would be (based on proposed states' legislation) the same people who could normally own and carry a gun everywhere else. To conclude my argument this round, adding concealed carry to college campuses has yet to cause a problem, and therefore, the state has no right to not allow people who already carry concealed elsewhere to carry on campus.",

While police responded as quickly as they could, they were unable to stop the shooter(s) before they could kill dozens of students and teachers. Had there been a student or teacher on the school's grounds however, there is a very real possibility that the shooter(s) would have been stopped in the very early stages of their tirade. 2) Utah was the first (and I believe only so far) state to universally allow citizens with concealed carry permits to carry while on college campuses. Thusfar they have had no major incidents that have resulted from CHL holders on college campuses. Other individual college campuses around the U.S. (Ex: Colorado State University) allow concealed carry and have similarly suffered no major incidents from CHL carriers. 3) The only people who would be allowed to carry concealed while on college campuses would be (based on proposed states' legislation) the same people who could normally own and carry a gun everywhere else. To conclude my argument this round, adding concealed carry to college campuses has yet to cause a problem, and therefore, the state has no right to not allow people who already carry concealed elsewhere to carry on campus.",

            "premise": "Negative Case Contention 1: Concealed weapons permission is unnecessary on campus. Although many point to such incidents as the Virginia Tech shootings to justify the need for concealed weapons, most college campuses are relatively safe compared to other areas in the United States. In 2002, the Justice Department discovered that crime on campus is 20% lower than the national average for individuals of the same age category as college students, and that 93% of the violence that occurs against students takes place off campus. (Source: http://www.bradycampaign.org...). This means that, as a whole, students are more while they reside on campus than they are in the outside world. This has two impacts. First, it demonstrates that concealed carry laws are absolutely unnecessary on campus because the crime rate is extremely low. Since there is no need to solve a problem that does not exist, concealed carry permits should not be extended to the campus. Second, it actually demonstrates that concealed carry laws have an increase in crime; most college campuses are safe without the concealed carry provision, but the outside world, which permits concealed carry, is not as safe as college campuses are. This means that concealed carry provisions may be the reason that crime is higher in the outside world, so increasing the number of guns on campus could potentially replicate the disaster. Gary Kleck, a gun-carrying advocate, concedes, \"Both gun carrying and gun violence are thus phenomena almost entirely confined to the world outside schools.\" Contention 2: Crime would increase on campus. Students who own guns are more likely to be mentally unstable and dangerous than their nonviolent peers. While the college rates for illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, and mental instability is high, studies have shown that individuals who are prone to carrying guns on campus are likely to be more involved in such debauchery than the average student. Two studies of college students discovered, for example, that students with guns more likely to engaged in such risky behaviors as binge drinking, use of crack and cocaine, having DUIs, vandalizing property, and clashing with the police. (Source: http://www.bradycampaign.org...). This means that the students who will actually benefit from the law will be those prone to felonious behavior. Given that most students will not carry guns, and that the students who do possess them will not possess the proper mental faculties to rationally prevent themselves from committing crimes, and that these students are more likely to engage in risky, illegal behavior than the average non-gun carrying college student, crimes on campus will be much easier to commit than they were previously. This means that giving risk-prone students access to weapons could potentially increase violence and other felonies on campus. Since this violates the rights of all, this is a reason to reject the gun laws. Contention 3: Concealed weapons would detract from the educational environment of the school. Given that the mission of colleges is to provide a safe, comfortable environment for a student to obtain an education, and that guns create an aura of fear on campus, permitting concealed weapons on campus would foster mistrust and detract from a student's ability to gain an education. Rather than proving that the campus is safe, the students at a college would attempt to minimize interactions with other students for fear of inciting them to emotional violence. A study conducted to determine the fear of the dissemination of guns discovered that 71% of people would feel threatened by the increase of guns in their community, and that 85% of non-gun owners were opposed to the spread of guns because they felt that it would foster mistrust and lessen their security. (Source: http://www.bradycampaign.org...) This increase in fear would decrease educational freedom by minimizing educational interactions, so concealed weapons should not be permitted on campus. Contention 4: Increasing the number of guns on campus could cause confusion and thus foster a greater loss of life. Consider the following hypothetical scenario: A shooter enters campus and threatens a student, who proceeds to pull out a weapon of his own to confront the aggressor. Students nearby also begin to arm themselves and enter the ensuing fray because they feel that their friends are in danger (we cannot assume that students will only arm themselves against the shooter.) By the time the police arrives, the officers can never reliably know which student instigated the conflict, which students are actually dangerous, and which students were trying to defend themselves. This scenario demonstrates the fact that increasing the number of guns on campus would generate confusion and could cause police officers to threaten even the innocent gun-wielders simply because it would be impossible to identify the actual threat. However, if only one shooter had been armed, the police could easily identify the individual and arrest him, thus minimizing the likelihood of his escape and decreasing the potential loss of life. So, because concealed weapons are unnecessary and detrimental to safety and security, you should negate. Rebuttals First, he mentions Virginia Tech and Columbine as reasons that guns should be permitted on campus. While these incidents were horrific, the reason that the public knows about them is that they are unique. The media does not cover every day shootings in the poor downtown areas because these are expected to happen, while crimes on campus are often covered because the stories are unique and sensational. This means that although he can provide you with a few specific, well-known incidents, we should prefer my statistics in the first contention that explain that most campuses are safer than other areas of the United States, meaning that while a few incidents do occur, on the whole, concealed weapons are unnecessary. Moreover, you can cross-apply my fourth contention about confusion here, because the incidents would have been magnified if some students had engaged the shooters in a conflict. Finally, this problem does not require guns to solve; more incidents can be prevented by increasing the amount of police security and support for students on campus (directly solves his \"police\" argument.) In his second point, he mentions that some campuses with permits have not had any major incidents. First, this could be explained by the fact that most college students do not wish to own guns, and that they cannot have such permits anyways because they need to be 21, so the prevalence of guns on campus is probably very slim. Second, this is empirically false as there have been over 1,400 cases in the state of Florida alone in which CCW permit holders have conducted violent felonies. (Source: http://www.bradycampaign.org...) For example: Tucson, Arizona, October 29, 2002. Robert Flores, Jr. shot and killed three professors, and then himself, in a rampage at the University of Arizona School of Nursing, where he was a failing student. Reportedly, he had told classmates about a year before that he had obtained a CCW permit. Finally, he claims that only those individuals who could carry weapons elsewhere would be permitted to have weapons on campus. Turn this against him because most students across the nation cannot obtain concealed weapons permits until the age of 21, meaning that the majority of college students could not even defend themselves in the case of a violent felony anyways. Second, this increases the likelihood of felonies as individuals outside of campus with permits would be able to safely roam onto campus with their weapons, meaning that they could easily use them against students. Thus, negate and reject concealed carry permits.",

            "premise": "BOP - Carrying a conceal handgun is permitted in 49/50 states, Illinois and DC are the only remainders banning the law. 35 states have shall issue laws, too. I think my opponent still is against the status quo overall, especially with a political and scientific consensus swaying towards my position. The BOP an be negotiated later in a private message, lets not waste a debate on it ;)Deterrence (use with argument below)A common misconception throughout Europe is less guns equal less crime, and the same argument applies in current US media, all claiming guns and conceal carry are evil.Now before we claim criminals can be deterred, we must first ask can they be deterred? The answer is yes, as many economic studies (studies done by economists) find when increased punishments or possible problems occur when doing the crime the negative outweigh the positives of committing the crime, and then they are less likely to commit the crime. Now we must ask why are they deterred by this? The answer is self explanatory, but I shall point out the obvious: They want self preservation, they want to be able to get away with their deeds. Also many surveys conducted show that criminals are more scared of people with guns then police officers, as if the gun is hidden they may be attacked back without warning (polices warning is the uniform).Now, lets look at a thing Lott calls a \"hot burglary.\" This is when a criminal strikes when a person is already at home. In Canada and England, where gun control is very strict, almost half of the burglaries where hot. In contrast, 13% in america where hot. Now what is the reason? Because they think they may get shot, they say robbing at night when people are home is the best way to get shot, they would rather case a house. This proves they fear guns.Now, lets use some examples of deterrence. Lott uses the literal example of apples and oranges. He says if the price of apples increases while the price of oranges decreases apples sales will decrease, while orange sales will stay the same or increase. This shows the human oh it has consequences effect.Is open carry and conceal carry different, when it comes to deterrence? When a concealed carry permit holder has a gun, it is harder to actually tell if they have a gun. Criminals wont know if they are attacking an old lady, or an old lady packing a .45 Springfield in her purse. This raises the risk to criminals, hence also their preservation. Whereas open carry is much less scary, as you know who not to annoy, and not to annoy anyone around him (as he may help the other person). The conceal carry laws threaten the criminals more.The empirical data Law Passed Murder fell 7.7%, Rape fell 5.3%, Aggravated assault by 7.01%, robbery 2.2%, Burglary .5%, Larceny 3.3%, Auto 7.1%. [1] (1977-1997 data)Other data, his 1999 data, shows a better outcome of a 10% decrease in murder, and the other categories too had a larger decrease in crime, hence CCW in hi later data was slightly revised in new data sets. Lotts early data can be found in #2. Now lets look at PA. They had a drop in murder of about 26%, and overall violent crime drop of 5.3%. Now, one of the criticisms of this basic trend is just because the drop happened after the law, we can also look at other variables, the most common one is arrest rates. Lott makes many dummy variables, tables, and to the best of his ability shows CCW laws where a significant portion of the decrease. [1] Another reasons he concludes the drop is because when there is a spike in people who have permits there is a decrease in violent crimes. To get more local statistics, lets look at his findings in some states. In Oregon, for example, murder dropped 37% after the law was passed. Now, there are other variables he accounted for in the third addition making his data superior to the first. He did other dummy data sets, and still finds CCW had a large portion of the deterrence an drop in crimes. [1] Now, it is logical to assume they actually decrease crime due to my deterrent argument above. The CATO study also finds similar reasons why it would actually decrease crime. They also fund similar accounts of data, and they conclude the Florida CCW law was positive and the other states that passed these laws also had a positive showing. Another question that must be answered: would it increase or decrease mass public crimes? Now, as this is a valid fear, see the recent shootings in Chicago I believe, or Virginia tech. But to define shootings/killings, we must look into what is defined by. It is defined as a public shooting in a place where 2 or more people are killed or injured. Now based n his data in figure 5.1, he found the likelihood of a state to have this happen was about 60%, a little more. After the conceal carry law was passed, data and trends suggests the state now has only a 1% chance of these types of shootings in areas where conceal carry holders are allowed. [1] I may have misphrased the argument here: the likelihood of deaths or injuries when the crime occurs. Essentially saying conceal carry laws make it harder for the psycho to kill when in the area where a conceal carry permit holder resides.Now, another question would be does it lower crime committed with guns? This argument used is common amongst people trying to go against conceal carry laws. But this is not the case. In the new 2010 edition of source 1, it finds a 9% decrease in murders with guns after non-discretionary laws are passed. Murders with non handguns dropped at a similar rate, 8.9%.\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [1] [2] (1997 study)Summary -- This was found in one of Lotts rebuttal paper defending his origional 1997 paper. *The majority of my sources can be found online, and source 1 can be gogled on google books and you can look into the specific data I cited*Conclusion:I have failed to see any good statistical analysis showing the opposite of my data. I am aware of two studies arguing the opposite, but both involve the same author and are not acedemically refered. The other data I saw was created by bias gun control organizations. For my opponent to win the debate, he actually must argue it increases crime. If it has no effect then there is no other reason against it. I urge a CON vote.

            "conclusion": "Right to carry a firearm should be allowed in all 50 states because it reduces crime",
            "premise": "I would like to begin by clarifying three issues within this debate, no matter how important they are. (1) If you believe that giving a gun to some one to carry might cause crime rates to go up then, from 1987 to 1999 221443 right to carry permits where given out, out of those 220000 plus people only 18 crimes where committed by these persons. (Lott, John R. Jr. and Mustard, David B. \"Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns.\" University of Chicago School of Law, 7/26/96.) Posted by my opponent. At first notice this suggests that it is a statistic of the nation of the United States. But to clarify, it only deals with Florida, \"* 221,443 concealed carry licenses were issued in Florida between October of 1987 and April of 1994. During that time, Florida recorded 18 crimes committed by licensees with firearms. \" http://www.justfacts.com... Notice that it also seems that my opponent has altered the statistic, stating from 1987 to 1999. But when the actual evidence is looked at from its source you can see that it says 1987 to 1994. My opponent states that it could have possible been a human error, but we can't know for sure. (2) \"Also what my opponent either doesn't know who has not acknowledged yet is that by me arguing for conceal and carry in all 50 states I am really only arguing for conceal and carry to be legal in Illinois and Wisconsin, because those are the only two states in the entire United States that do not have some form of conceal carry.\" My opponent must be referring to the map shown below in the link. http://www.wmsa.net... However, this map states that there are 65.7% of the US population lives in \"Right To Carry\" (Vermont, Alaska & 37 \"Shall Issue\") states, 28.1% in \"Right Restricted\" (9 \"May Issue\") states, and 6.3% in \"Right Denied\" (2) states. This means that 11 states may or can't issue right to carry laws. That means he is also arguing for these 11 states. I believe that my opponent has also not given examples of why these specific states would benefit. I have provided enough evidence to at least discredit my opponents source about Florida and shown that it can also be used both ways. (3) \"If a trained police officer barges into a room, knowing exactly where the \"test subjects\" where seating there would be little anyone could do. How do I know this, well if you watch the case study you see that the trained police officer goes into room gun drawn and goes after no one else but the \"test subject\". It would also be very hard to defend yourself if you where wearing baggy pants and do not have you firearm in a holster like logic would presume for just such situation, I forgot to mention the over sized white tee-shirt you are wearing.\" My opponent has correctly identified the experiment I have cited. However, the test subject was not the first fired at; in fact, he had ample time to unholster his weapon and fire the weapon. The attacker was trained (for safety reasons of course) and fired first at the lecturer of the class, then took a while to spot the person in the crowd with the weapon. As for clothing, you can't expect every kid in the room with a concealed weapon to wear his shirt tucked in and have \"non-baggy\" pants. As for a side note, a couple of the test subjects actually missed the attacker when shooting and hit one of the people running out the door behind him. This shows that, just like a police officer, you need years of training to become accurate enough to shoot at someone that is standing in front of a crowd of people. So, after clarifying this aspect, it is safe to assume that this experiment accurately portrayed what would happen if concealed carry was allowed in colleges. =General Refutations to my Opponents Arguements= ((1)) My opponent mentions that I have not provided any evidence showing that teenage drivers are the leading factor of car accidents. Well here, \"Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. \" Along with more evidence to support this claim. http://www.rmiia.org... ((2)) As for the controversy over Florida. I did not specifically say that the statistic does not help your case. I implied that it could also be turned around and used for mine. He states that if everyone had Florida's same laws on concealed weapons, what would suggest that Homicide rates would continue to increase throughout the nation. However, my opponent has said that the laws of all states regarding concealed carry vary greatly. He condradicts himself and tries to create a theory that all states will have the same law, and therefore homicide rates will decrease, but as he has already stated, \"but it is very hard to tell difference between the to due to the fact that everystate has different firearm laws\" As a side note, I believe my spelling and grammar constitutes a point for me. Had to state that somewhere. ((3)) I have also shown that my opponent may have altered evidence, to which he replied, \"\"As for my \"falsified facts\", I would like to suggest the human error of typo\"\". This is a very vague rebuttal to something to which he simply could of said, \"I made a mistake\". Instead he wishes to suggest that he did it, but does not take a stand. ((4)) I brought up my opinion of why concealed carry was wrong. My opinion no needed facts. I had expected to hear some of my opponents opinion. Instead he insists on copying and pasting evidence from other sites and draws blatant conclusions on them. He states, \"My opponent states that it is the job of the government to protect our rights, but what about our lives?\" I believe the natural rights of every citizen still stands to be the Right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. So to answer your question, I meant all three of these when mentioning rights of citizens of a government. I would like to ask some rhetorical questions which will hopefully have an impact on the readers judging decision. ;) Is it not one of the foundations of our government to uphold and protect it's citizens rights? Is it not the job of the State police and County police to serve and protect us as a people? Don't these State police and County police have years of experience which allow them to become one of our protectors? Why should we then, pass on the job of a professional policeman, to each citizen's of the United States? Why allow the use of a life or death weapon, to be placed within a human's hands which is capable of destroying lives? The answer is, we shouldn't. Because I have provided thoughtful insight and evidence to support my side of the resolution, I urge a negative vote.",

            "premise": "I thank con for accepting this debate! Lets look at the \"rights\" con listed. A \"right\" to a trial by jury or a \"right\" to an attorney. This falls flat when we understand that a right can only be a \"right\" if it does not violate the \"right\" of another human. The use of force is carried out to make people sit as a jury, who would otherwise spend their time doing what ever else they wish to do. It is irrelevant if a group of people say \"this is now a right!!\". If it violates the right of another human, it cannot be a \"right\". The \"right\" to an attorney falls flat as well. Public attorneys are paid with taxes. By definition, public attorneys are paid with stolen money as theft is when something (money) is taken from someone without their consent. Therefore, a \"right\" is not a \"right\" simply because a police officer or judge says \"you have a right to an attorney\". It violates the \"rights\" of other people. Con goes on to say the right to bear arms does not apply to felons. Well in many states this so called \"right\" written by man fails people on a daily basis. In New York state, a judge can be as arbitrary (which is why man cannot create a right) as he/she wants. If a person has too many parking tickets, the judge can declare the person cannot have a handgun. This is besides the fact that a handgun is a firearm, yet in New York, one must apply for a permit. See a small group of people who claim the \"right\" to rule over 300,000,000 other people cannot create \"rights\" simply because they arbitrarily choose when to uphold or toss out those \"rights\". The \"right\" to marry for example was tossed out for gays for a long time. Now the small group of people who rule say, \"ok we guess you can have these rights too\". Rights are not given to people by courts, police, politicians etc. This notion that people have a right to education implies that someone is forced to educate. Otherwise they are violating the \"right\" of the person wanting to be educated. Rights are not given. They just are. Man can recognize these \"rights\" or not. That is irrelevant. I do not argue that people should have a good education. I do not argue that people should have good health care. However, to say these are \"rights\" would imply someone must give the education or health care, which is an irrational thought to have. People have the right to educate themselves. People have the right to provide their own health care, but that is not what this debate is about. It is about people saying other people should be forced to pay or actually do the educating because a small group of rulers declare its their \"right\"",

            "discussionTitle": "On Campus Concealed Carry",
            "conclusion": "On Campus Concealed Carry",
            "premise": "Rebuttal to Contention 1: My opponent argues that CCWs (concealed carry weapons) on campus are unnecessary because campuses are statistically safer (on average) than other areas of the country. The problem with that reasoning is that while there is less crime, that doesn't mean that crime on campus doesn't exist. Students who are likely to be attacked and become victims of crime are also those least likely to be able to defend themselves, which includes women and people with physical disabilities. The best way for them to equalize their chances of protecting themselves is for them to be allowed to carry concealed. My opponent also makes the argument that the lower crime rates on a college campus indicates that concealed carry laws increase crime. Not only is that assuming that correlation implies causation, it's not even representative of the facts. If you look at the states where concealed carry is new or non-existent (Illinois is currently the only state without concealed carry) compared to states with more loose carry laws, there is no definite difference between them (http://www.disastercenter.com......). In fact, looking at college campuses where concealed carry is allowed, there has been no significant increase in crime since the colleges started allowing students to carry. Therefore, based on statistics, there is no reason to believe that adding concealed carry to college campuses would negatively impact student life. Rebuttal to Contention 2: My opponent claims that \"Students who own guns are more likely to be mentally unstable\". I don't know where my opponent gets that from but I've never seen any indication that that's true. Also, we are not debating who should own guns, only whether it should be legal to take them on a college campus. My opponent then cites two studies mentioned in a Brady Campaign article about the behavior of students with guns. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the studies mentioned by my opponent and I would appreciate it if he could post a link directly to the studies or if he could say where and under what name the studies are listed. My opponent then goes on to talk about how unstable and risk prone gun owners are. Since I couldn't find the studies con got these claims from, I have no reason to believe them. Also, if someone is prone to break the law, why would they care if a law is passed allowing concealed carry? They would carry regardless of what the law says. Rebuttal to Contention 3: The study my oppenent referrences asked whether or not people would feel safer if more people owned guns. The debate isn't over where or not more people should own guns, it's about where people who already own guns should be able to take them. Therefore the study really has no relevance in this debate. Additionally, my opponent's claim that allowing students to carry concealed will foster an anti-social fearful environment is unsubstantiated by off-campus society, where people in states with loose carry laws are no less social than people in states with strict gun laws. In fact, the gun shows that I have been to (where EVERYONE is packing) are some of the most social places I've been. Rebuttal to Contention 4: In my opponent's final point, he claims that having multiple people having guns will cause a shooting incident to become confusing to students and the police. I have yet to come across a similar shooting incident where police couldn't differentiate between victim and assailant. In fact during the UT tower shooting, students armed with their own weapons were able to pin the shooter in the tower until police could arrive and take over. At no point was there confusion over who the police needed to deal with and the students were able to help take control of a very dangerous situation. Con also says that police could potentially shoot an innocent CHL holder. While it is a slight possibility (I say slight because as I said before, there's no history of it happening) it's a choice that the CHL holder makes. Just as a police officer makes the choice to put himself in danger by accepting the job, a CHL holder makes the concious decision to accept the risk that comes along with it. Also my opponent says, \"This scenario demonstrates the fact that increasing the number of guns on campus would generate confusion and could cause police officers to threaten even the innocent gun-wielders simply because it would be impossible to identify the actual threat.\" Hypothetical situations in no way constitute evidence and shouldn't be relied upon to demonstrate \"facts\" that don't actually have any evidence to back them up. \"Second, this is empirically false as there have been over 1,400 cases in the state of Florida alone in which CCW permit holders have conducted violent felonies.\" I never said that CHL holders never commit crimes since that's not what this debate is about. I said that CHLs have not added to the crime committed on campuses that allow them. \"Tucson, Arizona, October 29, 2002. Robert Flores, Jr. shot and killed three professors, and then himself, in a rampage at the University of Arizona School of Nursing, where he was a failing student. Reportedly, he had told classmates about a year before that he had obtained a CCW permit.\" If I'm not mistaken, the University of Arizona did not allow students to carry concealed at the time. So how exactly did CHLs being banned on campus keep him from shooting his professors? As for my opponent's final rebuttal, just because not veryone can carry to protect themselves doesn't mean that nobody should be able to.",

            "discussionTitle": "On Campus Concealed Carry",
            "conclusion": "On Campus Concealed Carry",
            "premise": "Rebuttal to Contention 1: My opponent argues that CCWs (concealed carry weapons) on campus are unnecessary because campuses are statistically safer (on average) than other areas of the country. The problem with that reasoning is that while there is less crime, that doesn't mean that crime on campus doesn't exist. Students who are likely to be attacked and become victims of crime are also those least likely to be able to defend themselves, which includes women and people with physical disabilities. The best way for them to equalize their chances of protecting themselves is for them to be allowed to carry concealed. My opponent also makes the argument that the lower crime rates on a college campus indicates that concealed carry laws increase crime. Not only is that assuming that correlation implies causation, it's not even representative of the facts. If you look at the states where concealed carry is new or non-existent (Illinois is currently the only state without concealed carry) compared to states with more loose carry laws, there is no definite difference between them (http://www.disastercenter.com...). In fact, looking at college campuses where concealed carry is allowed, there has been no significant increase in crime since the colleges started allowing students to carry. Therefore, based on statistics, there is no reason to believe that adding concealed carry to college campuses would negatively impact student life. Rebuttal to Contention 2: My opponent claims that \"Students who own guns are more likely to be mentally unstable\". I don't know where my opponent gets that from but I've never seen any indication that that's true. Also, we are not debating who should own guns, only whether it should be legal to take them on a college campus. My opponent then cites two studies mentioned in a Brady Campaign article about the behavior of students with guns. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the studies mentioned by my opponent and I would appreciate it if he could post a link directly to the studies or if he could say where and under what name the studies are listed. My opponent then goes on to talk about how unstable and risk prone gun owners are. Since I couldn't find the studies con got these claims from, I have no reason to believe them. Also, if someone is prone to break the law, why would they care if a law is passed allowing concealed carry? They would carry regardless of what the law says. Rebuttal to Contention 3: The study my oppenent referrences asked whether or not people would feel safer if more people owned guns. The debate isn't over where or not more people should own guns, it's about where people who already own guns should be able to take them. Therefore the study really has no relevance in this debate. Additionally, my opponent's claim that allowing students to carry concealed will foster an anti-social fearful environment is unsubstantiated by off-campus society, where people in states with loose carry laws are no less social than people in states with strict gun laws. In fact, the gun shows that I have been to (where EVERYONE is packing) are some of the most social places I've been. Rebuttal to Contention 4: In my opponent's final point, he claims that having multiple people having guns will cause a shooting incident to become confusing to students and the police. I have yet to come across a similar shooting incident where police couldn't differentiate between victim and assailant. In fact during the UT tower shooting, students armed with their own weapons were able to pin the shooter in the tower until police could arrive and take over. At no point was there confusion over who the police needed to deal with and the students were able to help take control of a very dangerous situation. Con also says that police could potentially shoot an innocent CHL holder. While it is a slight possibility (I say slight because as I said before, there's no history of it happening) it's a choice that the CHL holder makes. Just as a police officer makes the choice to put himself in danger by accepting the job, a CHL holder makes the concious decision to accept the risk that comes along with it. Also my opponent says, \"This scenario demonstrates the fact that increasing the number of guns on campus would generate confusion and could cause police officers to threaten even the innocent gun-wielders simply because it would be impossible to identify the actual threat.\" Hypothetical situations in no way constitute evidence and shouldn't be relied upon to demonstrate \"facts\" that don't actually have any evidence to back them up. \"Second, this is empirically false as there have been over 1,400 cases in the state of Florida alone in which CCW permit holders have conducted violent felonies.\" I never said that CHL holders never commit crimes since that's not what this debate is about. I said that CHLs have not added to the crime committed on campuses that allow them. \"Tucson, Arizona, October 29, 2002. Robert Flores, Jr. shot and killed three professors, and then himself, in a rampage at the University of Arizona School of Nursing, where he was a failing student. Reportedly, he had told classmates about a year before that he had obtained a CCW permit.\" If I'm not mistaken, the University of Arizona did not allow students to carry concealed at the time. So how exactly did CHLs being banned on campus keep him from shooting his professors? As for my opponent's final rebuttal, just because not veryone can carry to protect themselves doesn't mean that nobody should be able to.",

            "conclusion": "THBT teachers should not have the right to carry concealed weapons in the classroom.",
            "premise": "I accept my opponent's altering of the definition. I will now proceed to protect my original arguments while piecing apart my opponent's arguments. CONTENTION 1 Yes, it is better to save the lives of, say, 5 children rather than none, yet it is far better to prevent the occurence of a shooting altogether. My opponent seems to almost accept the fact that there will be shootings regardless, and that all we can do is to minimize the effects. This is not true. It would be far more effective to invest into more police officers (I will expand upon this in the third contention), better security systems such as gates, and programs to help a potential shooter before the shooting actually occurs. Also, policemen nation-wide have a hit rate of about 34 percent of all bullets fired. This includes suicides among policemen. If policemen, who's entire careers revolve around enforcing laws using physical violence (if necessary), only have a 34 percent hit rate, then what will the accuracy be like of a teacher, who has little experience in an actual gun fight, is a nervous wreck, has heard shots already being fired down the hall, and is very emotionally attatched to the children she/he has suddenly been tasked to protect. If anything, the teacher might hit another student, or instigate even more shooting once the shooter come under fire. Think also of the availability of the weapon. It is unlikely that the teacher keep it on their person, because a gun holster or strap requires a blazer over it, which is highly unrealistic for hot weather. So the gun would most likely be placed in a locked drawer, which would be extremely difficult to access in the case of a shooting. I will expand upon cost issues and limited police force in the third contention. SECOND CONTENTION Given that a background check is required, many of these background checks are not effective, as my opponent admitted. \"Easily near by teachers can come and shoot the out of control teacher \" this is a complete logical falacy. First of all, the motion states that teachers have the right, not that it is a requirement, so not every teacher may have a gun. Also, how long does it realistically take to kill a room full of un-armed students? Too long for it to be stopped. And finally, if you did not arm teachers in the first place, this scenario would have no chance of occuring! Therefore, my opponent has in fact stated why teachers should not have guns, since they have stated a disastrous scenario in which a teacher posseses a weapon. THIRD CONTENTION I assume that there is a lack of policemen to secure the schools because of lack of funds. Yet if the guns are payed for by the individual teachers (and remember, not all will have it, for it is not required, only a right), very few will have one, for a gun, plus a concealed weapon liscence, as well as ammo and gun-checkups are very expensive relative to a teacher's generally low salary. If the govenrment is paying, then again, this will be of much cost for the govenrment, including background checks and periodical checks. These funds instead could be diverted to hiring more police officers to serve these schools, and increased security to stop the problem before it occurs, not while it already has happened. Also, if a rehabilitation program is offered in a more friendly, effective manner to the whole student body, troubled students may first consult with a counselor before any extreme measures are taken, or may be more easily identified with a more extensive, better funded program(s).

            "conclusion": "Gun Control/ Assault Weapons Ban/ Concealed-Carry Ban",
            "premise": "In the light of increased gun crime and mass shootings, Many a reasonable human has called for some sort of change to happen with our firearm laws. Although scholars seem to agree that it is the time for change, Some ideologues still stand firmly behind the current legislation? Why? Do they have the facts on their side? In this debate with Our_Boat_is_Right, Who I admire for his strong ability to debate and dedication to the craft, I will be setting out to prove that the answer is a firm \"no. \" --Concealed Carry Laws-- The National Research Council has found that \"shall issue laws\" (laws that require authorities to issue concealed carry permits) increase crime rates by 3 - 5 % [1]. Another study by Stanford Professor John Donahue also found that conceal carry laws increase crime [2]. There's very little to no studies that anyone can cite that say that concealed carry laws decrease crime. So, I ask Pro, Why does he support concealed carry? --Gun Laws-- My argument for gun laws is short, Simple and to the point: Places that have more gun laws have less gun crime than places that have less gun laws. We find that countries with more gun laws have less crime, [4] and although it is true that it is impossible to prove that less gun laws are cause of this, We can find that the states in the U. S. With less gun laws pretty consistiently correlate with the states that have the most gun crimes. [5] -- Assault Weapons -- Automatic and semiautomatic weapons do not save lives, They kill people. There is no reason to keep assault weapons. There is no evidence that they deter crime any more than your average gun. Will someone who may already be mentally unstable or desperate enough to rob a house draw the line at seeing not a regular gun but an assault weapon? There is no evidence that they do anything better than your average gun, Except kill large amounts of people. This is why they are the weapon of choice for mass-shooters. [3] --Unconstitutional? \" Finally, Some radical defenders of guns posit that gun restrictions, Bans, And the like are wrong simply because they violate the fundamental lawbook of our American society: the Constitution. But is this true? Are gun control advocates really violating the constitution? My answer is no, And this is what will be addressed in this contention. Here is the Second Amendment: \"A well regulated militia, Being necessary to the security of a free state, The right of the people to keep and bear arms, Shall not be infringed. \" According to The Supreme Court, Gun law regulation to keep guns away from criminals and the mentally ill is perfectly constitutional, Which is all the handgun control I advocate for. [6] The Supreme Court also dictated that banning sawed-off shotguns also doesn\"t violate the Constitution because they saw no way that a sawed-off shotgun could be used lawfully. [6] These similar restrictions would also apply to an automatic and semiautomatic weapon because these rifles were also made for the use of military combat, To kill as many people as possible. So, It is true that it is legal to ban certain guns. [6] Finally, Whether the Constitution prohibits regulation or banning of concealed carry laws is still up in the air. Of course, This could all be seen as an appeal to authority. So here are some of my individual arguments: It is fairly obvious that the Constitution would not want mentally insane people or criminals possessing guns. So gun control is pretty reasonable. It is also ridiculous to say that the Constitution would be against allowing assault rifles, Because they are guns that could be used for self defense. By that logic, Could someone have a turret gun on the top of their house, Because they could use that to protect themselves? Could someone have a bazooka gun, Because it could be used to protect themselves? How deep does this rabbit hole go? ! Finally, The Constitution says you can have guns. It doesn\"t say anyone can have guns. It doesn\"t say you can have any gun you want. It most certainly doesn\"t say you can own guns anywhere? On top of all of this, Bringing up the Constitution, A document written hundreds of years ago to dictate a government that had just escaped tyranny and was radically different from our own in modern times, Is nothing more than an appeal to authority. Just because it\"s an important law doesn\"t mean it\"s subject to scrutiny. In conclusion, I have proved that concealed carry laws increase crime and thus should be disallowed, Assault weapons increase crime thus should be disallowed, And I have proved that gun regulations decrease gun crime and thus should be implemented, And I have done it all within the framework of the Constitution.

Ultimately, it comes down to individual subjective judgment. Let's take a look at the spiel on rape I presented in round 1. Most cases of confessed rape were not actually cases of rape, but the women who made the claims supporting the 1 in 4 statistics claim otherwise. Consider this: you're making out with a woman and you're getting it on quite nicely. You decide that it's time to hit home base. However, the moment you make your move, the woman pulls out a gun, calls you a rapist, and makes you leave. You decide not to leave, and she shoots you in the head. She had to right? Otherwise he wouldn't leave? Later she can claim that he tried to rape her as is conducive to the false rape statistic. Isn't that just ridiculous?Crimes on college campuses:My opponent declares that his goal with the college campus statistic is to show that violent crimes do happen on college campuses. However, he neglects that the statistic also covers the fact that violent crimes happen everywhere and that they occur less often on college campuses. It is this lessened frequency which shows that prohibitions on concealed carry works. My opponent's argument is this: crimes exist on college campuses and permitting concealed carry will solve that problem. That's quite an assertion. How does my opponent know that permitting concealed carry won't actually increase the rate of crime? Don't college campuses' low crime rate actually prove that not having concealed carry actually decreases the rate of crime? Less guns around means less guns being shot, and statistics clearly corroborate this. College campuses are some of the safest places in the world and is a clear case in which a community with no conealed carry laws have lower crime rates.The under 9000:Let us revisit this statistic of homicide versus justified homicide. Of the about 8300 gun-related homicides in the year 2010, only 200 were considered justified homicides with the other 8000 are considered criminal. My opponent counters by saying that the 230 cases of justified self-defense fire negates the 8000 criminal homicides and justifies concealed gun carry. My opponent then goes on to say that the 8000 criminal homicides were not committed by concealed gun permit owners. Let me this around and ask: how does my opponent know that the 8000 weren't concealed gun permit owners. In 2012, James Eagan Holmes shot and killed 12 people at a theater in Colorado. The firearms he used were legally purchased and possessed.[1]An even better question: how does my opponent know that the 230 justified killers were concealed gun permit owners? If these 230 aren't concealed permit owners, how does my opponent justify using these 230 to justify concealed carry laws? 230 bad guys were put under the dirt, but 8045 innocent people lie with them. The statistic shows that 97.2% (8045/8275) of self defense homicide, permit or not, are going to be criminal.Statistics on Crimes in college:Again, 93% of crimes on college students occur off campus. Most of the cases cited in my opponent's case are cases of offcampus defense, and only a few of them mention concealed carry permit holders.I would like to point out this case in particular:PRO: \"University of Southern California students overpowered a man, taking away his firearm and holding him at gunpoint for police. The man had become violent and threatening towards a female at a student party and refused to leave.\"Consider this: What if this case were reversed? What if the students were the ones threatening the female and refusing to leave and the man was the one with the firearm trying to deter such behavior? In this case, the students' overpowering the man would be a terrible thing. The likelihood of such a thing occurring increases with each gun owner added to the pool of gun owners.I would like to point out the distinction between a student having prevented a crime and a student having prevented a crime on college campuses. Recall that this debate is about concealed carry on college campuses, not off college campuses. I posit that the statistics on violent crime provided by my opponent in this last round would be reduced if guns were banned and not the other way around as my opponent seems to be saying. My opponent has provided no evidence whatsoever that the total rate of crime would be reduced with concealed carry laws. Again, college campuses' being statistically more crime free than almost any other environment in the world clearly shows that not having concealed carry laws is correlated with reduced crime. Again, less guns overall means less gun-related crime. PRO:\"While college campuses usually have lower crime rates, they are not crime free.\"Nowhere in the world is crime free. My opponent seems to be claiming that concealed carry laws would make college campuses completely free of crime. Again, there is no evidence whatsoever that having concealed gun laws would magically remove the existence of all crime. There's no such thing as crime-free. In fact, I posit that concealed guns are the cause of a number of crimes and that not having concealed gun laws lowers crime and not vice verse as evident of the relatively low crime rate on college campuses.SummaryI hope that I have shown that college campuses do not need conceal carry laws and do not need to carry weapons while on campus. While a few cases of gun use may be justified, we have to remember that most are not. I must also point to the fact that this debate pertains specifically to concealed carry on college campuses. I have succinctly shown that college campuses have lower crime rates without concealed carry laws. I believe that is sufficient in negating the resolution.\"the U.S. has the best-armed civilian population in the world, with an estimated 270 million total guns.\"[2] The real question is, what portion of the concealed carry population will commit a violent crime?

In response to this I'd like to ask my opponent, would giving the power to the federal government allow people who are mentally ill or an ex-convict to purchase a hand gun? Of course not; in fact, our government would ensure this would not happen. I'd also like to point out my opponent has provided no evidence to back up this claim. I'd now like to go on to my own arguments. -First, states should not have the right to restrict handgun ownership to eligible citizens because this would restrict the liberties of only certain people, which violates the Constitution, whose Second Amendment clearly states, \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\" Next, it would be easier for the federal government to regulate hand guns, as everything would be uniform; there would be no uncertainty as to what is allowed where.",

            "conclusion": "Conceal carry laws decrease violent crime",
            "premise": "Thank you for responding :D1. Deterrence- Self Preservation My opponent claims people who engage in violent crime will likely not be involved in self preservation, claiming they already are in danger by doing this etc. This is factually incorrect. Criminals, more then the AVERAGE person are actually more into self preservation. Many, most, are not psychopaths and are indeed mainly doing this to have dominance, may sound crazy but that is human and criminal psychology. [1] In source [1], the writer, Lott, finds many stories, statistics, studies, that show criminals are scared of guns. After jailed, they generally admit they are afraid of guns, most say they would not attack an armed victim. This means a handgun can be a deterrent. Now my opponent will point out, \"if they knew he was armed\", but this actually helps my case. If they dont know who is armed, it makes it that much more.... Scary, if I can word it like that. -Encouragement My opponent basically cites more armed people mean more deaths, then cites a scenario. First, he chooses a bar as an example, yet forgets conceal weapons are banned in bars. [1] Also, he forgets vital things. First, he says more armed people mean more deaths. This is false, as it depends on who the armed people are. Conceal carry permit holders, are actually more law abiding then people, and many instances show this. Also, as stated, less then, LESS THEN 0.5% of permits are revoked, many due to tax evasion and other minor breakings of the law. So having citizens that are armed for defense is going to increase crime? My opponents argument only works if he can prove the conceal carry permit holders will actually commit more crimes then the average person. The argument he states is also known as the \"blood will run in the streets argument\", luckily this has not happens in ANY state where these laws have been passed. My opponent then cites a \"what if\" argument, what if A, B, or C happens. As stated, conceal weapons are banned in bars in most states, and conceal carry permit holders never have done this. My opponent uses the \"what if\" argument, which, has never happened, and it is impossible to argue a argument that has no experience in the world. [1]My opponent then uses the hot blood argument. This is also known as irrational crime. Essentially saying much of crime is a \"a am PISSED!\". But this ignores the overall numbers, as statistics show conceal carry has no increased effect on cold blood crimes, and actually a positive one. [1] Why does it make the numbers decrease on this crime? Simple, very, a small amount of even these \"AGH!!\" moments are deterred, a small amount. I statistics, if 2% are deterred then there will be a 2% decrease. Many of these crimes are stress, they do not attack the person who made them mad, rather another thing. Ex: Man fired at work, really pissed, does not attack boss, kicks dog instead. [1] Now, why did he not attack the boss? Because stiffer punishments happen when attacking a human, hence his irrational behavior was deterred by deterrence, this simple psychology means even irrational crimes can be deterred, if punishments are high. - Possible scenarios Irrelevant, has not happened as conceal carry holders are more law abiding then normal people. Also falls under the \"what if\" scenario, just a red herring used by anti gun outlets. 2. Data Um, what article are you looking at? My round one source #2? First, may I add, the \"wrong\" statistics that where reported are not violent crime, so even if I did \"Lie\", it is irrelevant. He also forgets the statistic, which cripples his argument:\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [2]Also, if you look at the drop per 100,000 you see:(Violent crimes) -.3489 (23.558) -.4519 (30.110)(Murder) -.4111 (19.854) -.4302 (20.290)(Rape) -.01773 (0.843) -.0440 (2.045)(Aggravated Assault) -.3198 (21.858) -.4443 (30.170)(Robbery) -.5073 (20.382) -.5768 (22.654)(Property Crime) -.1617 (18.223) -.18568 (20.535)(Auto Theft) -.2214 (12.676) -.3694 (23.505)(Burglary) -.2432 (25.998) -.2108 (22.189)(Larceny) -.1052 (10.752) [2]Per 100,000 we see a decrease. If anything, you are playing with the data presented. \"When state concealed handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent\" [2]I am NOT playing with the data. My opponent then brings the correlation argument, but this is actually interesting, as theory, statistics, and data = causation. Now the theory, a proven theory much like evolution on deterrence. Statistics, well proven. And the empiracle data I mentioned, and the other 16 refereed academic studies. [1] As logic and fact + correlation leads to causation, we can lead to the conclusion by the many studies they decrease crime. My opponent then uses the apple argument, but you must look at all the states. ALL THE STATES SHOWED A DECREASE IN CRIME FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THESE LAWS. [1] Now, with all the empirical data, as Lott points out: \"The gun-control debate has changed dramatically over the last decade. In the past the question was how much guns caused crime. The debate is now over whether there are benefits to gun ownership and how large those benefits are\". [1] So, as stated, there is overwhelming data, as well as the change in data towards [benefiting] people like me, who herald gun ownership, and there is now not debate over whether it raises crime, rather how big those benefits are. All of this data must lead to causation, and this theory is much like one of evolution, it is essentially fact but a few radicals sit clogging their ears yelling \"nanny nanny nanny!!\" And, there is not one refereed academic study showing it increases crime, and the ones that claim to have no effect actually misread their results, go back and fix them, and they find a deterrent effect, yet still claim no effect. [1] But I am sorry, with all of this data there is causation. The deterrence theory and the data + logic mean causation. My opponent then claims there is no pattern, then shows a dead link. To Yale, I know exactly who wrote the article, just by seeing the word Yale, professor Donahue (I am such a nerd). It was likely is 2003 study, which was not academically refereed. My opponent then uses Donahue's common attack on Lott by using the there variables, the most famous on was on cocaine usage, arrest rates etc. Lott counters this, with facts not what if arguments commonly used by Donahue. Lott used dummy variables, and other statistics, he shows even during other surges in factors the results show the same, also the argument my opponent is hinting is crime rates fluctuate naturally, but Lott's study was 1977-2010 (still continuing), and he shows through all this time conceal carry laws decrease crime, so, it could be explained by variables if states differentiated, but having the same/similar results in all states mean other variables conducting ever drop is impossible, therefore the CCW law has an effect. So, find a variable consistent in all CCW states, if you can then other variables statistically have a 0% chance of lowering crime at the exact same time after the law was passed in EVERY STATE. Conclusion: Deterrence, stats, logic, arguments, red herrings.... My opponent has failed to disprove simple deterrence theory, and uses a red herring on statistics which I then had to go back and quote, my opponent's argument on fraud stats was false. PRO has proven CCW laws lower violent crime. [1] Lott, John R. \"More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun-control Laws.\" 3rd ed. Vol. 1.

            "conclusion": "Gun Free Zone on College Campus",
            "premise": "I am currently an enrolled student, and also have a license to carry a concealed handgun in public. To be more specific about my position on this, I believe that it is wrong for Public Colleges/Universities to not offer any kind of process in which an individual may gain legal rights to carry a concealed handgun on campus when he/she goes to class. Of course, I also welcome faculty/teachers/staff to be allowed that offer as well. It's not just for the students. I do agree that we should not just hand guns to everybody, but there are some select individuals who I believe are deemed trustworthy to handle that kind of responsibility, even though you must be very responsible. As of now, I'm going to say that I believe that if you already have a concealed handgun permit, and are allowed to carry virtually all public places(Stores/Malls/Movie Theaters/ etc.) Then why should campus be any different? Of course if we agree that there should be a process to make it legal for certain people, I understand maybe not everybody agrees that a CCW permit is enough. I'm perfectly open to discussion as to what kind of requirements do you think in individual must pass to make it legal, but that's all details. For now, I wanna say that I am open to the idea that there should be some legal process offered by the public University to allow a certain individual conceal carry rights, so as long as he/she meets the following requirements, x,y, and z. For now, I think we can just take advantage over the system that is already in place to allow people to carry in public places and require a student/faculty to possess a valid CCW permit. It is wrong to deny a person rights just because some other people have abused it in the past. As a person who believes in America the way it was meant to be, a Republic, not a Democracy, then individuals including minorities should have constitutional rights in public places. Private Universities are another story. But Public Universities should abide by constitutional law. To start off with the argument, I'd like to say that criminals and anyone wishing to do harm will probably break the law regardless of the fact that we deny everybody the right to carry. We cannot protect people with just a sign saying that it's illegal to carry a firearm. This leads me to believe that there really is no logical reason to think that Gun Free Zones themselves would have any affect other than disarming the people who abide by the law and have everything to lose(no felons, no misdemeanors, no criminal recored etc.) Of course I'm referring to Gun Free Zones on college campus's. I do however, think that Courthouses are at least smart with that law by setting up preventative measures such as metal detectors and making sure the place is full of armed police officers. Because of the mass shootings and other various forms of gun violence that have appeared on College campus, it is clear that Gun Free Zones don't prevent everybody from coming in with a gun. The Gun free zone clearly does not actually disarm everybody, and it only seems to be the people we should be afraid of the most who are going to still carry anyway. I'll get into stats and facts in the later rounds. For now, this is my position as clear as I can make it with some rational reason why I don't think \"everybody\" should be disarmed. I welcome an opponent, preferably one who completely disagrees because obviously I 'd be preaching to the choir otherwise. So anybody who wants to challenge me, bring it on brother... or sister.",

            "conclusion": "Concealed Carry on College Campuses",
            "premise": "Your second sentence says you would \"feel very unsafe\" should students be allowed to carry their concealed weapons. The problem with this statement is that there is a huge difference in feeling safe and being safe. I'm sure the students at Virginia Tech felt very safe knowing that guns were not allowed on their campus; however, the fact is that no one was able to fight back when that maniac attacked. To clarify my 25% statistic, it is that 25% of all reported crimes on a college campus are rapes, not that 25% of women are raped. Furthermore, your point that rape does not justify murder depends on your moral standards. For example, I would rather a woman shoot and kill an immoral man in self-defense than that immoral man sexually harm her. Prevention of rape is certainly a justified reason for killing. \"There isn't enough crime on college campuses to support gun ownership.\" Any crime that causes harm to an innocent person should be prevented any way possible. Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that person has to use it. There are strict guidelines as to when a person can be justified for using a weapon. As for your point about college students being shot should campus carry be legalized, since Utah first legalized campus carry in 2004, six states have since followed suit. In all that time on over 150 college campuses, there have been only 3 negligent discharges, all of which could have been prevented. Two occurred because the weapon was being carried without a holster and one was because a teacher was showing her new weapon to a coworker. None of these resulted in serious injuries. Many places require that weapons be holstered or cased to prevent things like this from happening. In Point 3, you fail to realize that the \"8,275 criminal gun-related homicides\" says nothing about cases of unjustified self-defense. Instead, it shows that while 8,275 people committed a criminal act of murder, 230 people were able to defend themselves from harm and put the bad guy six feet under. If you take away concealed carry, you will decrease the number of justified shootings, but would leave those people defenseless in the face of criminals. Now here are some statistics for you. \"At the 2013 homicide rate, roughly one in every 285 Americans will be murdered. A U.S. Justice Department study based on crime data from 1974-1985 found: \" 42% of Americans will be the victim of a completed violent crime (assault, robbery, rape) in the course of their lives \" 83% of Americans will be the victim of an attempted or completed violent crime \" 52% of Americans will be the victim of an attempted or completed violent crime more than once\" [1] How's that for enough crime to justify concealed carry? When you get to talking about college campuses, there is nothing that will lead a logical person to believe that just because he or she walks onto a campus, that person will not be exposed to criminal activity. While college campuses usually have lower crime rates, they are not crime free. A person who is permitted to carry weapons almost anywhere should not be prevented from doing the same on a college campus where crime is still possible. Here are some more statistics: \"A 1982 survey of male felons in 11 state prisons dispersed across the U.S. found: \" 34% had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\" \" 40% had decided not to commit a crime because they \"knew or believed that the victim was carrying a gun\" \" 69% personally knew other criminals who had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\"\"[1] Responsibly carrying concealed weapons gives people an effective way to defend themselves. The only reason left to deny a person the right to carry is the very small possibility that someone else will be harmed, and it is not permissible to deny someone a right just because it is accompanied with a minor risk that can be reduced with simple preventative measures.

            "discussionTitle": "Allowing Citizens to Carry Handguns Reduces Crime Rates",
            "conclusion": "Allowing Citizens to Carry Handguns Reduces Crime Rates",
            "premise": "Clarifications:1 - I don't consider the specifics of regulations important to the debate, if we work off of the assumption that an agreed foundation for regulations can be established. That being said, criterion would include proving citizenship, a background check looking for criminal activity(robbery, burglary, assault, murder, and other violent crimes), and a training class on the safe handling of the handgun. 2 - Crime rates that are or can be affected by weapons should be considered, as reported by law enforcement agencies and published by the FBI and other agencies. Crimes should be considered on a percentage basis to avoid variance in population.Rebuttals:1 - Con states that an increase in available handguns would cause an increase in crime rate due to a higher percentage of people having access to said handguns. This argument focuses not on the cause of a crime, which is the criminal, but on one of the instruments of a crime. It is not the weapon that causes the crime, it is a person deciding to commit the crime that causes it.2 - Con states that an increased number of people capable of committing crime increases the probability of crime. The fact is, anyone who could commit a crime with a gun could also commit a crime with another weapon, or with their hands. Having a weapon available doesn't influence someone to be a criminal. Everyone(in general terms) is capable of making a fist and punching someone else, but the fist isn't the cause of the crime.3 - A background check removes the possibility of a gun being sold, or a permit being issued, to someone with a violent history. Con states that some individuals don't have a criminal history but can still commit crime. This is true, everybody has the capability to commit crime, but that doesn't inherently make them likely to do so.4 - A background check doesn't preclude one from getting a permit for something like jaywalking. Again, the focus of this debate is on citizens carrying handguns, with an assumption that we have preventative measures in place. Those I have clarified already.Further Arguments5 - Banning guns doesn't deter criminals from obtaining and using guns. In 1995, Washington D.C. had a murder rate of 65 murders per 100,000 citizens[1], during a time when handguns were banned(unless they were locked or disassembled). Of those murders, 81% were committed with firearms[2], even though they were banned. This shows that criminals don't care if guns are illegal or not, they show their disrespect for the law in committing a crime, and in using illegal weapons.6 - Stripping citizens of handguns only makes it easier for someone to commit a crime. For example, consider you decide to rob a bank. There are two banks in town. You know that the teller and manager at Bank 1 both carry guns. You also know that nobody at Bank 2 carries a gun. For the criminal, the defenseless Bank 2 is the obvious choice. It is similar for criminals in general. If they know that no citizen can legally carry a gun, they are less likely to encounter such deadly force in perpetrating a crime. If they know that any citizen could legally be carrying a gun, they are more likely to try and find someone they are sure isn't armed.7 - Despite the number of states issuing carry permits increasing drastically since 1987, the average murder rate in the United States has fallen 42% as of 2010.[3]8 - A study by criminologists Kleck and Gertz found that U.S. citizens use guns approximately 2.5 million times per year to stop a crime. Only 24% of reported incidents involved firing a gun, showing that 76% of the time a criminal will stop and leave with just the sight of a gun.[4]I appreciate my opponent's arguments, and look forward to the continuing debate.[1]http://www.disastercenter.com...

            "conclusion": "Concealed carry laws decrease crime",
            "premise": "Deterrence My opponents main claim to refute my analysis is economists to not study crime etc. Well first this is false, as economists study statistics (a large part of crime), and human behaviors (cost and benefits, also known as deterrence). Gary S. Baker, economist, he does a lot of work on deterrence, he knows about human error, costs and benefits etc. Just because you are an economist does not mean you are not a criminal expert, many of the things they use in economics, much of it is psychology to predict economic outlooks, they can easily apply to crime. \"Models of criminal behavior, where a person is assumed to act rationally on the basis of costs and benefits of legal and illegal opportunities, are presented in this chapter.\" [1]As you can see economists look highly into human behavior and cost and benefit issues, hence their knowledge is credible in the criminal world, especially the peer reviewed papers I have provided. Just because the object in question is not in the job description, they are often asked to do criminal reports, [1] and their knowledge works perfectly with the deviancy we know as crime. [1]Also my opponent claims my argument is biased, no its not, here's a non PDF version of the survey I cited, criminals are more afraid of armed victims then police. (http://www.pulpless.com...) [Gary Kleck, criminologist]My opponent then uses semantics with the word they in the guns deter robbers, they is obviously criminals. My opponent then says giving stats is BS, there are other reasons. He ignores what the source said after the sentence a quote from a criminal \"robbing a house with people in it is a good way to get shot\" (see round 1 source 1). Robbers and criminals concur they are deterred by armed victims everyday. The apples oranges view works, basic cost and benefit arguing...The old lady was an example, but ok. Your only argument is the old lady is slow and weak, this actually fails to understand defense. 99% of the time showing the gun, no shots, I repeat NO SHOTS fired deter the criminal, they are about self preservation, they are scared of guns, its basic psychology. [2]My opponents last claim fail to understand the arguments behind conceal carry, and psychology. I needn't refute the last point as he ignores basic economic and criminology arguments of cost and benefits. Conceal carry increases the cost, death, as apposed to open carry they will avoid him and the area around him. If you look at CCW he does not know who will and can fight back, essentially ending his life without warning, a huge cost, basic logic means it will deter. My opponent never refutes this premise, watch he will last round and I wont be able to respond -_- lol.DataMy opponent plays semantics, again on crime. Lets assume it is overall crime, I have argued overall already, just showed a graph for violent. But if you look at overall here's the exact:(Violent crimes) -.3489 (23.558) -.4519 (30.110)(Murder) -.4111 (19.854) -.4302 (20.290)(Rape) -.01773 (0.843) -.0440 (2.045)(Aggravated Assault) -.3198 (21.858) -.4443 (30.170)(Robbery) -.5073 (20.382) -.5768 (22.654)(Property Crime) -.1617 (18.223) -.18568 (20.535)(Auto Theft) -.2214 (12.676) -.3694 (23.505)(Burglary) -.2432 (25.998) -.2108 (22.189)(Larceny) -.1052 (10.752) [3]Now, my opponents first claim is the drop is small, he needs to look into crime and what is small. A drop os .1 per 100k people is actually huge if you look at the overall populations. Those \"small\" declines lead to this:\"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [3]So my opponents arguments on \"small\" are false. Also, my opponent forgets the peer reviewed studies I have been using have dummy variables, data, other things to account for the drug problems, and, well, they conclude the CCW laws still reduce crime, and it is unlikely that the CCW law (well statistically impossible) that the CC law did not reduce crime, in other words the CCW law was responsible on average in preventing overall crime. [3] \"Using a dummy model to estimate the effects we can we can rarely reject the null hypothesis of zero effect once the correct standard errors are used.... [note, this means CCW having no effect is impossible].. Surprisingly, therefore, we conclude, that there is considerable support for the hypothesis that shall- issue laws cause criminals to substitute away from crimes against persons.\" [4]Your arguments are refuted, the other variable argument is false, and therefore we can conclude in these MANY studies CCW has an effect on crime, and for the better of society. Chart: or:http://www.debate.org... Also heres violent crime data again, but different data: (see photo album fo source) As we can see, states without these laws have higher crime in all cetegories. The blue is the percent higher it is in states without CCW laws, it shows crime to be higher in all categories. Hence your argunment is false. 1. Violence does not decreaseMy opponent cites another what if argunment, sorry, but guns save more lives then they end, and that they potentially \"threaten\". Your argunment is a fallacy, oh a gun kills! forget, guns save more lives though deterence, [2] defense usage, [3] and even if you just show the gun. [2] So guns save more lives then they take away and \"potentially harm\". My opponent then says the percents are small, again, but sorry these percents when it comes to crime is enormous, and he forgets the vital argunment HE NEVER REFUTED: \"If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been avoided yearly.\" [3]My opponent then is using a strawman, saying never as literal, a CCW holder has never done what you claim might happen, the Zimmerman case does not apply to this debate as he was not a CCW holder. My argunment was CCW holders have never killed someone outside of self defense (proven by jury), [2] yur argunment fails to work as it refers to a non CCW incident involving a gun. CCW holders have never killed, meaning they have no negative effect on society, and the stats say it, they save lives. [2, 3, 4]2. LottAgain citing Donahue. Claiming it has no effect on crime, I said this, Donahue misread his results. He found 30 (27) data tables redced crime, 13 (16) no effect, 0 found an increase. Also, Lott has the most in depth study that exists to date. [2] You never criticised it, claimed crack messed it up, if your argunments where correct there would have been a spike in crime, there was a decline, hence CCW decreased crime through the troubles, meaning CCW even works when drugs linger aroung. [2] Plus, you never justified how crack explains the results.CONCLUSION:He fails to refute my argunments, and fufill his even BOP. He uses biased Donahue studies (panel studies find it biased), and Donahues results actually find in most tables the CCW lae decreased crime. [2] Its an easy choice, vote pro. Args - Easy vote, his args refuted, never justified criticisms on phsycology, or his things on Lott. Sources - I used only peered reviewed studies, he used a lot of opinion peices. rest your choices.

Sometimes these shootings are carried out by more than one person and students will need more protection than the helpless, defenseless teachers and faculty. A lot of schools are out of the way and far from the nearest police station. For example, my school is a good 20 minutes away from the nearest station. If someone shot up our school, I'd like to know that there were some students certified and licensed to have a firearm on campus to protect fellow peers. The certification will include a two-week course with local tactical defense specialists (Police). The process will be very thorough and will be tedious, but worth it. The course will be like a CHL Course (Concealed Handgun License) (1). In 31 states, it is legal to carry a concealed handgun on your person. Although, you cannot carry on school grounds. This license will allow students to carry a small HANDGUN on campus, if it is concealed properly. All students in the school (even non-carriers) will have to wear a name badge while on the campus and the licensed kids will have a special \"carrier\" emblem on the badge. The students will not be allowed to interact with the weapons unless the school goes under actual lock-down. Only then will the students be able to interact with the weapon.",

            "premise": "Firstly, I don't understand how the campuses of America will be safer if any student with a CC permit is able to walk around with concealed weapons. Being a student myself, it would make me very uneasy to know that anybody walking around me might have a concealed firearm, even if they are supposedly \"smart, responsible people.\" Also, when guns become involved, it is rarely an issue of \"one clean shot to the head.\" If there are a bunch of students carrying guns, and someone comes in with their own weapon intending to shoot people, do you think that one of the students is just going to say \"don't worry, I'll handle this\" and get a clean shot in the assailant's head? I think the reality of the situation would be that there would be a period of chaos when all of the concealed weapon holders take those weapons out and start firing. There is even high probability that bullets will miss their targets and innocent people will get injured or killed. Also, I'm sure that in the past many CC permit holders, not in schools but in other places, have actually been the crazy criminals who take out those concealed weapons and start firing on people. Schools are places of books, not guns. There are thousands of colleges throughout the United States, and the number of campuses where shootings happen is relatively tiny. If students anywhere with a CC permit are allowed to take guns to school, the number of shooting will go up because fighting fire with fire does not work. Giving people more opportunities to use weapons has never been, and never will be, a solution to violence. Lastly, using our \"right to bear arms\" is a really poor argument for allowing arms in schools. Do you really think when our founding fathers made the \"right to bear arms\" they were thinking of it pertaining to schools? I really don't think so. I think that right was created mainly because of the need for a militia, which means that the citizens needed to have guns on hand in case they were called to fight the British, French, Spanish, Native Americans, or whoever. Clearly, there are no more militias in the United States, and even if there were it would have nothing to do with schools. Allowing guns in schools will not reduce crime, that just doesn't make sense. Schools should continue to be Gun-Free Zones.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: That the private ownership of handguns should be banned in the United States",
            "premise": "I reject the resolution that the private ownership of handguns should be banned in the United States of America. Firearms, especially handguns, play an important role in our society: they help those who otherwise could not defend themselves effectively defend against forms of aggression. It is realistic to think that handguns has lead to many crimes in the USA, but it seems it will only be more of a detriment to ban them. Definitions: private ownership: Private property is the tangible and intangible things owned by individuals or firms over which their owners have exclusive and absolute legal rights, and can only be transferred with the owner's consent. handgun: A handgun is a firearm designed to be held and operated by one hand, with the other hand optionally supporting the shooting hand. United States: North American republic containing 50 states - 48 conterminous states in North America plus Alaska in northwest North America and the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean; achieved independence in 1776 Contentions: My first contention is that those who are otherwise unable to absolutely defend themselves would be unable to absolutely defend themselves. My second contention is that (being USA is a densely populated country) banning handguns would cause violent crime to rise. My third contention is that it directly violates the Second Amendment right of United States citizens. I will now elaborate on my contentions. 1st) There are a wide variety of people who actively carry handguns on their person on a daily basis, as well as those who keep them at home for home protection against burglars, murderers and other home intruders. Realistically speaking, the only true conventional way of stopping a person from continuing to put your life in IMMEDIATE danger is to pull a firearm on him/and or kill him, in this case with a handgun being the most preferable carry firearm. 2st) It is widely known that gun control on high population areas results in a negative way. A good example is the Draconian handgun bill in the United Kingdom, in which resulted in a violent crime increase of 69%. This also can be seen in Australia, where Australian tax payers paid over 500 million dollars for the government to confiscate 7 million firearms. The direct result to this was a 3% increase in homicide rates. 3rd) The Supreme Court of the USA ruled that the Second Amendment applies to citizens abroad the United States. Banning firearms would directly violate the Second Amendent of law-abiding citizens, and the counter-argument to citizens who do NOT abide by the law is not valid, for legallity is clearly found in my definition of private ownership. *I will cite definitions and articles of my statistics UPON REQUEST*",

            "premise": "In contention 1, I explained that according to studies, 93% of attacks against college students do not ever occur on campus, meaning that 1) concealed carry laws are unnecessary and 2) crime may be increased on campus as a result of the existence of the weapons. He responded to the first impact by saying that \"women cannot protect themselves\" and that students may still be attacked. While they still may be attacked, the fact of the matter is that concealed carry laws ON CAMPUS will not have a marginal impact for increasing student safety. Even if we assume that gun holders will not commit violent crimes themselves, college campuses are already secure, meaning that there will be no positive impact to the safety of the students. If he wants to advocate a change in policy, he needs to explain why it should be done, and insofar as the status quo will not change (since this is a debate about CCW ONLY on campuses), there is no reason to change the law. Additionally, please remember that eliminating guns on campus does not mean that students will not be able to defend themselves; there are other means that students can use to insure their safety, including campus and city police officers, other hand-held weapons, friends, etc. Finally, using guns will not prevent any loss of life in \"self-defense.\" Public health researcher David Hemenway concludes that \"[g]un use in self-defense is rare, and it appears that using a gun in self-defense is no more likely to reduce the chance of being injured during a crime than various other forms of protective action,\" and notes that no \"evidence seems to exist that gun use in self-defense reduces the risk of death.\" David Hemenway, Private Guns, Public Health 78 (2004). Thus, even if you drop all of my statistics, you still cannot vote for him because gun holders do not save any lives, so there is no need to have guns on campus. Let's look at the second impact about increasing crime rates. In fact, CCW states actually DO have more crime rates than other states. According to the disaster center sources that he cited, in the city of Chicago, which does not permit concealed carry, the violent crime index per 100,000 people was 1,195.7 (http://www.disastercenter.com......) , while in Dallas, the index per 100,000 people was 1,333.2 http://www.disastercenter.com....... Given that the population of Dallas was 1, 715, 800 smaller than that of Chicago in 2005, we would expect more crime in Chicago. However, the city that permitted CCW was more dangerous and violent than the city that did not permit concealed guns. He will try to respond to this with a \"correlation does not equal causation argument\", but please remember that needs to prove alternate causation in today's round in order to prove this true. His response to Contention 2 was twofold. First, he says that he cannot reject my claim because I did not cite the study. This is false because he could have easily researched the position and tried to provide counter-statistics. Second, Harvard University study study I used is quoted and cited below. \"According to the only previous national survey of firearm possession at college, 6.4% of male students and 1.5% of female students had a working firearm at school. In addition, students with guns were more likely than students without guns to have alcohol-related problems, such as getting into fights attributed to drinking alcohol and being arrested for drinking while intoxicated.\" (http://www.riskandinsurance.com......) According to that same study, only 1/2 of college gun owners said that they had guns for protection, meaning that the rest use the guns for nefarious purposes. His second response was that \"we are not discussing who should own guns.\" This is fallacious because if we are discussing whether or not CCW should be permitted, we also need to discuss who will benefit from those laws; if these are risk-prone criminals, then CCW will pose a security threat and there is no reason to affirm. He also claims that these students would break the law anyways. While this is true, it is more difficult and more expensive for them to gain access to guns currently than it would be if CCW were permitted because gun companies would begin targeting college-aged children as buyers. This would allow criminals to purchase guns more easily than they currently can, making the prevalence of dangerous weapons on campus more likely. Against Contention 3, he claims that this study is irrelevant. He misses the point of the study, however, because it explicitly demonstrates that the people do not wish to have guns because they fear for their safety; guns would increase on campus as a result of CCW. He then refutes my evidence with anecdotal evidence that can neither be verified nor proven false. Prefer my hard evidence over his anecdotal evidence because he there is no proof that his statement is true, while mine is actually backed by statistics. He makes a MASSIVE concession against my first point against his case; I demonstrated that the fact that he can name a few college shooting incidences proves that shooting is not prevalent on campuses because the media covers sensational and spectacular stories. He had ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE to this argument meaning that this proves that crime is not prevalent on campus, so CCW are not even necessary in today's college societies. Against my second point, he says that CHL holders \"never commit crimes on campus.\" First, look to the Harvard study that I provide earlier; if gun holders commit crimes on campus, and many gun holders have CHL permits, then CHL permit holders contribute to crimes on campus. Second, against the UA example I provided, he says that this is not relevant because UA did not permit students to have guns. This is fallacious because this individual, WHO MURDERED HIS PROFESSORS, POSSESSED A CHL PERMIT. So, even if the campus did not allow it, a COLLEGE STUDENT WITH A CWL PERMIT SLAUGHTERED INNOCENT PEOPLE. This is exactly what I have been trying to prove throughout the debate. He also concedes that most campuses do not have major incidents BECAUSE ONLY 4% of students CURRENTLY OWN GUNS (http://www.riskandinsurance.com......). This means that campuses are safe because STUDENTS DO NOT OWN GUNS. Insofar as this is true, any evidence that he provides about \"no major incidents\" is flawed because it does not take this fact into account. Finally, I mentioned that most students would not be able to have guns on campus anyways because license holders must be 21, and most students are under that age, so the only people who would benefit from this law are criminals who will be able to legally bring guns onto campus. His response is that \"just because some cannot have them does not mean that others should not be able to defend themselves.\" He is missing the point of the argument, however. The entire premise of his case is that students will increase safety with guns, but if they cannot have them anyways, then they will be unable to improve their security by owning CWL permits. These permits are therefore useless on college campuses and should not be permitted because they will not help the students defend themselves anyways.",

Additionally, please remember that eliminating guns on campus does not mean that students will not be able to defend themselves; there are other means that students can use to insure their safety, including campus and city police officers, other hand-held weapons, friends, etc. Finally, using guns will not prevent any loss of life in \"self-defense.\" Public health researcher David Hemenway concludes that \"[g]un use in self-defense is rare, and it appears that using a gun in self-defense is no more likely to reduce the chance of being injured during a crime than various other forms of protective action,\" and notes that no \"evidence seems to exist that gun use in self-defense reduces the risk of death.\" David Hemenway, Private Guns, Public Health 78 (2004). Thus, even if you drop all of my statistics, you still cannot vote for him because gun holders do not save any lives, so there is no need to have guns on campus. Let's look at the second impact about increasing crime rates. In fact, CCW states actually DO have more crime rates than other states. According to the disaster center sources that he cited, in the city of Chicago, which does not permit concealed carry, the violent crime index per 100,000 people was 1,195.7 (http://www.disastercenter.com...) , while in Dallas, the index per 100,000 people was 1,333.2 http://www.disastercenter.com.... Given that the population of Dallas was 1, 715, 800 smaller than that of Chicago in 2005, we would expect more crime in Chicago. However, the city that permitted CCW was more dangerous and violent than the city that did not permit concealed guns. He will try to respond to this with a \"correlation does not equal causation argument\", but please remember that needs to prove alternate causation in today's round in order to prove this true. His response to Contention 2 was twofold. First, he says that he cannot reject my claim because I did not cite the study. This is false because he could have easily researched the position and tried to provide counter-statistics. Second, Harvard University study study I used is quoted and cited below. \"According to the only previous national survey of firearm possession at college, 6.4% of male students and 1.5% of female students had a working firearm at school. In addition, students with guns were more likely than students without guns to have alcohol-related problems, such as getting into fights attributed to drinking alcohol and being arrested for drinking while intoxicated.\" (http://www.riskandinsurance.com...) According to that same study, only 1/2 of college gun owners said that they had guns for protection, meaning that the rest use the guns for nefarious purposes. His second response was that \"we are not discussing who should own guns.\" This is fallacious because if we are discussing whether or not CCW should be permitted, we also need to discuss who will benefit from those laws; if these are risk-prone criminals, then CCW will pose a security threat and there is no reason to affirm. He also claims that these students would break the law anyways. While this is true, it is more difficult and more expensive for them to gain access to guns currently than it would be if CCW were permitted because gun companies would begin targeting college-aged children as buyers. This would allow criminals to purchase guns more easily than they currently can, making the prevalence of dangerous weapons on campus more likely. Against Contention 3, he claims that this study is irrelevant. He misses the point of the study, however, because it explicitly demonstrates that the people do not wish to have guns because they fear for their safety; guns would increase on campus as a result of CCW. He then refutes my evidence with anecdotal evidence that can neither be verified nor proven false. Prefer my hard evidence over his anecdotal evidence because he there is no proof that his statement is true, while mine is actually backed by statistics. He makes a MASSIVE concession against my first point against his case; I demonstrated that the fact that he can name a few college shooting incidences proves that shooting is not prevalent on campuses because the media covers sensational and spectacular stories. He had ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE to this argument meaning that this proves that crime is not prevalent on campus, so CCW are not even necessary in today's college societies. Against my second point, he says that CHL holders \"never commit crimes on campus.\" First, look to the Harvard study that I provide earlier; if gun holders commit crimes on campus, and many gun holders have CHL permits, then CHL permit holders contribute to crimes on campus. Second, against the UA example I provided, he says that this is not relevant because UA did not permit students to have guns. This is fallacious because this individual, WHO MURDERED HIS PROFESSORS, POSSESSED A CHL PERMIT. So, even if the campus did not allow it, a COLLEGE STUDENT WITH A CWL PERMIT SLAUGHTERED INNOCENT PEOPLE. This is exactly what I have been trying to prove throughout the debate. He also concedes that most campuses do not have major incidents BECAUSE ONLY 4% of students CURRENTLY OWN GUNS (http://www.riskandinsurance.com...). This means that campuses are safe because STUDENTS DO NOT OWN GUNS. Insofar as this is true, any evidence that he provides about \"no major incidents\" is flawed because it does not take this fact into account. Finally, I mentioned that most students would not be able to have guns on campus anyways because license holders must be 21, and most students are under that age, so the only people who would benefit from this law are criminals who will be able to legally bring guns onto campus. His response is that \"just because some cannot have them does not mean that others should not be able to defend themselves.\" He is missing the point of the argument, however. The entire premise of his case is that students will increase safety with guns, but if they cannot have them anyways, then they will be unable to improve their security by owning CWL permits. These permits are therefore useless on college campuses and should not be permitted because they will not help the students defend themselves anyways.",

            "conclusion": "Handguns are uniquely dangerous when compared with other weapons",
            "premise": "Opposition agrees that handguns have unique advantages over other weapons; however, banning handguns in this area would lead to worse problems which are mentioned here as well as in the first point of opposition. The biggest issue with banning handguns, especially in a city, is that handguns will still be available to criminal classes willing to simply import the weapons from elsewhere. Due to their concealable nature it is very easy for them to smuggle handguns into an area where a handgun ban has been imposed. This is problematic because law abiding citizens in this area will now not have guns to defend themselves with. As such an asymmetry of power has been created where the people who bear guns, mainly criminals have weapons which give them significantly more power than the citizens in that area. Under the status quo, the legality of handguns means that although they are more dangerous than other weapons, their availability works in citizens\u2019 favour. This is because the asymmetry of power mentioned above is then weighted in the other direction. If a large proportion of the population have handguns for self-defence then there will be a greater chance that criminals attempting to commit violent acts will encounter individuals carrying weapons, resulting in an equality of power between both attacking and defending parties. The asymmetry is then pushed towards the defensive parties because presumably there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. As such those who wish to use guns for defensive purposes outnumber those who want to use guns for criminal purposes, weighting power in favour of those defending themselves. This is verified by the incredibly common use of handguns in self-defence; roughly 80% of self-defence actions involve handguns.4",

The fact that hand guns could fall into the hands of those who are likely to commit a crime again such as ex-convicts[2] or those who are mentally unqualified to carry a weapon should justify giving local governments the ability to regulate handgun ownership.
