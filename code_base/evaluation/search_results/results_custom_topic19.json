            "premise": "Important Note: Acheiving the same goal by different means are two different things, they mean different things. Calling myself out, but my debate is partly based partly (like 60%) on semantics but the legal system lives off of semantics, so though I am not a fan of it, it must be used when you talk about laws. Making gay marraige legal is to make homosexual marraige legal. This means writing a law that says homosexual marriage should be legal. This creates the legal term gay marriage, creating a difference between the previous marraige and the new gay marraige. The largest roadbloack is state laws similar to DOMA that define marraige. \"In 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which, for federal purposes, defined marriage as 'only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife' \".Ways to allow homosecuals to marry:A. Making gay marraige legal. Adding a law that adds/amends DOMA style laws. By ameding DOMA, there must be a difference between marraige, the civil union of a male and female, and the gay marraige, allowing same sex marraige. This is the solution that cause problems. This is the solution we are arguing and that I am arguing against.B. Making no such thing as gay and traditional marraige. Removal of DOMA and replacement with a law that does not differentiate in marraige. First you would have to get two bills for congress (removing Doma, then replacing it), which could leave the US in a state of limbo if the first finals. Finally, things would need to be solved at a state level. Which varies per state, but it would mean removing or amending a number of laws. This the solution I advocate but is not making gay marraige legal. It just means changing how we express gender in laws.Analogies can be expressed as:A. Red apples are the legal apples. And changing this to, red apples and green apples are the legal apples. But other laws and court cases say \"Red apples must be healthy and from a tree\". What about green apples? What if the the apple changes color, what now? What happens when laws refer to a specfic red apple tree (mother) and another specfic red apple tree (father)? By making it fair to green apples, you just made the system complicated and unfair to green and red apples for the next 50 years.B. Removing the previous law and saying, \"Apples are legal\". In the court of law, there is no green or red apple, there is only apples. Green apples are not legal, there is no such thing as \"green\" apples.Rebuttals:1. How do you define in a marriage of two females who is the wife/mother?Take Idaho for example: \"The earnings and accumulations of the wife and of her minor children living with her or in her custody, while she is living separate from her husband are the separate property of the wife.\"http://www.hg.org...The point still stands.2. But there is a difference. As solution A states, expressing a difference between marraige and gay marraige would mean that gay marraige would not inherent court cases and laws expressing gay marraige without each court case and law being amended.3. Again, have fun changing laws on every state, then dealing with the court cases. :)4. Look at state laws concerning divorce (which is most laws concerning marraige). Not every single one, but most have differences between genders.http://www.hg.org...http://www.law.cornell.edu... has less but it ignores other laws that influence marraige (often banning gay marraige).5. Yeah they have the liberty to do as they please. Gays are represented in court as equal citizens to everyone else. That does not mean laws are equal to all. Taxes, affirmative action, etc are all unequal and legal.6. You never said the debate was removing gender from laws. You said gay marraige should be legal. Again I refer to the difference between genderless laws and making gay marraige legal.What I am NOT arguing gay marraige should be illegal. I am agruing that gay marriage should not be legal. Different things (semantics and definition in the court of law)",

Look at the court cases. The court cases use the logic of all people are equals, not gay marriage and traditional marraige are equal. As society changes, marraige is becoming more widely considered gender neutral. Thus reflecting in court cases where courts say that the law was unfair to cite a gender. They are not changing the courts cases on \"make gay marraige legal\".http://gaymarriage.procon.org...http://en.wikipedia.org...; - \"policy for the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level at the discretion of local issuing authorities.\"2. \"How? Taxes how are they any different tell me that.\" - Taxes are higher on those with larger incomes. Though it is morally right for them to pay higher taxes, it does not treat all people as perfect equals. Because the individual is able to make more money means they should have more taken from them, which is unequal. I am definity NOT an advocate for the FLAT tax. I am just saying that taxes for those with higher incomes is unequal.4. (NOT A REBUTTAL) \"having to change things legally isn't a reason to keep the idea of gay marriage illegal\" - This is pretty much signifies why I debated aganist you on this. How many people actually think about the legal process and the best way to make gay marraige legal? No one. They make demands and don't think the process.5. \"FYI I will enjoy the court cases if that what it takes :)\" - Going to court is expensive, and can take a dramatic toll on people, relationships and families.ArgumentsMost of my points still stand, especially those on divorce laws.Finally,Gay marraige should not exist or be legal, because it identifies it as seperate from traditional marraige. Marraige without gender is a more appropiate means of accomplishing your goal (and is how courts are allowing same-sex marraiges).",

            "conclusion": "Gay marriage should be legal",
            "premise": "Gay marriage should be legal. By making it legal this leads to a change in the definition of what marriage is. It has to be changed because it is a social problem. Making gay marriage legal is being proposed as a solution to the problem. Since this is the case then the social view on marriage will change. I am not changing the debate. I really hope this makes it clear for you. Rebuttal 1. Religious people are still part of society and it is society that is forcing this change. Because of beliefs it is generally religious people that are against gay marriage however this is also changing shown by my first point. There is a growing support for gay marriage and there are less and less reasons to be against gay marriage. 2. Yes I will prove that most people support gay marriage. \"Right now, the most recent gay marriage poll comes from CBS News in July 2011. It showed that most people support gay marriage rights. According to the poll, 53% say the government should legally recognize same-sex marriages.\"[1] \"An ABC News poll conducted in July 2011 showed similar results. According to that poll, 51% support gay marriage 45% are against it. 4% are unsure.\"[1] \"35. Do you think marriages between gay and lesbian couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages? Apr. 9-10 Apr. 23-26 Dec. 19-21 June 26-29 2011 2009 2008 2008 Should be recognized as valid 51% 44% 44% 44% Should not be recognized as valid 47% 54% 55% 53% No opinion 2% 2% 1% 3%\"[2] So as you can see not only does the majority support gay marriage that support is growing rapidly. 3. This is the point of having laws. You're not allowed to do something because the government says it is wrong. Take ethnic discrimination in America. A very relevant example would be the anti-miscegenation laws which \"remained in force in many US states until 1967\" [3]. These laws prohibited any interracial marriages from taking place. Nowadays interracial marriages are common and there are no social stigmas attached. The law said it was wrong and people took the view that inter-racial love was wrong. Now that the laws are changed this view is dying out. 4.\"You have not yet proved that legalizing gay marriage would make more people support.\" See rebuttal point three. \"But you still do not bring up the benefits for society as a whole.\" So when people are not forced to drugs unnecessarily (see my last argument) because they think that the way they love is wrong this is not a benefit for society as a whole? When young people stop feeling the need to commit suicide because they think their love is wrong his is not a benefit for society? 5. Pro- gay marriage should be legal which would make it equal to that of \"traditional marriage\". Civil unions are not the same as marriage because they do not carry the same social status and it is the social status that is damaging which is why gay marriage should be recognised by the law. 6. See first paragraph of argument. 7. I have actually proved that it has benefits for society. You have not proved that it is harmful for society. Your attempts at that are rebutted below. How it benefits other societies is still a valid point as I have shown it has an affect on how other nations view America therefore still has an affect on American society. 8. \"people could then say it should be changed so that they can marry their family members or pets.\" Family members will never be allowed to marry because inbreeding is biologically dangerous. Pets are not consenting adults so can't get married. 9. Your own definitions state that the only difference between gay marriage and heterosexual marriage is legal recognition. They are the same thing so they should be called the same thing. 10. In what way are we subsidizing their marriage? We are giving them the same legal recognition as heterosexual marriage which they have a right to. http://www.gaymarriageresearch.com... [1] http://i2.cdn.turner.com... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org...

As I said earlier Gay marriage is already legal in 19 states which the school system still hasn't collapsed. \"Gay marriage\" is just a way of easily organizing the topics that gays should marry. When gay couples get married, they get married, not gay married. What makes no sense why if you were gay and you wanted to get married how do you think they feel having to move away from there friends and families just to be married. When they SHOULD be allowed to marry anywhere. Other people should not get to decide weather they can get married just because you love someone. People commonly base it off religion which there are homosexual religious types out there. But the reason they are so against it I because it bans them and being who they are. You said '5. Yeah they have the liberty to do as they please. Gays are represented in court as equal citizens to everyone else. That does not mean laws are equal to all. Taxes, affirmative action, etc are all unequal and legal.' How? Taxes how are they any different tell me that. 'Gay marriage isn't it's own entity, it is saying gays should be able to get married.' Worded from fellow debater YaHey Which is very TRUE. It isn't anyone else's choice except them weather they can get married or not I don't think its fair weather people get to vote on if two people can get married that is taking away there rights. If you were in their shoes you wouldn't want other people to have the power over you. When you can't legally combine love with the very one you love. having to change things legally isn't a reason to keep the idea of gay marriage illegal A. Making gay marriage legal. Adding a law that adds/amends DOMA style laws. By amending DOMA, there must be a difference between marriage, the civil union of a male and female, and the gay marriage, allowing same sex marriage. This is the solution that cause problems. This is the solution we are arguing and that I am arguing against. Which is there is no reason like I said in the very beginning. DIVORCE the same either way no absolute difference between mm ,mw, ww . JUST GENDER Instead of noticing healthy apple relationship and give rights and marriage equalities to both green and red apples and there applied. So That Concludes My Argument For my first debate and I don't looking forward to loosing. FYI I will enjoy the court cases if that what it takes :)",

But divorce is supposedly an abomination because you vow \"til death do us part\" yet. But divorce is still legal. Gay marriages have EVEN been proven to last longer and happier than straight marriages. Homosexuality IS NOT a choice. Many studies have confirmed that whether you are gay or not lies in genes.

To make gay marriage legal would be just that: making only gay marriage legal. This does not mean that polygamous marriages and incestuous marriages would instantly be made legal once gay marriages were. We can only determine whether it is fundamentally unfair to bar an entire class of citizens from a privilege afforded to the rest of us. My Response: Making only gay marriage legal would open up a door to multiple other parties. I never said that polygamous and incestuous marriages would be made legal, I am saying that by making gay marriage legal you are violating there rights as well because according to you marriage is based on love, and nothing more. If that is the underlying premise, then any other person should marry whom they love. This is flawed. Thus a definition of marriage must be heterosexual. \"2. One can plausibly argue that there is a rational basis for states to ban polygamous marriages in which there has been historical evidence of an imbalance of power, coercion (particularly of young girls), and an enormous financial burden placed on the state. None of these arguments can be made against gay marriage.\" My Response: Turn this argument against my opponent. Essentially, then, my opponent is basing marriage off more then love, which inherently collapses his idea that gay marriage should be legal. He is now basing a marriage off of economics, not just love. This attacks the very premise of his argument. \"1. Gay animals are found in nature.\" My Response: The term gay animal is intrinsically flawed. An animal is not \"gay.\" An animal could possibly be pan-sexual. Pan sexual is the sexual tendency towards sex itself rather then the agent helping. Furthermore, I am arguing against gay marriage, not homosexuality itself. When the natural law and marriage is intertwined, then the result is a family. Gay marriage undermines this natural order of family making. \"2. If the reason for marriage is to produce a child, we should not let elderly people or people who are unable to have children marry. The fact that both can marry proves that marriage is not for the sole purpose of producing children.\" My Response: Yes, but the old people had the ability to make children. Yes, they may not be able to anymore. This, is irrelevant because the possibility and the natural organs are all there. That doesn't violate the natural law. Gay marriage violates the natural law because 2 men/women are purposely getting married when it is impossible for 2 men/women to have children. The opposite sex is necessary for this. \"3. There is no requirement that two people who marry have sex.\" My Response: I never said they had too. The possibility is there. In gay marriage, there is no possibility for it is impossible with two people of the same sex. That's where the difference lies. [Affirmative Burden] My Opponent has yet to make a case fulfilling the affirmative burden. For this reason an affirmation is impossible regardless of my arguments or not. If my opponent doesn't fulfill this, then you must negate. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

            "premise": "I would like to say I want us to stay away from any religious and lifestyles contexts, especially those explained in the comment section. And thanks for the link, I always wondered how courts perceived the issue (legally classifying transgender/transsexual). 1. Now going back, my first point still stands. Laws in marriage relations and divorce say wife, husband, father, mother. By making gay marriage legal suddenly, more problems would arise out of the wording of certain laws which would cause unnecessary complication. By creating civil unions, previous marriage laws could be argued that they don't apply. 2. Court case also would need to exist at a federal level to solve this: Is \"gay marriage\" the same as the previously noted \"marriage\" in court cases and laws? 3. Complications also arise in legal and medical paperwork listing \"mother\" or \"father\". School paperwork has the same issue. My point is that \"gay marriage\" shouldn't be legal because it would cause such a massive number of legal problems. Should everyone be treated the same, yes, but writing laws to say \"gay marriage \" is legal is a bad idea. Presenting a solution I thought about last night: Change the laws to not be gender specific. Otherwise a hundred years of laws will have to be brought up in court to be dealt with for the next 50 years. By changing the laws to not be gender specific, there would just be marriage that doesn't recognize gender. Yet this still aligns with my argument because gay marriage would not be legal. Marriage would be marriage, without denoting the genders of those married. Yes gays would be able to marry then, but \"gay marriage\" would not exist. (I know my debate is falling into semantics but that's how the legal system works. Also the method means a completely different thing socially. Removing the denotation of gender in marriage says we are all equal and all marriages are equal. Gay marriage separates gay marriage from the traditional marriage which as you said, \"people deserve marriage just as much as anyone else\".)",

One can plausibly argue that there is a rational basis for states to ban polygamous marriages in which there has been historical evidence of an imbalance of power, coercion (particularly of young girls), and an enormous financial burden placed on the state. None of these arguments can be made against gay marriage. -Contention II: Natural Law This is invalid because: 1. Gay animals are found in nature. 2. If the reason for marriage is to produce a child, we should not let elderly people or people who are unable to have children marry. The fact that both can marry proves that marriage is not for the sole purpose of producing children. 3. There is no requirement that two people who marry have sex.",

In fact, if you have said that, you would have negated the resolution (i.e., That gay-marriage is not legal in the US)Since I'm arguing that gay-marriage should not be legal in the US, that means that I'm also arguing that places in the US which already makes gay-marriage legal, should not make it legal anymore. And since Con is arguing that gay-marriage should be legal in the US, that means that he's also arguing that places in the US which doesn't make gay-marriage legal, should start making it legal.

Everyone should be free to live their own life, and what happened to the separation of church and state? And why do people Want to control things that aren't their buissness?

            "conclusion": "Gay marriage should be legal.",
            "premise": "My opponent's arguments will be addressed below. Paragraph 1: \"Making only gay marriage legal would open up a door to multiple other parties. I never said that polygamous and incestuous marriages would be made legal, I am saying that by making gay marriage legal you are violating there rights as well because according to you marriage is based on love, and nothing more. If that is the underlying premise, then any other person should marry whom they love. This is flawed. Thus a definition of marriage must be heterosexual.\" 1. How do you know that it will open up a door to other parties? Even assuming that it did, how would heterosexual marriage also not open up a door to other parties? And even THEN, like I said originally, each group looking for marriage rights must be considered on their own merits. It isn't as if once gay marriage is legalized, every other kind of marriage that the imagination can think of will also be made legal instantly. 2. My opponent said \"According to you marriage is based on love, and nothing more\". I never said that or even implied that, so this is an assumption on his part, making the rest of this paragraph based on an assumption. Paragraph 2: \"Turn this argument against my opponent. Essentially, then, my opponent is basing marriage off more then love, which inherently collapses his idea that gay marriage should be legal. He is now basing a marriage off of economics, not just love. This attacks the very premise of his argument.\" 1. My opponent was the one who brought up polygamous marriages (\" .. If this was true, why isn't polygamy allowed? .. \"), so I listed some reasons against it that cannot be used against gay marriage in response to that sentence. This was to illustrate how gay and polygamous marriage are different. 2. Again, my opponent makes an assumption that I said that marriage should be based on love and nothing more. Even if I had said that, my argument differentiating the merits of gay marriage and polygamous marriage does not collapse or discredit my position that gay marriage should be legal, and certainly not inherently. 3. I also did not base the idea of marriage \"off of\" economics. I simply listed reasons that people have used to be opposed to polygamous marriage that cannot also be used to be opposed to gay marriage. I also did not claim it was MY position; rather, I said that \"One can plausibly argue that..\". However, my original claim still stands: Gay marriage must be evaluated and considered on its own merits, not on the merits of a seemingly endless variety of paranoid possibilities. Paragraph 3: \"The term gay animal is intrinsically flawed. An animal is not \"gay.\" An animal could possibly be pan-sexual. Pan sexual is the sexual tendency towards sex itself rather then the agent helping. Furthermore, I am arguing against gay marriage, not homosexuality itself. When the natural law and marriage is intertwined, then the result is a family. Gay marriage undermines this natural order of family making. \" 1. My opponent claims that animals are not gay and that the term itself is intrinsically flawed. A couple of sources that I will provide to argue his claim are the August 2008 issue of Scientific American Mind ( \"..Animal homosexuality has been documented in as many as 1,500 species, including insects..\" ), which reports on a study spearheaded by University of Oslo zoologist Petter Bockman. Another source is \"Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity\" by Bruce Bahemihl, Ph.D. ( \"..In ostriches, male homosexuality is much more common than bisexuality..\" ). 2. I understand that my opponent is arguing that animals who engage in homosexual activities are probably pan-sexual - the desire to have sex regardless of the partner's gender. While it is true that not every sexual act has a reproductive function, some scientists have also proposed that being gay may serve its own evolutionary purpose - it could be a way to strengthen bonds. As proposed by biologist Marlene Zuk, gay individuals could contribute to the gene pool of their community by nurturing their relatives' young without diverting resources by having their own offspring. Regardless of the explicit reason, the fact still exists that homosexual animals exist in nature. 3. My opponent says he is only arguing against gay marriage and not homosexuality. However, the two are obviously closely related. I will clarify my position about why gay marriage SHOULD be legal at the end of this response. Paragraph 4: \"Yes, but the old people had the ability to make children. Yes, they may not be able to anymore. This, is irrelevant because the possibility and the natural organs are all there. That doesn't violate the natural law. Gay marriage violates the natural law because 2 men/women are purposely getting married when it is impossible for 2 men/women to have children. The opposite sex is necessary for this.\" 1. My opponent said that older people should still be able to marry because organs necessary for reproduction exist. He solidifies his position by saying \"it is impossible for 2 men/women to have children\". This implies that reproduction ability should be a prerequisite for marriage, which still means that straight people who are medically unable to have children (perhaps they're missing an organ - maybe it had to be removed or due to a defect?) should not be allowed to marry, under this philosophy. 2. Regarding natural law in relation to homosexuality and ultimately gay marriage, natural law is premised on an observation of nature and homosexuality clearly exists within both human and animal nature. Paragraph 5: \"I never said they had too. The possibility is there. In gay marriage, there is no possibility for it is impossible with two people of the same sex. That's where the difference lies.\" 1. If my opponent claims that two married people do not have to have sex - only the possibility to have sex has to exist, I will assume that my opponent is again trying to say that straight people can reproduce while gay people cannot through sex. This weak argument was disputed above. Affirmative Burden: \"My Opponent has yet to make a case fulfilling the affirmative burden. For this reason an affirmation is impossible regardless of my arguments or not. If my opponent doesn't fulfill this, then you must negate. \" It is sad that I could still be \"forced to negate\" if I don't clearly state my position as to why gay marriage should be legal, regardless of the fact that I've argued all of your contentions. Please, let me be more clear. Gay marriage should be legal because gay people should be allowed to marry as long as straight people are allowed to marry. I believe that they should be afforded this same right because the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution states: \"No state shall .. deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Not offering equal protection to gay people under marriage laws is unconstitutional. Since there are many arguments against gay marriage which, as we have seen from above, are really about homosexuality at their core, it is important to argue the merits of those as well. This is a complicated and controversial issue and all sides need to be carefully considered.",

Other People Will Be Gay Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. 3. It Will Lead To Other Crazy Behavior Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. 4. Marraige Isn\"t Open To Change Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn\"t changed at all. Women are still property, blacks still can\"t marry whites, and divorce is still illegal. 5. The Sanctity of Marriage Will Be Broken Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed. The sanctity of Britney Spears\" 55-hour-just-for-fun and Kim Kardashian\"s 72-day-highly-profitable marriage would be destroyed. 6. Marriage Should Produce Children Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn\"t be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren\"t full yet, and the world needs more children. 7. Gay Parents = Gay Kids Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. 8. It Is Not Supported By Religion Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That\"s why we have only one religion in America. 9. A Male And Female Role Model Is Required Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That\"s why we as a society expressively forbid single parents to raise children. 10. It Will Change the Foundation Of Society Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. We could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven\"t adapted to cars, the downfall economy, or longer life spans.",

            "premise": "\u201cGay marriage should be legal. By making it legal this leads to a change in the definition of what marriage is.\u201d Gay marriage cannot be legal until the definition changes. Gay people are already allowed to get married, just not to each other. If the definition changes, then the law can change. Gay marriage cannot be made legal until the definition changes. \u201cSo as you can see not only does the majority support gay marriage that support is growing rapidly.\u201d 51% support gay marriage and 49% do not [1]. There is most likely some source of error in that poll so it is basically half and half. Your own source says that the margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. You cannot say that the law should change because of the beliefs of one half if there is not a real benefit to society. \u201cThis is the point of having laws.\u201d The point of having laws is not to change a society\u2019s views. The point of laws are to protect society. That is why gay marriage is illegal, to protect society. \u201cThe law said it was wrong and people took the view that inter-racial love was wrong. Now that the laws are changed this view is dying out.\u201d People did not think inter-racial love was wrong because the law said it was wrong. Their own personal views caused them to think that. The law changed because people\u2019s personal views changed. The law did not change peoples\u2019 personal views. \u201cSo when people are not forced to drugs unnecessarily (see my last argument) because they think that the way they love is wrong this is not a benefit for society as a whole? When young people stop feeling the need to commit suicide because they think their love is wrong his is not a benefit for society?\u201d People are not forced to do drugs just as they are not forced to commit suicide. They choose to do it. They also choose to think that their love is wrong. You also said that the majority of society supports gay marriage, so why do they feel that their love is wrong? The must be bothered by the views of what you called the \u201cminority\u201d. The views of the \u201cminority\u201d will not change if gay marriage is legalized so they will still feel the need to harm themselves. \u201cPro- gay marriage should be legal which would make it equal to that of \"traditional marriage\". Civil unions are not the same as marriage because they do not carry the same social status.\u201d They do not carry the same social status because they do not contribute to society in the way that the majority of heterosexual marriages do. It should also not be made equal to a traditional marriage because it is not the same as a traditional marriage. A gay marriage will not result in a traditional family with traditional views. That is why they do not get the traditional benefits of marriage. \u201cI have actually proved that it has benefits for society\u201d. You have not proved the benefits for society. You have brought up the same points multiple times and I have rebutted them. \u201cHow it benefits other societies is still a valid point as I have shown it has an affect on how other nations view America therefore still has an affect on American society\u201d. You state in round 3 that \u201cby changing our laws to bring them into a 21st century world we tell the world that it is better to move forward\u201d. According to what you say, the rest of the world will not change their views or laws unless we do. Therefore, if we do not change our laws or views, they will not change theirs either so they will not view us in any negative way. \" Family members will never be allowed to marry because inbreeding is biologically dangerous. Pets are not consenting adults so can't get married.\u201d Pets cannot get married because the law says that only consenting adults can get married. The law says that only a man and a woman can get married but gay marriage supporters are fighting to change that. People who want to marry their pets can fight to say that the definition and law needs to be changed so that animals can get married. You statement implies that family members should not be allowed to marry because they cannot produce healthy children even though they adopt or use a surrogate. Gay couples cannot produce healthy children without adoption or a surrogate either. Therefore, they should also not be allowed to get married because according to you, married couples have to be able to produce healthy children. \u201cYour own definitions state that the only difference between gay marriage and heterosexual marriage is legal recognition. They are the same thing so they should be called the same thing.\u201d My definitions state that one is between a heterosexual couple and one is between a homosexual couple. They are not the same thing. A man is not the same as a woman. So a couple composed of a man and a woman is not the same as a couple composed of two men or two women. \u201cIn what way are we subsidizing their marriage? We are giving them the same legal recognition as heterosexual marriage which they have a right to.\u201d The legal recognition of a heterosexual marriage provides certain financial benefits when it comes to things like taxes and insurance. Giving gay couples the same legal recognition would subsidize their marriages by providing those financial benefits. Gay people have a right to those benefits when they marry someone of the opposite sex. Their rights are not being taken away from them. They are asking for more rights than everybody else because they want those benefits when they marry someone of the same sex too. Homosexual couples do not have a right to those benefits because they do not benefit society in the way heterosexual couples do, by producing children which are needed for the future. [1] http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com... My opponent has failed to prove why gay marriage should be legalized. He/she has not proved that it will provide any benefit to society. He/she also said things that could contradict his or her argument and was not always clear as to what she was debating. I have proved that gay marriage should not be legalized because it does not produce the same benefits as the majority of heterosexual marriages. It would also require that the meaning of marriage be changed and lead others to fight that the meaning of marriage should be changed to suit their situations. My opponent also used Wikipedia as a source and sources that were supporting the LGBT community. His/her only neutral source was CNN. I used neutral and reliable sources. Vote Con",

            "premise": "\"How do you know that it will open up a door to other parties? Even assuming that it did, how would heterosexual marriage also not open up a door to other parties? And even THEN, like I said originally, each group looking for marriage rights must be considered on their own merits. It isn't as if once gay marriage is legalized, every other kind of marriage that the imagination can think of will also be made legal instantly.\" My Response: The door has already started to open. E.g. In Utah, polygamist Tom Green, who claims five wives, is citing Lawrence v. Texas as the legal authority for his appeal. This past January, a Salt Lake City civil rights attorney filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of another couple wanting to engage in legal polygamy. Their justification? Lawrence v. Texas. You then ask, wouldn't heterosexual marriage do the same thing? No. Why? Because heterosexual marriage is already seen as the traditional value of marriage. Anything that steps out of this, like gay marriage, would open up the door to non-traditional views of marriage. Furthermore you claim that it won't lead to the automatic legalization. This is true. However you fail to see the big picture. Once gay marriage is established and a non-traditional view of marriage is adopted other people who are polygamists, etc, would say that their owns rights are being violated. Look at above example. \"My opponent said \"According to you marriage is based on love, and nothing more\". I never said that or even implied that, so this is an assumption on his part, making the rest of this paragraph based on an assumption.\" My Response: First off, you never cited a case that defends homosexual marriage. Secondly, you claim that family making isn't the main reason. If that isn't? Then what is? This leads to my conclusion that gay marriage is upheld by only love. \"My opponent was the one who brought up polygamous marriages (\" .. If this was true, why isn't polygamy allowed? .. \"), so I listed some reasons against it that cannot be used against gay marriage in response to that sentence. This was to illustrate how gay and polygamous marriage are different.\" My Response: My opponent didn't understand my attack. If economics is the reason for marriage then heterosexual marriage should be the sole one. By claiming economics he devalues his own stance. \"My opponent claims that animals are not gay and that the term itself is intrinsically flawed. A couple of sources that I will provide to argue his claim are the August 2008 issue of Scientific American Mind ( \"..Animal homosexuality has been documented in as many as 1,500 species, including insects..\" ), which reports on a study spearheaded by University of Oslo zoologist Petter Bockman. Another source is \"Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity\" by Bruce Bahemihl, Ph.D. ( \"..In ostriches, male homosexuality is much more common than bisexuality..\" ).\" My Response: What I am saying is that animals aren't gay for the fact that it doesn't wish to \"love\" their gay partner. They look to indulge in mere sex. That's what makes us different then animals (Most of the time). Saying that animals are gay cannot be linked to human homosexuality. I'm sorry if I didn't make this clear. Extend this for his responses about homosexuality and animals. \"My opponent says he is only arguing against gay marriage and not homosexuality. However, the two are obviously closely related. I will clarify my position about why gay marriage SHOULD be legal at the end of this response.\" My Response: I am not saying that gays are evil people. I am saying that they shouldn't not have the right to marry. Some friends of mine are gay, I don't hate the. I just feel for consequentialist reasons that gay marriage should not be legal. [Affirmative Burden] My opponent finally says a case, however I believe too late in the round. However, that's for the voters to decide. I don;t think he has given me adequate time to respond. But still, I will. His case: 14th Amendment: Equal Protection Clause This is a good point, however has a flaw to it. the Power of Marriage was given to the states rather then the Federal Government. (10th Article) Furthermore, this amendment only applies to laws under federal statue. My opponent will likely claim the Virgina Court Decision. In this case the court did go in favor of love, or w/e her name was. Some people take this as a point that marriage is federal. This is not the case at all. Nowhere in the court decision did it make marriage a federal \"umbrella\". Therefore, you can drop my opponents argument.",

            "premise": "I negate: Gay marriage should be legal. [Contentions] Contention I: \"Slippery Slope\" Argument By allowing gay marriage and not defining marriage between a man and a women, then the law is open to all types of other definitions. Gay Rights Activists claim that marriage should be based on nothing more then love. If this was true, why isn't polygamy allowed? Why isn't incestuous/family marriages allowed? It's all based on love right? By allowing gay marriage, the state is being opened to all sorts of other acts that are seen as wrong in society. Marriage cannot be based solely on love. This leads to my next point. Contention II: Natural Law The question now arises how should marriage be defined and why. Marriage should not be defined based on love only (As proven in my above point). Therefore, for the sake of this debate I will explain natural law. Natural law dictates that society should not condone an action that violates the natural law. Marriage should be the contract between 2 people admitting themselves in the natural process of sex. The reason for a married couple is to be the basis for child making, and thus a natural family. Gay marriage violates the natural law because 2 men cannot naturally make children, that goes for 2 women as well. Marriage should be the sacred bond for the fulfillment of this natural law of sex and family. [Affirmative Burden] My opponent has claimed in his opening round that the reason he thinks gay marriage should be legal is because there are no arguments that say it shouldn't. As a reminder, my opponent is the one with the burden of proof for this round. He must submit an argument/contention affirming the resolution. If not, then you must vote Con.

Gay marriage, presumably a marriage which is somehow related to homosexuality, e.g. one or both partners are homosexual, is legal. Nearly every form of marriage is legal. There is no need to legalize that which is legal. It is far simpler to create a new, legal institution, a civil union, and leave the definition of marriage to the Church. I propose that civil union status, along with benefits, be given to all those who become, or are currently married, and that the government ceases to regulate marriage. I concede all points, excepting 4. An interracial marriage always fit the definitions, and when did we legalize polygamy?",

            "premise": "You never said that the point of the debate was changing how society defines marriage. This debate is supposed to be on whether gay people should be allowed to get married. Therefore, my point is relevant. \u201cI have proved why these religious beliefs are no reason why the government should not recognise gay marriage to support basing my arguments around the separation of the church and the state.\u201d You stated in your previous argument \u201cThis man is just one of the growing support for gay marriage within religious communities. This shows that even if religions were to hold power over the governments decision this would not restrict the passing of this motion for long because people are willing to accept others because most people are generally quite pleasant\u201d. When you brought up the religious supporters of gay marriage, you implied that religion should be part of the decision. The majority of the religious community is still against gay marriage. So if religion held power over government decisions, gay marriage would not be legalized. You did not prove anything about the separation of church and state. \u201cOnly a minority in society now still believe that gay marriage is wrong\u201d Can you prove that statement? From what I know, a large percentage of society does not support gay marriage. \u201cthe common belief that we had about gay marriage being wrong stemmed from the fact that the government would not allow it to happen\u201d I would also like to see the proof for that. \u201cWhen we get rid of this last piece of \"legal stigma\" society can then fully integrate\u201d You have not yet proved that legalizing gay marriage would make more people support. If people hated gays before gay marriage was legal, they will hate them after it is legal. Society will still not fully integrate. But you still do not bring up the benefits for society as a whole. The stigma and hate crimes relating to gay couples are directed at the LGBT community. The rest of society is not harmed by it. Legalizing gay marriage would benefit the LGBT community but it would not end the stigmas or hate crimes. It would also not benefit society as a whole. \u201cthe state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage\u201d. This definition still supports my point. Gay couples can be united in a relationship LIKE that of a traditional marriage. It is called a civil union, so you are practically \u201cmarried\u201d. It is not and should not be recognized by the law because it is not the same as a traditional marriage. \u201cThe only difference here is that heterosexual marriage is \" recognized by law \" and homosexual marriage is not. That is what this debate is about.\u201d You should really decide what this debate is about. Since at the beginning of you argument you stated \u201cthe whole point of this debate is that we should be changing how society defines marriage. That is the definition as it stands the now but this debate is about changing the definition\u201d. \u201cBecause gay marriage does benefit our society and it can lead to improvements in other societies\u201d You have not proved why gay marriage is beneficial to a society so you cannot say it would lead to improvements in other societies. You also say in your first argument that this debate is about American government and society. If this debate is about America, it does not matter whether or not it benefits other societies. Gay marriage should not be legalized for multiple reasons. First, it would require the definition of marriage to be changed. If the government changes its definition of marriage to allow gay couples to get married, people could then say it should be changed so that they can marry their family members or pets. Marriage is a very sacred thing to many people. Allowing gay marriage would take away the value of marriage because it would show that the meaning of marriage can be changed to suit the needs of a group of people. Gay couples are already allowed to have civil unions. They can be joined together but it is not called the same thing as when heterosexual couples are joined. They are not the same thing so they should not be called the same thing. Same-sex couples are unable to procreate, meaning that there is no compelling interest to subsidize their marriages. The majority of heterosexual couples can procreate or were able to procreate at some point. There are exceptions but those are exactly that, exceptions. Homosexual couples cannot naturally procreate. There are no exceptions.",

The government should ban all marriage, therefore gay marriage too. -That wasn\"t the point of the debate, and you sound like you support straight marriage much more than gay marriage, so I don\"t think you agree with yourself here. Either way, I will note that marriage provides benefits to society, so we should have the option. Also, later you suggest that if most people support something, then it should be law. Most people want government to recognize marriage, so by your own standard, marriage should be recognized by government. 2. The government doesn\"t have the power to redefine marriage. -We are talking about legal marriages, so yes they do. Congress created the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. According to the Supreme Court, state bans on gay marriage are in violation of that amendment. 3. Not many people are gay, so why not ban it? -I\"m not sure what the argument is here. Things that are uncommon should be banned? 4. Most people oppose it, so it should be banned. -Your own second source shows that 60% of Americans support it, so this is not true. If your point is that the government should obey the majority, then that means they should keep gay marriage legal. You proved yourself wrong. Even if most people did oppose it, so what? The majority shouldn\"t discriminate. 5. Legal marriage doesn\"t help gay people, because they can still be together either way. -There are legal and social benefits to gay marriage. 6. Why would we need the government to acknowledge this marriage just so we can pay more taxes? -So gay people can get the benefits that come with marriage. 7. It creates moral decay. -How? Discriminating against gay people is what causes harm and unfairness. You said yourself that gays can be together either way, so what harm does it cause? 8. It has nothing to do with equality. -Benefits denied based on gender and orientation means there is inequality. 9. Gay marriage legalization will lead to the fall of America. -You\"ll need to provide a lot of support for a huge claim like that. Even if it were to happen, it is inevitable. Gay marriage is here to stay, so it\"s pretty pointless to try to ban it.",

            "premise": "I'll attack my opponents case then move to crystallize my own. \"Concerning your request for clarification, I am not saying that the federal government should make it explicitly legal for homosexual couples to marry. That is not what governments generally do. They don't say what is legal, just what is illegal.\" My Response: This is totally off base. My opponent says that the government only says what is illegal, not legal. It works both ways, if something is illegal, most the time the opposite of illegality is legality. And vice versa. \"My argument is that not only should the federal government never amend the Constitution to bar homosexual couples from marrying, but that it is furthermore unconstitutional, unjust, and illogical for states to make gay marriage illegal or otherwise \"define\" marriage as between individuals of the opposite sex.\" My Response: I have 2 response: 1) Again, it's the decision of the state or the populous. Thats where the power lies. According to a poll taken by the Ny Times, 75% of Americans oppose gay marriage. That says something. The example I gave, Virginia already has a marriage clause in their constitution. Furthermore, if the federal government interferes they are throwing off the balance of power.However more importantly 2) My opponent never warrants the claim. He has just an assertion. Why is it unjust and illogical for states to make a clause defining marriage as heterosexual. Remember, culture comes into play too. My opponent tries to warrant this by claiming the 14th Amendment. However looking back to my round 1, I have shot down that argument and it has gone responded by my opponent. So you can extend that argument. Since my opponent has no warrant for his claim, then you can't look at his assertion. \"I find it hard to understand how you could not see the connection in my syllogism. It is very simple. Men have the right to marry women, and women have the right to marry men. If you agree that men and women should have equal rights, it logically follows that men should have the right to marry men and women to marry women. This simply gives men and women the same rights. You try to say that the right is given to both men and women to marry individuals of the opposite sex. It seems to me that that interpretation is quite full of problems.\" My Response: My opponent never explains how it makes sense. My opponent jumps from simple rights to then gay rights. I have already explained that they have rights they can both marry the opposite sex. My opponent arrives at a conclusion, again with no warrant. \"What about transgender individuals, both pre-op and post-op? How exactly does the government define sex? Is it defined by sex chromosomes, reproductive organs, or what the individual feels his/her sex is?\" My Response: I have 3 responses. 1) The government doesn't define sex, it defines what MARRIAGE is. 2) My opponent seems to feel that since it's natural/of what he or she feels, then the government must protect it. This is totally false. If I was naturally born a violent person, does that mean that I get privileges from the government? 3) Ok, what about polygamists, should they get protection too. What about incest (which is a sexual disorder, probably linked to genes) should that be legal too. My opponents arguments lead to slippery slopes. If the government, according to my opponent, does not have the right to define marriage as between a man and women, then groups the above will look for \"Protection\" as well. \"I realize that the 10th amendment states clearly that powers not specified by the Constitution as reserved for the federal government are for the states. I am not disputing this. States can make laws independently of the federal government. However, they can't make laws that are in violation of the United States Constitution. But by baning gay marriage outright, states have done just that. They are abridging specfic privileges of specific individuals (not couples), based solely on sexual orientation.\" My Response: My opponent doesn't seem to understand. Just link my attack response against his 14th amendment argument (Round 1). \"I was actually looking for my opponent to make arguments as to why gay marriage to be specifically ILLEGAL.\" My Response: You did not put that in the topic, and you didn't define that in your first round. Therefore, as your contender I have a right to fix any gaps in the debate. I have obviously refuted/negated the topic of the legalization of gay marriage, because as your 1st round implies, as using the 14th Amendment, you are arguing for the federal government to: A) Ban states from making their own decisions on marriage (Thats why I use my state power argument) B)Making it legal everywhere, in every state. Therefore, my contention stands and it has gone un-refuted. =============================================================================== Extension: 1) Extend my rebuttal arguments, since he failed to address them. 2) Extend my contention 1",

            "premise": "To begin, this is not a debate over wether government ought to recognize the institution of marriage. The resolution states that gay marriage should be legal. If something is recognized as legal it is recognized by the government. Secondly, this is not a debate about wether government should incentivize marriage or wether gay couples should enjoy the same tax benefits as straight couples. The resolution speaks exclusively to legality; nothing more. Legality, for our purposes, is only the ability to do something without punishment or incentive designed to hinder any given act. Gay marriage should be legal. A. Only acts that encroach upon the life, liberty, or property of another should to be illegal. Our founding fathers wrote that government ought be charged with three essential tasks: preserving our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (property). People, by the virtue of their humanity, are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (ownership of property), and are entitled to enjoy them to the fullest possible extent unless or until their enjoyment hampers another's enjoyment of their rights. In essence, my rights end where yours begin. It is from this principal that the American concept of equality is derived. Where the object is to uphold natural rights, the task of government then (in domestic terms) is only to make illegal those acts which are not germane to natural rights, their preservation, or enjoyment thereof by all people. If any act by any individual or third party encroaches on the enjoyment of anyone else's rights, that act ought be illegal because no person has the right to deprive another of their rights without consent or without just cause. B. Gay marriage does not jeopardize the life, liberty, or enjoyment of property of another. Marriage, in essence, is a contractual agreement whereby two consenting parties agree to share their lives together. It is an institution that requires consent of two adults; traditionally centered upon either romance or utility or both for both people who marry one another. There has been no substantial indication that gay marriage is harmful to any member of society, wether we consider society as a whole, individuals, children, or those who should desire to marry one another. There is accordingly no conflict with any individual's enjoyment of life, liberty, or property in any way, shape, or form. As such, gay marriage should not be illegal. If something is not illegal, then it is legal. Ergo, gay marriage should be legal.",

            "premise": "Gay Marriage- Taking away Love \"A life without love is no life at all.\" \"Leonardo Di Vinci. By not allowing gay marriage, the privilege of eternal love is taken away. Homosexual couples should be allowed to marry, because they deserve the same rights as straight couples, it will give children a healthy home by helping gay couples adopt, and will help the economy. Homosexual couples deserve the same rights and legal benefits as heterosexual couples. Michelle Johnson, former editor for the Boston Globe says, \"Those who continue to oppose same-sex marriage should consider what it would be like to cross state lines with their spouse and no longer be recognized as a married couple or lose parental rights to your children. Or think of how you would feel if your community went to the polls on Election Day to vote on whether you have the right to marry.\" It is never appropriate to take the rights away from a human being, just because they do not have the same beliefs. By saying a homosexual couple cannot get married, it takes away their right to be wedded and adopt together just like any other couple. Everyone deserves rights, and no one should have them taken away. Gay marriage helps couples adopt, and those couples provide more stable homes to their children. A study published on June 7, 2010 found \"...children of lesbian mothers, and gay fathers, were rated higher in social and academic ability than children of heterosexual parents. These children also had fewer social problems.\" By allowing gay marriage, it will be easier for them to adopt. It will also help the children when they are adopted, because gay parents provide a better home. If gay marriage is not legalized, many children will be left in foster care, or end up in home that are not stable. We need gay marriage, for the children, but also for the economy. The economy of states and local governments can be improved by gay marriage. The Comptroller for New York City, Scott Stringer, found \"In new york city, allowing gay marriage brought a total of $326 million dollars to the states and city\"s economy, over three years.\" Since there is also a financial benefit to gay marriage, legalizing it should be the only option. By letting more citizens marry, the economy will grow rapidly. Let gay marriage be legal, and there will be an economic value as well. People who are against same-sex marriage say, \"Marriage is between a man and a woman and view anything else as morally wrong... allowing homosexual couples to marry is unconstitutional and would destroy the sanctity of marriage.\" Where in the constitution does it say gay marriage is \"unconstitutional\"? All marriage really involves is two people who love each other, no matter what gender, race, or religion they are. Love is never wrong. Gay marriage is just the same as heterosexual marriage. 2 people in love, who deserve to be wed. Gay marriage should be legal because everyone deserves the right to be married, gay marriage will provide a stable home for adopted children, and will help the economy. Do not take away the amazing privilege of love, grant it, and approve of gay marriage. Works Cited Barnes, Robert. \"Gay Marriage Bans Upheld by Appeals Panel.\" Washington Post. 07 Nov. 2014: A.1.

Marriage: a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife[1]My opponent makes a few assumptions in her case. They are that:Everyone should be able to marry who they love.Why is this? My opponent brings no warrant for this assertion.Why can I marry who I love, but someone who is gay can't?The answer is complicated, but the short answer would be that marraige is by definition a union between a man and a woman. Thus, a homosexual couple cannot possibly be married. Gay marriage is the same as yellow blue, a contradiction in terms.It is a human right to marry who you loveAgain, why is this? My opponent again brings no warrant to her assertion. I would write more but there is a 1,000 character limit.

            "premise": "There are many reasons to why gay marriage should be legal. A few reasons would be right of choice, right to love, and staying true to one's own feelings. These reasons are very important as you should take legalizing gay marriage around the world to consideration. First of all, there should be a right of choice. Not everyone is going to be like you. A vast majority of the population loves to choose to either marry someone of the opposite sex, or not marry. But there's a percentage with it's own opinion. You get to choose a lot of your life, there are many small decisions we make everyday that are very important to us. But marriage is a much greater concept. For people who prefer living with someone of the same-sex who they love, if gay marriage is illegal where they live, they often have a mentally tough and challenging time choosing between marrying someone of the opposite sex, or not marrying at all. Just because some choices are more appreciated worldwide, doesn't mean that other choices are of any lower value. In this case, since there should be a freedom of choice, gay marriage should be legal. Secondly, there is a right to love. No one can stop you from mentally loving someone. No matter how much someone can stop you from seeing the person, your mental state will still love. Not being allowed to express this love, may make a person emotionally challenged, and fiercely disappointed. Tradition isn't bad, as tradition is to love, live with, maybe have kids with, and marry someone of opposite gender, possibilities still exist. Gay couples could still love, live together and take care of kids. People who are against gay marriage because of religion, should be aware that even if two people of the same-sex don't marry, they can still love each other and you can't stop that. If love grows exceptionally strong within the same-sex, they may really want to marry. If there is a right to love people of the same-sex, there should be a right to show this desire. If you're one of the people who think gay couples should love someone else, you're not defining love right. Mentally, there is always going to be right to love. But these emotions are remarkably calmer when expressed, so the right to go through your love life the way you want to, should exist. Lastly, this is your life. A person has a life, with their own body. They have a mind, which has it's complexity. Part of this complexity may come with one's own emotions. Changing one's own self isn't that simple, and shouldn't be done, especially because judging creates barriers. Extraverted judging creates barriers for others, while introverted judging gives yourself barriers. Judging should be used for accuracy, not for personality. Your personality is you, and your feelings are a part of your personality. Being receptive of the world is important. Emotions are a tough part of the inner-world, which shouldn't be sacrificed if you want to stay true to yourself. Legalizing gay marriage isn't just legalizing it for everyone, but one's it's legalized, allowing yourself to have gay marriage, is a part of judgment. Staying true to yourself, is refusing to judge. Part of what you have to do to legalize gay marriage, is to temporarily accept the world without judgment, so that you can vision these perspectives. Staying true to yourself, is listening to your personality, and letting it matter. Overall gay marriage should be legal, so that some who prefer loving another of the same-sex as they themselves, can express themselves to the fullest. One can do this by valuing their own individualism, openly perceiving emotions, and acknowledging the human right to make decisions on her/his own. A lot of us express these needs by marriage with the opposite sex, or no marriage at all, if we don't feel this way. But it's important to respect the part of the human population who feels such emotions for someone of the same-sex. One's personality creates love. Therefore, gay marriage should be legal.",

            "premise": "Thank you for responding. My computer broke, and I couldn't respond, even though I would have liked to. Hopefully we will have a very efficient debate. Let's start by analyzing some of the reasons why gay marriage should be legal: 1) It's wrong to deny a man the right that only a women has; marry a man. When marriage requires the equal participation of both sexes, that's unequal treatment of the sexes. 2) Gay marriage would change the definition of marriage, but not the value. If gay marriage is imposed on society a, then society will adapt to the change, just like the desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement. 3) It provides many benefits for gay couple than a 'civil union.' 4) Children would be adopted since the couples are sterile and have a family. Many people worry about children \"becoming gay\" when they are adopted by gay parents. But, let's look at some facts and statistics: bloggernews.com says,\"According to the 2000 census, there were 163,879 households with children being raised by same-sex couples. That number is said to have climbed from between 1 and 9 million children. About 67 studies have been conducted by the American Psychological Association, focusing on children of gay parents. Each of these studies proved that children do the same no matter which environment they grow up in. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics agree with these findings.\" Gay couples are going to be together, regardless of being married. And gay marriage does not physically harm anyone, or effect anyone they do not know. Just because two men or two women want to be married does not mean all kinds of laws are going to be made about other kinds of marriages, such as polygamy, etc. Some benefits that gay couples will have if they get married includes: 1) To show their commitment to society 2) Mutual legal protection I now hand the floor to my opponent. I wish you the best of luck in the next round.",

            "discussionTitle": "Should gay marriage be legal in all states",
            "conclusion": "Should gay marriage be legal in all states",
            "premise": "From round 1: \"I believe it should be legal in all states because band go against the constitution. \" You've shown nothing to prove that legalizing gay marriage is in the constitution. \"The declaration of independence states all humans have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that's what homosexual people are doing perusing happiness.\" By privatizing marriage you do insure that homosexuals as well as many other groups can no longer be persecuted by the government. Privatizing marriage allows people more freedom to pursue the type of marriage they feel suits them best. The government would no longer be involved with or get to decide the rules of marriage. From round 2: \"Also in America we have The separation of church and state and the thought of gay marriage being immoral and wrong is based wholly on what the bible says and that is involving religion with politics.\" Some people view marriage as a holy institution. The only way to take marriage out of a political realm where religious ideologies are used to determine law, would be to privatize marriage. I think homosexuals should be allowed to marry. I've shown a way to take marriage out of the legal realm. My opponent has failed to show why legalizing gay marriage would be superior to privatizing it and taking marriage off the government's hands. From round 3: \"First without the government being involved in marriage there would not be marriage because there would not be anything binding the two people together so you wouldn't have a true marriage. \" That's a myth. Marriage can exist without the government's laws or intrusion. I already covered what would bind people together. A couple ( or trio etc.) would be binded together by their love for one another. If the couple needs some legal protections and other things. They would then be free to form a civil union and write out a contract to each other. No government is necessary or even preferable for people to fall in love with each other and live happily ever after. \"Second we would have twelve year olds getting married and divorced like thirty times a day so this country would be full of crap relationships and we also would have a rise in divorce rate.\" That statement is ridiculous and unproven. 12 year olds by law couldn't sign a contract and form a civil union. If they got married without the governments involvement it wouldn't hurt anybody. It would basically be a fun game of pretend at that point. Since 12 year olds don't have a ton of assets they could easily separate without involving the government at all. I also have no ideal what you're referring to by \"crap relationships\". I think it's just you projecting your ideals of morality on others. It's you infringing on my right to have a \"crappy relationship\". The last thing we want the government doing is imposing their own personal morality on society. My opponent has actually done nothing to support the hypothesis that the divorce rate would rise or even that the divorce rate rising is harmful. \"Third your belief that we shouldn't have the institution of marriage has nothing to do with this debate \" I'm sorry that you didn't get the argument you was expecting. Refer back to my definition of legal. Privatizing marriage would make marriage a right for gays. It would also take marriage out of the legal realm thus making it neither legal nor illegal. Marriage privatization is a reasonable counter argument to one proposing to legalize gay marriage. \" it is extremely flawed and not well thought out\" It's actually extremely well thought out, but since your arguments and rebuttals against it are extremely weak, the true depth of marriage privatization won't be shown in this debate. I don't mean that as an insult either, just a statement of fact. \"We are talking about the fact that America practices legally binded marriage and the fact that we don't allow gay marriage in all parts of our country. So your argument is off topic to begin with but I still proved it to be unethical.\" It's not off topic at all. You have to prove gay marriage should be legalized. I have several ways to argue against this. I chose to show an alternative to legalized marriage that actually covered a lot of the reasons you wanted to legalize marriage. In order for you to win, you have to prove legalizing marriage is superior to privatizing marriage. Back to pro.",

            "discussionTitle": "The marriage of Homosexuals should be legal",
            "conclusion": "The marriage of Homosexuals should be legal",
            "premise": "Okaaay...my opponent continues to assert that my definitions are biased and unworthy, without proof. I have proven that marraige has it's roots in religion and he refuses to contend that point, so I can only assume that he accepts it. In a convential marraige, they are married by, often, a preacher. He reads from the Bible. He mentions God. How can my opponent assert that marraige has no roots in religion? He cannot. A document does not testify to the will of God. His Bible, however, does. The preacher reads from this and joins them in union. My opponent says my Unconstitutionality argument is invalid. I state: \"The bindings of matromony are held, rightly, by the states, empowered by the Consitution.\" To have the marraige of homosexuals legalized without the empowerment of the states themselves and federally mandated by the government of the nation would conflict with our Constitution. Unless my opponent can disprove that, the point stands unnegated. My opponent says: \"...things that are legal throughout the nation that the state's do NOT have control over such as tobacco for example.\" Tobacco is a product of companies. In the constitution, we are given the right to own businesess without government interfearance. \"Also, legalizing gay marriage everywhere is not tyrannical. In fact its more tyrannical for the government to call it illegal because that's the government taking control of our personal lives.\" Legalizing gay marraige IS boarder-line tyranny, if the states do not want to, which some do not. Therefore, that is tyrannical and unconstitutional. Also, the state government does not \"take control over our personal lives\", for if you are not currently married, then there is nothing to take control of. However, there is something to prevent. Legally, they can, and do, do this. My opponent says (on the matter of my source) \"...he is correct but at the same time you have to realize that times have changed and while the elderly feels that homosexuals are an abomination, people of this decade do not.\" Oh, but about half of the people of the decade disagree with it too. So, it isn't as 'trendy' as the picture is painted. On this entire paragraph: \"He claims that \"Christians believe that marriage is a gift from God\" and while that may be true, I ask you this, who cares? What we have to realize here is that not everyone believes in God. If they do, that's great, that's another debate. So if my opponent truly wishes not to debate God's existence, let us shy away from the Christianity references. Thank you.\" The reason why I bring this up, as I've said before, is because marraige has it's hold in religion. The reason why I wouldn't debate the existance of god, is because that is opinion, but the fact that He is used in marraiges is, indeed, fact. \"Well, as I have proven, marriage does not always have to do with God.\" Ahhhh!!! That is what I've been waiting to hear from you, and a very valid point! However, I have prepared for this. If you look at my first, brief arguement, I said : (As stated above, to be joined in matrimony, they must have the blessing of God, and since this country is, for the most part, Christain, I will use this religion to form my basis.) Since this country's marraiges are mostly in the Christain format, I would contend this. There are some, but to Christianity this is a minorty plea, cases where God is not invloved. Even without Christianity, it is stated in most other major religions, which most often a marraige is based upon, that homosexuality is a \"sin\", or whatever their religious term may be. \"Politics and the law have everything to do with marriage, hints the fact that it is illegal while it should be legal. Once again, that's GREAT that God doesn't approve of gay marriage, there's a lot that \"God\" doesn't approve of, yet it's still legal.\" My opponent seems not to believe that Christain marraiges, which I still maintain, is the convential and popular method of marraige. In this, the act of marraige ITSELF cannot be completed if not blessed by God, and marraige must be unequivically fufilled to be vaild. Therefore, there is no complete marraige, there can be no law to legalize the marrige if the act cannot take place. \"I'm by no means convicting you for you're beliefs. I'm saying that while you may think it's 'wrong,' that does NOT give anyone the right to tell anyone, gay or not, that they cannot marry whomever they want.\" HOWEVER, my dear friend, you stated, and I quote: \"\"People believe differently and they need not suffer on what makes them happy by another man's beliefs.\" I must say, that I know several people that it makes them physically sick at the sight of two men (or women) kissing each other. Literally, I have seen my best friend throw up on the floor (funny though!). You said: \"People believe differently and they need not suffer on what makes them happy by another man's beliefs.\" The homosexual belief is that it's alright. The heterosexual beleif is that it's not. By your arguements, you would force the puking of my best friend, thus making him suffer (I can't stop laughing!). \"My point was and is that God and religion does NOT matter in this debate.\" In marraige, as I've proven, it does. That's like saying wheat has nothing to do with a delicious ham sandwhich. If there is no wheat, there is no bread to tie the delcious ham and lettuce sandwhich together. You just have ham and lettuce. (PS: 1 bread is God, 1 bread is is government legalization/approval, the ham is the man, the entire sandwhich is a successful marraige, and the lettuce is the woman. If you have only 1 slice of bread, it is not a delicious ham and lettuce sandwhich, and the sandwhich is not whole; it topples and falls since it is incomplete.) Thank you for the debate VOTE CON",

Truth is, if you don't like it then don't be near them. There is nothing wrong with being gay. There isnt proof of god anyways and If someone doesn't want to follow god's rules then they shouldn't have to. People have the freedom of any religion/belief they want. Many teens are gay and get bullied all the time and legalizing it across the nation will show teens that homosexuality is accepted in society and its okay to be gay.

Many laws, especially with those concerning children and divorce, have references to wife and husband which would bring to question \"Well we are both wives so what now?\". http://www.hg.org... 2. In a divorce, precedent gives favor in most states to the female as having priority to the children. What happens with both parents are female and precedent gives both priority? What if one is transgender? Could they be argued as male instead, which would be unfair? For Gay Marriages to become legal, there needs to be a comprehensive solution.

            "premise": "Concerning your request for clarification, I am not saying that the federal government should make it explicitly legal for homosexual couples to marry. That is not what governments generally do. They don't say what is legal, just what is illegal. My argument is that not only should the federal government never amend the Constitution to bar homosexual couples from marrying, but that it is furthermore unconstitutional, unjust, and illogical for states to make gay marriage illegal or otherwise \"define\" marriage as between individuals of the opposite sex. I find it hard to understand how you could not see the connection in my syllogism. It is very simple. Men have the right to marry women, and women have the right to marry men. If you agree that men and women should have equal rights, it logically follows that men should have the right to marry men and women to marry women. This simply gives men and women the same rights. You try to say that the right is given to both men and women to marry individuals of the opposite sex. It seems to me that that interpretation is quite full of problems. What about transgender individuals, both pre-op and post-op? How exactly does the government define sex? Is it defined by sex chromosomes, reproductive organs, or what the individual feels his/her sex is? I realize that the 10th amendment states clearly that powers not specified by the Constitution as reserved for the federal government are for the states. I am not disputing this. States can make laws independently of the federal government. However, they can't make laws that are in violation of the United States Constitution. But by baning gay marriage outright, states have done just that. They are abridging specfic privileges of specific individuals (not couples), based solely on sexual orientation. Your first contention doesn't actually address my argument. As I said, I am not looking for the federal government to make a law saying that gay marriage is legal. I think that the federal government should just enforce the Constitution and keep states from making it illegal. I was actually looking for my opponent to make arguments as to why gay marriage to be specifically ILLEGAL.",

            "conclusion": "Gay marriage should be legal in the United States",
            "premise": "\"My opponent makes the claim here that something can be neither legal and illegal, but he fails to provide evidence or reasoning for this claim.\" Opposite to what my opponent has said, right before this quote I provided evidence from my opponent's argument concerning the tenth amendment. I shall expand upon the reasoning involved. What I have said is that the federal government cannot make laws either way concerning gay marriage. It is up to the states. \"I claim that something is legal until it is made illegal.\" Let's look at a few examples to examine when something is legal. 1. An employer can pay their employees whatever they want until a minimum wage law is passed. Thus, in this case, it is legal to pay whatever until a law is passed, then it is illegal. 2. There are no laws concerning marriage whatsoever. Marriage was defined as a legal union. Because there are no laws pertaining to marriage in this situation. Legal marriage does not exist. Anyone can have a religious ceremony and live with whomever they wish, but this legal union does not exist because there are no laws. As can be seen in these two examples, something is not always legal until it is made illegal. In the second example, marriage as a legal union simply did not exist. An action can be considered legal until it is legislated otherwise, but something provided by the government, (in this case a marriage by law), does not exist until it is brought into existence by law. Civil rightsCivil rights- The rights belonging to an individual by virtue of citizenship [1]. Marriage- The legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife, and in some jurisdictions, between two persons of the same sex, usually entailing legal obligations of each person to the other\"Under this definition [of marriage], gay marriage certainly could be considered a civil right, just as marriage already is, under certain jurisdictions. As long as gay marriage is included in the definition of marriage, it is a civil right.\"Gay marriage can only be considered a civil right in some jurisdictions. This is because as noted in the definition, gay marriage is only a part of the definition of marriage in some jurisdictions. Because civil rights are rights that are gained by being a citizen or resident of a certain jurisdiction, gay marriage is only a civil right in those jurisdictions that recognize the definition of marriage as gay marriage or straight marriage. In jurisdictions that define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, gay marriage is not a right that belongs to people who are under that jurisdiction.\"The United States does have the obligation or duty to enforce its laws; this does not mean that the states have the obligation to define marriage as only between a man or a woman. \"The United States does have an obligation to enforce its laws. One of these laws is the tenth amendment which gives the states, not the federal government, the power to legislate marriage. My opponent's argument that the federal government is obligated to legislate marriage is an argument for the government to break the law. My opponent also highlighted the difference between \"should\" and \"can.\" Of course Congress can pass any law it wants to, however it should pass all laws. The reason it should not pass a law legalizing same sex marriage is that such a law is unconstitutional. Whether gay marriage should be included in the definition of marriageMy opponent is correct in assessing my argument. My argument's main points are that states may define marriage as they wish and that the federal government cannot constitutionally regulate marriage.As his final argument of the previous round, my opponent chose to argue why each state should include gay marriage in the definition of marriage. Unfortunately, this argument is not applicable to the resolution. The resolution, interpreted using the agreed upon definitions, states that the federal government should legislate to make gay marriage legal. The choices states make concerning the definition of marriage is not a part of the resolution. The important part is that states are allowed to make that choice.Thus, my opponent is arguing for an unconstitutional action and the specific actions the state's choose regarding the definition of marriage are not topical to the resolution.Question Although I believe I have sufficiently proved the non topicality of the previous argument, I anticipated such an argument in the previous round, and thus posed the question \"If gay marriage is a civil right, then is polygamy a civil right?\" My opponent chose not to answer the question because he felt it was not topical to the resolution. This question is absolutely relevant to the resolution. This is because if we are exploring redefining marriage, we must look at the possible precedents that it could set. Polygamy, as a comment on this debate pointed out, could become part of the definition of marriage because of the precedent set. I suspect the real reason for his response is that he simply did not wish to answer the question. Why might he choose this response? Let's say he chose to affirm the question and say that yes, if gay marriage can be a civil right, then polygamy too can be a civil right. In that case, he would have to defend polygamy because I could use a moral argument to show why polygamy was wrong and if gay marriage led to polygamy, this would be a morally wrong procedure. If he chose to negate the question, then he would have to prove that gay marriage would not be setting a precedent for polygamous marriage. This is also a challenging argument to make. I am not saying this is the reason he chose not to answer the question, but it certainly appears that way. I myself feel no reason to push for voters to vote one way or the other on conduct because I feel my argument are strong enough to win by themselves. I will, however, remind readers that my opponent has chosen to not respond to a question which I have shown to be directly related to the issue at hand.Summary1. I proved that legal marriage does not exist until brought into existence by law2. I proved that marriage is not a civil right throughout the United States, because only some jurisdictions recognize marriage as both homo and heterosexual.3. I proved that my opponent is advocating for an unconstitutional action.4. I proved that how states choose to define marriage is not important to the resolution.5. I proved that my unanswered question is relevant to the resolution, so it is my opponent, not I, who am drawing away from the resolution.Source:[1]- http://www.thefreedictionary.com...",

Homosexual relationships are increasingly gaining acceptance in this country; however, these couples have not been permitted to marry. Some states have considered a new form of commitment called a \"civil union\", which essentially is marriage without using the word \"marriage\". Many politicians have said they are against gay marriage but think it should be left up to the states to decide. However, the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the Constitution says that if one state makes a law, other states must recognize it. Thus, if one state allows a gay marriage and that couple moves to another state, the other state must recognize that marriage. This in effect allows one state to make same-sex marriage legal in the entire country. Many politicians are calling for amendments to their state constitution or the U.S. Constitution. Many areas of the country such as San Francisco have performed marriage ceremonies in defiance of the law. Lost in all the legal battles and political maneuvering is the basic question \"Should we allow gay couples to legally marry?\"",

            "premise": "Hello \"Yes it could be considered a religion under some people's eyes.\" What religion? There has never been one for gay marriage for 1,000 years, and now all the sudden people want it to be legal, and it's a religion. That doesn't make sense. \"we have evolved from the olden times\" So? What's your point? I think that there are some principles of are country should never be changed, and that would include gay marriage. \"Who says people have to reproduce, do people have to give birth to a child, even when a man and a woman marry are they forced to have a baby?\" I'm not saying they have to have a baby. But in generalization, most couples have a natural baby, while gay couples can only adopt kids. Where do you come up with ideas that I'm saying that a man and woman have to have a baby? \"if people want to marry other wo/men then let them why should we interfere with there personal concerns.\" We are interfering with them, for their own good. If 2 people get married of the same sex, they will be discriminated against, and it will ruin their lives. We are protecting them from not getting married. Also, if they ever adopted a kid, he/she would be made fun of. IN today's day, kid are getting fun pf today just for being adopted, now add in having gay marriage. This would ruin the kids childhood, because he would be afraid of going to school, because of the thought of being made fun. Thank you for this debate",

            "premise": "Being legally married can get you benefits such as inheritance and tax cuts. However, couples can get married to get these benefits and are 'cheating the system.' If we get rid of these marriages, we won't see the problems. Contention 1: You can still get married religiously. This debate topic says we are ending legal marriages. That doesn't mean we are taking away marriage all together. Marriage is a religious bond and therefore should not have a religious contract. Those who are completely in love cannot complain because they can still go to their local church and get married. http://atheism.about.com... The difference between religious and civil marriages is undeniable. Civil marriages have very little in the way of requirements. They are basic contracts with a bare minimum in the way of qualifications. Religious marriages, however, are entirely different. They aren't civil contracts. Individual churches and denominations can create all sorts of requirements or qualifications before they will perform one. Legal Marriages are not religious marriages Contention 2: People are taking advantage of the legal marriage system. When people get married, you get a lot of benefits such as inheritance money and tax cuts. People are getting married to get these benefits and not because they love the person that they are marrying. Contention 3: Taking away legal marriages will get rid of controversy Everyone can agree that there is controversy between gays or such people and whether they should be allowed to get married. Taking away legal marriages can end this dispute. They can get married religiously and there will no longer be the controversy. http://atheism.about.com... So why are people trying to change things here? Banning marriage between gays simply because some churches object to gay marriage is no better than banning re-marriage for divorced people simply because some churches object to divorce and re-marriage. Contention 4: Having a piece of paper saying that you are married does not make you happier. A legal marriae gets you a piece of paper saying that you are married. If you can still get married religiously, you can still be happy. You don't need to be legally married to do that. Contention 5: The rights given to married couples aren't fair. We give all of these rights to married couples, around 1,000 actually. However, is it really fair that we give these rights to married couples? What about those couples that need these benefits but aren't receiving them? Therefore, I support abolishing legal marriages and urge you to vote on the pro side.",

            "premise": "Hello. This has been an interesting debate and now I will refute my opponent's refutations. Here we go: So my opponent stated that some people not know about/believe Christianity. This is true, though 33% of people are. [http://www.adherents.com...]. Such a large proportion surely has an effect on the decision if gay marriage should be legal. This is why I brought it up. It seems an important factor, and my opponent has not actually refuted the attack, just the significance of it. Seeing as that part still stands, it should flow to me. Next to the 'sex for reproduction' point. While it's true that couples will sometimes use contraceptives, about 44% of married couples will have children. [http://factfinder.census.gov...] When a gay couple marries, this takes away the possibility of reproduction for two couples. This means that for every 1 gay couple there are two straight ones that can't have kids. This means that this IS a big point that my opponent has not refuted and it still flows to me. Back again to the 'decrease of male population available'. Sure, in small numbers gay relationships won't hurt, but a drastic increase will occur if gay marriage is legal, and this means a drastic increase in gay people. There might be 10 ft. between you and your neighbor, but if y'all are both gay then their won't be any babies made. In a world full of gay people, humans will die out. This is simple fact, and this is why this point flows to me. 'gay hurts everyone'---Wow. Keep it in your pants now. We both know that's not the kind of hurt I meant. Point flows to me, once again. 'divorce rate increase' ---So my opponent showed why divorce IS an increasing thing. Thank you for strengthening my argument. Secondly, divorce is bad socially as it creates gaps and tensions in the social community. Not to mention the fact that it creates a tendency for divorce which may spread to heterosexual couples. This is obviously a problem, my opponent agrees, and this point should flow neg. 'marriage losing value'----Yes, marriage is symbolic. For eternal love and loyalty to the other person. My points showed that gay marriage decreases the significance of the symbolic nature of marriage. Soon, marriage won't even be a symbol, just a process with no meaning. And please, don't call the Bible mine. I am an atheist. And about the atheist getting married comment, heterosexual atheists can have a baby. Gay couples of all religions can't. Also, statistics say nothing of atheist couples, except that they have a lower divorce rate, and statistics DO show that gay couples have a much HIGHER divorce rate. See previous harms to see the problem with this. My opponent has unsuccessfully refuted my argument and it, therefore, flows Neg, to me. 'increases other homosexuals' --- actually no. See my next point as this ties in. 'children susceptible' --- The last point is perfectly shown by this one, that children will assimilate what they see around them. If alls they see around them is homosexuals then they will be homosexuals. Notice that my opponent didn't actually refute this argument, and that's why it and the previous argument flow to me. 'especially homosexuality' --- this one too my opponent has not refuted. My opponent is acting as if homosexuality is the natural state of things, as I've shown it is not. 'homosexual is contagious' --- So my opponent states that these things are secrets? A marriage in a church between two gay people is not a secret. Mr. Smith talks far more about his 'thing' than my opponent gives him credit for. Every child has heard of homosexuality and that it's bad, but if they begin to hear it's good and LEGAL, then little Bobby and little Timmy might just start experimenting starting a trend even worse than Christianity itself. 'causes more discrimination'---- My opponent doesn't understand my point apparently. Situation in the past: John: Blacks shall be free. Bob: Free blacks? What the hell, lets go dress up in sheets and burn some blacks John: (uh oh) This is the same thing that will happen with homosexuality. If it become more legal without being more accepted, problems will begin to occur. Big ones resulting in mass murder, that is. 'homosexuality not accepted' -- Similar to previous point. My opponent says we should teach our children to accept something we don't? No one will point to gay guys in a good way if they hate them! This marriage thing will INCREASE the hate, and DECREASE the acceptance of gay relationships. Just like before, this flows to me. And calling my logic ancient is pretty pitiful. Insults will only win you a negative vote on the conduct. :) 'violence' ---- sortof. And also like this http://en.wikipedia.org... And lets not forget this http://www.bilerico.com... Notice the men are getting hung because they are gay. The fact that you post a bunch of links about gay hate just strengthens my point. Thank you for that. Because of mine AND my opponent's arguments this flows to me. You are right, people should not kill. (By the way, pick your religion, stop going against religion then with it.) But if we start gay marriage there will be much more killing. Much more. Killing is bad, and this is why Gay Marriage should not exist. Evidence to my facts? [http://www.loveandpride.com...] - gay divorce rate [http://www.now.org...] - gay violence statistics This is all the evidence I used or needed. Homosexuality is a plague to the Earth right now, not because of what it is, but because of how people react to it. People slander hurt and murder homosexuals because they believe it is wrong. Gay marriage will increase gay prevelance, and therefore the violence and death. I am not saying gayness is wrong. I am saying the reactions TO IT are wrong, and increasing. This marriage will not help. I do not appreciate when one calls my logic ancient of foolish. The fact that your mind is too infantile and partial that you can't understand my points is the reason for your stress. I suggest you read what I say carefully, drop the smart-a** attitude, and grow up a bit with your attacks. I hope for the sake of this debate the next round shows a more mature side of you that understands my attacks. To the voters: I have refuted all attacks, and shown clearly why homosexual MARRIAGE is a bad thing. Vote Neg, and thank you.",

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting. I hope we can have a good debate. First, I want to start off with what I think to be the definition of marriage: two people who love each other joined to live together until death or until one wants a divorce. There isn't anything biological about marriage. Marriage is something humans created, rather than gender, which was created for us, inside of us. Humans created marriage and therefore, I think, have the right to change the definition as they wish, should they feel that that change is justified. Next, I ask a simple question. Why shouldn't gay marriage be legal? There are obviously people who would benefit from gay marriage being legal. Who exactly would it hurt? There are many people who don't want gay marriage to be equal, but would it hurt them? Would gay marriage make their lives worse? This may seem like a short starting argument, but it's all I need right now. If humans can change their definition of marriage as they please and there is no reason NOT to change it, why should we keep our laws about marriage the same? Thank you. I await your first arguments.",

            "premise": "\"If we are to look at the social trends in the past few centuries, then gay marriage seems to be the next logical development.\" Ok, and I believe that light speed is cannot be reached, and that the world is round while we are stating oppinions that have no bearing on the topic stated. Allow me to remind you what your thesis stated... \"Gay marriage is natural, necessary and inevitable.\" All you seem to be saying is that \"lots of people are accepting gays as natural; we should too.\" As soon as you present me with evidence to refute, then let the debate begin. \"Gay marraige is natural...\" well, if you mean that people are born that way, then I guess we agree. In your profile you say nothing about being Christian, so I will not bring religion into the debate at this point, however if you do claim to be Christian I have several scriptural references that should change your mind on how \"natural\" homosexuality is. At this point we will leave it as it is, though, given the fact that we agree that some people are born homosexual. \"...necessary...\" I fail to see how homosexuality/gay marraige is necessary. Give me one example of a cvilization that collapsed due to a lack of gay people and I will deal further with the claim. You say... \"In fact, the socio-psychological impact of gay marriage and its consequences to the social perception of gay people as a whole, is the most important and crucial element toward acceptance of this minority.\" Ok, so, gay marraige is necessary for helping gay people? Isn't that circular reasoning? homosexual marraige has no necessary role in society, nor does heterosexual marraige. \"...if we are to believe that we can achieve an even higher state of equality and freedom, then gay marriage is certainly the next natural, necessary and inevitable step forward.\" For me, equality is not an issue. I see homosexuals as equal people to myself, and that, I believe, is that way it should be. It seems, then, that freedom is the only issue in question. So you believe that homosexual marriage is necessary step towards greater freedom. Well, that sounds great, but there is one problem with this argument, and that is the fact that THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON BIBLICAL STANDARDS. Homosexual marriage is NOT a freedom in the Bible, nor is it in any way acceptable. If this country was founded on Biblical morals, then it follows that gay marriage should be unacceptable. If you don't like it, talk to God. \"...and inevitable.\" Really? Last I looked there are many acounts of people changing their sexual orrientation. I'm not saying tha homosexual marraige is going to come to a screeching hault, but it is by no means inevitable. If people don't wanna to be gay, thay can, with help, change their sexual orrientation. \"The Director of the New York Center for Psychoanalytic Training, no doubt aware such changes occur, remarked on the \"misinformation spread by certain circles that homosexuality is untreatable,\" saying it did \"incalculable harm to thousands.\"4 Dr. Irving Bieber concluded (after treating more than a hundred homosexuals) that \"a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change.\"5\" (http://www.family.org...) If two gays want to get married, first they will have to find some place where it is legal, and then they can decide wether or not they really want to get married. There is nothing forcing them to be married, and therefore gay marraige is not inevitable. I applaud you speaking ability, and can honestly say I am impressed. You fail, however, to say anything in relation to your own topic that can act as suitable evidence for your side. All you talk about is what marraige was, is, and will probably become. I need facts to refute, not theories. Let me go over your thesis one more time... \"Gay marrige is natural...\" Born gay, yes. Either we take this one to the Bible, or throw it out. \"...necessary...\" As I showed you, it would only be necessary for greater freedoms. These freedoms, however, would contradict the laws that this country was founded on; that is, Biblical laws. \"...and inevitable.\" Like I said, nobody is forcing any gay person into marraige, so it is therefore NOT inevitable. On a side note, sexual orrientation is in fact reversable. Now to my arguments. Leaving out the first point, which I will assume we agree on, I will move on down to its necessity. My argument against this is simple: It is not necessary because it does not meet the definition of \"necessary\". Allow me to define the word. \"Necessary: absolutely essential\" Food is necessary. Shelter is necessary. Water is necessary. Allowing gay people to marry...I don't think so. Moving on down to \"inevitable\"... Why is gay marraige not inevitable? I have already stated this, but I will reitirate. It is not inevitable because, just as heterosexuals can cancel a marriage, so can homosexuals. \"Inevitable: incapable of being avoided or prevented; an unavoidable event.\" An ecplips is inevitable. Death is inevitable. Gravity is inevitable. Gay people getting married? I don't think so. This should be enough to conclude my first argument. Thanks, Rnzzy",

            "conclusion": "Gay Marriage Should Be Legal in the United States",
            "premise": "Sad to say it but my opponent has made a few fatal flaws that will cost him this debate. He begins his speech by saying that we are not arguing about how to preserve equality but rather about what laws are constitutional. I understand this and completely agree. He is arguing that Gay Marriage being legal is constitutional, I'm arguing it's not. My opponent goes on to state that my position stems from a misunderstanding of the strict scrutiny law. In fact he goes on to say that it applies to not marriage as an institution but the laws that govern marriage. I completely agree, I understand strict scrutiny rather well and that's exactly what I'm arguing...... As a final point in this overview section my opponent argues that my case could not happen because federal law does not deal with marriage. Then he goes on to say, \"Plus, all laws concerning marital benefits, legality of church marriages, etc... would have to be changed at the federal level...\" I realize of these things which is why my case says: \"The alternative is that the federal and state governments will no longer have a hand in marriage what-so-ever and will discontinue to recognize marriages as a legal entity.\" Notice two things. First I'm focusing solely on marriage as a legal entity not as an institution. Secondly I'm focusing on both the state and federal levels. This allows for the laws on the federal level concerning marital benefits etc to be thrown out on the federal level and for the states to play their own role on the state level. Yay..... In short my case is pretty salient. And I have not conceded; while not allowing gay marriage is flawed under the current system so is allowing it simply because of the system. So let's check out these contentions: ========================= Contention 1: The Most Fair to all ====================== My opponent makes two responses onto this entire contention. Let's take a look at those: \"The correction of law to allow gay marriage would be necessarily done as a freedom to choose one's partner, regardless of gender. The trans- and ambiguously gendered would not be ostracized at all. In fact, a genderless selection pool would include them to a much greater extent.\" and \"So does allowing partner selection that has nothing to do with gender...\" My response to the first argument... LOLOLOL There is absolutely no way that you're changing the resolution that easily. My opponents positions is quite clearly: Gay marriage should be legal in the united states. That is the position he is constitutionally advocating for. There is absolutely no mention in that sentence of anything to do with transgender or other marriages. What my opponent would like to do is switch the resolution it's current state to something to the affect of: Freedom to a marriage of ones choice should be legal in the United States. Or perhaps: Transgender, Gay, and ambigously gendered marriage should be legal in the United States. These are doubtlessly not what the resolution says. If my opponent can just change the resolution at his will there is absolutely nothing I can do to win this debate. He would always just be able to change it in order to avoid my arguments. Don't let him do this. Having said that his plan suffers from all of the things that he argues against in the first speech. He says gay marriage should be legal because otherwise people would be unfairly excluded and it would not meet the scrutiny standard. This rational is exactly why he will lose this debate. Having straight and gay marriage unfairly excludes people in much the same way. My argument is that gay marriage is UNCONSTITUTIONAL in exactly the same way that straight marriage is. This means that I negate the resolution by saying that no part of the United States should uphold legal marriage. I'm saying that laws in the United States regarding marriage should be abolished. The institution can stay on the church level. But the laws get abolished. This means that nobody gets unfair benefits and that everyone is equal. EVERYONE. People of course could still draft legal contracts but those are also gender neutral. =) Sweet. In response to the second argument. My opponents case does not allow for partner selection that has nothing to do with gender. It allows for partner selection between gay and straight people nothing else. This means it's not as equal as just abolishing marriage laws. However, even if my opponents case allowed for completely gender neutral marriages it still wouldn't be a better idea than simply abolishing the laws. If you'll recall I have an entire contention on how \"marriage\" is a church creation and that would unfairly fringe upon their religion. Contention 2: Religious, Religions, and God ============================= My opponent makes two arguments, \"Good call. But marriage the religious rite and marriage the legal institution are two different things.\" \"True, but the problem remains that members of your club get fancy benefits from the government - benefits people can't get if they make their own club. It's like if Mom only visits the no-girls-allowed clubhouse with cookies and refuses to give cookies to any other clubhouse....\" To the first argument. I realize that they are two different things. My case abolishes the marriage legal institution while leaving the marriage religious rite in tact. My only argument here is that the legal institution emerged and was based off of the marriage religious rite. This means that the United States government has taken a religious institution, turned it into a legal one in part and is now attempting to change it under my opponents case. This is devastating for religious people because it's doing the exact opposite of what their doctrine says. My argument therefor is that if we simply abolish marriage as a legal institution we can avoid the entire fiasco. There won't be protests and nobody's religion is being infringed upon by the government, everyone wins. To the second argument. Here's where we see the real problem with this debate. My opponent misunderstands my case. In a world where marriage as a legal institution is abolished there are no longer perks to being married. Marriage simply defaults to a religious ceremony for those who care to. But people who are married would no longer receive any benefit over those who are not. This means mommy isn't giving cookies to just one club house. Contention 4: Finish Him ================ My opponent wants to examine this debate in a legal way. He introduced the strict scrutiny standard to decide if not allowing gay marriage is constitutional. Under our current system, it is not. However what my opponent failed to do was apply the strict scrutiny standard to the world in which gay marriage is allowed. My opponent assumes that there are only two alternatives, either have gay marriage or not. If this was the case then the strict scrutiny standard would apply. However there are quite a number of alternatives thus it fails. Neither gay nor straight marriage concerns a compelling government interest. Equality does concern a compelling government interest. The best way to achieve it is by abolishing legal marriage. Extend my entire second and third contentions here. Gay marriage hurts religion and marriage in general hurts society. These are compelling government interests against allowing marriage in the United States. Additionally neither gay nor straight marriage laws are narrowly tailored or are the least restrictive means to a goal. The best way to achieve both of these prongs of the strict scrutiny standard is by abolishing marriage as a legal institute. For these reasons gay marriage is just as unconstitutional as straight marriage and should be rejected under the strict scrutiny standard. *********************** Closing note: Yeah I do know, and I'm definitely not.

I will begin with my first argument. #1: The Constitution - \"Separation of Church and State\" is a very clear line in the Constitution. Marriage is a legal ceremony acknowledged by the government with benefits the government provides. Laws making it illegal for gays to marry because of religious beliefs are unconstitutional and should not be passed, by state or nationally. Gays should be allowed to marry in all fifty states of America, seeing as it is their constitutional right.",

            "premise": "A. Contention 1+: Family My opponent contends that some people don't have time to write their \"living will,\" and wouldn't bother with the paperwork. However, if people are willing to go through the extremely formal legal process of marriage, then most certainly they'd be willing to write out who they'd want to visit them. It's just a simple matter of writing some names on a piece of paper and sending it to the hospital. B. Contention 2+: Change from Status Quo My opponent claims that if all people could get married, then nobody is being denied the right to marry. However, what's really the point of reserving rights to the married? Why should somebody have to get married to receive these rights? What if a person's too ugly to get anybody to marry him? Everybody has the opportunity to be rich, but that doesn't justify the law favoring the rich over the poor in issues where it should be neutral. Contention 3+: Counterproductiveness My opponent says that gays are exploited. However, under my proposal, gays would not be exploited, and neither would the non-married. My opponent contradicts himself, saying that polygamy should be legalized while saying that marriage promotes polygamy. \"No, I said that non-religious people would not have a way to get married.\" They can be married in their heads. Why should they need government to tell them if they're married? D. Contention 1-: Discrimination My opponent claims that because the EPC is repeatedly violated, it becomes okay. Discrimination does not justify discrimination. \"[A]s long as all adults are allowed to marry, everyone has equal opportunity to take advantage of the benefits that come with it.\" Nope. The handsome have advantage over the ugly. The rich have advantage over the poor. The kind have an advantage over the rude. E. Conclusion: I would like to thank my opponent for his commendations. He calls my argument indirect. However, if there is no reason for marriage in general to be legal, then gay marriage would most definitely not be legal. In conclusion, there would be less government, more liberty, and less discrimination if marriage were not legal. Vote CON!",

            "premise": "Time for the final round-the rebuttal round. Firstly, you gave a few sources for why homosexuality is a choice. However they all seemed like opinion pieces, and when I brought that up, you didn't argue. Secondly, you claimed gays are pedophiles and animals, and you quickly tried to backtrack, saying \"where homosexuals are truly considered animals\", implying that you did not consider gay people animals. Yet you clearly said in your first argument \"sadly these animals are being protected\". And then you implied killing homosexuals, however, was that necessary? You also made some very extreme connections. You repeatedly compared being gay, that's loving someone, albeit of the same gender, to extreme actions. For example, you compared loving someone to murder, walking around naked, and illegal drug use. How do you make those connections? In your next argument, you said that \" with gay marriage comes more rights that homosexuals will demand\". What is bad about that? Why shouldn't gays have rights? Why can't they be served regardless of their sexuality? It seems unreasonable that they can't. And then you said many people would deny them because it goes against their beliefs. But when entering a store, one wouldn't randomly announce their sexuality. And the store clerk wouldn't ask \"What is your sexuality?\" so that they know whether they can serve them or not, that is intruding. The clerks would serve them anyways. So how is your argument valid? Also, people must accept the beliefs of others. While they may not approve of gay marriage, others must accept it. Finally, you keep on referencing gay rights, however the topic of this debate is \"Gay Marriage Should Be Legal\", we are just focusing on gay marriage. We can debate the topic of gay rights another time. Now, I said, that people cannot help their sexual orientation. As I already said, you tried to disclaim me by giving me a bunch of sources, however when I said that they were merely opinion pieces, you did not disagree. You made no comment at all. Then, I went on to say that people deserve, at least, their right to love, and therefore marry, whomever they want. And it doesn't matter it's not the social norm. You did not disagree to the point that people deserve the right to love, but you did try to rebut my point on being the social norm. However, I say, and said, that the way you tried to rebut this was by comparing it to other non-norms, like walking around half-naked, and illegal drug use. However, as I said earlier, the connections you made between people loving each other, and drug use is very abstract. And now, I shall leave it to the members of the DDO to decide who has won this debate. I have given you a lot to consider for why gay marriage should be legal. However, for all these reasons, I believe that gay marriage should be legal.",

            "premise": "Just because you call it 'marriage' doesn't make it actually marriage. Marriage is a covenant between a man and a woman, so gay marriage would actually, legally, not be marriage. It would even deny the specific primary purpose of marriage: the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children. Gay marriage always denies children a father or mother. \"It is in the child's best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother.\" Gay marriage actually created a naturally sterile union, instead of a family like how marriage between a man and woman should actually be. Gay marriage defeats the State's Purpose of Marriage. \"The State bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design, marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable, affectionate, and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children\"all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents. This aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society, an evident interest of the State.\" So gay 'marriage' doesn't provide the conditions. The primary purpose is the gratification personally of two people whose union is sterile by nature. For those who don't know, sterile means to not be able to produce children or young. By letting gay marriage be legal, the Stat becomes the official and active promoter. It calls on public officials to officiate at a new ceremony, and even orders public schools to teach the acceptability to children, and also \"punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval.\" Objecting parents would see their children exposed to more things about this new 'morality', because of businesses offering wedding services forcing them to provide them for gay or lesbian unions, and rental property owners would have to agree to accept gay or lesbian couples as tenants. \"In the 1960s, society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women. Today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same-sex \"marriage.\"\" \"The gay movement, whether we acknowledge it or not, is not a civil rights movement, not even a sexual liberation movement, but a moral revolution aimed at changing people's view of homosexuality.\" Sources: www.dictionary.com/browse/sterile https://www.researchgate.net... http://family.findlaw.com... https://www.tfpstudentaction.org...",

Marriage is only LEGAL between a man and woman, not to of the same sex.\" and that's why we're debating about Gay Marriage should be legal in the USA. \"That is an interesting argument, but that can be put under the marijuana religion. IS it really a religion, or just an excuse to smoke. It is really fake and don't be surprised if someone comes up with it.\" Yes it could be considered a religion under some people's eyes. \"Our founding fathers would have never allowed this. But it isn't just are founding fathers, up to JFK, all the presidents would have never allowed it.\" My opponent states that up to JFK which means all the presidents after would theoretically agree to it. Also that is why I am for Gay Marriage being legal because now we have evolved from the olden times before JFK where men and women weren't even equal or maybe all the way back where blacks and whites were seperated. \"Another thing is, the average person living from paycheck to paycheck, can only do one thing for human race: have a baby. That is the human life cycle; birth, reproduce, die. A gay couple cannot do that.\" Who says people have to reproduce, do people have to give birth to a child, even when a man and a woman marry are they forced to have a baby? To some of my points: if people want to marry other wo/men then let them why should we interfere with there personal concerns. Gay people are still people and should have all the rights that we have, religion, race, rights everything including marriage. Thank you for this debate it has been great, Hope to debate you again soon,",

Not arguing about the constitutionality or current legal status of same in America or any other country; just whether it SHOULD be legal. We are assuming that all humans have the same inherent rights, and that implementation is not an issue. I am approaching this debate from a centrist, authoritarian viewpoint, and will argue the CONVERSE. My opponent is welcome to argue any position he wants that AFFIRMS the proposition as stated. This is a philosophy debate; I don't have the time to dig out the most scholarly sources on this topic, and will not hold my opponent to a higher standard of research than myself. Wikipedia and a few online dictionaries/encyclopedias will have to suffice. Arguments begin R.2. Thanks again!",

            "premise": "Thank you for starting this debate, Freeman. First, we need a definition for \"legal\": \"Having a formal status derived from law often without a basis in actual fact\" [1] My argument will be that government should have no authority over marriage. Now, to address the contentions individually: Contention 1: The Harm Principle The central idea of my dismissal of this contention can be found in my opponent's quote, \"Any coherent argument against gay marriage that would leave these people to freely marry would be a masterpiece of political engineering.\" My argument is against the legalization of both gay marriages and straight marriages, so this entire contention has no purpose. Contention 2: The Utility Factor All things my opponent mentioned here do not even require government, with the exception of one: \"[I]t guarantees them the legal protections that other married people enjoy.\" However, if other married people no longer enjoy these legal protections, gays would no longer have anything to complain about. In fact, nobody would have any complaints about government and marriage whatsoever. A woman could marry a wall [2], and nobody would have any reason to oppose her. Contention 3: Gay marriage bans violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Now, in order to uphold the 14th amendment, we'd have to go further than granting marriage rights to gays. We'd have to grant them to pedophiles, people who wish to marry multiple people [3], people who wish to marry animals, people who wish to marry inanimate objects [2], and people who wish to marry abstract ideas. The simple solution is to have law no longer involved. No more discrimination. Contention 4: Gay marriage bans violate the due process clause of the 14th amendment. See above. Same problems, still gone. Now, for my own contentions against the resolution: Contention 1: It is illegal for marriage to be legal in the United States. Our beloved first amendment [4]: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\" Marriage was a religious institution before government decided to make laws respecting it [5]. Therefore, we must undo this illegal act by government by repealing all laws formally recognizing marriage of any kind. Contention 2: It is discriminatory for marriage to be legal in the United States. By giving benefits such as tax cuts to those who are married, the government puts those people above those who are not. This is obvious discrimination. By separating government from marriage, this discrimination will automatically vanish. Contention 3: The United States lacks the power to legalize gay marriage. According to the Tenth Amendment [4]: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" The power to legalize gay marriage rests not with the USFG, but with the individual states. As my opponent does not live in every state of the United States, he does not have a say in the governments of most states. Therefore, because the people of a state have decided that gay marriage should not be legal, gay marriage should not be legal in that state. In conclusion, gay marriage should not be legal in the United States, because it would be discriminatory, and it would involve too much government intervention where it is not needed. 1. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 2. http://www.ananova.com... 3. http://www.pro-polygamy.com... 4. http://www.archives.gov... 5. http://en.wikipedia.org...",

            "conclusion": "Gay marriage should be legal in the United States",
            "premise": "\"...something is not always legal until it is made illegal. In the second example, marriage as a legal union simply did not exist. An action can be considered legal until it is legislated otherwise, but something provided by the government, (in this case a marriage by law), does not exist until it is brought into existence by law.\"Allow me to start out by reintroducing the tenth amendment while defining the United States Constitution. According to the tenth amendment, \"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" (I won't bother sourcing this, since it has been sourced previously. United States Constitution: a document that outlines the basis of the federal (national) government of the USA [1]. Ultimately, my opponent is confusing legal and establishment, when he says elsewhere \"Because there are no laws pertaining to marriage in this situation. Legal marriage does not exist.\" According to Con, legal marriage is not established according to federal law, because federal law cannot establish it. I say that this does not mean it is neither legal or illegal, however, and this is because the Constitution does not mention it. If the Constitution restricted it, it would then be illegal. But since it does not restrict marriage, and thus passes on the powers of legal marriage to the states according to the tenth amendment, the Constitution permits it, making it legal according to the previously agreed upon definition: permitted by law. It does not establish it, but that does not mean it is not legal, since it does permit it. Since the federal government must abide by the Constitution, gay marriage is legal according to federal law, since it is legal according to the Constitution. Con will certainly disagree with me on this, and it is unfortunate that I am not be able to respond to his attempts to refute this argument. \"The resolution, interpreted using the agreed upon definitions, states that the federal government should legislate to make gay marriage legal. The choices states make concerning the definition of marriage is not a part of the resolution. The important part is that states are allowed to make that choice.\"Con's understanding of the resolution is incorrect. According to Con, \"My opponent has the BoP to show why the United States is obligated to make gay marriage legal.\" This does not mention any form of legislation; it can include legislation, but it does not have to. Instead of legislation, I have shown the USA should make gay marriage legal through the Constitution. In other words, above, I have shown that gay marriage technically already is legal in the United States. My previous arguments concerning whether or not the states can decide is technically irrelevant, but that is because I had an incomplete understanding of the resolution, one that already assumes that gay marriage is legal in the United States according to the Constitution, which means we will be arguing about whether or not the states have an obligation to allow gay marriage. My opponent seemed to have an understanding of the resolution that too seemed incorrect, because he figured it involved legislation; as I pointed out above, this was incorrect. \"My opponent chose not to answer the question because he felt it was not topical to the resolution. This question is absolutely relevant to the resolution. This is because if we are exploring redefining marriage, we must look at the possible precedents that it could set. Polygamy, as a comment on this debate pointed out, could become part of the definition of marriage because of the precedent set.I suspect the real reason for his response is that he simply did not wish to answer the question. Why might he choose this response?\"I have an explanation. I did not understand the context of the question, because there was not any context at all. It was just the question itself, not mentioning how it applied to precedent or anything. It was your responsibility to explain how the question applied to the resolution. Without context, I was unsure how it applied to the debate; I had ideas, but I did not know exactly. It was not my responsibility to provide context to the question. You, as you basically admit in round three, wanted to follow up with more arguments, which I shall address. The arguments was the context I was asking for. \"Let's say he chose to affirm the question and say that yes, if gay marriage can be a civil right, then polygamy too can be a civil right. In that case, he would have to defend polygamy because I could use a moral argument to show why polygamy was wrong and if gay marriage led to polygamy, this would be a morally wrong procedure.\"I don't necessarily see a problem with the legalization of polygamy, under the same precedent as gay marriage. States have the ability to define marriage as whatever they wish, as long as it is a legal contract between adults; thus, simply having marriage as a government institution would open the doors to polygamy. To argue that gay marriage would create precedent is not true. My opponent would have to argue that polygamy is immoral and that marriage should not be involved in government.\"I myself feel no reason to push for voters to vote one way or the other on conduct because I feel my argument are strong enough to win by themselves. I will, however, remind readers that my opponent has chosen to not respond to a question which I have shown to be directly related to the issue at hand.\"Well, I did not chose to respond to the question before he tried to show how it was relevant to the debate, as opposed to after. Here he is simply being dishonest, trying to make it look like I ignored the question that had context behind it. Once he put context behind the question, I addressed it. I should not be punished for questioning a different topic my opponent brought up without placing any sort of context. If anything, he should be at fault for not putting it in context of the debate. Summary:\"1. I proved that legal marriage does not exist until brought into existence by law.\"I have addressed how marriage is still legal, in that it is permitted by law, even if it is not established under federal law. \"2. I proved that marriage is not a civil right throughout the United States, because only some jurisdictions recognize marriage as both homo and heterosexual.\"I believe he meant to say that he proved gay marriage, not marriage, is not a civil right throughout the United States. In any case, I have already provided arguments why gay marriage should be included in the definition of marriage, which already is a civil right. \"3. I proved that my opponent is advocating for an unconstitutional action.\"I have refuted this.\"4. I proved that how states choose to define marriage is not important to the resolution.\"This was due to my misunderstanding of the resolution, something we are both guilty of, just in different ways.\"5. I proved that my unanswered question is relevant to the resolution, so it is my opponent, not I, who am drawing away from the resolution.\"I shall quote my previous rounds post: \"I am not at fault from drawing attention away from the debate in this instance because I am simply addressing a question asked of me as opposed to asking one myself. Likewise, my opponent shall not be at fault if he tries to explain why this question is relevant to the debate.\" I assume that Con had simply forgotten what I had said in my previous post, because he did not address it. It's an honest mistake, and he should not be penalized for drawing attention away from the debate with this part of his summary, and neither should I, because I was simply pointing to his honest mistake.I thank my opponent for the debate.

            "premise": "Let me thank Mongeese for not making this debate a carbon copy of the previous debates that have been done on Gay marriage. Your argument is both original and captivating. ======= Case Pro- Rebuttals ======= ---> \"My argument will be that government should have no authority over marriage.\" Marriage is a fundamental right of liberty. The United States Supreme Court has ruled this to be the case some 42 years ago. [1] Therefore my opponent's claim has no sort of standing legal precedent or logical basis whatsoever. ---> \"However, if other married people no longer enjoy these legal protections, gays would no longer have anything to complain about.\" No, society would still be facing the same problem at that point. Only this time even more people would have their basic rights taken away. ---> \"Now, in order to uphold the 14th amendment, we'd have to go further than granting marriage rights to gays. We'd have to grant them to pedophiles, people who wish to marry multiple people, people who wish to marry animals, people who wish to marry inanimate objects, and people who wish to marry abstract ideas.\" I must admit that I'm unused to facing slippery slope arguments about gay marriage that advocate for a walls right to marry. [2] Animals, walls, and abstract ideas aren't people with the legal rights associated with people. It would therefore be meaningless to speak of their right to marry or to get married. Contention 1: \"It is illegal for marriage to be legal in the United States.\" - mongeese There is nothing explicitly religious about the institution of marriage. In our modern secularized country anyone can get married in a courthouse without having religion ever involved in the matter whatsoever. [3] To claim that marriage is a religious institution is therefore false. It may have had its roots in religion at one point, although that would be a simplistic understanding, but that doesn't mean that it's a religious institution in our present society. Moreover, I have already shown you with my first source that the Supreme Court has ruled that marriage is a fundamental right to liberty. Indeed, it is legal for marriage to be legal. Contention 2: \"It is discriminatory for marriage to be legal in the United States.\" -mongeese This is an interesting argument, but completely irrelevant. It deals with the legal protections that should be afforded under marriage and says nothing of who should be able to marry. I will simply make the case that everyone should be allowed to marry even if we end up deciding that married people shouldn't receive tax cuts over single people. Moreover, the government has a vested interest in helping marriage via tax cuts and other measures, because functional marriages are necessary in order to promote social stability. With this in mind the removal of marriage would be likely to foster societal dysfunction. Marriage helps people collaborate on a common project and it gives children a safe environment in which to learn and grow. If you remove marriage by abolishing it you will deal a tremendous blow to the social, economic, and legal structure of modern civilization. Contention 3: \"The United States lacks the power to legalize gay marriage.\" -mongeese According to the Tenth Amendment [4]: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" I have already made a strong argument that the Constitution of the United Sates guarantees the right to gay marriage under the equal protection and due process clause of the 14th amendment. Therefore the people of the United Sates that have voted to ban gay marriage in their state can all go screw themselves. They don't have the necessary power to override the Constitution of the United Sates. And since this is the case it would follow that individual states could not prevent gay marriage because doing so would violate the 14th amendment of our constitution. ======= Conclusion: ======= My opponent's arguments are interesting and\u2026 well they're interesting. But they do not serve to refute any of my four arguments. And apart from a few slippery slopes and other fallacious contentions my opponent has not presented a compelling argument that gay marriage should be banned. Banning gay marriage is unconstitutional and since the United States Supreme Court has declared that marriage is a fundamental liberty it follows from this that gay marriage should be legalized.

            "premise": "Ok first of all I did not state any definition for marriage because the whole point of this debate is that we should be changing how society defines marriage. That is the definition as it stands the now but this debate is about changing the definition therefore your first point of rebuttal becomes irrelevant. For your second point of rebuttal, I was using my religious point as pre-emptive rebuttal for any religious arguments you may have brought up. The points are still relevant however because much of the stigma against gay people arises from religious beliefs. I have proved why these religious beliefs are no reason why the government should not recognise gay marriage to support basing my arguments around the separation of the church and the state. As for your third piece of rebuttal I will explain my point more clearly. Gay marriage not legal. Heterosexual marriage is legal. Government says gay marriage is wrong. Government says heterosexual marriage is right. Society believes gay marriage is wrong. Society believes heterosexual marriage is right. Society believes gay love is wrong. Society believes heterosexual love is right. Only a minority in society now still believe that gay marriage is wrong but the common belief that we had about gay marriage being wrong stemmed from the fact that the government would not allow it to happen. It is legally bad therefore it must be morally wrong. When the majority of people change this view because they disagree with the torture these people were being subjected to then they have the power to demand that the laws be changed which is where we are at the now. When the laws are changed and the government legalises gay marriage showing it is right then the minorities that still believe that gay marriage is wrong have no more reason to. This stigma will soon die out when that happens. It was the same with black people and women being given the same rights as white men. It takes time but the old views die out and it starts with the government accepting the minorities to have the same rights as the white males. Therefore societies views will change and it happens by the government legalising gay marriage. It has already been proven to work. \"You also fail to mention how legalizing gay marriage will benefit society as a whole. You only show how it will benefit the LGBT community.\" This is a very strange view indeed. Not only are the LGBT community part of our society, and a big part at that, I thought the rest was kind of obvious. I'll explain it then. Most people in society are classed under a minority (women, religious minorities, sexual minorities, ethnic minorities, disabled people). When one minority is still being attacked and marginalized it shows that society still cannot fully accept anyone who is not a healthy,straight,white male. This is bad for society as it gives more legitimacy to hate crimes and other acts that marginalize minorities thought to be accepted. When we get rid of this last piece of \"legal stigma\" society can then fully integrate. There is far less stigma overall. Less stigma in society leads to less unnecessary crimes. When we are no longer fighting each other we function far better on the whole as a society. I hope this explains it better for you. Also less young people feeling the need to commit suicide and take drugs is a massive benefit to the whole of society. I would also like to point out for the benefit of the readers and voters that the definition that you give for marriage is only part of the definition supplied on the website that you linked. Here is the full thing. \"(1) : the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law (2) : the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage \" The only difference here is that heterosexual marriage is \" recognized by law \" and homosexual marriage is not. That is what this debate is about. You so far have not provided any substantive points that prove that gay marriage should not be recognised by the law. Substantive To add to my case I will bring in one more point about international relations. 1. America is meant to be a world leading country. At the moment all we are proving to be are stubborn children. We believed it was wrong for centuries and even though we have absolutely no other reason to keep marginalizing these people we will do it anyway. This is one of the last big areas of stigma that our government still says is ok. By changing our laws to bring them into a 21st century world we tell the world that it is better to move forward. America is no longer a country that will marginalize minorities. It is no longer a country bases it's actions on out of date social beliefs. We can leave our past behind and form a properly integrated society. Our allies respect this change. Not only that but countries like Britain are more likely to move to change their own laws to legalise gay marriage. America becomes the driving force for political and social change. This improves our relations with our allies. Because gay marriage does benefit our society and it can lead to improvements in other societies gay marriage has to be legalised. Vote Pro. I look forward to hearing a stronger substantive case from Con.",

            "conclusion": "Gay Marrigae should be legal and gays should not be discriminated against",
            "premise": "1. AcceptanceI accept. I'd like to thank my opponent for creating this debate. I would note that I agree \"gays should not be discriminated against\". However, I do not think that they are discriminated against. As Con, I will be defending the idea that gay marriage should not be legal. I look forward to a good discussion!2. RebuttalI will begin by addressing my opponents opening statement, then I will move on to my own argument as to why gay marriage should not be legal.\"Homosexuals are people just like heterosexuals.\"I agree.\"They deserve the same rights.\"Again, I agree. It seems to me that they have the same rights.\"We are spending time money and energy fighting love.\"Who is \"we\"? I am certainly not spending any money or energy fighting love.\"It doesn't matter if you believe that it is right or wrong, it's still love.\"I agree, though I fail to see why this is relevant.\"People should not fear holding hands with the person they love, or kissing them in public.\"I don't see any reason why someone would hold this fear.\"This isn't gay rights, It's human rights.\"How original. Please provide evidence to support your implicit claim that a certain group of people are having their \"human rights\" violated. I can't argue with a case that hasn't yet been made.3. ArgumentBefore beginning my argument, it is essential to point out that my opponent is arguing in favor of \"gay\" marriage as opposed to \"same-sex\" marriage. There is a key difference, as we will see.In 1996, the United States Supreme Court\"s decision in the Romer v. Evans case prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. As a result of the finding that this sort of discrimination was unconstitutional, the United States government must be blind to sexual orientation (among other things) when enacting policy.But the concept of \"gay\" marriage proposes to do just the opposite. In the case of traditional marriage, the law is blind to sexual orientation. A heterosexual man is legally able to marry a heterosexual woman, a homosexual man is legally able to marry a heterosexual women, a heterosexual man is legally able to marry a homosexual woman, and a homosexual man is legally able to marry a homosexual woman. In no way does the traditional idea of marriage discriminate based on sexual orientation. This traditional idea is consistent with the 1996 Supreme Court ruling.In contrast, if \"gay\" marriage were to be enacted into law, it would mean that only homosexual (I'll use this term when referring to the orientation and the term \"gay\" when referring to the marriage idea) men and women would be allowed to be joined in a \"gay\" marriage with other homosexual men and women. This means that while a homosexual man would legally be able to marry a homosexual man, and a homosexual woman would legally be able to marry a homosexual woman, a heterosexual man would be prohibited from marrying another heterosexual man, and a heterosexual woman would be prohibited from marrying another heterosexual woman. The orientation-based discrimination in this case is clear. The idea of \"gay\" marriage would unconstitutionally discriminate against a heterosexually-oriented individual\"s right to the same type of marriage that would be given to a homosexually-oriented individual.Thus, by its very definition, \"gay marriage\" is inherently discriminatory.4. Summary I agreed with the majority of what my opponent had to say in his/her opening statement, but I saw no arguments or evidence in favor of his/her position that gay marriage ought to be legal. In contrast, I provided an argument that shows \"gay\" marriage is inherently discriminatory, as it would prohibit heterosexual males from marrying other heterosexual males and would prohibit heterosexual females from marrying other heterosexual females. This is the very reason why no one would dare try to enact a \"gay\" marriage law; the battle is instead over the idea of \"same-sex\" marriage, which is not what my opponent has chosen to defend in this debate. Thus, it seems to me that we have no reason to accept the assertion that gay marriage should be legal, whereas we have ample reason to think that gay marriage is discriminatory, and, therefore, ought not be legal.5.

            "premise": "First, let me say that I am only interested in debating those who are willing to devote sufficient time to complete this debate. If you think you might not be able to post your arguments within the allotted time, please don't bother. I will argue that gay marriage, the legal union between a same sex couple, should be allowed. Let me state that I also believe that \"civil unions\" exclusive to homosexual couples are not sufficient. The term \"civil union\" should either replace \"marriage\" entirely for both heterosexual and homosexual couples in terms of the actual legal contract (leaving marriage as a religious and philosophical term only), or the term \"marriage\" should be used for all. My first argument can be given in the form of a syllogism: 1. A man has the right to marry a woman. A woman has the right to marry a man. 2. Men and women should have equal rights. 3. Therefore, men should have the same right to marry men as women do and women should have the same right to marry women as men do. The second argument I will give here is a little more in depth. I believe that the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits any law against gay marriage. The 1st section 14th amendment reads as follows: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Laws against gay marriage clearly \"abridge the privileges\" of certain citizens. More specifically, that privilege is marriage and those citizens are those men and women who wish to marry those of the same sex. I have several other arguments, but I will first allow my opponent to speak.",

            "premise": "My Refutations What is marriage? What is the right to marry? Con first asserts that under the Constitution, Gays are not denied the right to marry under the one man one woman rule, but are denied the right to same sex marriage. However, my opponent merely states this without any evidence or source. He then explains how I described the benefits or marriage, but not what it was or what it was not. I believe at the beggining of the debate, I defined marriage as: a social union or legal contract between people called spouses that establishes rights and obligations between the spouses, between the spouses and their children, and between the spouses and their in-laws.[1] Therefore, the right to marriage is what is given in the definition. Now, I will prove that denying marriage is unconstitutional and refute Con's point. Recently, Calfornia Proposition 8 was ruled unconstitutional for reasons such as a violation of fundamental rights.[2] It also did not possess legal standing to defend the resulting law in federal court.[3] Therefore, governing bodies of the United States have already ruled some bans on gay marraige unconstitutional because of the Equal Protection clause and the 14th Amendment.Cons objections to my argumentsCon states yet again that my third contention is a non sequitur in support of SSM, and that people can share rights obligatons without entering a marriage. True, but as I mentioned before in the second round, civil unions aren't the same as marriage. They don't provide the same benefits as marriage. On average, the benefits civil unions are usually less generous then marriage in regards to taxes, health insurance and social security benefits.[4] An Iowa Court rejected civil unions because they don't satisfy equal treatment. The Iowa Supreme Court quotes: \"A new distinction based on sexual orientation would be equally suspect and difficult to square with the fundamental principles of equal protection embodied in our constitution.\"[5] Homosexuals should be able to share equal rights and obligations as heterosexuals through marriage.For my refutation of the brother and sister argument, Con asks: \"Why does the incest couple sexual attraction disquailty them from the right to marry but the gay couples same sex sexual attraction does not disquality them from the right to marry?\"As a response I say this: It's not just about sexuality, it's about the inbreeding impact. Children of these parents are prone to disorders and diseases due to inbreeding.[6] Mostly, it's for the safety of the children. I've shown that kids raised by gays can be healthy, but kids from incestual parents are not.Defining marriage as between a man & a womanFirst of all, Con needs to define what pro-creative in type means. He then states: \"It is not necessary for two people to produce children to be recognised as pro-creative in type.\" This basically means that if gays don't produce children, it can still be a pro-creative relationship. Con then states: \"This argument is given to justify the states interest in recognising a marriage IF and ony IF the marriage is procreative in type. A SSM does not satisfy this requirement.\"Yet again, Con needs to define what pro-creative in type means. He then states without any evidence or source, that SSM doesn't satisfy this requirement. However, I proved that homosexual males can adopt and lesbians can adopt or have artificial insemination. What exaxtly is your definition of procreate? Procreating is raising a new generation, and most Gays are looking to do this by adopting....[6]My Conception of MarriageI believe at the beggining of the debate, I defined marriage as: a social union or legal contract between people called spouses that establishes rights and obligations between the spouses, between the spouses and their children, and between the spouses and their in-laws. The rights and obligations part was the part I was stressing. I didn't just say the marriage was just about rights and obligations. I also mentioned the legitmate defintion of marriage in Round 1, and I described the legal aspects of marriage in Round 3. Do you call this vague? I desribed the entitled rights of marriage in Round 3, and obligations would be love and respect. In my third contention, all I did was shorten the defintion of marraige. Con then states meaningless semantical questions such as: \"Should the state recognize best friends forever as a marriage too ?\" Friends are not spouses that would be willing to share rights and obligations and raise children.My Arguments:Gays raising kidsAccepted by Con.Marriage is a Constitutional RightCon has no evidence that it's not, while I do. According to Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: Justice Kennedy, \" \u201cThe federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and injure those whom the state, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity,\u201d \u201cBy seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d[7] Banning Gay marriage violates a number of Amendments and the Constitution. Hence, this has resulted in the abolishment of California Proposition 8. Morgan Freeman's voice: Therefore, Marriage is Constitutional right upheld by the 14th and 5th Amendement. Not only is it granted by the Constitution, but is granted through the Universal Decleration of Human Rights.[8]Two people who love and respect one another should be able to share rights and obligations equal to heterosexualsBy rights, I mean \"the right to favorable treatment in tax, inheritance, insurance status, immigration rights, adoption and custody, decisional and visitation rights in healthcare and burial\". By obligations, I mean love and respect i.e. not cheating. I don't think this is vague as Con asserts. In conclusion, two consenting homosexual adults should be able to share rights and obligations through marriage. Hence, guaranteeing them rights equal to heterosexuals. If gays benefit society just as much as heterosexuals, they should be able to get married.Conclusion: 1. Pro's one and only contention is quite vague and ultimately fails since gays can procreate.2. Banning gay marriage has already been deemed unconstitutional by some Courts.3. Homosexual marriage benefits American society and International society through adoption.I thank Illegalcombatant for an excellent debate!Sources: http://en.wikipedia.org... [1]http://www.cato.org...

Every day people are scared to come out because they are afraid of being judged but if society were more accepting, we could make it easier for them. Now for those of you concerned with RELIGIOUS REASONS, listen up. There is a separation of church and state. Religious perspective should have no place in federal or legal matters in the US. And for people offended by gay marriage, tell me how exactly is gay marriage affecting you. Gay marriage has had no impact whatsoever on heterosexual communities. Let's also remember that this is an issue of EQUAL RIGHTS. Denying marriage to two individuals who love each other is to deny them a fundamental freedom. There is no reason to deny gay marriage other than religion (still not a good reason though), but as I have already said - church stays out of state (separation of church and state).",

I will present 2 reasons why i revised my stand on Gay marriage. 1.A marriage is not only a social institution, but a legal one.I completely agree that an individual's sexual orientation is none of the Government 's business.But marriage as a legal institution exists to promote stable traditional marriage, which is in the interest of the state as it will provide a stable environment for the growth and production of future citizens.Gay marriage cannot do both as the members in a gay marriage cannot produce children of their own. The state spends a LOT of money and resources in settling disputes. This was justified because of the benefit it provided for the society as a whole through children. I don't see why taxpayers should shell out their funds to protect Gay marriage. 2. the Morality: this argument goes something like this: 1.It is morally correct to use organs given to us for the purpose for which they were intended(eg. One must only use one's eye to see, deforming it willfully to look 'cool' would be morally wrong) 2.it is evident that sexual organs were intended for reproduction. To misuse them solely for pleasure would be morally wrong. i am *not* saying that homosexuality should be banned.I assert that a person's sexual orientation is strictly none of the government's business.But just because it should be legally tolerated does not mean that it is morally right.Just like pornography, alcohol and cigarettes, they are nothing but an unwanted consequence of having freedom of expression.It is not in the interest of the state to promote these things. If you want i can give you the catholic apologetic reasons that really convinced me, but you should be willing to accept christian doctrinal arguments. please clarify your stand if you are interested in this debate.",

            "conclusion": "Gay-marriage should not be legal in the US",
            "premise": "Thank you, Jenx, for accepting this debate challenge.What Marriage IsWhat's the reason for a country to create a law about something? Why does it do it? The answer is simple. A country creates a law because that law will benefit the society as a whole. Does and can gay-marriage benefit the society as a whole? No, because gays cannot procreate. Hetersexual marriages is the only marriages which can continue our society by procreation. Marriage is by nature oriented to procreation. It is procreation which is the sole purpose behind marriage, and marriage is incomplete without it.Now, why should the US legalize gay-marriage or at all have an interest on it? What does the society as a whole benefit from legalizing gay-marriage? The fact of the matter is that society as a whole is benefited from the union of a male and a female in ways that are not valid for two persons of the same sex, because only heterosexuals are capable of procreation. Gays are not capable of procreation, and gay-marriage becomes therefore very useless for the society and for the state. Procreative marriages is essential, important and necessary for the production of future citizens and therefore the continuation of the society. Indeed, this is the very reason why the state at all has an interest in marriage. Calling something marriage or just writte under a 'contract' that you are married, does not make it marriage. Marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and well being of the spouses.[1] This is what real marriage is, and gay-marriages goes completely against it. Girgis, George and Anderson, the authors of \u201cWhat is Marriage?\u201d, nicely explains what marriage actually is:'Marriage is the union of a man and a woman who make a permanent and exclusive commitment to each other of the type that is naturally (inherently) fulfilled by bearing and rearing children together. The spouses seal (consummate) and renew their union by conjugal acts\u2014acts that constitute the behavioral part of the process of reproduction, thus uniting them as a reproductive unit. Marriage is valuable in itself, but its inherent orientation to the bearing and rearing of children contributes to its distinctive structure, including norms of monogamy and fidelity. This link to the welfare of children also helps explain why marriage is important to the common good and why the state should recognize and regulate it.' [2]This view of marriage is called the 'Conjugal view' or the 'Traditional view'. Indeed, this the most rational view of marriage.But wait! What About The Revisionist View of Marriage?The Revisionist view of marriage is that marriage is about love and not procreation. This view however is simply just false. Those who say that marriage is about love and not procreation have completely misunderstood what marriage is and why it is regulated by the state.If marriage was merely about love, then what are the state's interests in recognizing it to begin with? And if marriage is about love and not procreation, then what reasons is it for the US to not allow other relationships like for example friendships, few peple wanting to marry each other, or even people who wants to marry an animal because he/she loves it? Very little. In fact, 'love-marriages' can be used to justify all sorts of relationships. However, in nature and in the governments eyes, marriage is to create a procreating type relationship that enables the continuation for the society. Only heterosexuals can create this kind of relationship. This is indeed the most rational form of relationship marriages, and there is no rational reasons as to why the state should have an interest on any other forms of relationship marriages, like for example 'love marriages' which can be used to justify all sorts of relationships, and which doesn't benefit the society as a whole.The truth is that the government doesn't care about love, and marriage is not about love. Of course, love is a important part of marriage. However, it's not the sole porpuse behind marriage. Procreation is. This is why the state at all has an interest in regulating marriage, because it recognizes that procreative marriages is essential, important and necessary for the production of future citizens and therefore the continuation of the society.Gay-Marriage and EqualityAccording to many proponents of gay-marriage, not legalizing gay-marriage deprives homosexuals of their equal rights, and it also goes against the idea of equality (i.e., All humans are equal and should have the same equal rights etc).However, equality has very little to do with this. The real sake of the matter is mainly and fundamentally over what marriage is. Sherif Girgis, Robert P. George, and Ryan T. Anderson says: \"Any legal system that distinguishes marriage from other, nonmarital forms of association, romantic or not, will justly exclude some kinds of union from recognition. So before we can conclude that denying homosexuals to marry each other violates the idea of equality and deprives their equal rights, or any other moral or constitutional principle, we have to determine what marriage actually is and why it should be recognized legally in the first place. That will establish which criteria are relevant, and which are irrelevant to a policy that aims to recognize real marriages. So it will establish when, if ever, it is a marriage that is being denied legal recognition, and when it is something else that is being excluded.\" [3]So you cannot argue that gay-marriage should be legal because of \"equality,\" unless you first establish what marriage actually is. And as I have said earlier, marriage is a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered towards the procreation and education of children and the unity and well being of the spouses. Thus, since the nature of marriage is that gay relationships cannot qualify as marriages to begin with, there is no discrimination against them or their 'equal rights'. ConclusionGay-marriage cannot benefit the society as a whole, because they cannot procreate. It is basically useless for the state and the society, just like for example friendship relationships. Moreover, gay-marriage goes against what marriage actually is. Namely, the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children. In the words of Girgis, George and Anderson:'Same\u2010sex partnerships, whatever their moral status, cannot be marriages because they lack any essential orientation to children: They cannot be sealed by the procreative act.' [2]There are also no compelling reasons as to why the state should have interest on gay-marriage or recognize it - or at least legalize it. Thus, the US should not legalize gay-marriage. Now, Con must do these three things in order to successfully refute my argument:1) Give us a compelling reason as to why gay-marriage should be legalized, and why the state should at all have an interest in recognizing and legalizing it. 2) Show us that there are rational reasons as to why a person should marry another person of the same sex.3) Show us that my definition of marriage is wrong, and that my definition of marriage is not why the US at all has an interest in marriage. Namely, because of the continuation of our race and society by procreation, and because of the rearing of children which only heterosexuals can naturally create.The US ought to not legalize marriages which goes against what marriage really is, and the state is justified in recognizing only real marriages. Indeed, the resolution is for now affirmed: Gay-marriage should not be legal in the US Sources[1] http://www.tfpstudentaction.org...[2] http://www.peter-ould.net...[3] http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com...;",

            "conclusion": "Gay Marriage should be 100% legal",
            "premise": "First off I would like to thank my opponent for starting this important and controversial. Responding to one of his comments, despite my age I think we can still have a very good debate. I also find it very interesting that we have the same name and live about 10-15 minutes apart out of pure coincidence. Now, on to my rebuttals which will be followed by my own arguments. Indeed, all men are created equal and are granted our life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And those are granted to all of us. Our country was founded on the declaration of independence that is correct that actually is not news to me or our viewers I am sure. But one man's pursuit of happiness cannot disregard or overpower the happiness of the majority of the population (that is against it). My opponent states \"If all men are created equal, doesn't that mean that we shouldn't judge based on things such as sexual orientation?\" People are free to think or \"judge\" however they want about sexual orientation, that comes with the freedom of speech that you so blatantly pointed out. Regardless of why individual people are against gay marriage, it is their right like you said. \"Liberty is obviously a blanket category for many things, but you should have the liberty to marry who you want.\" You can in fact marry whoever you want, as long as it follows the definition of marriage which states \"the legal or religious ceremony that formalizes the decision of a man and woman to live as husband and wife, including the accompanying social festivities: to officiate at a marriage.\" -http://dictionary.reference.com... And of course the restrictions preventing pedophilia, polygamy, incest, and homosexual marriage. Because marriage between a man and another man is simply not marriage, because marriage was created for a man and a woman. \"Obviously if it makes you happy to inject a shot of heroin three times a day and then go out and rape a few people, that is kind of a no-no. But the difference of one chromosome really doesn't seem like such a big deal.\" Who are you to tell the entire population that one chromosome doesn't seem like such a big deal? What does not seem like a big deal to you may in fact be a big deal to other people. Should we be able to marry Chimpanzees because of our chromosomal similarities? Because that is also wrong. The thing is, is there are countless laws that prevent our pursuit of happiness, if we allow gay marriage, we might as well abolish the rest of those said laws, from what your argument suggest anyhow. Which would result in chaos might i add. \"People will start wanting to marry more than one person. Or animals. Or inanimate objects. Or little children. Well, technically yes, and technically I could care less about the first three. The people may be wackos, but this is America. We have Michael Jackson. Wackos are allowed. The fourth, marry a small child, that is different, because of the age of consent (again, I am fairly against that as well, but that is a different debate).\" First off, you may care less about those wants but many people would disagree. This is indeed America, but \"wackos\" are not allowed, if they were the United states would be in chaos. Our court system attempts to prosecute those \"wackos\" in a fair manner, which will not always result in punishment due to our innocent until proven guilty law. Allowing these wackos free reign over our under aged, animals, deceased, inanimate objects, is simply balderdash, and wrong, and would result in exponential growth of abuse. We cannot allow such atrocities because of \"Michael Jackson\" But your idea of pursuit of happiness, as well as the rest of your arguments support the idea of legalizing pedophilia, zoophilia, necrophilia, polygamy and such wrong perversions. Please tell me why we should legalize same sex marriages, with an argument that would not suggest these said perversions. But, from your previous arguments you suggest they should all be legalized. Which would not only diminish the meaning of marriage but would also result in a sexual perversion driven society. \"2) The Bible (aka the law book of America... Wait... that's not right) says it's a big no-no. As I said, the Bible is a religious thing. America enjoys a separation of Church and state.\" Yes, we do. We enjoy a government which is not controlled by the church, which is what separation of church and state is. But the thing is, is that marriage is a religious ceremony. The church is not in control over whether or not gay marriage is legal, the government is. Our government is a democracy, which i will point out the obvious means that the people decide. So why should it be legal when a majority of our population is against said gay marriages? \"3) Well yes, the bible is a religious thing, but marriage is a religious ceremony. Usually, but not always. I am atheist. Does that mean I can't get married? I'm technically also Jewish. Does that mean I could have a gay marriage if I wanted one (not that I do).\" You can get married. No that does not mean you could have a gay marriage since you are Jewish. sorry. \"4) Marriage is only for children. Well, this is the only one that makes any sense to me; however, does that mean that infertile people should not be able to marry? And birth control and condoms can go away. First of all, teen pregnancies would go through the roof. Back to the topic, you can't single out one group, and when you include everyone applicable, it doesn't always seem like such a good idea. Sorry.\" Since when is marriage only for children might i ask? Last time i checked under aged children cannot get married unless accompanied by the consent of the guardians of both proposed. Nobody is singling out a single group, are you forgetting all of the restrictions we have both explained? Gays are not alone, I could be in love with my dog, my sister, my dead grandma, 6 different legal woman, a 13 year old girl (assuming i was over 18) and i would not be able to marry any of them accept for one of those legal females, but how could i pick? There are 6 of them! That's not fair right? No it is fair, since we all have the same rights. \"I myself am not gay, but I would like to see gays have rights, liberties, and the same opportunity as we heterosexuals do to pursue happiness.\" Gays do in fact have the same rights, liberties and opportunity at happiness as us heterosexuals have. Your turn.",

If that is what they want to do with their life let them, it is not some big crime that they are commiting. Also if people have freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion and petition why can't they have freedom of marriage. Theoretically gay marriage could be put under freedom of religion so why not just let them marry who ever they want to. If they really do love another wo/man and both agree why should we stop them? There shouldn't be any law saying that there can be no gay marriage. Thank you for joining this debate,",

            "conclusion": "Gay-marriage should not be legal in the US",
            "premise": "My opponent has, for one or another reason, disappointingly and unfortunately forfeited her second round. If I had known that she would just forfeit, I wouldn't have challenged her to this debate in the first place. Anyway, I extend my arguments and hope that she comes back and engages in what is left of this debate.Now, since Con forfeited her second round, I would like to use this round to refute two common arguments made by gay-marriage proponents. These two arguments comes from the idea of \u201crights\u201d and are used many times to support the belief that gay-marriage should be legal in the US. However, as we will now see, both of these arguments are failures. 1) Marriage is a fundamental human rightThis argument is merely a question-begging because it does not justify and successfully answer this question: What marriage is and why it is recognized legally. Moreover, proponents of this argument must also answer and justify how gay-marriage is fundamental human right, and why gay-marriage is a fundamental human right.I agree that marriage is a fundamental human right, but I however strongly disagree that gay-marriage is a fundamental human right. Why? Because it goes against what the term \u201dmarriage\u201d really means and really is. You cannot argue that gay-marriage is a fundamental \u201dhuman right\u201d, unless you first establish what marriage actually is. And again, since the nature of marriage is that gay relationships cannot qualify as marriages to begin with, it can't be said that gay-marriage is a fundamental \u201dhuman right\u201d. Maybe heterosexual marriages is but not gay-marriages, because gay-marriages goes against what marriage actually is and why it is at all recognized legally by the state. The goal of marriage is the continuation of the society (procreation). Only heterosexual marriages fulfil this goal. Gay-marriages do not.2) Not legalizing gay-marriage deprives homosexuals of their rightsAccording to many proponents of gay-marriage, not legalizing gay-marriage deprives homosexuals of their \u201drights\u201d. First, this argument is also merely a question-begging because it does not justify and successfully answer this question: What marriage is and why it is recognized legally. Again, you cannot argue that gay-marriage should be legal because not legalizing it deprives homosexuals of their \u201drights\u201d, unless you first establish what marriage actually is. And again, since the nature of marriage is that gay relationships cannot qualify as marriages to begin with, it can't be said that not legalizing gay-marriage deprives homosexuals of their \u201drights\u201d. Just like it can't, for example, be said that not allowing me to become the president of the United States deprives my \u201drights\u201d. To say that would be illogical since I don't qualify as the president of the United States to begin with. Thus, no \u201crights\u201c are being deprived from me by not allowing me to become the president of the United States.Secondly, proponents of this argument must also successfully answer: 1) How gay-marriage is a \u201cright\u201c.2) Why gay-marriage is a \u201cright\u201c.3) And why gays should be given this \u201cright\u201c to marry each other in the first place.If these three questions isn't successfully answered, then what rights is the homosexuals deprived of? You can't say that someone is deprived of their rights when those rights doesn't even exist. So proponents of this argument must first prove that such a \u201cright\u201c even exist.This argument is simply just assuming that gay-marriage is a \u201cright\u201c of the homosexuals without first proving that such a \u201cright\u201c even exist. Moreover, marriage is a union between a man and a woman. Thus, there is no discrimination against gays and no rights are being deprived from them, because \u201cgay-marriage\u201c doesn't exist and because the nature of marriage is that gay relationships cannot qualify as marriages to begin with. In order to claim that gays are deprived of their \u201crights\u201c by not allowing them to marry, you have to first change the meaning of \u201cmarriage\u201c to include a relationship between two males too. However, what are the state's interests in recognizing and legalizing a relationship such as a \u201ctwo males relationship\u201c as marriage to begin with? What does the society as a whole benefit from doing that? Very little. And again, marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and well being of the spouses. This is the very reason why the state at all has an interest in marriage, because it recognises that procreative marriages is essential, important and necessary for the production of future citizens and therefore the continuation of the society.It is now Con's job to prove that this view of marriage is wrong in order to successfully change the meaning of \u201cmarriage\u201c to include a relationship between two males too, because according to my view of marriage (which is called the \u201cConjugal view\u201c or the \u201cTraditional view\u201c of marriage) gay relationships cannot qualify as real marriages to begin with. Thus, to say that not legalizing gay-marriage deprives homosexuals of their \u201crights\u201c, is absurd and invalid. Well, until Con have refuted the \u201cConjugal view\u201c or the \u201cTraditional view\u201c of marriage and given us a rational reason as to why we should believe in another view of marriage, and why the US should at all have an interest in recognizing and legalizing marriages in accordance to that view. We have already seen that the revisionist view of marriage is illogical, invalid, and cannot in any way be better or more rational than the \u201cConjugal view\u201c or the \u201cTraditional view\u201c of marriage. And nor can the revisionist view of marriage be considered a good reason as to why the US at all should have an interest in recognising and legalizing gay-marriage.ConclusionAll my arguments stands completely unrefuted and Con have not given even one reason/argument as to why gay-marriage should be legal in the US.The resolution remains affirmed: Gay-marriage should not be legal in the US",

            "premise": "It's clear at this point that there's not much room for optimism when it comes to winning this debate for me. Nonetheless, I have found a couple things to rebut in your argument. Quite honestly, however, they're more paralogies than anything. Notwithstanding that, I've taken it upon myself to argue this side of the debate and will carry forth with the self-assigned duty.Punctual ParalogyMy opponent declares that I misinterpreted his argument. If no harm is to come, and many want it, then let it be. There is harm in genocide. Thusly, there is a reason against genocide. However, \"there is no reason against such legalization (of gay marriage).\"Fifty three percent.But with my emphasis on the majority being made, whether Active or Silent, as well as my statement that \"When a contradiction within our beliefs is created, then the stronger of the contradiction must prevail,\" we should remember that Fifty four percent don't want anymore laws at all. I made this argument before, and my opponent asserted that the majority may not matter as reducing the amount of laws, or keeping them the way they are, could be harmful. Being that we both agree that the rights should be the same for both homosexuals and otherwise, it would mean reducing laws.This implies that my opponent is saying that privatizing marriage would cause more harm than good. The majority want privatized marriage. So, at this point, it seems like my job is to refute the harms of privatizing marriage, to make it seem as harmless as gay marriage, meaning it would be preferable as more people want it.Wikipedia's listed some flaws.[1] However, I'll merely be focusing on the ones with citations. Robert George argues (it's worthy to note that he's against private and gay marriage) that marriage is \"profound\" and should therefore be monitored by the state.[2] To go further, he asserts that marriage should be between a \"husband and wife\" to teach people their \"rightful place in society.\" I think it's safe to say that as he's against both sides of this debate, that neither of us can agree that this is a sound reason against privatization.That's the only source cited that works and is on the internet, so the rest will be what Wikipedia claims they said.Richard Mohler says privatizing marriage would disallow the government's ruling of an ethical marriage, while we, as the People, would be unethical due to the fact that the \"markets do not always encourage or support moral behavior.\" We're incapable of being ethical without the government, and therefore must be regulated. This is ignoring the majority again, even though the majority is not causing harm. This isn't genocide. This is just wanting to have loving relationships with a single partner in matrimony of their own terms.There is no good reason against simply not making marriage a part of the legal system altogether. My opponent wants equal rights for homosexuals and otherwise in terms of marriage. My side offers that. My opponent wants the People to get what they want. My side offers that. My opponent likes to write stories, apparently. I enjoyed that.Finally, it seems that, to keep things fair in general, this has become more an argument of privatizing marriage. Gay marriage shouldn't be legalized to equalize things as a conventional, heterosexual marriage shouldn't be interfered with through the legal system to begin with.It's also worth noting that my side is easier to accomplish. To create equal rights for all marriage, we can make every kind of marriage legal with its own set of rules: Straight marriage; Gay marriage; Polygamous marriage; Interspecies marriage. Things could get hectic.My side simply removes one system. The regulation of the only type of marriage that's managed to be legalized.Also, due to the lack of time, I won't be able to revise and edit. That will be an explanation for any glaring mistakes in my citing and such. http://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.catholicnewsagency.com...",

            "premise": "I apologize for having to make these arguments that my opponent will not have a chance to respond to. Unfortunately, because of the change in arguments on the last round on his part, I am forced to do this.If, like Pro has said, gay marriage is currently legal as part of United States federal law, then I have the BoP to prove why the law should be changed so that gay marriage is not legal. If, however, I can prove that legal gay marriage is not currently part of federal law, then Pro would have the BoP to prove why the law should be changed. In this round I will show how gay marriage is not legal under federal law. The other option my opponent has argued for in the previous round is that the Constitution should be changed to make sure that gay marriage is legal if I can prove that it is not already. Because he bears the BoP in this case, I contend that he has not provided good enough reason to take this power from the states. So at this point all I must do in order to win this debate is to prove that gay marriage is not currently legal.Legal in the United States was accepted at the beginning of the debate as federal law. The definition of federal law which was included in that definition is: \" the supreme law of the land.\"If legal gay marriage was the supreme law of the land in the United States, then all states would be required to allow gay marriage. Obviously states do not have to make gay marriage legal according to the tenth amendment. The tenth amendment does not make marriage legal. Instead, it defers this power to the states. So it is legal for the states to make gay marriage legal. It is also legal for the states to make gay marriage illegal. So gay marriage is not legal in the United States which would mean that it was the supreme law of the land. What is legal is for states to decide.So although it is permitted by law, the agreed upon definition of legal, it is not federal law, the more recent agreed upon definition of legal in the United States.Conclusion: Same sex marriage is not currently legal in the United States under federal law.Same sex marriage is only a civil right in some jurisdictions in the United States.My opponent has not provided a substantial reason why the states should not be allowed to maintain the power to decide for themselves.Therefore, I have fulfilled my BoP by showing that my opponent did not fulfill his.I would like to thank my opponent for this interesting debate.",

            "premise": "Part One: Right of Choice The biggest problem with your first argument is this statement \"In this case, since there should be a freedom of choice, gay marriage should be legal.\" You are not only claiming that gay marriage should be legal, but you are arguing that it should be legal because there should be a freedom of choice. First you must argue for a freedom of choice before you argue for gay marriage. Then it is argued \"for people who prefer living with someone of the same-sex who they love, if gay marriage is illegal where they live, they often have a mentally tough and challenging time choosing between marrying someone of the opposite sex, or not marrying at all.\" This is may be true (no evidence was presented), but when making a decision about making something legal, it is important to think about the society as a whole and not just about the 2% of the population that are homosexual. Homosexuality is actually dangerous to the society as a whole. It spreads disease, there are higher sexual molestation rates among them. And by the way, the arguments my opponent has used could literally be used to support \"voyeurism, necrophilia, bestiality, polygamy, incest, exhibitionism, fetishes, frotterism, masochism, sadism, etc.? (https://carm.org......). Homosexuality is dangerous whether people want to admit it or not. Link: exodusglobalalliance.org/ishomosexualityhealthyp60.php Part Two: Right to Love It was then said that \"Secondly, there is a right to love. No one can stop you from mentally loving someone.\" No actually, there is no right to love. My opponent hasn't even defined love yet so this whole argument is somewhat meaningless. And it doesn't seem like the majority of the homosexual community actually knows what love is (1 Cor 13 is my definition of love). Statistics show that \"83% of the homosexual men surveyed estimated they had had sex with 50 or more partners in their lifetime, 43% estimated they had sex with 500 or more partners; 28% with 1,000 or more partners.\" Doesn't sound like love to me. See link above for the evidence of this fact. And just out of curiosity...do you think I should have special rights because I am a Christian? Part Three: This is your Life It was then said that \"Lastly, this is your life. A person has a life, with their own body.\" My response to that is who says? Prove that statement and don't just keep asserting things without any justification. What gives a person the right to do whatever they want? But the most disturbing statement made was this: \"Part of what you have to do to legalize gay marriage, is to temporarily accept the world without judgment, so that you can vision these perspectives.\" As a Christian I know that homosexuality is a sin and what you are asking me to do is to completely ignore my moral values to give the minority special privileges. And the worse part is that I know that homosexuality will cause harm to society but you want me to completely remove my knowledge of these matters merely because you believe they should have rights. I don't think so. I thank my opponent for creating this debate and I look forward to see how things turn out.",

            "premise": "I will begin this round by pointing out that my opponent provides no evidence for his assertion that gay marriage is a civil right. Because there is no evidence for the claim, it will not be accepted as true. I will continue by quoting my opponent: \u201cMarriage is outside the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction, according to the tenth amendment: \u2018The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u2019\u201d My opponent\u2019s quote shows that marriage is an issue for the states to handle, not the federal government. Because the resolution calls for gay marriage to be legal in the United States, and legal in the United States has been accepted to mean federal law, my opponent has himself acknowledged that it is not within the power of the United States to put the resolution into effect. He also says that \u201cWhile the federal government should have no say in the gay marriage issue, making the federal government unable to ban gay marriage itself unless through an amendment to the constitution.\u201d The federal government is unable to ban gay marriage, likewise, it is not able to legalize it. Thirdly, Section 2 of the Defense of Marriage Act states: \u201cNo State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship\u201d [1]. This law means that it is up to each state to determine how it wishes to define marriage, and states do not have to accept the same sex marriages of other states. If a state decides to define marriage as an act between a man and a woman, then all laws on marriage only apply to heterosexual marriages. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law [2]. If the law states that marriage is for heterosexual couples, then all that is required is that all heterosexual couples are allowed to take advantage of those laws. My opponent has said \u201cSince there are thousands of laws pertaining to marriage, gay couples should also be protected in their right to marry under state law.\u201d I have shown in this round that because some of these many laws occur in states that have defined marriage as applying to heterosexual couples, homosexual couples are not protected under these laws. I have also shown in this round that not only is the United States not obligated to make gay marriage legal, it is unable to do so based on the agreed upon definitions.

            "conclusion": "Gay Marriage",
            "premise": "I would like to begin by thanking my opponent for thanking me for thanking him for accepting this debate. In this round I will address the definitions, then offer some rebuttals to Con\u2019s case, and finally I will defend my case against his attacks. Definitions There does seem to be a bit of a disagreement on what \u201cin the United States\u201d should mean. Con argued that it ought to mean the federal level of government, I argued that it should merely mean any specific jurisdiction, but rather any level of government, be it municipal, state, or federal. In the end it is up to the voters, but I will point out that Con has not offered a reason why \u201cin the United States\u201d implies federal government, and not any jurisdiction within the United States. The other possible area of disagreement is whether marriage ought to constitute a legal union, or merely a social one. Con has not offered a reason to think marriage is not a legal union. It does not make sense for this debate to center around a purely social union, because that sort of union is already allowed to occur without government recognition. Even if we determine marriage is a social union, he has not offered a reason that such a union should not be legal. CON CASE He begins by saying that legalizing gay marriage gives the federal government authority to redefine marriage to include homosexual couples. To begin with, marriage was already defined by the federal government to exclude gay couples and I have presented reasons why marriage should be made legal for heterosexual couples. Since the government defined what constitutes a legal union in the first place, they have the authority to change that definition. A1: Government should not be allowed to define personal relationships. The beginning of his case illustrates the flaw at the heart of my opponent\u2019s argument. This flaw is the difference between a purely social union without legal implications, and a legal union that has legal effects. Con argues that marriage ought to be a purely social institution, and the government should not be involved at all. I disagree with that notion (more on that in a minute), but it should be noted that even if we allow marriage to be free of government regulation, my argument still stands that gay people should be allowed to get married. My opponent really offers no strong opposition to the ideas of gay couples receiving equal marriage rights, he simply argues that marriage should not be controlled by the government. At this point I do not even need to disagree with my opponent\u2019s first two arguments in order to win, but I will address them anyway. He says that we are allowing the government to define personal relationships, but that is not really what occurs. What occurs is government recognition of an already existing relationship that allows a couple to receive certain benefits through legal recognition of their union. These benefits include such things as inheritance rights, the ability to visit a sick spouse in the hospital beyond visiting etc [1]. If marriage were not a legal institution, spouses would not be legally recognized as a family member of their partner. A comprehensive list of legal benefits resulting from marriage is available at the source I previously cited. Not only have I explained why marriage should be a legal institution, I have shown that if marriage were not a legal institution, gay people would be allowed to get married and the resolution would be affirmed! A2: Marriage would benefit all parties involved more if it were a strictly private institution. My opponent states that we ought to have contracts setting up the terms if a marriage were to terminate, however a contract is a legal document. This is basically what legal unions boil down to: a type of contract that is recognized by the government as signifying the legal joining of two unrelated people as family. Even though his point is irrelevant to gay people being allowed to get married, as his scenario would affirm the resolution, he is arguing for a legal contract recognizing a couples, which is basically what exists right now. A3: Gay marriage is simply a concession of defeat for the gay community. Here it is argued that rather than pushing for equality in marriage, gay couples should push for the abolishment of legal marriages period. I have already shown why legal unions are important, but if the gay community did push for no government recognized marriage at all, they would still be able to have marriages, and the resolution would be affirmed. I have shown that legally recognized marriage is important, but even if all of Con\u2019s points were true, the resolution would be affirmed. PRO CASE C1: Legalizing same-sex marriage has a positive impact on society. Here my opponent attempts to undermine my conclusion by launching two weak and unfounded attacks on my premises. His attack on my first premise does not even address the premise. He writes: \u201cP1 only legitimizes an immoral institution, which causes harm further down the road, not only for individuals that want to get married w/o meeting the criteria set by government, but for individuals that find themselves subject to other arbitrary standards set by a far away government.\u201d He talks a great deal about marriage, but P1 does not concern marriage in the least. P1 states: Legalizing something causes happiness without causing harm has a positive impact on society. It is easy to see that his attack does not come close to dismantling this premise as he has not offered any reason why something that causes happiness without causing harm would not be a good thing. P1 stands with virtually no challenge to it at all. The argument against P2 also misses the mark, as his \u201calternative\u201d would still allow for gay people to get married, and this would not harm anyone. P2 stands with no challenge as well. P1 stands, P2 stands, therefore, C1 stands. C2: Denying same-sex couples legally recognized marriage is a violation of civil rights. I agree with my opponent that \u201cIf government were not involved in marriage, there would be no violation of civil rights, because everyone would be free to set their own terms for marriage.\u201d However, I have shown that marriage ought to be a legally recognized union, and even if it were not, the resolution would still be affirmed. C3: Legalizing same-sex marriage is beneficial to the economy. My opponent concedes that marriage is good for the economy, but says that marriage does not have to be recognized by law for celebrations to take place. I agree, but if a marriage had a legal weight, that would encourage more people to get married. There are same-sex couples that could be having celebrations recognizing their relationships, but they don\u2019t because they would not be receiving the legal benefits that are awarded to straight couples. Legalizing gay marriage would encourage more gay celebrations, thus helping the economy. CONCLUSION Con never really attacked my argument that legalizing gay marriage is good for society. His other two rebuttals hinged on the idea that marriage should not be a legal union, but I have shown why it is should be. His case also revolved around the idea that marriage should not be defined by the government, but again, I have shown why it should be a legal union, and not just a social one. I have also shown that even if his arguments are true, the resolution is still affirmed. It is clear that there are benefits for society if same-sex marriage was legalized.

If we strongly dislike something the government does, we retaliate.\" I love this quote! It is something I whole-heartedly agree with.However, this must also be true with society in general. People are tired of Gays not having the same legal status of straights, and so they are doing things.To counter your arguements: \"So, being that Americans don't want legal matters involved in marriage at all, it's unfair to say that we ought to let these matters interfere with the marriage of homosexuals as well.\"It doesn't really matter if the People wish marriage to be separate from the government because the majority may not even matter here. If 59% wished to take away all welfare, social secuity, and Medicare/Medicaid, this could not be done because, if it were, anyone relying on these programs would be dead in a month. The same thing would happen if insurance benifits for marryed couples were revoked because people rely on the Marriage Benifit Programs (MBP).If we were to look at Gay Marriage, its legalization DOES NOT harm anyone. Revoking Government Marriage Insurance Benifits does, and so we must keep Gov. and Marriage together, and then there are also no reasons why Gays shouldn't be treated the same as Straights.Your next argument: If your potential for having children rises, the state is interested. It helps the statistics.You are right that the state is interested in child creation, but this is not the point of marriage itself. Fertility should not be a factor as the infertile can Marry.It does not help to know that (gays),who have an extremely low chance of creating a child, are emotionally bonded.Extremely low chances? Wow. How about no chance. lol.As for Gay Marriage benifiting the state:http://www.pbs.org...http://www.huffingtonpost.com...Does this suffice?",

            "discussionTitle": "Gay marriage should be legal in the United States.",
            "conclusion": "Gay marriage should be legal in the United States.",
            "premise": "Thank you for your quick response. My opponent's first argument is that \"marriage is a fundamental right of liberty.\" However, the context of the case itself is that people should have the right to choose who they marry. However, it does NOT say that people have the fundamental right to gain benefits from the government for being married. The Supreme Court case only stated that the government was having too much authority over marriage. In fact, it was a law limiting marriage rights that made the case necessary. Nowhere in the case is it implied that ending all government involvement in marriage would have any negative consequences whatsoever. So yes, marriage is a fundamental right of liberty, but to have government grant discriminatory benefits to marriages is not. Additionally, this is an example of appeal to authority [1], because he is claiming that because the United States Supreme Court ruled something to be so, then it must be so. In fact, the USSC is actually a biased entity, if we were to go by my opponent's interpretation of the Supreme Court being pro-government interference, because any government institution would naturally be in favor of increased government authority, making my opponent's appeal even more fallacious. Contention 2: The Utility Factor My opponent then argues that if government quit all involvement in marriage, \"even more people would have their basic rights taken away.\" Not at all. People would still marry as they pleased. However, government would be unable to have a say in the matter. The people would simply lose their discriminatory tax cuts, which they had no \"right\" to. Or, we could just eliminate a few unnecessary government projects and say that everybody gets tax cuts, rather than just the married. Now, how can anybody complain with that situation? Contention 3: Gay marriage bans violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. My opponent's arguments against marriages involving animals, walls, and abstract ideas are valid, but he ignores polygamy and pedophilia. Contention 1: It is illegal for marriage to be legal in the United States. My opponent's next argument is that marriage is not a religious institution. However, it is. The story goes that marriage was solely a religious institution until John Calvin decided that his government would recognize religious marriages [2]. Since then, people with no religious beliefs decided that it was unfair that only religious people were getting unfair government benefits, so they started marrying, too. That is how government got itself involved in marriage, and it has refused to release its grip ever since. The question is, why continue its grip? There's no point except to discriminate. Contention 2: It is discriminatory for marriage to be legal in the United States. My opponent suddenly switches his arguments from government-recognized marriages to not-government-recognized marriages. This is fine and all, but it completely kills any chance for him to affirm the resolution. Remember the definition of \"legal\": \"Having a formal status derived from law often without a basis in actual fact\" [3] If we remove the legal protections, government would no longer bother to give marriage any formal legal status, and therefore, gay marriage would not be legal. Additionally, here are a few quotes from my opponent: \"Moreover, the government has a vested interest in helping marriage via tax cuts and other measures, because functional marriages are necessary in order to promote social stability.\" Now, this is an example of a non sequitur (does not follow) [4], because it assumes that marriages need \"tax cuts and other measures\" to be functional. However, marriages have existed for a long time without \"tax cuts and other measures\" [5]. Gays have lived in informal marriages, and have reportedly been doing fine without \"tax cuts and other measures.\" Therefore, there is no reason to assume that we need \"tax cuts and other measures.\" The rest of the paragraph continues to rely on the misconception that abolishing \"tax cuts and other measures\" will lead to the abolishment of all functional marriages. Now, for a final in-depth analysis of my opponent's conclusion: \"My opponent's arguments are interesting and\u2026 well they're interesting.\" Thank you. \"But they do not serve to refute any of my four arguments.\" I beg to differ. \"And apart from a few slippery slopes and other fallacious contentions...\" You have failed to explain why my argument was a slippery slope (especially when I gave examples of people wanting to marry multiple people or inanimate objects), and have not brought up any other fallacies. \"...my opponent has not presented a compelling argument that gay marriage should be banned.\" Banned? No. What, would government install cameras in everybody's houses to make sure that nobody attempted an informal marriage? That would be ridiculous. What I am calling for is a lack of government recognition in gay marriage, and all marriage. \"Banning gay marriage is unconstitutional...\" First, let's assume that you mean \"removing legal and discriminatory benefits from.\" Then, let's realize that I am advocating \"banning\" all marriage, not just gay marriage, so the 14th Amendment would not be infringed upon at all. \"...and since the United States Supreme Court has declared that marriage is a fundamental liberty...\" For one thing, this is an appeal to biased authority. For another, marriage being a fundamental liberty does not grant it formal legal status. \"...it follows from this that gay marriage should be legalized.\" When the two premises collapse, so does the conclusion. \"(Resolution affirmed)\" Because giving legal status to any marriage is clear discrimination against those who are not married, and there is no valid reason for the recognition of marriage by government, and there would be less discrimination if government stopped messing with marriage altogether, gay marriage (and all marriage, for that matter) should not be legal in the United States. 1. http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. http://en.wikipedia.org... 3. http://www.merriam-webster.com... 4. http://en.wikipedia.org... 5. http://en.wikipedia.org...",

That isn\"t what the debate was intended for. Either way, the government doesn\"t have the constitutional authority to \"not acknowledge\" gay marriage because that would violate the equal protection clause. RE: THE GOVERONMENT ISN'T GIVEN THE POWER TO REDEFINE MARRIAGE We are talking about legal definitions. Let\"s not conflate separate issues. RE: NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE GAY Yes, you shouldn\"t be able to ban the color red from being worn. This helps my argument more than yours because it\"s not your right to infringe on other people\"s rights. If someone wants to force ice cream parlors to stock manure, then they are infringing on the parlor owner\"s rights. If someone wants to ban manure from ice cream parlors, they shouldn\"t be allowed to infringe on rights that way either unless there is a health concern which there may be in that case. Most people were bothered by interracial couples, but that doesn\"t mean that interracial marriage should be banned. Most people in some countries even think gays should be executed. RE: THE MAJORITY DEFINE MARRIAGE IN A TRADITIONAL WAY Again, we are talking about whether to have a legal ban on gay marriage. What difference does it make if people think of a word as having a certain meaning? Who would be hurt by changing a legal definition of marriage to include same sex? RE: ACKNOWLADGING GAY MARRIAGES SERVES NO BENEFIT; RE: WHY PAY MORE TAXES? Some benefits: Hospital visitation during an illness, the option of filing a joint tax return, access to family health coverage, US residency and family unification for partners from another country, bereavement leave and inheritance rights, child custody rights, spousal or child support, equitable division of property, adoption, etc. RE: MORAL DECAY How is it harmful for children to be accepting of gays? What about children who are harmed because they are gay? RE: EQUALITY Firing someone because they are lazy makes sense. Firing someone because they are GAY/straight/christian/atheist/black/white, even though they are doing a great job, would be discrimination. You can\"t choose who you\"re attracted to, and even if you could, so what? If blacks could choose to be white, would that make it okay to discriminate against blacks? No. RE: THE DOWNFALL OF AMERICA Your argument here is that eliminating all marriage would mean no inequality. Again, I am talking about banning gay marriage, not all marriage. And either way, transitioning to a system of no marriage because of prejudice towards gays, means that this legal change is a result of discrimination. If you don\"t want to get gay married, then don\"t. Millions of people shouldn\"t be treated as second class citizens when they aren't hurting anyone, just because you think it's gross for two women or two men to love each other.",

            "premise": "Let\"s take a definitional approach to the \"gay marriage\" argument and consider the question: who determines the constitution of marriage? This easily pulls focus from both the legal and social components of this arrangement. Furthermore, this clarifies the logistics of whom and what opinions are held at a higher regard in this debate, which often times concerns the sanctity of marriage. Religion holds a considerable amount of weight within this debate. As rebuttal, let us consider the theocracy that is assumed to be tolerated. For as a democratic republic that\"s established the 1st Amendment, the Good Ol\" United States of America is more than willing to adhere to the imposing values of one religion. Moreover, gay marriage will destroy the sanctity of marriage, a claim that is usually made while we recap the Kim Kardashian 72 day \"just for the hell of it\" marriage. What\"s more is the belief that gay marriage will change the foundations of society, kind of like how health awareness has changed the life spans of our modern citizens. For we, as a society, fail to adapt to newer social norms, just as we did with the introduction of the vehicle. And as if being gay wasn\"t enough to handle, but to consider that they\"d have a legal responsibility to the children they could potentially share, it\"s god-awful. Quite obviously, gay parents will raise gay children, just as straight parents will raise straight children. Marriage is a civil right and should have no restrictions, especially to the unnatural behaviors of the \"gays\". Keep in mind: Americans have always rejected unnatural things, such as eyeglasses and modern Western medications.",

God created the first man and woman from the first man, his intention was for the union of male and female. My opponent stated that Jesus taught Love and acceptance which he clearly did. This shows that my opponent is religious so we can argue on religious basis.Resolved. God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with great distaste for reasons solely like the motion. For God to wipe an entire race shows he wanted to make sure that their actions and legal behaviors were not nationally accepted. He wanted to put a stop it. gay marriage should not be made legal for the following reasons 1.it denies a child either a father or mother. Thereby ignoring the child's best interest 2.marriage itself is a property that belongs only to heterosexual couples.so gays can be and live together,forever but never be legally married 3.it turns moral wrong into civil right 4.it offends God 5.marriage equality directly harms straight people 6.granting same-sex marriage makes it cease to exist, causing existential linguistic crisis. 7.same sex couples, seeking marriage wants to validate their \"choice\" so they don't deserve it. looking forward to view my opponents arguement.",

I'm not homophobic and I generally have no opinion on the matter but I think I can fight against the legalization of gay marriage. (and to be completely honest I got bored of waiting for an interesting topic, first debate for me :) ) You made the implication that all Gay couples will only get married once with your statement, \"PEOPLE that are straight get married and divorced all the time gays just want to get married once\". How could you be so sure? You said that love is love and while I agree, people are people and there is an equal chance that gay people will divorce just as much. You have absolutely no evidence that straight couples would get divorce more then gay couples. The definition of the word 'marriage' is \"the formal union of a MAN and a WOMAN, typically recognized by law\". Notice how the definition clearly states that marriage is the legal combination of two persons of opposite genders. So even if \"marriage\" was legalized for gay couples, they would not be getting married that would simply be legally bound. The act of a woman and woman or a man and a woman being bound by \"marriage\" will most definitely have a negative effect on a child if the couple chose to have one. It will negatively affect the child due to it being denied either a father or a mother, his is a very generalized statement due to some children growing up without one parent and turning out just fine but nevertheless it is not as healthy as having a good relationship with both a mother and a father. Having said that it has been proved that children should grow up under the influence of their natural mother and father due to the evident difficulties that \"parents\" are faced with when raising an orphan, a relative or a foster child.

Because the resolution calls for gay marriage to be legal in the United States, and legal in the United States has been accepted to mean federal law, my opponent has himself acknowledged that it is not within the power of the United States to put the resolution into effect. He also says that \u201cWhile the federal government should have no say in the gay marriage issue, making the federal government unable to ban gay marriage itself unless through an amendment to the constitution.\u201d The federal government is unable to ban gay marriage, likewise, it is not able to legalize it.\"My opponent makes the claim here that something can be neither legal and illegal, but he fails to provide evidence or reasoning for this claim. I claim that something is legal until it is made illegal. Since the federal government does not ban gay marriage, gay marriage is thus legal in the United States; the government does not have to write up a law for everything to say that it is legal when it already is; the government does, however, have to do this to make something illegal. My opponent now has the responsibility to not only refute my claim, but he also must provide reasoning or evidence for his claim gay marriage can be neither legal or illegal on the federal level. \"I will begin this round by pointing out that my opponent provides no evidence for his assertion that gay marriage is a civil right. Because there is no evidence for the claim, it will not be accepted as true.\"Allow me to elaborate further then. From the Supreme Court decision in Loving v. Virginia:\"Marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man, fundamental to our very existence and survival.\" [1]Now, I shall refer to my opponent's definition of marriage that I accepted at the beginning of the debate: \"The legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife, and in some jurisdictions, between two persons of the same sex, usually entailing legal obligations of each person to the other.\" Under this definition, gay marriage certainly could be considered a civil right, just as marriage already is, under certain jurisdictions. As long as gay marriage is included in the definition of marriage, it is a civil right. I shall argue that gay marriage should be included in the definition of marriage, but first, I shall address another one of Con's points.\"Thirdly, Section 2 of the Defense of Marriage Act states: \u201cNo State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship\u201d [1].This law means that it is up to each state to determine how it wishes to define marriage, and states do not have to accept the same sex marriages of other states.\"The Defense of Marriage Act has not been tested for constitutionality in the United States Supreme Court, and thus, it remains law. This debate, however, is not a question of whether or not gay marriage can be legal in the United States, but rather, whether or not it should be legal. Should was already defined as \"used to express obligation or duty.\" In this use of the word, can is defined as \"be able to.\" [2] The United States does have the obligation or duty to enforce its laws; this does not mean that the states have the obligation to define marriage as only between a man or a woman. According to my understanding of it, the entirety of my opponent's response to my argument, which makes up most of his argument, hinges on the fact that states can define marriage as they wish, under a few restrictions, none of which includes the guarantee that the states have to define marriage to include gay marriage. Thus, the states do not have to provide the same benefits to same-sex couples as they do heterosexual couples, nor do they have to provide the right to marry to homosexual couples in the first place, because even though marriage is a civil right, as long as the definition of marriage does not include gay marriage, then gay marriage is not a civil right. Overall, his argument hinges on the fact that the states do not have to define marriage to include homosexual marriage. Con can correct me if I am mistaken with my understanding of his arguments. This means my only rational response to this argument would be to argue that gay marriage should be included in the definition of marriage. Now, there is little legal precedent or standing for this on a federal basis, and state basis varies, and thus, I will simply use reasoning and rational thinking as opposed to relying on legal documents, which my opponent and I have used throughout this debate. Nonetheless, if my argument, which is that gay marriage should be included in the definition of marriage, is successful, and my opponent's refutations are unsuccessful, then gay marriage should be legal in the United States, because marriage is a civil right that the states already provide for heterosexual couples.To begin my argument as to why gay marriage should be included in the definition of marriage, I shall say that marriage is not necessarily naturally between one man and one woman; in other words, my opponent has to provide reasoning for the claim that marriage should be between a man and a woman, just as I have to provide reasoning that marriage can include homosexual couples. Evidence for the notion that marriage may not just be between heterosexuals is shown throughout history. Same sex marriages have been tolerated in ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, and even a few examples in Middle Ages European secular law. [3]As for rational reasons to include gay marriage in the definition of marriage, some examples are: it would allow gay couples to receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples; it does not hurt society or anyone in particular; marriage is also a matter of love, and this allows homosexual couples another way to express their love; marriage would encourage family values amongst homosexual couples in the same way marriage encourages family values amongst heterosexual couples; it would encourage child adoption amongst homosexual couples, giving more children stable homes where the parents are in a social contract to stay together. This is the end of my argument for round three, and although I do have more to say and argue, I cannot fit in for space reasons, mainly because at this point I have one last thing I need to address, which is addressed below this paragraph. \"Question: If gay marriage is a civil right, then is polygamy a civil right?\" The question shall be ignored until my opponent provides reasoning as to why it is relevant to the debate. The debate is about whether or not gay marriage is legal. Although arguing gay marriage as a civil right may be necessary for my side of the debate, and arguing that it is not a civil right may be necessary for my opponent's side of the debate, arguing polygamy as a civil right or not a civil right is irrelevant as to whether gay marriage should be legal or illegal. I see the question by Con as an attempt to draw away from the main topic of the debate, and readers should take this in mind when determining the conduct of the two debaters. I am not at fault from drawing attention away from the debate in this instance because I am simply addressing a question asked of me as opposed to asking one myself. Likewise, my opponent shall not be at fault if he tries to explain why this question is relevant to the debate; if he fails to do this, however, this question should be a factor when determining his conduct in the debate.

            "premise": "1. PolygamyCon says: P1: As the polygamy/incest argument proves, we do ban things that there is no reason not to give. The points Pro provided at the end for why polygamy is wrong are outdated reasons that would not exist in today's equal and somewhat paranoid political climate, that can also result from a normal marriage.P2: The reason not to give homosexuals the right to marriage is marriage, created and carried through by the church, is not a governmental right, and could even be called a private institution. The church, and the government at this point, defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and from a legal standpoint, that is their right to define it as such.Con's argument against my first premise can be summarized as follows:(P1) We make things illegal when there is no reason to.(P2) There is no reason to make Gay marriage illegal.(C) Therefore, Gay marriage should be illegal.The problem is that even if we do make things illegal when there's no reason to, I still argue that everything that has no reason to be illegal should be legal. There is no alternative.I think that he may be getting sidetracked from the resolution here. The resolution is \"Gay marriage should be legal.\", and let's imagine there's this cafe that gives out free massages to black people, but then there's outrage from white people who want 'White massages'. Should White massages be illegal? No, but the cafe here has the right to not give White massages. Since we it's not illegal, it's legal, so Gay marriage, should be legal.2/3. Inequality and BlasphemyI put these two in the same category as Con makes the same argument in both. He says here:\" If someone were to start a business banning blacks, there would be outrage, but it would be legal.\"If this is true, then surely the church not allowing Gay marriage is legal. He also says: \" Not only may churches forced by law to give gay marriages be, in their eyes, committing blasphemy, but the members may believe that they will be punished after their death for it. It goes against their religious freedom to ban anything they do that is not illegal.\"Just because it's legal, it doesn't mean it's required. If, like you've said before, the Church is a private institution, then it does have the right to do that.4. I love my sister!I find it very hard to believe that Con still doesn't undertsand my point, however, I will explain it. If Gay marriage is illegal, then heterosexuals can marry without that marriage conflicting with their sexual orientation, whilst Gays cannot. This is different to marrying a close family member as there is no other group that is allowed to marry their sister. Con claims that there is no group who is allowed to marry the same sex, and that is correct, but it's not the point. The point is that if gay marriage were illegal, then heterosexuals would be able to get married without that marriage conflicting with their sexual orientation, whilst homosexuals would not.I thank Con for a thought-provoking debate.",

            "conclusion": "Gay marriage should be legal",
            "premise": "I'll start by laying out the first premises I have adopted for this debate. Governments exist. Here are a few examples: http://www.usa.gov... http://www.madagascar.gov.mg... http://www.royal.gov.uk... http://english.gov.cn... Whether a government exists to protect its citizens (Switzerland, Israel), to serve a more powerful government's ends (East Germany, the Marcher Lords in medieval Wales), or merely to line the pockets of the rulers (Cuba, Saudi Arabia), it needs power to achieve that end. That power is based on the ability to wield deadly force. A country without ability to defend itself or impose order on its citizens is, in the normal course of events, waiting for a conqueror; and unable to effectively fulfill its purpose. Whatever diminishes from a nation's ability to defend itself is thus considered less desirable than an option that increases that ability, under this theory of government. As one cannot foresee how much power of coercion may become necessary to have available for future events, the logical course is to maximize one's available power to be as prepared as possible. http://www.iep.utm.edu... There are two aspects of gay marriage that make it undesirable for the maximization of power: 1. Gay marriages do not result in any offspring, thus not creating additional potential soldiers or workers to increase the power available; and, 2: Any marriage results in one legally taxable entity where there was two before; decreasing the potential income through taxation. Marriages tend to collect dependents, reducing the working population; and the resulting potential emotional stability adds resistance to government-employed emotional conditioning/propaganda, potentailly reducing control and thus power. This second argument applies to any marriage, of any type; although gay marriages may be less likely to attract dependents (although adoption is still a possibility, as are mendicant in-laws) the arrangement still allows one partner to remain at home rather than contributing to the workforce. Thus, the arguments against *any* marriage being legal apply equally to gay marriage. It may sound harsh for a government to impose restrictions on its citizens merely to increase its power (or order, or stability); but in reality it is an everyday occurrence. Examples of such restrictions include: -Militia laws -Gun control laws -Traffic laws (forbidding un-liscensed individuals from driving certain vehicles) -Anti-sedition laws (forbidding conspiracy to overthrow the government) -Anti-trust laws (forbidding monopolies) ------------------------ From the viewpoint of the government, therefore: Gay marriage should NOT be legal, as it tends to diminish the power available to the government to fulfill its purpose for existence. To my worthy opponent; best of luck!",

            "premise": "I thank Pro for their response.Premise 1) Freedom is our defaultI don't think Pro is disagrees with this premise, Pro makes some remarks about marriage being a privileged and not a right but even if this accepted this doesn't refute the first premise.The alternative would be that freedom is NOT our default.Premise 2) You need a good reason to make something illegalPro says...\"Perhaps it doesn\u2019t refute the premise but the premise is flawed in that gay marriage isn\u2019t illegal as much as it\u2019s not an allowed circumstance in most states\"The first part of this sentence doesn't make sense where Pro says that gay marriage isn't illegal as much as its not allowed. Well what does it mean for something to be illegal ? Well at the start of the debate illegal was defined as... \"Illegal = Illegal, or unlawful, is used to describe something that is prohibited by law.\" Prohibited means not allowed by the way.Definition of Prohibited 1.Formally forbid (something) by law, rule, or other authority- laws prohibiting cruelty to animals2.Formally forbid a person or group from doing something- he is prohibited from being a director3.(of a fact or situation) Prevent (something); make impossible\" [1]As such when Pro says that to not allow gay marriage in a legal context doesn't mean you are making it illegal is a contradiction in terms.Conclusion) If a law exists that does not have a good reason for making something illegal, then the law should be changed so the thing is no longer illegalRegulation of marriagePro informs us that marriage is currently regulated, well sure no argument there, but does this prove that gay marriage should be illegal ? I don't think so, consider this argument....1) Marriage is regulated2) Therefore we should ban gay marriage1) Marriage is regulated2) Therefore we should ban interracial marriage.Both arguments are non sequiturs, you can accept the first premise but the conclusion doesn't follow from it.I would also point out the fact that there are places that ban gay marriage is not a good reason to ban gay marriage. There are some places that ban Christianity, would the fact that a law exists that bans Christianity be a good reason to make Christianity illegal ? what about the fact there are places that ban women from driving, is the fact their is a law some where that bans women from driving a good reason to ban women from driving ? of course not.Marriage and procreationPro says...\"Married partners are granted these benefits because the propagation of society is a compelling interest for the State. This is why laws tend to restrict marriage between couples unlikely to produce viable children\"I am aware of no law that restricts marriage (at least in western civilization) to couples if they can't or are unlikely to produce \"viable\" children. I will ask Pro to explain what they are going on about here. The ability to have children is not a necessary requirement to be able to marry. The state and the harm principlePro says...\"Privileges are set in law, inferred from other rights or take the form of \u201cfreedoms\u201d as Con puts it. As a privilege, marriage can be denied based on the needs of the State.\" & \"The benefits mentioned in my initial argument (among possible others) garnered from this privilege should only be extended to those who would benefit the state by their union.\"I don't accept that marriages should only be granted to those who are judged to be providing a benefit to the state and I don't think you should either. Remember under Pros argument here both gays and hetrosexuals can be denied marriage if they are not deemed as providing a benefit to the state.Rather than restrict marriage or anything for that matter cause its not deemed beneficial for the state we should only restrict something if it will result in \"harm\" as the harm principle says...\"The harm principle holds that the actions of individuals should only be limited to prevent harm to other individuals. John Stuart Mill first articulated this principle in On Liberty, where he argued that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\"[2]\"Marriage of conveniencePreviously Pro tried to ban gay marriage on the grounds that this could result in a marraige of convenience. But as I pointed out a marriage of convenience can also happen in a hetrosexual marriage, so according to Pros own rule we would have to ban both gay and hetrosexual marriage. Pro now says...\"I would argue that marriage should be banned for everyone that has a \u201cmarriage of convenience\u201d based on the benefits derived from the State making it in the State\u2019s interest to do so.\" & \"So, yes, even in heterosexual marriages certain restrictions should and do apply. And I still believe that either homo or hetero couples that do this violate the sanctity of marriage.\"Even if we accept Pros now new modified rule, this doesn't result in the banning of gay marriage, it only says that certain gay marriages and hetrosexual marriages should be banned. Well for the sake of argument we can agree to Pros rule here and thus allow gay marriages & hetrosexual marraiges that are not deemed a \"marriage of convenience\".I look forward to Pros reply.Sources [1] http://www.google.com.au...[2] http://en.wikipedia.org...",

Nevertheless,I am convinced that legalisation of gay marriage is not only *not* necessary from a legal point of view, but is also morally wrong.I am a catholic christian and catholic apologetics played a major role in re-shaping my opinion.But since you are atheist, i will provide purely secular moral and legal reasons for my stand. Please let me know if we are going to argue about the legal aspect of gay marriage alone, or if we are going to debate the moral aspects as well in your opening statement. Looking forward to an interesting debate.Wish you best of luck.",
