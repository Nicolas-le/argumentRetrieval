            "premise": "By the definition of your title, I was speaking off topic for the previous Rounds. However, the only federally mandated election law change suggestions for future Federal Elections have been not a picture ID, but a voter ID. Regardless, I will propose a counter-plan advocating voter accountability through a paper trail. The greatest risk to switching votes (D. Josef Thompson, University of Chicago) is tampering with electronic machines. Because votes are analyzed more on the county precinct level instead of the voting locations, discrepencies are much harder to find. In the 2000 and 2004 elections, he estimates, that there were more incidences of voter fraud by one individual than there were electronic machine tampering. However, the percentage of votes changed by machine tampering outweighed the percentage of votes changed by voter fraud by a ratio of 3:1, while even counting invalidated absentee ballots equals the approximate number of votes by voter fraud. I will now assess the American government's ability to improve its voting system. The American government only has the resources available to take one option: paper trails for electronic machines OR voter/picture ID because of the official documentation and training purposes. The winner of this debate is the Negative side because its counter-plan of instituting a paper trail defeats the Affirmative plan of picture Identification at the voting booth. Thanks, The Colonel",

Those who are partially sighted are unable to see the position on the text blocks on the screen; small controls such as buttons or touch screens create problems; and some cognitively impaired people may find it difficult to remember a PIN number which is used to authenticate the vote[1]. A simple paper ballot is a far more commonly-recognised and straightforward method. In terms of cost, the electronic voting machines or voting programmes would certainly cost a great deal to implement and run[2]. Ultimately, the great risk that electronic voting machines or systems will lose votes[3]\u00a0outweighs the cost argument: you cannot put a price on a crucial process at the core of every democratic state.

For example the UK general election in 2005 cost over \u00a380 million to organise[1], Canada\u2019s 2008 election cost around $300 million[2], and the USA presidential election of 2008 was estimated to cost up to $5.3 billion[3]. Electronic voting also brings the opportunity to increase access to those who currently find it difficult to register their votes; for example, electronic voting could be conducted in a minority language for those who find English difficult[4]. In the past, trials of this have been shown to improve voter turnout among minority groups[5]. Electronic voting could also benefit the elderly, as many find it difficult to use the lever-operated ballots currently in use.[6]\u00a0Using electronic voting ensures that no groups are left out of an essentially democratic process.

            "premise": "In many Western democracies, voter turnout has been falling while voter apathy appears to be rising. In the UK, voter turnout fell sharply between 1997-2000, and the last general election in 2010 saw only 65% of potential voters cast a vote[1]. In the USA, the federal election of 2010 saw only 37.8% of potential voters cast their vote[2]. Voter turnouts across Europe follow this trend[3]. When so few people participate in the key act of democracy \u2013 voting for the political leader of the country \u2013 it begins to raise worrying questions about the legitimacy of that democracy in the first place. If electronic or internet voting was introduced as an option alongside more traditional polling methods, it would expands the accessibility of the voting system in general. Internet or electronic voting would be a strategic practical measure. It would make voting convenient for busy modern citizens because it minimalises the amount of effort each individual has to contribute \u2013 namely, they do not have to travel to the polling stations[4]. As such, it removes physical restrictions on the voting process and becomes more universally accessible. This would prevent people from being unable to vote because they are \u2018too busy\u2019[5]\u00a0\u2013 whether this is simply because their local polling station is too far away for them to commute to, or to fit in alongside their other daily responsibilities based at work or home[6][7].

Secure software and encryption protocols have allowed online markets to flourish, with companies such as PayPal inspiring a sense of security among their customers[2]. Any software for remote electronic voting could be scrutinised well in advance. It also removes the potential for identity fraud, which is a problem with current postal voting systems[3]. Each voter could be given a unique password, if necessary alongside something like a special swipe card, ensuring that everybody who is entitled to vote gets a single vote. Given that in many jurisdictions, traditional polling stations do not require voters to provide ID[4], it would arguably be a security improvement on the current situation.

Secure software and encryption protocols have allowed online markets to flourish, with companies such as PayPal inspiring a sense of security among their customers[2]. Any software for remote electronic voting could be scrutinised well in advance. It also removes the potential for identity fraud, which is a problem with current postal voting systems[3]. Each voter could be given a unique password, if necessary alongside something like a special swipe card, ensuring that everybody who is entitled to vote gets a single vote. Given that in many jurisdictions, traditional polling stations do not require voters to provide ID[4], it would arguably be a security improvement on the current situation.

            "premise": "Rules: No word play on semantics. No specific format. If you accept, please present a case and don't just forfeit. Thanks in advance! I affirm the resolution. C-1: Many entities use various forms of online voting with success. Examples include Major League Baseball All Stars, and Debate.org (Sources www.mlb.com & www.debate.org) The basic premise requires a person to log in and vote. Failsafe measures to prevent fraud would be 1 vote per SSN. The Social Security Administration has dates of birth on file. Thus, it stands to reason that persons 18 and older could vote one time. C-2: Numerous elections have had questionable results and recounts, most notably that of Florida or Iran. Such a system would likely alleviate inaccurate vote counting as it would be done electronically, and tallied as the votes occur. C-3: Absentee voting has it's share of potential debacles as well. Online voting alleviates the process of mailing ballots, having them marked, mailed back, opened and counted. C-4: Elderly and shut in voters may not get the opportunity to vote traditionally. Having access online would enable them to have a better opportunity to vote. CONCLUSION: Given the unreliability & inaccessibility of traditional voting, it passes the common sense test to switch to online voting. It is possible to create a reliable program that would be protected against hackers and pirates, that would not only simplify, but also uncomplicate the entire voting process. Further, greater accessibility suggests that more registered voters would actually vote, which is the very essence of what a democracy is intended to be. Many people fought for the rigth to vote, thus we have the 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th amendmentst o our national constitution. Thank you!",

Converting over to a run off election could certainly help get more people involved and give a voice to those who previously did not have a voice. But, honestly, you don't fix a \"lack of interest\" with a gun to your temple. Also, voting isn't a sacred duty. There's noting sacred about it. You go into the polling place and put a mark next to whoever the Democrat in the election is and leave. Nothing holy or even slightly difficult about it. Democracy doesn't flourish with a boot to the throat. We would have roughly the same government today as we would have had if we forced people to vote. The choices aren't that great and for the most part voting doesn't change the outcome. For example, did you know that the voting rate is better in Cuba and in Saddam's Iraq than it is in the US, and they only had one party systems... and similar provisions to your rules. We could do many thing to improve the voting and to make the voting count for more, we could elect better people and fix the system, we could do a better job at counting the votes cast, and keeping legal voters on the voter rolls... and we should. Forcing people to the polls does not make magical democracy fairies come around to fix all the problem. Random disinterested people vote when they need to vote, and don't when they don't.

            "premise": "I apologize if I sound like a broken record here, but I don't think my opponent understood exactly what I was getting at. I'll try to go back over my opponent's points once more. 1. I don't think you fully understand the system. I say this not to be condescending, but because you said \"If you leave the box blank, that's equivalent to ranking the candidate last.\" That is NOT the same thing. If you rank the candidate last, then you're voting for a candidate that you don't want. But if you leave it blank, then none of your votes can go to the candidate(s) that you don't agree with. 2. This problem isn't at all specific to IRV. There are many fake candidates today. So that aspect of it may not change, and maybe never will. But your attack has nothing to do specifically with IRV. 3. The FPTP system does NOT better uphold \"democratic values\". Looking at your example, in the current FPTP system, that would still happen. If most prefer John to David, but for whatever reason a large number of John supporters vote for Peter, then David would win. Ex. (in the FPTP system): Let's say the numbers pre-Peter are John 54% David 46% Now, if you add in Peter, the numbers (using your same logic) would be Peter 40% John 14% David 46% You see, under our current FPTP system in your hypothetical, David still wins because he has the largest percent. The whole contention of \"upholding democracy\" isn't true. You act like FPTP can't be susceptible to fake candidates or splitting the vote. So again, your point isn't specific to IRV. 4. This also has nothing to do with IRV. If 3rd party candidates had a good chance at winning (i.e. Ross Perot), then they would be invited at debates. Instead of only hearing Democrats and Republicans at the debates, they would invite everyone who has a good chance. Besides, even today in the FPTP system, uninformed voters can completely alter the outcome of an election 5. I'll prove that we can afford such a system. Even though I again don't think this contention is specific to IRV, I'll prove that there's a way we can count the ballots quicker and cheaper than today's system. Let's look at Maryland as an example. In the status quo, millions of dollars are spent by stats every year to buy the e-voting machines and to maintain. Electronic voting machines cost an average of $23.40 per registered voter. About half is because of the machines they replace every few years, and half is to maintain the machines (unloading the machines in, keeping them in an air conditioned room). Hand counting ballots costs an average of $3.20 per registered voter. (Sources down below). Not only would it be affordable, it would help us save a lot of money. IRV is more democratic than FPTP voting, because under FPTP voting you can win with less than 50%. IRV goes until a candidate gets more than 50%.

            "conclusion": "Alternative Vote should be adopted in the UK (over First Past the Post).",
            "premise": "Hi and thanks for taking part in the debate. I shall now deal with each of the points you raised. 1: AV is complicated. You first raised the argument that the Alternative Vote system is complicated, and that people would be less likely to vote with a complicated system. If you have a child, and you ask that child 'which chocolate bar would you like', the child might answer something like 'mmm I'll have a snickers but if they don't have a snickers I'll have a galaxy'. That child just understood the basic concept of Alternative Vote: preferences. It is not at all complicated. You also raised the point that AV is only used in 3 countries worldwide. What is often overlooked is that STV (single transferable vote) is a system that is exactly the same as Alternative Vote, but used in multi member constituencies. This system is used in a large number of countries worldwide, including some member states of the European Union. NO other European Union member state uses First Past the Post. 2: AV is not as proportionate as you think. Alternative Vote does not claim to be a proportional voting system. But neither is First Past the Post, so in trying to establish which of these two voting systems is better - there is no point entertaining any ideas of proportionality. Secondly, you raise the fear of endless coalition governments and put forward the idea that the 3rd party - the Liberal Democrats would always have the power to choose governments. This is actually what has just happened under First Past the Post. In truth, this fear of coalitions is unfounded and irrational. Many of our European neighbours 'endure' coalitions through most governments, and it becomes the political way. There is nothing to be afraid of. Examples of countries where successful coalitions dominate include much of Scandinavia (take a look at Norway, Finland etc) While you raise the issue of the results made by Alternative Vote as being 'undemocratic' you fail to defend First Past the Post itself as being 'democratic'. I would argue that if we had a democracy scale in front of us, Alternative Vote would far be considered 'more democratic' than First Past the Post. The fact of the matter is, that First Past the Post leads to minority rule. As I stated in my first posted argument, only on government in the last 100 years (in 1931) enjoyed an actual 'majority' ie. more than 50% of the vote. It is surely impossible to defend minority rule as being 'democratic' in nature. If we are comparing First Past the Post and Alternative Vote on a democratic level, I refer you to this study carried out recently at the London School of Economics: http://www2.lse.ac.uk... Here, 22 voting theory experts from around the world compared voting systems to see which one was most fitting for UK democracy. Every single one of them rejected First Past the Post. 10 of them chose the Alternative Vote. (the other 12 chose Approval Voting, but we are not debating that here). 3. Changing to AV would be costly. This is a lie (though it is not your lie). Firstly, you have included in your argument the sum of \u00a391 million for the cost of the referendum. This figure is completely irrelevant seeming as this money has now been spent whether or not we implement AV. You go on to quote a figure of \u00a3130 million to be spent on electronic counting machines to be used with the new system. This is false. Electronic counting machines are unnecessary, and the Electoral Commission has already stated that they would be unnecessary. In Australia (where they use AV) they continue to count by hand, and do not use electronic counting at all. That cuts the cost from \u00a3250 million to \u00a326 million, to be spent on informing the public on how Alternative Voting works. This is an absolutely minuscule figure in the grand scheme of things, especially when you consider that it is to enhance the quality of our democracy. Who can put a price tag on democracy? 4. AV is unfair. You use an example how someone who finishes first in the original count - ie, someone who wins under First Past the Post, can go on to lose to someone originally placed 3rd or 4th. Again, in Australia, where they use the system, only in less than 5% of cases do those who are placed 1st after the first round of counting, do those candidates fail to go on to win. First Past the Post is the system that is unfair. Here is (fake) example: ROUND ONE (FIRST PAST THE POST RESULTS ROUND) Conservatives: 35% Labour: 33% Liberal Democrats: 24% Green Party - 8% Ideologically, 65% of the voters above voted for a party either considered Liberal or Progressive. The majority (though not all, I concede) of these voters would be more likely to want a Progressive, or Liberal candidate & government, than a Conservative, right-wing one. Under AV, with the Greens eliminated a second round of voting might look like this: ROUND TWO Conservatives 36% Labour 37% Liberal Democrats 27% Still no winner, as no candidate has achieved 50% of the voter. Liberal Democrats are now eliminated and their votes redistributed. ROUND THREE Conservatives 43% Labour 57% ++++LABOUR WIN++++ Not only do we now have a winner, but we have a winner that over 50% of the electorate have specified a preference for. Over 50%of the population said they would prefer Labour to the Conservatives, and that's what we have. This is MAJORITY RULE. This is fair, and democratic. The only way it could be improved is if it was a proportional system. But neither is First Past the Post, so FPTP cannot criticise AV in this respect. First Past the Post would have simply produced a winner who only managed to achieve 35% of the popular vote, and 43% preferential overall. This candidate did not have broad appeal. Under First Past the Post he/she (not to be sexist) could potentially have contually been re-elected by a minority, despite a majority preferring someone else. I ask my debate partner the following: How can First Past the Post be defended as being democratic when it has been shown to produce minority rule 99% of the time. What price would be acceptable to pay for improving the quality of democracy in the country? What he fears from a coalition government, when they work so successfully in many other developed countries?",

            "premise": "Thanks to Wylted for taking me up on this important debate! The outcome of the voting reform process could have a variety of wide-ranging impacts on the health, direction, and tenor of DDO's politics and community affairs, and so it is important that this topic is discussed in our community. In this debate I will examine the problems of the current voting system that necessitate change, and then I will discuss how my proposal effectively and efficiently addresses those problems. I will also discuss the BOP before I launch into those arguments. With that, let's launch into the debate!BOPSince Wylted has agreed to split the BOP, judges should approach this debate keeping in mind the question of \"which system is better?\" Whichever system is better is the one you should vote for. There should be no presumption in favor of the status quo.PROBLEMS WITH THE STATUS QUOThere are five big issues that I see in the current voting system: (1) that people in the polls are largely disenfranchised, (2) that users who are barely part of the community are able to vote, (3) that users with no interactions in the forums can vote, (4) that users are often bombarded with unwanted communications from the candidates during the campaign process, and (5) that voters who have already voted are often pressured by various campaign teams to change their votes. I will now review each of these five points and explain why these are problems under the status quo.(1) People in the Polls are DisenfranchisedFirstly, it is important to note that just because a user spends a lot of time in the polls section that does not mean that they are not good users who are invested in the site. Two particular users come to mind: PetersSmith and Bblackkbbirdd; both of these users attempted to cast votes or wanted to cast votes in the last election, but were barred from doing so because they did not meet the voting eligibility requirements. By all accounts these users were invested in the site, promoted exemplary polls, exhibited good conduct, and were all around benefits to the DDO community. (2/3) Users who are barely part of the community are able to vote/Users with no interactions in the forums can voteI just want to point out that 2 and 3 are different insofar as a user can be invested in the community without spending much time in the forums, but for the sake of saving valuable character space, I will be addressing these points together. The investment comments have more to do with (2), and the latter have more to do with (3), but I think they're all interrelated to some extent.Let me construct a hypothetical to demonstrate my point. Let's say that user X has received a PM asking him to vote. User X has done 3, 1-round debates. Each of his rounds in all of his debates was one or two brief sentences. He has never posted in the forums, never created a poll, and has been on the site for a few weeks (let's specify and say 21 days). This user is eligible to vote. There are several problems with this. Firstly, this user has not demonstrated any investment in the site. There are many temporary users of DDO, who flit in, do a few debates, and leave. They are not long-term users, and so have no stake in casting a wise, prudent vote for the site's long-term investment. This means that they will likely not care as much about casting a good vote if they choose to vote. Alternatively, they may stick around for awhile, but only be on the site in short bursts and leave for months on end. Here again, their frequent absence diminishes the stake they have in ensuring the best outcome. To me, the impacts of this are that they are more likely to vote for whoever asks them to vote (regardless of the quality of their positions), are more likely to not get informed about the issues before voting, and are thus more likely to cast careless or bad votes.Secondly, even if this voter is invested for some reason, they are likely not well informed. This most recent election cycle, big issues that the candidates discussed included forum reorganization and revitalization, reducing flamewars in the forums, trials, and other issues outside of the debate section of the website. These are things that users who spend little or no time in the forums are not going to be informed about, so it will be hard for them to truly assess the importance of these issues to the welfare of the site as a whole. In fact, it is quite possible that they do not even know many areas of concern in their own section of the website due to the lack of effort they put into it. Finally, it is also possible that they do not even know what they are voting for. Of the voters I talked to when I campaigned, those who were not involved in the forums seemed more likely than other groups to conflate the position of mod and president. It does not seem fair that two users who are aware of community issues should be denied the right to vote in the community's Presidential Elections simply because they frequent the polls section more than other sections of the site. In fact, the polls section as added to DDO after the eligibility requirements were created, so it seems logical to update those requirements to reflect such changes to the site.Thirdly, it seems that X could very easily be a multi-account created in anticipation of the election. With voting requirements that are easy to meet, it also becomes easy to craft alts with the specific purpose in mind of casting illicit votes.(4) Users are often bombarded with unwanted communications from the candidates during the campaign processI experienced this problem firsthand when I was campaigning this election cycle. Several users clearly did not want to receive messages, and were irked that they would often find their inboxes filled to the brim with notifications and PMs from multiple people on both sides of the race. One user in particular, Beastt, noted that he was fed up of receiving these messages. Clearly, this can feel harassing to some users, which is not what DDO wants its users to be feeling.(5) Voters who have already voted are often pressured by various campaign teams to change their votesThis issue sparked several debates in the forums, particularly after Mikal posted his thread accusing campaigners of harassing people to change their votes [http://www.debate.org...]. Wylted himself has admitted this is a problem--and it clearly is a threat to the integrity of DDO's electoral process (voter intimidation), but also to DDO's values and positive community atmosphere.HOW MY PROPOSAL SOLVES(1) My proposal solves for the disenfranchisement of poll-usersUnder my system, Bblackkbbirdd would have been eligible to vote per the fourth bullet, having at least 200 posts and 50 polls, and could thus have cast ballots. PetersSmith would have been very close to being eligible (less than 40 comments away, which could have easily been made up before voting began). Another disqualified voter, Zyloarchy, would have been much closer to qualifying too. Ultimately, my system makes it much easier for these types of users to become qualified voters.(2/3) My proposal solves for community involvement and forum useBy raising the bar on eligibility requirements, we can cut down on some of the members who are merely transient being able to vote. We can also make it harder to create alts simply to garner more votes. Moreover, by ensuring that everyone has to have at least 100 posts to vote, we ensure that voters have some exposure to the heart of the community and increase the chances of their being informed about other site issues.(4/5) My proposal solves for harassmentMy proposal mandates that if someone asks not to be PM'd further, campaigners must stop PMing them. A no-contact list could even be created to this end. Furthermore, my proposal explicitly bans contacting voters after they vote to lobby them to alter their votes.Prefer my System. Over to Con...",

            "premise": "Elections can be confusing enough already; there are numerous levels of elections which often all are voted for on the same day so that turnout is high for all the elections. As a result voters often get numerous different ballots to fill in; the system for voting in each may well be different and are often complex. Adding that sixteen year olds can vote in one election and not the other simply adds to this complexity in polling stations meaning more mistakes are likely to be made. \u00a0Lack of knowledge of voting process, increased complexity of voting process, and long ballots decrease accuracy in voting.[1]\u00a0The first, and possibly also the second are factors that this lowering of the voting age will influence \u2013 so this change would mean increasing the numbers of spoilt ballots.

Improper disposal of electronic equipment poses a significant threat to public health and the global environment. When electronic products are incinerated or dumped in a landfill, they can release heavy metals and other hazardous substances that contaminate groundwater and pollute the air. Some hazardous e-waste is being exported to developing countries that are less equipped to handle the hazardous materials \" even though, in many cases this export violates international law, as well as domestic laws in the importing countries. See Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia (pdf). As a large volume buyer, the health care sector has the power to shift the electronics market toward greener practices through its purchasing choices.

            "conclusion": "WHY electronics should be alloud in school",
            "premise": "As much as I might enjoy demonstrating why young goats should not use microwave ovens in aquatic environments necessary to have groups of fish I shall try and restrain myself. Unless of course that was the debate my opponent was seeking. Definitions: Electronics [1]: (1) A branch of physics that deals with the emission, behavior, and effects of electrons and with electronic devices. (2) Electronic components, devices, or equipment. I'll assume that we're talking about the second definition here but that still leaves us with a ridiculously broad field. For the purposes of this debate we should narrow the definition the \"electronic devices typically used by minors\". Thus, my opponent won't argue the benefits of having schools upgraded for the electric light and I won't try and demonstrate that school board budgets might be strained by installing an LHC. More thoroughly, we should discuss why the electronic devices should be used in schools rather than simply permitting their presence. School[2]: (1) An organization that provides instruction as (a) an institution for the teaching of children (b) college, university... (2) A large number of fish or aquatic animals of one kind swimming together. Ignoring the entertainment value in the second definition, we are still left with a wide variety of types of \"schools\" including colleges, universities and schools of thought. For the purposes of this debate we should stick to definition (1a) and should probably restrict the discussion further to public schools as private schools have a different standards and rules too varied to properly cover. If my opponent would prefer to use different definitions I'd appreciate clarification in the next round. This still leaves a variety of electronic devices to cover: Entertainment This is the most easily dismissed category of electronics. Personal entertainment devices in the school environment serve only to distract. They distract not just the child but other children in the same classroom. Their only possible use is improving hand-eye coordination and in an age where childhood obesity and inactivity is rising [3,4] and attention spans are falling [5,6] there are more fit and active ways to achieve this. Children get more than enough electronic entertainment at home so school policies should encourage children to leave their DS at home. Communication Many parents equip their children with mobile phones for safety and basic communication needs. These devices should be allowed in schools but should be kept off during class time. Texting and talking on mobile phones is obviously disruptive in the classroom [7] amongst other perils. The most obvious problems are poor grammar and decreased information retention [8]. Computing Personal computers are one form of electronic device that should not only be allowed but required in schools. In the information age, computer literacy is a requisite for most jobs above the grade of fry cook and should be taught as part of all school curriculums [9]. Back in the day schools taught cursive writing and long division. Today's schools need lessons on proper search techniques and internet privacy. However, these lesson should be taught on school computers. Having children bring their own computers causes a host of problems including: - Theft, loss damage. Problems that will be familiar to anybody who remembers how they treated their textbooks. - Disadvantages to underprivileged students due to the expense of the electronics and the software. - Classes become difficult to impossible to teach when different students all have different computers, operating systems and software. - Teachers have to police a variety of non-class computer issues from minor distractions through cyber-bullying, pornography, phishing scams and sexual predators [10]. As such, computer literacy should be taught at school using school computers. While there are exceptions for students with disabilities who need computers [11], in all other cases student computers become redundant for educational purposes. Student computers should be left at home to prevent damage, distraction and a host of other problems. Conclusions There are few reasons to allow students to bring electronic devices to school and, with a few special exceptions that prove the rule, no good reason to allow their use in school.

            "premise": "1) My opponent concedes that the idea of the multi-category system is good. He just has practical issues with it. So let's address those... 2) My opponent concedes that those users who have given up on their win ratios are doing noble things. He has a problem, though, with individual debate results. I've already responded to this: Phil is currently working on his vote-bomb-removal program. I stated this TWICE, and yet my opponent said nothing in response. The way to fix the voting system is not to completely redo it, but to amend it. My opponent agrees that the main problem is vote bombing, and that is in the process of being taken care of. 3) My opponent concedes that the problem originates from bad users. He writes that Phil's \"position is that members who have legitimately confirmed their account have every right to vote whichever way they choose,\" and I agree. My opponent forgets, though, that his problem is with vote bombers who abuse the system, people who do not legitimately confirm their accounts. And vote bombing is in the process of being taken care of. Again, completely changing the voting system is not necessary. 4) Of course completely changing the current system is impractical! It works okay now, and is in the process of being fixed. And yes, it is harder to go from the current system to the outdated system than from the outdated system to the current system. When v2 became v3, all v2's one-point votes were converted to argumentation votes; the point ratios remained exactly the same. To go back to the outdated system now would require completely distorting the votes. And furthermore, my opponent of all people, as an experienced programmer, should know the months it would take to write a program that would redo all the votes on this site. Again, my opponent's plan is impractical. 5) Has my opponent ever considered that maybe the new system actually helps debaters improve? Since v3, debaters are now more eager to do research so that they can win the sources vote. Since v3, debaters check their spelling and grammar more adamantly. Since v3, the amount of abusive ad hominems have lessened. Of course the new system helps comment communication; people now know what to look out for. 6) My opponent writes, \"It is clear that many voters award all 7 points to their determined winner.\" No it isn't. I don't think so. I believe that if a reader is going to take the time to read a full debate, that they would also take the half a second to think about their votes. And if indeed there exists this minority, I doubt they will have much effect. But I too am merely speculating. My opponent bears the burden of proof in proving that these \"casual voters\" exist. He has failed to do so. This destroys his entire case. 7) My opponent writes, \"Vote bomber identification is irrelevant unless a vote-bomb-removal system is implemented.\" Ummm... my opponent seems oblivious to the fact that a vote-bomb-removal system is in the works. Knowing so destroys his counterargument. The current system allows an easier identification of vote bombers. In closing, my opponent has failed to prove his case. He (1) failed to prove casual voters exist beyond an extremely small minority, (2) failed to recall that a vote-bomb-removal program is in the works, (3) conceded that the idea of our current system is good, (4) conceded that the problem is the users and not the voting system, (5) failed to provide beyond a single argument, (6) failed to prove his singular argument, and (7) ultimately failed to prove the resolution. I'd like to thank my opponent for this wonderful debate, and I would like to thank the audience for taking the time to read this. Thanks!",

While not posing a strong disincentive preventing voters from paying one-time fee to exercise their future right to vote, the principle of paying to vote is unfair and should not be advocated. As a counter-plan to solve the problems of the 2000 and 2004 elections, the solution should be a federal mandate requiring paper trials for all election precincts. A paper trail would allow voter fraud to be caught most efficiently.

I would also like to remind any voters that voting should not just be taken on the specific topic of voting in general elections, or in political spheres, but in the more general topic of merely 'voting' as laid down in my first argument. That said, I would like to conclude the debate by rebutting my opponents final argument; 'In the 2000 presidential election, 1.9 million Americans cast ballots that no one counted.' This shows that many people are uninterested to vote! and therefore making it compulsory would have the numbers rise' No. In fact, it shows nothing of the kind. If readers would be so kind as to actually read the link, the article is a piece on racism, implying that the reason Bush won the elections against Gore was because the vote counters conveniently 'lost' many black votes. Whether the article is accurate or not I have no idea, but it has nothing to do with 'uninterested voters' as my opponent seems to think. 'You state in round 3 that every citizen that is entitled to vote should vote and go on and say that it is in the interest of the people however I disagree as many people do not vote because governments say things and when they get into power they dont act and many of these bad pasts make it unrewarding to vote' Indeed. However, the point of democracy is that if parties consistently fail to live up to their promises, then the people will not vote for them next time round. Also, they can protest, complain, go on strike and even rebel. This is an argument on democracy in general - I don't see how it refutes any particular compulsory or non-compulsory aspect of it. 'You go onto say that it reflects the core values of democracy If people who want to vote vote it gives a bigger voice to people who care about democracy and governments' It would force a lot of people, who would otherwise not be bothered, to really think about who they would like to see leading them. It would renew interest in people who had, indeed, lost interest or faith in the democratic process. 'what is the point of making voting compulsory when people have random votes. And this eliminates voters that have no interest or belief in the process and people who vote are serious about the government' This argument is almost entirely negated by my suggestion to put a 'no suitable candidate' box. People who truly have no interest in the process would vote there. 'so vote for Voting to NOT be compulsory because we have a right to be heard and a right to not be heard when we choose!' Nay, we have a DUTY to uphold, a duty to make sure our leaders represent the will of the people. It is for this reason, and the others laid down, that I implore readers to vote PRO.",

            "conclusion": "The United States should adopt Instant Runoff Voting.",
            "premise": "Thanks for the quick response Mr. Voices. Let's look to my points and whether my opponent adequately refutes them. 1) IRV increases strategic voting My original argument was that ranking your preferred candidate as number 1 can make him/her lose and ranking your least preferred candidate last can help him/her to win. This makes no sense. People have to vote strategically under IRV as well to prevent their votes from being wasted or having a counterproductive result. My opponent says that you can just leave the box blank. But this doesn't answer the argument that \"ranking a candidate higher can actually cause the candidate to lose, and ranking a candidate lower can cause the candidate to win.\" If you leave the box blank, that's equivalent to ranking the candidate last. It doesn't change the problems with IRV. 2) Extra candidates My argument was that IRV is stupid because it's possible that candidate A beats candidate B in a head-to-head election, but if candidate C enters the race, suddenly candidate B beats candidate A. That makes absolutely no sense. Parties will run fake candidates to split the vote of popular candidates so they don't make it to the final 2. My opponent just nitpicks an assumption I make in the scenario I gave, but that's the point of giving hypotheticals: it simplifies the issue so it's easier to understand. And it's not that far-fetched. Median voter theory states that voters will prefer candidates who are closer to them on the political spectrum. So if this is the political spectrum: Liberal Conservative Then it's not that far-fetched to believe that if candidate A loses, all of his supporters will instead vote for candidate B. This proves that fielding extra candidates DOES split the vote, potentially causing the winner in a head-to-head election to instead lose in the first round of vote counting. 3) The candidate with majority support can lose My opponent's response has something to do with doing a poll under the current system. However, the point of this objection is that under ALL voting systems, the person who is preferred by a majority should win (assuming you believe in democracy). However, if you remember the example of John, David, and Peter, the majority preferred John to David, but David wins because Peter knocks John out of the race in round 1. Yet 60% of voters preferred John to David. A \"first past the post\" system better upholds democratic values. 4) People won't research all the additional candidates. My opponent says that this happens now. However, NOW there are usually only two viable candidates. Under instant runoff, your choice of who to rank second or third could entirely sway the outcome of the election. This requires a level of research that people do not do. The two party system simplifies the electoral process for people. I wonder how the majority of voters will choose their rankings, given that few people do research on candidates. It's a double bind: either people rank third party candidates without researching them (which undermines democracy) OR they do the responsible thing and don't rank anyone but the Democrat and Republican, which is functionally the same as the current system. Best case, my opponent is advocating for the current system. Worst case, he is advocating for people making uninformed rankings that can completely alter the outcome of the election. 5) Ballot counting My opponent advocates hand counting. However, his source's speculative claim doesn't seem to be true. You have to pay people to count the ballots by hand. You also have to print a different type of ballot than the ones we currently use with machines. I would like my opponent to prove we can afford such a system. In addition, hand counting leads to its own problems. In Republican states, it is likely Republicans would be counting the ballots. When there are marginal ballots where it's unclear who someone voted for, Republican vote counters are going to be biased and award more marginal ballots to the Republican candidate. Bryan Pfaffenberger, a professor at the University of Virginia, points out, \"By taking paper out of the voting process, mechanical voting machines make it impossible for anyone to invalidate a ballot. A complex interlocking system \u2013 a technological achievement \u2013 prevents overvoting, in which a voter casts votes for more candidates than the law permits. Above all, the voting machine's virtue was precisely that it left nothing for partisan election officials to haggle over.\" He continues, \"Returning to [hand counting] might work well in areas with lots of oversight, but in contrast to other stable democracies, this movement has made little progress in the US. Throughout most of the country, today's election system has more in common with that of the 1890s: It's inadequately supervised, insufficiently professionalized, and all too often staffed with openly partisan officials. Under these circumstances, what voting machine backers believed a century ago still holds true: It just isn't wise to let people count ballots.\" http://www.csmonitor.com... My opponent also doesn't answer the following arguments: *Federalism: each State has the right to adopt its own system. The federal government cannot mandate how they apportion votes. *Electoral college: IRV doesn't work well with winner take all. In states that award electors proportionate to a candidate's share of the vote, you're not \"throwing your vote away\" if you vote third party. That person still gets electors. If all states adopted proportionate systems, that would be preferable to IRV. *Multi-party presidential systems are bad. The Kellogg School (at Northwestern) found that in all of history, there has only been ONE stable multi-party presidential system. Most presidential systems with successful third parties stagnate because the legislature can't get anything done. We can barely get anything done with two parties who always disagree. Imagine if we had 4 or 5 disagreeing. *The Guardian's analysis of the 2010 UK election shows that IRV does NOT increase the number of third party candidates that win. So IRV doesn't accomplish my opponent's goals anyways. *If you don't want to throw your vote away, vote for one of the two major parties. This solves. Even under IRV, Ross Perot would have still lost. The only way IRV could have possibly changed the outcome is that Bush might have beat Clinton because IRV might have screwed up the election. The lack of third parties has to do with our form of government (presidential vs. parliamentary), and NOT with the way the votes are counted.",

A simple reprogram is all that would be needed. You said \"We cant afford to give out ballots to someone that cant vote properly\" In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson, had the Voting Rights Act passed. This act allowed all american citizens the right to vote, ignoring any discrimination. To quote Lyndon B. Johnson, \"Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote.\" This act already covers language disabilities, and there fore it is the government and states duty to provide voting supplies not based on any discrimination. If you deny the right to vote based on language you are discriminating against those that do not speak english. By doing this, you are simply creating another example of the 1960's, when African Americans were not allowed to vote. America does not need this kind of negative attention, when we are already getting enough from the war in Iraq.",

Tucker notes that in Australia\u00a05%\u00a0 of eligible voters did not caste a valid vote. Most countries that use compulsory voting give voters a legal opportunity to abstain. For example, in Australia valid explanations might include being overseas, trying to vote but failing for some reason, or belonging to a religious order which prohibits voting (Electoral Commission). Moreover people who vehemently refuse to vote find a way to do so such as paying the fine straight away (for those who can afford to) or attending the polling station but submitting a blank ballot. McAllister et al (1992)1\u00a0conclude that compulsory voting has led to a higher level of non-votes because the only legal method of political protest is to spoil the ballot paper or leave it blank deliberately\u00a02. However, in non-compulsory jurisdictions voters so motivated would boycott the ballot. Furthermore, forcing people to vote will lead to more meaningless votes. People who are forced to vote against their will won\u2019t make a proper considered decision.\u00a0 At best they will vote randomly which disrupts the proper course of voting. Compared to countries that have no compulsory voting laws, in countries where such laws exist there is an increase in donkey votes (where voters simply chose the candidate at the top of the ballot), random votes, \"just for the fun of it\" votes, protest votes and abstentions. This does not contribute to improved legitimacy of the government. It merely allows the government to say 'because there is a 100% turnout, this government is 100% legitimate', which is clearly not the case.\u00a0 There is a reason why some people are less politically active.\u00a0They neither know nor care about politics.\u00a0\u00a0How can their\u00a0forced inputadd legitimacy to the mix?

            "premise": "http://www.time.com... - this is why voter ID laws are bad. Legal citizens who have residencies and polling places cannot vote because their college ID, birth certificate and drivers licenses are not proof enough. I have a question. Why, if voter fraud that can be stopped by ID's, is enough of a problem that it effects national, state, or township elections and delegitimizes the vote is this a partisan issue? I will tell you why Republicans push this and democrats do not. It is because the legitimate voters that this causes a hurdle for or those whom it stops completely are almost all democrat. The young, the intercity poor and the old retired who may have trouble getting the right ID become disenfranchised and won't make their voices heard because they can't be \"trusted\". In fact, in PA alone, since voter ID laws came in to place voting , which had been moving steadily up, slowed. More people were barred from voting then all the voter fraud in the state for 10 years earlier until now. You say that you are protecting voting when your causing less people to vote. My parents are democrats who live in a republican area after redistricting. For many elections their vote counts for nothing because the republicans always win. We need to be looking at the other ways we are destroying the vote, not the negligible amount of fraud. To answer your question I refer to my previous statement that most of the voter fraud is not done by non-citizens or done in a way that allows for requiring ID. Basically when you move to an area or reach 18 your polling place will contact you and set up your account using government records to identify you as a citizen. If every person eligible in this country voted instead of barring young and poor than fraud would be impossible. By making it harder for people to vote you are making fraud more effective by giving those who commit large scale fraud in ways that do not require ID (electronics rigging, absentee voter impersonation) more potential votes to use. By the way, firearms, alcohol and driving can kill other people. Voter fraud has never effected a major election or even on a county level. Why bar legitimate voters to stop the 10 people casting 1 illegal vote each when the votes of those barred is much greater than fraud that can be stopped by ID laws. You say that it is harmful enough to the people that blocking thousands of voters is important enough to catch them. I say, then why is this an issue of Democrats vs. Republicans and not something agreed upon. I would suggest that republicans are trying to block the Democrats voting base. Is it a coincidence that the legitimate voters barred from voting the most are the young and the poor? Sorry if I made spelling, grammar, punctuation errors or my sources didn't get on. I'm trying to type from an iPod touch, which is difficult.",

The argument that they can provide a faster vote-count is negated by the fact that in many cases they aren\u2019t counting all the votes, but instead missing some out[3]. If the results cannot be trusted, there is no merit in implementing an electronic vote. Furthermore, this motion neglects those who do not have access to electronic systems or the internet; they may end up being disenfranchised if voting went online. This is particularly pertinent for senior citizens who lack the skills to \u2018find, retrieve and evaluate\u2019 information found electronically[4]. It is also a disadvantage for those who with a limited income and education, who are \u2018most likely to not use the internet or even understand how to use a computer\u2019[5]. 37% of low-income households do not regularly use the internet[6]; this motion would create a two-tier system where already under-represented groups are allowed to fall behind the rest of society. Even public libraries and state-provided resources are suffering cuts under the economic depression[7], which further reduces access for those from poorer backgrounds. This allows real issues of discrimination and alienation to rise.

The election results from compulsory voting may not be a representative view of society, than the current systems. Just because people are required to vote does not mean they become more politically engaged than they were before. Rather than forcing people to vote, more should be done to engage the public in political life. Government transparency should be further encouraged as well as evaluating to what extent the current voting system causes low voter turnout. Low turnout is best cured by more education. Instead of trying to engage people\u00a0by force, how about introducing political education in schools and encouraging political conversation. How about educating the public on how politics affects them? Citizenship classes should be taught to students who are approaching voting age, as it would teach the importance of the electoral process, and the history of the suffragette movement, the reform bills of the 19th century and the responsibilities of living in a democracy. The government should be trying to engage people by other means, not compulsory voting. Compulsory voting may improve low turnout but will not affect the root problem- what people actually think about politics. In essence it is just relieving the side effects without curing the disease. \u00a0 \u00a0 improve this \u00a0",

            "conclusion": "Voter photo id laws.",
            "premise": "INTEGRITY This one of those debates that just needs to center around common sense. Common sense tells us that the voting process should have some integrity. We should be able to trust that the official elected to office was elected by a majority and not by a small group of people engaging in fraud. None of us wants our vote canceled out by somebody who voted twice. Election fraud even if supposedly rare now is something that needs to remain rare and with the citizens of America (and probably several other countries), becoming more divided over politics are also becoming more incentivized to win by unethical practices. After all you are keeping a scary monster out of office in the mind of the average person. It is my contention that it is better to take a proactive approach to preventing election fraud. The last thing we want is some Manchurian candidate who gets into office by the extreme effort of a small group of people. We saw something similar to that in DDO\"s last election (not counting the \"emergency\" election that elected Ore-el). A small group of people controlled the outcome of that election and it probably wasn\"t fair. The dangers the Democratic process faces, needs to be anticipated instead of responded to. By the time we know to respond to a stolen election, it is probably too late. I\"m not really alone in this either. This is basically a common sense position that most people agree with. According to one study 75% of voters agree with voter ID laws. If we were to put voter ID laws to a vote, the people would decide it is a good idea. THE MYTH OF VOTER SUPPRESSION I do have legitimate studies that show that voter ID laws in fact do not suppress votes, but before I reveal those, I want to explain the voting process so the voters can understand why this is the case. Being turned away at the polls, does not indicate being turned away from voting. What happens to a voter if they show up without a photo ID in states with voter ID laws is that they receive what is known as a provisional ballot. They vote on this ballot and a lot of times, no further effort is needed on the voter\"s part. Other times the voter may receive a letter in the mail just to check a few boxes and return to insure they have their vote counted, and that they actually cast the vote. [1] I also want to take the time to note that reasonable accommodations are made to help people vote who would be overly affected by voter ID laws. Accommodations allowed by most states: =607;1.\"Have religious objections to being photographed (Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin) =607;2.Are indigent (Indiana, Tennessee) =607;3.\"Have a reasonable impediment\" to getting an ID (South Carolina) =607;4.Do not have an ID as a result of a recent natural disaster (Texas) =607;5.People who are victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking and have a \"confidential listing\" (Wisconsin)\" [1] The voter ID laws do not affect absentee ballots or mailed ballots.[1] So if an individual is extremely burdened to get an ID, they can just mail a form. I get these forms in the mail every election cycle. It is actually probably even way more convenient just to check a few boxes, lick the envelope and shove this stuff into a mailbox According to on highly respected news source who used available data from Georgia and Indiana where these laws have been in place for some time: \"(Reuters) - Democratic claims that a large number of Americans could be prevented from voting because of photo identification laws are probably overstated based on evidence from Georgia and Indiana, the two states where the laws have been in place for multiple elections, Reuters found.\" [2] These states have also done a lot to reduce the fear of critics. For example they have made sure to hand out free ID\"s and I see no reason why other states could not replicate that, since it has been so successful. VOTER FRAUD Voter fraud does happen and since ID isn\"t required in many places it is extremely hard to detect. Some other types of voter fraud mentioned in an article by USA Today include \"Critics of voter ID laws also fail to note they are designed not just to stop voter impersonation but also multiple voting, non-citizen voting, people voting in the wrong precinct, out-of-state voting and voting in the names of fictitious people.\" Voter fraud is hard to detect because of the secret nature of the ballot on top of the fact no ID is needed to vote. The highly touted news 21 study has a ton of flaws and is basically trash. This study was done by several college students and funded by very liberal sponsors. There was definitely a conflict of interest which is not enough to discredit the study on its own. The news 21 study was extremely amateur and not useful in any way. \" Essentially, they politely asked for public officials to send them all of their examples they had of election fraud.\"[5] According to their own criticisms of the study; \"[I]t is possible that some jurisdictions which did respond failed to include some cases. Despite the huge News21 public-records request effort, the team received no useful responses from several states. Hundreds of officials responded with short notes \" some handwritten, even coffee-stained \" saying they had no cases of fraud. Some jurisdictions insisted that their computer system lacked the capability to search for election fraud cases. Dozens of jurisdictions flatly refused the requests. For nearly all the data News21 received, there would be some vital piece of information that had been requested specifically but that was missing. [T]here are cases in the database that contain so little detail that they cannot be properly categorized as one kind of fraud or another.\" [5] CONCLUSION I appreciate Four Trouble allowing me to debate this with him. Next round I plan on contesting just about every piece of evidence my opponent has brought forward. Election fraud is real, no legitimate study has been done to know exactly how significant it is but we should proceed with caution and do everything in our power to protect the integrity of our election process. If people think their votes are being erased by those who engage in fraud they will become disenfranchised Thank you. sources 1.http://www.ncsl.org... 2.http://www.reuters.com... 3.http://www.usnews.com... 4.http://www.usatoday.com... 5.http://www.conservativeblog.org...",

            "discussionTitle": "Online voting should replace traditional voting.",
            "conclusion": "Online voting should replace traditional voting.",
            "premise": "I staunchly disagree! Online voting should NOT replace traditional voting. It holds far too many ways to fail than suceed. Idealy, yes, for convenience sake online voting would be far superior to traditional voting. However it makes the already problematic voter fraud even easier then it already is. While you have listed ways that you think will be able to prevent this, I shall now go through and show how each is inevitably able to fail to virus', hackers, and general vote bombers. c-1: Voting fraud on this site has not been unheard of, and debate.orgs 'fail safe' with cell phone identity is a speed bump at best. All one needs is a phone number that can recieve text messages, an viola, that account can vote. I do not have a phone that can recieve TM, and so am unable to confirm my identity, though I know I exist. This means I can't vote, which is very inconvenient. However, if I so chose to I could get one or convince a friend or even steal a phone and \"confirm\" my identity tot he satisfaction of debate.orgs fail safe, though as you can see there are more dishonest ways to pass this than the honest one. Now, for your example of what I am assuming are serious political elections, you say that a social security number will do the trick. Not so. Just as with the cell phone all one needs to do attain a SSN, and they are now that person whether they are or not. If you have contention with this then you are probably not aware of identity theft [http://www.ftc.gov...]. Now as you'll have surly noticed this site is not just about what identity theft (IT) is but how to fight it. I fully admit that there are ways to fight IT after it has happened, though they are often lengthy, inconvenient, and costly. In all cases, IT could be fought but not after the damage has been done. This means that in a serious election, the mere possibility of the damages of IT far outweight the benefit of convenience. An election where seemingly thousands have voted could just as well be 1 person, or group with a particular agenda. Even if 1 vote is not that of the legitimate holder of the SSN, your fail safe has failed. It is far more pssoible than not, and for this reason, online voting clearly fails. C-2: If we lived in a perfect world then you'd be right. An electronic voting system would be more relable in counting votes. That is, if those votes were real and reliable. As I've already shown, the reliablity of votes is already in question. But whether a real person in any degree cast those is also in question. A virus, especially a well designed one, could easily pass through a fail safe of any kind, and perform a simple operation of changing a 1 into a 2, or 3, etc. Hacks and viruses into what where thought to be secure systems is all too common, and a simple google search can reveal hundreds of stories of real life scenarios where such a thing happened. Here's on that happened just 2 years ago [http://www.crn.com...] and a famous story where the FBI's database was hacked into [http://www.computerworld.com...]. The moral of the story is that if there is a will, then there's a way, especially when it comes to computers. Vote bots exist, and are able to be purchased easily and effectively, as well as (obviously) designed [http://cheatingnetwork.net...]. So again here, electronic votes fail as they would only suceed if there were not people who would exploit them. C-3: Sure they do, but it isn't as easy to fraud those as it is from a computer. With absentiee votes there is an official form, that has to be filled out be hand. A very lengthy process and definetly not immune to the effects of fraud, but it would take more time and resources to produce anywhere near the amount of damage that can be caused by a few key strokes. I believe I've sufficently described how that can happen above. C-4: Undoubtably, but like I've shown, for every honest elderly shut in who could use the technology to vote, there are more who would use it exploit their own agendas dishonestly. CONCLUSION: Given the unreliabilty and accessibility that a hacker or virus could take advantage of over the web, online voting does more harm than good. With traditional voting, were one has to go into a set voting center, and show an ID that matches the person to it to another living person, the chance of fraud exists but is minimalized by the ability to verify the actual physical existence of a person right then and there. Opperations to commit fraud with traditional voting are far more costly, time consuming, and active (as in one has to get up and go do something) than it is with a computer. No system is perfect but a computerized voting system is far more so in the ease that it could be hacked. So while we are not in contention that a online system would do some good, I hold that it's far too easily penetrated by wrongdoers for it to become the mechanism that decides the course of an entire country, or even county.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: in a democracy voting ought to be compulsory",
            "premise": "I agree with the definitions posited by the Negative, with one slight exception. The Negative defines \"ought\" as \"expressing obligation.\" I would suggest that \"ought\" expresses moral desirability, particularly as \"ought\" implies a value judgment. For example, the statements \"you ought not to steal the cookies\" and \"you ought to go and see your grandmother\" are statements that connote what is the most morally desirable course of action. The statement is obligation you to go and see your grandmother, but it is implying that it is the moral thing to do. I will now present the AC: FDR once declared, \"Nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves, and the only way they could do this is by not voting.\" Because I agree, I affirm the resolution. I Value Governmental Legitimacy. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes, \"legitimacy is negative: it offers an account of when effective authority ceases to be legitimate.\" Stanford goes on to claim that a government ceases to be legitimate when it no longer respects the rights of its citizenry, specifically those rights enumerated in UDHR. Prefer this debate as the resolution is essentially questioning whether voting needs to be universal for a democratic government to remain legitimate. I propose the Criterion of Promoting Electoral Equality, as ensuring that no one group dominates at the polls, and thus holds undue sway over the government. For example, if group A votes more than group B, elected officials will favor group A, maybe even to the point of impinging on group B's rights. My thesis is that compulsory voting is key to promoting electoral equality. Contention One: Low voter turnout threatens democracy and governmental legitimacy. \"In a modern democracy, it is ultimately the will of the people expressed through periodic elections that decide the fate of the people. In practical terms, modern democracy has come to mean government based on majority rule. The leaders acquire political power and strength because the people's power is vested in them through elections--If voter turnout is very poor and if votes are split by too many candidates contesting a seat, the government ceases to be majority rule. In such situations, it is the minority of voters who run the government. This goes counter to the principle of majority rule, which is an important ingredient of democracy. An effective remedy to meet this deficiency is to find an alternative to the first-past-the-post system.\" [1] \"U.S. elections are not even particularly well-designed polls because they are not based on a representative sample of eligible voters. Rather, they rely on a racially and socioeconomically skewed sample. Because of this, America could actually achieve a more representative government by doing away with the current election system, and instead polling a large, representative sample of eligible voters, despite the fact that such a mechanism for selecting government leaders seems inherently unfair and might violate the Equal Protection Clause. Given how limited the franchise was until the twentieth century, and the low rates of voter turnout in recent decades, it is likely that no U.S. President has ever received a majority of the votes of the American adult population. In the 1984 election, for example, Ronald Reagan won a \"landslide\" victory, but received the votes of only 32.9% of the potential electorate. The preferences of the other 67.1% of eligible voters were either for a different candidate or simply left unaccounted for...fundamentally, there is a serious tension with the understanding \"that within our constitutional tradition, democracy is prized because of the value of collective self-governance,\" which is as much about procedure as it is about substance. Indeed, the level of voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters in many recent elections would not even be sufficient to constitute a quorum for some of the most important American political institutions...Partly because of disparities in turnout rates by demographic categories, the center of political gravity has shifted toward the wealthiest white Americans.\" [2] Contention Two: Compulsory voting will help alleviate these problems. Sub-point A: Turnout will likely go up: \"Academic analysis shows that compulsory voting is likely to produce a high turnout of voters, wherever it is used. There is no doubt that the Australian arrangements produce a high figure, for Australia's is one of the most consistently high turnouts anywhere in the world -- an average of 94.5 percent in the 24 elections since 1946.\" [3] \"One solution to the problem of low voter turnout is to require all eligible voters to vote by law. Approximately twenty-four nations have some kind of compulsory voting law, representing 17% of the world's democratic nations. The effect of compulsory voting laws on voter turnout is substantial. Multivariate statistical analyses have shown that compulsory voting laws raise voter turnout by seven to sixteen percentage points. The effects are likely to be even greater in a country such as the United States, which has a much lower baseline of voter turnout than many of the countries that have already adopted compulsory voting.\" [2] Higher vote turn out will combat the problems named in Contention One. Sub-point B: Reduced Polarization: \"It is also possible that increasing turnout will increase the representativeness of the electorate in another way that might help put a dent in one of the major ills of the current political discourse in America: polarization. The electorate and the parties have become more polarized - some might say hyper-polarized - by playing more and more to the extremes and crowding out the center. This has a negative impact on political discourse and can serve to diminish participation by those citizens who have less extreme views. Importantly, the citizens who are currently being left out of the mix in terms of political participation tend to be less connected to the two major political parties. Put another way, the citizens who are most engaged in politics and turn out to vote also tend to be the most extremist in terms of political outlook.\" [4] Sub-point C: More inclusive: \"Unless public engagement with the democratic process improves, our leaders may well find themselves elected by precariously small proportions of the eligible population, which will cast doubt on the popular mandate behind their policy initiatives\"the have-nots increasingly shun electoral means of addressing their concerns, they may resort to more disruptive forms of political action. Social unrest manifests itself as a quintessentially economic problem, but it is also closely linked to constitutional and political structures, as these structures define the options citizens have at their disposal for voicing dissent--Increasing the electoral participation rates of deprived and marginalised social groups is a key means of incentivising political parties to pay attention to their needs, and thereby of heading off destabilising forms of social unrest.\" [5 Thus, I stand in firm affirmation of the resolution. I shall rebut the NC more in-depth in my next speech, but just a few quick notes: C1: Firstly, voting is a civic responsibility; everyone should do it. It is not some onerous imposition upon your freedom, rather, mandatory voting is simply formalizing the responsibility that you should have been meeting before. Additionally, autonomy is too often used as an excuse to ignore that civic duty. Secondly, your actually increase your autonomy by voting. Voting is a check against government becoming too intrusive; voting protects minority rights; and permits you to freely express your choice and your voice in governmental decision-making. C2: Neg gives no evidence regarding how much his reforms will actually boost turnout. Even if we educate people, that doesn't mean that they'll vote more. But education of voters isn't unqiue to the Neg, it's permutation of my advocacy. In the Aff world people can be educated and mandated to vote, ensuring high poll turnout and informed voters. And who says compulsory voting has to be hard; all of my opponent's suggestions could be incorporated into my own case. How about online compulsory voting, or house-to-house aid, or rides to polling places for those in need. My point is that everything Neg has suggested is non-unique; I can do it too. Coupled with complusions on voting, these measures would cause turnout to be even higher and would make voters far more educated. V/C: Autonomy is important, but the impact on society as a whole is also key. Gov. Legit. would maximize both. The criterion is circular logic. Aristotle says we shouldn't be forced to do things. Autonomy is self-direction. Basically, Neg is supporting autonomy with autonomy. Plus, I can link, as voting promotes freedom. Sources: [1] T. S.

By their very nature, electronic voting systems must be inter connected and in continuous communication with one another. As a consequence, the devices and methods used to gather votes can also serve as access points to the larger network of vote gathering and counting systems. The most \u2018secure\u2019 of websites have been recently hacked. For example, Paypal was hacked by Lulzsec in response to the Wikileaks scandal[1]. Lulzsec also hacked the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)[2], supposedly the source of all their national intelligence and top secret information. If anything, recent events have shown us that the internet is an unstable medium for people to conduct personal or professional affairs; we certainly should not allow our voting systems to become even more vulnerable to this kind of attack. A better way to prevent identity fraud would be the simple measure of now requiring polling stations to ask for ID, rather than going to the extreme of online voting.

            "conclusion": "Personal electronic devices in the classroom should be allowed",
            "premise": "Personal Electronic Devices in the classroom should not be allowed: Since my opponent wants to use the quality of education as the standard in this debate; I will argue that the quality of education deteriorates with the usage of Personal Electronic Devices. Personal Electronic Devices defined my opponent; \"Personal electronics refers to any instrument that uses electricity, for ex: tablets, cell phones, and computers that is owned by the student for at least a one-year term.\" Therefore, Personal Electronic Devices are completely independent from education. Their usage can or cannot be used for the purposes of education, depending on the the responsibility of those who use them. Since my opponent has quoted studies that refer to the improvement of education from K-12 and College, I am going to use this age group as the standard for the quality of improvement. In this age group, an area known as the frontal lobes is not fully developed. The frontal lobes are responsible for executive function which are critical to logical decision making. So if Personal Electronic Devices are allowed in the classroom, then logically people in this age group would struggle make proper decisions. Therefore Personal Electronic Devices would deteriorate the quality of education. I do agree with the contention that Electronic Devices administered by the school would help in the quality of education. They provide a reminder to students that the Electronic Devices in this context are for the purposes of education. However they do not belong to the students, the duration in which they borrow them they are not ever owned by the students. If something happens to the Electronic Device, they are obligated to compensate of at most a value equal to the device in question; depending on whatever the true owner decides. Therefore, Electronic Devices administered by the school cannot be considered as evidence to support my opponents argument. Two of my opponents arguments use Electronic Devices administered by the school as evidence for his contention that Personal Electronic Devices help in the quality of education. Based upon the logic above, they cannot be used as evidence and are empty arguments. The last contention asserts that Personal Electronic Devices help in the quality of education because they promote group learning. This may be true, however they do not provide evidence in why they should be allowed in class. My opponent uses the definition according to thirteen.org: \u2022diversity \u2022more interaction in student learning \u2022Peer feedback According to \"Pros and Cons of File Sharing\", file sharing, or exchanging files on a computer network, encourages: \u2022Flow of ideas from everyone \u2022Efficient working: each student can revise on different computers at the same time. \u2022Therefore, file sharing can involve more students compiling up their ideas into one report, thus improving the learning experience for children. Personal Electronic Devices do not promote group learning in the classroom. All the above points do not require a Personal Electronic Device. All above bullet points refer to good communication, a Personal Electronic Device facilitating communication would obviously slow the process of communication between two people in the same room. Since the burden of proof is on my opponent, if I refute his arguments as I have done; then I have won this argument.",

            "premise": "Hmm. Even though my opponent has forfeited, I shall still go ahead and form a rebuttals agaisnt her case...==Rebuttals==CON says \"Electoral vote enhances the status of minority groups. This is so because the voters of even small minorities in a state may make the difference between winning all of that states electoral votes or none of that states electoral votes.\"1) Consider this situation....A) There are, say, 1 billion people in a state \"x\"....B) 499 million people are democrats, while 501 million people are republicans....C) In the current electoral system, all of a state's electoral votes go towards one candidate. It's an all-or-nothing system....D) The voices and opinions of 499 million people are ignored, due to this system. CON claims that the electoral college helps out minorities, but I fail to see how the minority party's voice is being heard.CON says \"The founders intent was to filter the vote so in case of regional antagonism their is a reasonable solution. \"1) Situations change over time. America isn't the same as it was 200 years ago.2) The founders weren't always correct, just like other leaders of America.CON says \"Electoral vote does a better job representing the country as a whole. Since we have different leaders for each state, some of the larger states could over power others votes. Electoral vote provides balance to this. Smaller States Equal Say.\"1) Electoral vote discourages the minority voters, worsening the representation of the entire country. 2) ...A) CON states that we have different representives for each state...(Which is true)...B) CON then says that the larger state would over power others.I don't understand CON's logic here. There is no connection between what CON said.CON says \"Recounts are confined to a few states. It avoids recount of the entire nation. If we had to recount through the entire nation, the chances of fraud would go up tremendously. An across the nation recount might be REQUIRED if we had direct popular vote if the president.\"1) I've stated why recounts aren't that hard. A lot of voting is done electronically.2) How would fraud occur? CON says \"In direct election of the president people might stuff the ballots.... We are not all angles in this world. There is bad people out there.\"1) Electronic voting prevents this.2) The same could be said about the electoral college.CON says \" it allows small states and small towns to have a say in the election. It allows smaller states with a smaller population, have an equal pull to a larger state. The candidates go to every corner of the battle ground states, so people get to meet and question them, \"I'm originally from a small state and I think this is one of the major benefits of the electoral collage.\" Says David Leip.1) CON even admits that cantidates spend a tremendous amount of time on battle ground states. This simply supports my point about how cantidates often ignore states that they are winning tremendously or losing badly. Sure, some people would like the attention, but would the ignored like it?2) Popular vote forces cantidates to spread out their campaigning, as every vote counts.CON says \"It lowers campaign costs. If politicians did have to campaign equally in every state just so they could get every vote, it would substantially raise the coasts of campaigns. Campaigning like that would cost over 2 BILLION dollars.\"1) Spending limits are put on cantidates. http://www.fec.gov...) If everyone is at the same disadvantage, it would no longer be a 'disadvantage'.3) No evidence is given for the number of 2 billion.==Voters==1. Conduct - a) I deserve it due to CON's forfeit.2. Spelling and Grammar -a)Some of CON's mistakes: \"The founders intent was to filter the vote so in case of regional antagonism their is a reasonable solution. \" (ROUND 1 CONTENTION 2)...and...\" Electoral vote provides balance to this. Smaller States Equal Say.\" (ROUND 1 CONTENTION 3)Grammar issues are apparent in the examples I have given.3) Convincing Arguments - a) I've answered all of CON's questions and responded to her case.b) She didn't answer any of my questions, and she did not respond to my case. 4)Reliable Sources - a) I've used plenty of sources.b) She hasn't used any sources.=======VOTE PRO :D!",

We know that discouraged and poor aren't voting in non-CV countries. Why not put in place a system where these underrepresented groups are assured a vote. Australia, a CV-Country, votes on Sundays and even accepts doctors notes to ensure fairness. The right not to vote shouldn't be mistaken as \"your vote doesn't matter\".

            "premise": "Resolved: Personal Electronic Devices in the classroom should be allowed. WLPPF Def: \u2022Personal electronics refers to any instrument that uses electricity, for ex: tablets, cell phones, and computers that is owned by the student for at least a one-year term. Standard: The standard, or weighing mechanism, for this debate should be the quality of education. Since this debate is about personal electronics in the classroom, it will impact education the most. The team that can best prove that their side of the resolution betters the quality of education should win today's debate. WTS, WH3A Contention 1: Ebooks Ebooks, or books read on screens, are the new revolutionary way of reading. Educause.edu asserts that ebooks improve learning because they: \u2022have built-in dictionaries, pronunciation guides, and highlighting, motivating students to check the meaning of each word and pronounce it correctly \u2022can also integrate video, audio, animation, and interactive simulation \u2022Access to newspapers for free In addition, there is cost benefits, according to about.com: \u2022Average of $5.50 savings per nonfiction book and textbooks \u2022Average of $2 savings per fiction book So judge, clearly ebooks have more capabilities that regular books. These capabilities have been shown to enhance learning, and provide costs at a lower price. This argument ties into the standard because, obviously, if you have something at a lower cost, you would most likely buy it. Therefore, students will have more educational materials with them, and the savings can also translate into increased funding for other classes that can further enhance student learning. Contention 2: Enhances learning According to Report to the President on the Use of Technology to strengthen K-12 Education in the United States, co-authored by Charles Vest, the former president of MIT, electronics have been very promising to improve America's education by giving us: \u2022valuable skills in logic \u2022Access to educational websites \u2022More extracurricular and interactive learning These skills have been shown to yield the following results: \u2022Carrollton City School District (Georgia): Computer technology has reduced the dropout rate from 19 percent to 5 percent (74% decrease), and the failure rate in ninth grade algebra from 38 percent to 3 percent (92% decrease). \u2022Clearview Elementary School (California): the use of technology resulted in an increase in standardized test scores from the bottom 10 percent to the highest 20 percent in the state. Maine.gov also states that student assigned laptops have improved the student's education: \u2022Writing scores improved by 33% \u20222 times more students met the state standards vs. students who weren't assigned a laptop in class. \u2022Professors from UC Berkeley found students who use laptops excessively did 11% better than the other students in her class. \u2022National center for education statistics says that 76% of grades have improved with technology in class and will improve with electronics they can take home. As you can see, judge, personal electronic devices have already prevailed in classrooms that have already allowed them. They are shown to enhance learning and improve the quality of education, tying into our standard. Contention 3: Group learning and file sharing According to thirteen.org, group learning encourages: \u2022diversity \u2022more interaction in student learning \u2022Peer feedback According to \"Pros and Cons of File Sharing\", file sharing, or exchanging files on a computer network, encourages: \u2022Flow of ideas from everyone \u2022Efficient working: each student can revise on different computers at the same time. \u2022Therefore, file sharing can involve more students compiling up their ideas into one report, thus improving the learning experience for children. Since dictionary.com defines file sharing as exchanging files on a computer network, it can only be done electronically. In addition, email and other network servers promote group learning, and all of its benefits. If personal electronic devices were allowed in the classroom, the quality of education for students could improve a lot by promoting both group learning and file sharing.",

            "discussionTitle": "Mandatory Voting",
            "conclusion": "Mandatory Voting",
            "premise": "I would like to begin by thanking missbailey8 for accepting this debate. I have read your previous debates and am delighted to be debating someone who is well articulated and experienced. Arguments- 1. Voting is a moral and civic duty2. Mandatory voting will increase representation3. Mandatory voting will reduce polarization4. Mandatory voting will increase voter participation and knowledge When we vote, we make a conscious decision that will effect the entire nation. Often times, our choices will have consequences, whether good or bad, that could last for generations. In his book, The Ethics of Voting, Princeton philosopher Jason Brennan writes: \"Voting is morally significant. Voting changes the quality, scope, and kind of government. The way we vote can help or harm people. Electoral outcomes can be harmful or beneficial, just or unjust. They can exploit the minority for the benefit of the majority. They can do widespread harm with little benefit for anyone.\" [1] Brennan further writes: \"Voting is the principal way that citizens influence the quality of government. No activity is more emblematic of democracy. Some call voting a civic sacrament. Many people approach democracy, and voting especially, with a quasi-religious reverence.\" [2] In his debate, debate.org use whiteflame writes: \"[Democracy is] the basis for how our country continues to function, and an essential component in determining who represents the country. As such, voting is necessary to keep the country functioning for the benefit of the people. It's beneficial for all eligible voters to understand that necessity, and to be aware that their duty as citizens is to be involved in the composition of their government, and thus to be involved in the laws it passes. This is the same reason why jury duty is compulsory, as it ensures that the courts can function properly.\" [3] So in conclusion, we get this: P1: In democratic countries, voting is the primary way in which the government functions.P2: It is therefore our moral and civic duty to ensure that the government runs properly.C: Therefore, the government ought to make voting mandatory. Among the mantras of democracy is the concept of the consent of the governed. One of the many problems in the United States is the anemic voter turnout. This, in turn, creates a situation in which the vast majority of eligible voters do not consent to the current form of government, nor the leaders in charge. For example, in the State of Maine, the gubernatorial election in 2014 had three candidates. Paul LePage, the highly unpopular governor, won re-election with only 48 percent of the vote. (4) This means that for those who actually voted, 51 per cent did not consent to him being the next governor. How would mandatory voting increase representation? Whiteflame further notes (3): \"Part of the reason that voting is so important is because it ensures that your views play a role in how your part of the country, and the country as a whole, are represented. Representation is enhanced by having a larger voting bloc, but that's a basic hazard of democracy in any case. What changes in a voluntary voting system? Those sectors of the public that turn out to vote. Who turns out to vote? Those with higher incomes. Voter apathy is inversely correlated with wealth, as those with more wealth tend to vote more often. This means that these groups receive less representation, as the leadership of our political parties has little reason to see to their needs over those of the rich. Compulsory voting ameliorates this problem, making voting blocs the size of their populations, and, perhaps, even reducing the gridlock that we currently see between political parties. This is what we've seen in studies conducted in Australia, a country that employs compulsory voting. In the end, this ensures that special interest groups and extremist subsets of the population have less control, and over the way U.S. policy is conducted, and have to convince broader subsets of the population that their intentions are for a larger overall benefit than simply for themselves.\" Thus to conclude: P1: Democracy is based on the consent of the peopleP2: Citizens show consent by voting.P3: Mandatory voting increases representation and consent of the people.C1: Therefore, a democracy without high electoral turnout rules without consent.C2: Therefore, voting ought to be mandatory. Among the issues with voter turnout is the high polarization in the United States. Justin Valasek in his research for Duke University noted: \"When turnout is strategic and citizens have decreasing intensity of political preferences, I show that an incentive to maximize turnout among the base can cause candidates to take partisan positions, in contrast to the median voter result under full turnout. I then study how the results of this model change with the introduction of measures to increase turnout. In contrast to previous literature on turnout and mandatory voting, which takes candidate positions as fixed, I analyze the effect on both who wins the election and the candidates\u2019 political positions.R32;R32;I show that at high enough levels, measures to increase turnout result in convergence at the median citizen\u2019s ideal point. As voting is made cheaper, or strictly beneficial (through subsidies), the strategic effect of turnout on candidates disappears, returning the median voter result.\" So, if we made voting mandatory, the results will be that the candidates will largely take political positions that represent a broader aspect of the said population, thus creating a more centrist government as Eric Liu writes (6): \"In today\u2019s electorate, hardcore partisan believers are over-represented; independents and moderates are under-represented. If the full range of voters actually voted, our political leaders, who are exquisitely attuned followers, would go where the votes are: away from the extremes. And they would become more responsive to the younger, poorer and less educated Americans who don\u2019t currently vote.\" One of the main arguments used by those who do not support mandatory voting is the issue of low-informed voters; however, by making voting mandatory, we will prompt more voters to pay attention to politics. Eric Liu further notes (6): \"Third, mandatory voting would prompt more Americans to pay attention to the choices. Those of us who lament the decline of civic knowledge generally focus on the supply side of the equation: more civics education. A mandate would stimulate the demand side, motivating more voters to learn what they were voting on (just as a draft makes the drafted motivated to learn what they\u2019d fight for). There are many arguments against mandatory voting; each reflects a lack of faith in democracy itself. One says that increasing the number of uninformed voters will lead to worse policymaking. That presumes, however, that policymaking today sets a high-water mark of enlightenment. It also sets up a viciously antidemocratic circle: if you don\u2019t vote you must be stupid and if you are stupid you must not vote.\" | Conclusion | In democratic society mandatory voting is necessary for the government to be able to properly function. Voting will also help to reduce polarization, and increase knowledge and awareness of the government. I affirm the resolution. Over to con! _______ Sources 1. Brennan, Jason. The Ethics of Voting.

            "conclusion": "Voting on Debate.org Should Be One Point Per Vote",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for taking this debate, especially given his experience with previous versions of the Debate.org voting system. Having joined only a few months ago, I was unaware the current voting system was an added feature in version 3. However, I remain resolute in my position that a one-point voting system is better for this site. 1) My opponent begins his rebuttal with the accusation that my \"entire premise is flawed,\" and backs this claim with ambiguous qualification, simply saying that the \"old debate.org system was much, much worse.\" How much worse exactly? He says there was a reason they asked for change but does not list it. Perhaps he meant for the reason to be explained in his other counter arguments; nevertheless I can guess the reason. As I stated in my previous round, the idea behind the current voting system is great. The IDEA is great. I am willing to bet that all serious debaters on this site appreciate the idea of having a more precise assessment of their performance. I myself admit the very IDEA brought me to this site. My premise, however, is that the idea only works if the majority of voters execute it in practice. As I showed in my first round, this is not the case. 2) My argument in no way rests on the assumption that users care about their win ratios. I am well aware of askbob's personal Terms of Service and Kleptin's intentional 0% win ratio. The motive behind their actions is evidence of the current voting system's flaws. The actions of these fine men are the result of inaccurate voting results, specifically in the form of prejudicial vote bombing. My argument rests, instead, on the assumption that users care about individual debate results, hoping to gain insight so they might improve in the future. 3) My opponent wants to shift the focus from the system to its users, but this does not comport with the philosophy of the site's creator, Phil. His position is that members who have legitimately confirmed their account have every right to vote whichever way they choose. If user voting is flawed, it is because the system allows for such flaws. So long as the administration does not intend to police votes (if that were even practically possible), total reliance falls upon the system itself. 4) I never conceded my system to be impractical and respectfully ask my opponent to quote me. If the webmaster was able to go from a single-point system to the current system, then he can do the opposite. To simply say it's too much work is a red herring. 5) As I stated in my previous round, thoughtful voters could still assess all areas of debate. My system in no way inhibits it. Thoughtful voters are capable of explaining their votes in any system and need not be given a formula. Indeed, if askbob can create his own TOS, then members can create a good voter feedback convention. 6) My casual voter category is based on simple observation. It is clear that many voters award all 7 points to their determined winner. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, assuming they do this because they simply view it as a 7 point score, like football. Call them vote bombers if you wish, but there is no shortage of evidence that people award all 7 points to one side. I daresay such voters far outnumber thoughtful ones. 7) Vote bomber identification is irrelevant unless a vote-bomb-removal system is implemented, though this does nothing to eliminate the problem with casual voters. The only way to ensure that the current system adheres accurately to its philosophy is to punish all voters that do not explain themselves, including non-malicious casual voters that like to award 7 points to the winner. Consider this debate: (http://www.debate.org...). A score of 31 to 55 is meaningless. You cannot determine anything from that score other than some kind of preference towards Con. Is it because he argued better? Had better conduct? The only reason we know for sure is because 8 thoughtful voters explained their votes. Taking the thoughtful votes into account, this debate's score would have been around 4 to 11 in a one-point system. This score is MEANINGFUL, even with explanations. It tells us that 11 people preferred Con while 4 people preferred Pro. Even if some votes were arbitrary or malicious, it carries meaning, which is further enhanced by thoughtful voters explaining themselves. It's worth pointing out that, minus the 8 thoughtful votes, the score would likely have been 4 to 3 instead of 30 to 16, which is a much closer score. Just because Debate.org tried the one-point voting system and moved on does not mean we cannot count our losses with the current system and revert back. Already users are denouncing win ratios and ignoring actual vote scores. Let's go back to a more meaningful voting system--the one-point system--before it gets any worse. Vote (or vote bomb) in favor of Pro.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: in a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote",
            "premise": "1. Suppose a missionary and four cannibals are stranded on an island. Does justice demand that the issue of what's for lunch be settled democratically, with a vote granted to each of the five residents of the island? Pro argues that democracy is the preeminent value of justice, that no one can be excluded from the society, and that fencing off any demographic, in this case the cannibal demographic, is clearly wrong. If these arguments are true, then the missionary is not only in the soup, he should be pleased that justice has prevailed. I argue that such is not the case. 2. I accept the definitions offered by Pro. I note, however, that the definition of a \"right\" does not tell us what is and what is not a right. Moreover, there are inevitable conflicts among rights which must be resolved. The U.S. Constitution grants no right to vote for president. The electors for the President are determined by state legislators \"by any means.\" Clearly, the Constitution does not make voting a preeminent right. The Constitution defines a republic, which subordinates the right to vote upon legislation to voting for legislators. There are clauses granting equal rights based based upon race and religion, and equal voting rights based upon gender, but there is nothing that prevents voting restrictions based upon other criteria. The right to vote is not granted to those under the age of eighteen. That limitation shows that voting rights may be restricted when there is reason to doubt the potential voter's good judgment. Convicted felons are another class of citizens whose judgment is reasonably called into question. Resident aliens are excluded from voting on the grounds that their interests are not necessarily coincident with the interests of citizens. The interests of convicted felons are likely to be contrary to the interests of citizens as a whole, who want to be protected from criminals. That is stronger grounds for excluding convicted felons than the grounds for excluding resident aliens. 3. Pro cites Thurgood Marshall as evidence in supporting the proposition. Justice Marshall is a distinguished jurist who is an expert on interpreting laws. However, being highly qualified to interpret laws does not qualify one as an expert on making laws. The good justice claims that once a prison sentence is served, that felons have \"fully paid their debt to society.\" Whether or not they have fully paid there debt is a matter of law, and ultimately of the values of society as reflected in the lawmaking processes. For example, convicted sex offenders must register with the government and are restricted from certain interactions with children. The \"three strikes and you are out\" laws identify career criminals and remove them from society. The justification for both sex-offender registration and \"three strikes\" is that convicted felons are more likely to commit additional crimes than persons without a criminal record. It is arguable what the correct level of continuing debt to society ought to be, but the fact that convicted felons are more likely to commit crimes is unquestionable. The U.S. Bureau of Justice reports that \"...over two-thirds of released prisoners were rearrested within three years\" http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov.... Note that the two-thirds only reflects released felons who where caught within three years. It does not count those who committed crimes but were not arrested. Overall, only about 45 percent of violent crimes are solved, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics http://www.ncpa.org.... Factoring in the criminals not caught, we may reasonably suppose that the true recidivism rate is in the neighborhood of 85 or 90 percent. The \"debt to society\" at the heart of this issue is not with respect to serving a sentence for a particular crime, it is in having adopted a criminal lifestyle. The convicted felon ought to have the obligation of establishing that his interests have become aligned with those of ordinary citizens and contrary to those with a criminal lifestyle. For example, that might be established after ten years without an arrest for a felony. It is not established by release from prison. Only eight states currently prohibit convicted felons from voting for life. Two states permit felons to vote while in prison. Thirty-three states remove the franchise while convicted felons are on parole. Thus even if one accepts Thurgood Marshall's argument that voting rights should be restored after felons have \"paid their debt,\" it is not at the heart of the issue. The issue is mainly about criminals who are in prison or on parole and have not paid their debt. 4. Pro claims that in the 2000 election in Florida, \"The fact that these voters were disenfranchised caused a serious lapse in democracy, and therefore did no justice. Because Disenfranchisement restricts the democratic process the resolution is a just principle.\" I agree that in close elections the votes of those with an established criminal lifestyle voting for someone they feel to be in their interests could determine the outcome of an election. That is a powerful argument that justice demands that election not be determined by such people. 5. Pro claims \"It must be agreed that fencing off a certain voter demographic is a fundamentally unjust principle.\" I do not agree. It depends upon the reason for fencing off the demographic. People under the age of 18 are fenced off on the just grounds that in general they lack the knowledge and experience to cast an informed vote. Note that this is done despite some sixteen and seventeen year olds being more informed than some citizens who are fifty or sixty years old. The fencing off is justified because the odds are so heavily against it. Similarly, not all convicted felons remains committed to the criminal lifestyle. But with about 85% recidivism, the odds are much against it. Therefore, it is reasonable and just to identify the demographic and exclude them. Convicted felons are, I agree, an identifiable demographic. That makes them an identifiable target for politicians, who can go to prisons to seek votes by making various promises to tilt the justice system in favor of criminals. (Note that the proposal is to for convicted felons to retain the right to vote, with no criteria that they even have been released from prison.) Politicians are clever enough not to make the appeal directly, as that would alienate other voters. They would use surrogates who espouse \"improving\" the justice system by weakening it. Even if no targeted appeal were made, criminals would figure out for themselves which candidate was most likely to facilitate their lifestyle. Crime victims are also an identifiable demographic. However, victims are less likely to vote based upon the single issue of weakening the justice system. Victims are citizens who worry about the health of the economy because a good economy facilitates their making a living. A criminal lifestyle, however, is only facilitated by weakening the justice system. Therefore, the fact that criminals constitute a single-issue demographic is just grounds for excluding them from voting. 6. Justice is not served by having cannibals voting democratically on the fate of missionaries. The interests of justice are best served by subordinating democracy to human rights. We should not want people whose prime interest is in pursuing a criminal lifestyle determining the outcome of close elections.",

            "premise": "Thanks for the quick response. 1. There is a very low chance of that happening. There are loopholes in any voting system, but they're highly unlikely. As far as the not ranking = ranking last, I see what you're saying but I was talking about if there were several candidates whom you don't like. Then, it wouldn't be the same. 2. Adding candidates in the status quo can alter the outcome of the election. The problem you're referring to is the Condorcet method. But IRV solves for that, while the status quo does not. http://www.guardian.co.uk... http://en.wikipedia.org... The second link has a great graph showing the advantages and disadvantages of all. You can see that IRV solves for much more than Plurality (FPTP). I'll include it in the comment section. Officials can find it much easier to tamper with electronic machines. All they need is a hacker. http://www.youtube.com... I need evidence that the U.S. can't mandate IRV, states don't award proportionately for the presidential race (final). Multi-party systems can be a great thing, they provide much more balance. On the large global political scale, our Democrats and Republicans are very similar. That's the problem. If you want to vote for who YOU ACTUALLY AGREE WITH, then you can't do it in FPTP without wasting your vote. This way, you have a backup. *Overall, you can see that IRV may not be the best mathematical system, but it's the easiest for people to understand, it blows the current system out of the water and makes it look prehistoric, and it makes the most sense. I urge a Pro vote. Thanks to my opponent.",

            "premise": "The founding fathers of the United States established a form of government that allowed people to choose their representatives through voting. However Illegals voting has become a serious problem. Fortunately It is a fixable problem. We need to establish voter identification (voter ID's). In California, Non-citizens testified that they had voted! Hans A. von Spakovsky who was former member of the Federal Election Commission Stated in his article \"The threat of non-citizen voting\" in July 2008 \"The evidence is indisputable that aliens, both legal and illegal, are registering and voting in federal, state, and local elections. Following a mayor's race in Compton, California, for example, aliens testified under oath in court that they voted in the election.[8] In that case, a candidate who was elected to the city council was permanently disqualified from holding public office in California for soliciting non-citizens to register and vote.[9] The fact that non-citizens registered and voted in the election would never have been discovered except for the fact that it was a very close election and the incumbent mayor, who lost by less than 300 votes, contested it.[10]\" (http://www.heritage.org...) I have personally worked on 2 different political campaigns doing phone banking and I have had people tell me multiple times that they have gone and voted 4 times that day or that they had even had someone go and vote for them! Voter ID's will help to stop this problem. It is to ensure the integrity of the US election system that we need to put voter ID's' in place. So in to do this I present the following plan: Government issued photo Identification cards will be required to register to vote, as well as vote in person at the polls. ID's will ensure integrity in our electoral system while reducing fraud. Hans A. von Spakovsky said: \"Requiring voters to authenticate their identity at the polling place is necessary to protect the integrity of elections and access to the voting process. Every illegal vote steals or dilutes the vote of a legitimate voter. Opponents of voter ID claim that it can only prevent impersonation fraud at the polls, which rarely happens. That assertion is incorrect. Voter ID can prevent and deter: -Impersonation fraud at the polls; -Voting under fictitious voter registrations; -Double voting by individuals registered in more than one state or locality; and -Voting by illegal aliens, or even legal aliens who are still not entitled to vote since state and federal elections are restricted to U.S. citizens.\" (http://www.heritage.org...) Now wether you agree with Hillary Clinton's politics or not I believe she summed it up best when she said, \"Voting is the most precious right of every citizen, and we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our voting process\". That is why I would strongly encourage a vote for pro. To protect every citizens rights and privileges.",

            "conclusion": "Alternative Vote should be adopted in the UK (over First Past the Post).",
            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for presenting an issue that is highly controversial in the UK at this time; leaflets are delivered through my letterbox practically every day from campaigners of the No and Yes campaigns (I won't be voting). I will be arguing that the Alternative Vote has too many problems and does not represent any great advantage over First Pass the Post; at best, AV is not superior to FPTP (and correspondingly is not worth the money converting) and at worse, it suffers from enough flaws to make it a worse system. For the record, I am playing devil's advocate to a degree; I have no strong views either way. Problems with the Alternative Vote 1: AV is complicated. Some people have been claiming this argument is patronizing - that somehow it underestimates the British populace and that AV isn't that hard to understand. However, the fact remains that AV is much more complicated than FPTP and people are less likely to vote using a system they don't properly understand. In Australia where AV is used, the problem with low voter turn-outs is so bad that they have had to implement compulsory voting. [1] The only other countries to use it are Fiji and Papua New Guinea - and Fiji plans to discontinue it. [2] 2: AV is not as proportionate as you think. AV arguably produces a closer proportion of votes to seats; however, this does not translate into those seats having a proportionate amount of power in the House of Lords. Under AV coalition governments like the current one will be more likely and coalition governments are undemocratic. The Liberal democrats, who were voted for by only 1 in 5 voters, now shape UK politics as part of an alliance with the Conservatives. The ability to select a prime minister would change from the British people to the Liberal Democrats because of their power to choose whichever party they chose to form a coalition with. Finally, party accountability would be decreased because parties could go back on their campaign promises to broker an agreement for a coalition government. The Liberal Democrat's current predicament with student fees is a case in point. 3: Changing to AV would be costly. The UK is currently going through severe economic difficulties. The cost of AV could be up to \u00a3250 million [3] if implemented; \u00a391 million on the referendum, \u00a3130 million on electronic voting machines and \u00a326 million to explain the new system to voters. It is not sensible to spend so much on altering our voting system at a time when unemployment is high and the UK has a huge deficit to overcome. 4: AV is unfair. My opponent's analogy which just lays out AV but doesn't really argue for it can be used to show how AV is unfair. To make the point clearer, add Miss Yellow and Miss Orange (let's not be sexist). Everyone vote, the votes are counted and the candidates arranged according to the number of votes received; Mr Blue is first, Mr Red is second, Miss Yellow is third, Mr Green is fourth and Miss Orange is last. Under FPTP, the election stops there - Mr Blue wins because he came first. Under AV however, assuming no-one receives 50% of the votes, Miss Orange is eliminated and her voters secondary preferences counted - votes that people don't care as much about and may not have considered before casting. This time, Mr Red might win if he receives more, or even Miss Yellow. If no-one has still reached 50%, third preferences will be counted - at this point many of the votes that will count may not have been considered by the voters since they will care most about their first preference. The unfairness is clear - a candidate who has received the most votes when they are first counted can lose to the second or third most popular candidate - and this will be determined by the secondary prefernces of the least popular candidate!

            "premise": "A birth certificate is technically not enough to prove citizenship for an election. It needs to be a semi-recently updated photo ID, which not everyone has.Polling places know if your a citizen or not. You just need to prove who you are. Forged IDs of non-voters are easy to get. If someone wants to vote illegally they will. I said that the poor who may not have jobs that give the ID's that can be used for voting and the young who may not have jobs or colleges that issue the ID's because not all colleges issue the ID's and most college jobs aren't full time and won't provide it. By solving a virtually non-existent problem you are creating a hassle to the voting process causing voter apathy, which destroys the vote much more than fraud. You repeatedly claim that even if voter fraud that can be stopped by voter ID laws are non-existent, than why not have the laws? I will address several claims made by you and many other people. (not all you)1. Even if it is not a serious problem, if someones a citizen then they have nothing to hide. For those that are unemployed or do not receive a legitimate ID regularly it can be a large hassle to get the ID needed. A common refutation of this is that a right isn't a privilege. I would argue that you are creating voter apathy. Voter apathy is the main reason why people don't vote. Imagine you are a voter. (not sure your age) You hate both candidates, but agree with one just a little more than the other. You prefer one over the other just enough to go out and vote. Any small hassle would make it not worth it to go out and vote. I have described most of the non-voting population and the close to non-voting population. Whether or not it is a privilege or a right by inserting a law that would knowingly cause many people to stop voting all together is an awful way to stop the minor incidences of voter fraud that could be stopped by this. 2. It might become a serious problem later, why not attack it now? I want you to ask this question to yourself. Why now? Why during an era where the democrats are fast gaining power are the republicans pushing these laws. You yourself have admitted it might not stop most of our small amount of fraud. Who are the people who are most likely to be stopped at their polling place for lack of an ID. It is the young and the poor, the core of democrats base support. 11% of voters do not have the ID already, most democrats or left leaning. WHY IS THIS A PARTISAN ISSUE IF IT IS A SIMPLE CASE OF SECULAR RIGHT AND WRONG?! I WANT TO KNOW!3. Even if it isn't a big problem it de legitimizes the vote. Purposefully creating voter apathy is a bigger problem and a side affect of these laws. We would lose about 3% (this is low-balling) of the voting population if we enact these laws. That de legitimizes the vote much more. Redistricting and propaganda destroy the vote much more than illegal voters that could be stopped by these laws. So why don't those who push ID laws push non-partisan districting?",

Young people are not completely detached from the political or the non-electronic world. Many are passionate about politics and exercising their right to vote[2]. Low voter turnout is a general trend across the nation, and if young people are failing to vote then this too reflects disillusionment with government. For example, many young people who voted for the Liberal Democrats in the UK recently were shocked when he expressly went against his promise to prevent tuition fee rises[3]. Political disillusionment among young people is also a problem in the USA[4]\u00a0and Europe[5]. It is the state of politics itself, rather than the literal process of voting, which deters people from full political participation.

            "discussionTitle": "In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory",
            "conclusion": "In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory",
            "premise": "I hereby state that the opinions stated below and the arguments presented do not necessarily dictate my personal opinions.As commonly proposed, democracy is of the people, for the people, and by the people. The basis of democracy depends on the effectiveness of the state to grant its citizens with the right to vote and the citizens to respect that right. Democracy exists on the notion that all the eligible citizens vote for a future that they would like to see. However, in many democracies, today, a decrease in this number of eligible citizens at the voting booths has been witnessed. This is why I call for voting to be compulsory in all effective democracies. I will first present a mechanism that will address the issues at hand. Then, I will refute the arguments presented by Con as I go through my first two arguments and get to any points of rebuttal left at the end. Mechanism: All registered voters will be asked to compulsorily cast a vote during the elections. However, for those who do not have a chosen candidate or do not wish to vote on the particular election, there will be an option to not vote which would say something on the lines of \u201cI wish to abstain from voting\u201d. Those citizens who are registered, but do not place a vote, will be withdrawn from the list of registered voters, until they register again. On the second time of registration, they will be fined a decently hefty amount. So, we are looking into a system where a onetime registered person will be expected to vote each election year. There will be an additional law added which will ask all employers to give a day off for each one of their employees such that workload does not become an issue of low turnout.Argument 1: A better distinction between the citizens. People who are registered voters have an interest in voting for the country. By mandating them to vote each year, we are keeping our responsible eligible voters active. The turnout rate has gone very low with unequal turnout also a big issue. However, what the status quo does not tell us is the real reason behind this low turnout. Once this distinction is made, the state will be more aware of their political institutions. This will then help them see if attention should be paid to improve the campaigning systems and the procedure of political election. If many people vote to abstain, then the state will have to make sure that the political leaders express themselves better and also will have to see that a diversity of principles are presented by the leading parties. Con argued that the registered voters not voting is mainly due to reason that they are \u201cnot particularly excited by any candidates, or because they are disenchanted by their favored political Party\u201d. The best way to confirm this will be by asking these voters to show up at the polling stations and pick the option that says they would like to abstain. This practice will help us distinguish between the people who see the political parties of the particular year to be not legit from those who just do not want to make the effort to vote. There are many other reasons for which one may not like to vote. One, being diversion from the workload and other being laziness. To make sure that these reasons do not rule the low turnout, the proposed mechanism should be adopted. The lazy people will be ousted from the registered voters list and would have to pay a penalty if they want to vote the next time. However, some of these smart lazy people will be able to see that they could save a fine and the time spent on the process of registering by going to the polling station. And if they are just going there, why not have at least some information about the parties. This will increase the effectiveness of a democracy, which will be addressed in Argument 3. Argument 2: Unfairness abolished It is important to notice that politicians place a lot of focus on making sure that their supporters go to the polling stations and place their votes, without regards to those who would probably not vote. However, if the proposed mechanism is adopted and voting is made compulsory for all registered voters, politicians will now have to make sure that most of the registered voters vote for them. They will also have to focus on the hard labor workers who could sometimes not make it to the polling stations and those people who did believe that the parties were not any good this election period. Con argued that \u201cthe duties and rights of citizens are importantly different from those of their representatives, because the latter have powers and responsibilities that the former do not...Citizens do not owe their government electoral support or legitimacy.\u201d This claim supports a system where democracy can never work effectively. Not only democracy, any institution cannot work without a mutual share of duties of the powerful and the ruled. The citizens do have a responsibility to vote, which in our system, could also be a vote of abstention. How can citizens expect to take advantage of a democratic institution without fulfilling their own job of placing a vote? Except those who have researched and did not get fascinated by a candidate, all the other citizens have a duty to keep tuned with the political parties and then make a decision. Secondly, Con emphasized that compulsory voting takes away the right of people to have a choice, which Con suggested was \u201cthe point of democracy\u201d. I would like to also emphasize that in the proposed mechanism this choice of the people will be respected. They will be given a choice to vote or not and for whom to vote. The proposed mechanism will both support the rights of the people and ask them to perform their duties.Argument 3: Democratic Ideals promotedThis argument will be presented in the next round.Remaining rebuttals to Con\u2019s case:Con was worried about the fines that will follow after people will not vote. Con was right to say that this would negatively affect the poor and may increase the number of criminals who owe fine debt. However, the mechanism clearly states that a fine will only have to be paid if one wishes to register again. This will work as an incentive for registered voters to not skip a voting period. And if for some reason they do, they will not have to worry about a fine until the next elections and will only have to worry if they wish to vote next time.None of the Con\u2019s arguments so far have shown a downfall to the proposed mechanism for the motion at hand. The mechanism works really well to make a distinction between the citizens and find out the weaknesses of the political institutions of a state and also abolishes unfairness on many grounds. This is why I urge a strong Proposition vote.",

            "premise": "I would first like to thank my opponent for the excellent topic.The vote is a powerful tool used in any representative government. It can be used for the benefit or harm of society depending on who is voted for and who is voting.My opponent makes the claim that the electoral college nullifies or makes the popular vote useless. This is incorrect. The electoral college is an assembly of electors who represent their parties nominees and are sent based on who wins a states popular vote to vote for president. Essentially whoever wins the popular vote in a state receives those electoral votes. Note that there a few states where electoral votes can be divided depending on percentage as opposed to winner taking all. Because the members of the electoral college are sent depending on the popular vote, our vote does matter in selecting the next president. It may not be the best system but it is false to say that our vote literally doesn't count. [1]Pro also states that \" Those in the position of power have always pre-picked presidents\"This assertion shows a lack of knowledge of the presidential process. A political party will nominate a candidate to run for the presidency. It may be a party with a strong foothold in congress or a party member who previously held the presidency. Also the incumbent may not even be the parties nominee. President Pierce lost the democratic nomination as the incumbent. Getting back to the point, once a party has delegates vote for their candidate they run for the actual presidency. Once in the actual campaign the candidates may receive funds from certain special interests but this doesn't mean they are being picked by higher powers. It just means they are accepting a bribe more or less to act a certain way and pass legislation in office. The same thing is done on every level of government but in no way is the president being chosen by some higher power other than the people (or at least pro gives no evidence to prove otherwise). Pro goes on to say in regards to the electoral vote \"it was written into law in the constitution largely because the founding fathers were worried about the American public's ability to choose wisely\" Well yes. Its essentially a safety net to keep uneducated voters from electing a leader who would act malevolent in office or be tyrannical. The safety net that is the electoral college has been heavily diluted today because as of now a majority of states actually punish faithless electors (electors who don't vote for the candidate they were supposed to based on popular vote and their placement as an elector for that candidate). This doesn't necessarily mean our vote doesn't count. Just that if we get to the point where we vote for someone who is just honestly terrible, the electors can come together and stop that from happening. Its just highly unlikely to happen. I hold that our vote does count based on this analysis. I await Pros response. Sources: [1] http://www.archives.gov...",

            "premise": "Greetings, In this particular debate, I will be arguing that, because voting is a flawed method for establishing federal laws in the Untied States, the act of voting should not be used in the United States House or Senate. Definitions: Voting \u2013 casting one's preference for a particular measure or resolution. Flawed \u2013 having an imperfection of defect. Federal \u2013 of or relating to the central government. Federal laws are created in the United States House and Senate. I am arguing that merely voting on a particular measure is a flawed method to create a law. Merely voting means that the majority wins. My main case in this debate will be the following: \"What is popular is not always right; what is right is not always popular.\" This quotation depicts that there is a \"right\" (and therefore a wrong, as well) that is present. Similarly, there is also a \"popular\" (and therefore an unpopular, as well). The process of voting fails to take into account what is \"right\" or \"wrong,\" but merely what is \"popular\" and \"unpopular.\" This, in my view, is wrong; and what is wrong should, ideally, not be implemented into federal level. Because voting is largely subjective, necessitating its voters to determine what may be preferable to them, instead of what is indeed right, the process of voting if inherently flawed. So how do we determine what is right? Well, logically, what is right can be deduced via debate by those involved in the particular measure that would otherwise be subjected to a vote. I can get into this in subsequent rounds, but I would also ask that my opponent read a previous debate I have had, regarding a universal truth, as parts of it may be relevant in explaining and deciphering what is correct. http://www.debate.org... As well, my opponent in this debate should be in favor of the process of voting to establish federal laws in the United States.

            "discussionTitle": "Resolved: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory.",
            "conclusion": "Resolved: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory.",
            "premise": "The order will be NC, then AC. CON's CASE Compulsory voting poses a risk to the foundations of effective democracy. Thus, I negate. Observation One: This resolution, by its own terminology, is not U.S.-specific; thus, this topic must be debated globally. I Value Democracy, as it is the ultimate good implied by the resolution. Democracy is defined by American Heritage Dictionary as a \"majority rule\" government that embodies \"principles of...respect for the citizens within a community.\" I offer the Criterion of Reducing Illiberal Democracies. Fareed Zakaria defines illiberal democracies as one in which the people have a voice in government but lack the necessary sub-culture to make informed decisions. Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, writes, \"democracy rests on an informed and educated populace. Education enables people to know their rights and how to exercise them.\" Therefore, it is important to ensure that the vast majority of the electorate is educated prior to making voting compulsory, because compulsory voting would naturally bring people who are ill-informed and unable to cast an educated vote to the ballot box. Contention One: Illiberal Democracies are extremely dangerous, and undermine the principles of equality and respect necessary for true democracy. Prof. Amy Chua of Yale notes that, within illiberal democracies \"increasing the political voice and power of the majority has fostered the emergence of demagogues\"like Zimbabwe\"s Mugabe, Serbia\"s Milosevic, Russia\"s Zyuganov, Bolivia\"s Great Condor, and Rwanda\"s Hutu Power leaders\"who opportunistically whip up mass hatred against the resented minority, demanding that the country\"s wealth be returned to the \"true owners of the nation.\"\" Professors Dye and Ziegler contend that, \"despite a superficial commitment to the symbols of democracy, the masses have surprisingly weak commitments to the principles of individual liberty, toleration of diversity, and freedom of expression when required to apply these principles for obnoxious groups or individuals\"Masses are dangerously vulnerable to demagogic appeals to intolerance, racial hatred, anti-intellectualism, class anatagonisms, anti-Semitism, and violence\"demagogues, are mass-oriented leaders who express hostility toward the established\"are extremists and intolerant, impatient with due process, contemptuous of individual rights, anxious to impose their views by sweeping measures, and often willing to use violence and intimidation to do so\"These tactics appeal to mass desire for simplistic solutions to societal problems.\" Contention Two: Compulsory voting will bring in uneducated and ill-equipped voters; it will also increase irresponsible voting practices in the voting booth, thus increasing the chances of forming an illiberal democracy. Sub-point A: Compulsory voting brings in uniformed voters. Prof. Michael Pitts claims, \"empirical research lends support to the argument that higher turnout at elections may just lead to additional voters casting uninformed votes\"A study of compulsory voting compared voters who were compelled to vote with voters who would not have voted absent the compulsory voting regime. That study determined that those forced to cast ballots by compulsory voting were \"less inclined to make their decisions in a way that coherently reflects their issue preferences\" and that this increases the likelihood that an election outcome \"will not accurately reflect the distribution of voter preferences\" In addition, less informed voters might be more likely to cast ballots in favor of incumbents merely because of name recognition, or might be more likely to cast a ballot based solely upon the racial identity of the candidates. In essence, there are some plausible reasons to think that higher turnout could result in a less informed electorate and less accurate elections.\" Sub-point B: Compulsory voting will not makes voters more likely to get informed. Prof. Sarah Birch notes, \"compulsory voting fails to raise levels of political knowledge. Those who vote due to compulsion may have little incentive to inform themselves, and some may actively resist the acquisition of relevant information as a form of protest...one of the main objections that opponents of compulsory voting have to the institution: that it brings uninformed voters to the polls, and that voting on a random basis by the uniformed can, under certain circumstances, have a substantive impact on the outcome which could well be construed as being undemocratic.\" Sub-point C: Compulsory voting promotes random voting. Prof. Mark Wattenberg observes, \"People with limited political knowledge might deal with a compulsory situation by making dozens of decisions the same way they choose lottery numbers. In Australia, this is known as the \"donkey vote,\" for people who approach voting like the game of \"Pin the Tail on the Donkey.\"\" In other words, people will vote for the person who appears first in the list, or whose name they like best, or some other equally arbitrary factor. These votes dilute the pool of votes that are cast by responsible voters, and therefore, this \"randomizing\" effect can impact the results in a negative way. Sarah Birch furthers, writing, \"random voting could alter electoral outcomes, and that the larger the number of random votes, the greater the likelihood that electoral results would resemble a coin-toss. Enhancement of the stochastic element of the electoral process would lead to a deterioration in the democratic validity of the results, and it would impair the ability of elections to provide an accurate tool for translating popular opinion into political outcomes.\" In conclusion, compulsory voting leads to uneducated and random voting practices; as a result, illiberal democracies become more likely. Because illiberal democracies are antithetical to the notions of equality and respect inherent in true democracy, it is vital that we negate. PRO's CASE: V: Equality - Pro fails do define equality, so I will offer a definition from Merriam-Webster: \"the state of being equal\" where \"equal\" means \"same as another.\" Therefore, equality would necessary imply that all individuals should be placed into a state wherein they are as much the same as they can get. This could lead to ethically questionable practices such as resource redistribution, and could deprive those individuals who work harder to their just due, in order to ensure that everyone is treated \"the same.\" Thus, equality is not necessarily intrinsically valuable. C: Governmental Legitimacy - cross apply my case here. Clearly, if a democracy becomes illiberal, it loses its claim to legitimacy. But, moreover, Pro's definition of his criterion is unable to achieve his value. He defines his criterion as implementing the desires of the majority. Let's say that the majority of people in Nation X decide to pass a law that would outlaw being brunette on pain of death. Brunettes would be subjugated to persecution, and thus would be treated unequally. So, her own criterion, as she defines it, could undermine rather than support her value. C1: Pro's own card admits that Pro would have to include the uneducated in the process. Furthermore, in all of the examples Pro cites, many of the first leaders elected were voted into power by the poor and vulnerable. Mugabe in Zimbabwe was elected because he won the black, impoverished vote. He was a demagogue, they were his sheep, and thus arose an illiberal democracy. Finally, the viability of poor candidates is more so an issue of campaign finance laws then it is compulsory voting. C2: Apply the following: Prof. Sarah Birch notes, \"compulsory voting fails to raise levels of political knowledge. Those who vote due to compulsion may have little incentive to inform themselves, and some may actively resist the acquisition of relevant information as a form of protest...\" Pro's source talks about \"suggestions\" and \"hopes,\" not likelihoods. Many will just see compulsory voting as a burden that they just have to deal with, not as a valuable means of participation, and so will continue to do the bear minimum. Finally, the Halperin evidence is not only U.S-restrictive, but it ignores the threats that illiberal democracies pose. C3: There are three attacks I will make here: (1) that we have a right to choose not to vote, (2) there is not duty to vote, (30 abstention is important for political expression. 1. Prof. Sarah Birch writes, \"the analogy is frequently made between electoral compulsion and the styles of political persuasion employed in authoritarian or totalitarian states\"\"a totalitarian view of political life easily involves an obligation not only to vote, but to do much more--and to do it all moreover, in the 'right' direction.' \"When the people are forced to choose democracy, it is no longer a choice.\" 2. Prof. Anabelle Lever writes, \"voting is at best, only one form of democratic political participation, and from some perspectives not an especially important or attractive one. So, from the fact that political participation is valuable, it remains to be seen what importance we should attach to electoral participation. The second difficulty is that people who value self-government can have moral as well as pragmatic reasons not to vote.\" 3. Lever writes, \"Rights to abstain, to withhold assent, to refrain from making a statement or from participating may not be very glamorous, but can be nonetheless important for all that. Rights to abstain, no less than rights of anonymous participation, enable the weak, timid and unpopular to protest in ways that feel safe, and that require little coordination and few resources. These rights are necessary if politics is to protect people\"s freedom and equality, and therefore to reflect their duties as well as their interests.\" My citations will be posted in the \"comments\" section. With that, I firmly negate the resolution. Over to Pro.",

The voters must just have a bone to pick with EA and took out on them at the polls. I do not feel that they are necessarily making bad decisions at this point. I feel that that EA is just trying to become more popular and wanted to beat out the competition by making Origin. They probably feel that more users will notice them with this new service and their sales would go up, but obviously that backfired. Electronic Arts makes successful games that many people, especially kids, enjoy playing, and I'm pretty sure they would not mind making and Origin account real quick to start playing.

            "conclusion": "DDO should keep a voting system with multiple categories",
            "premise": "Con must show that there is a significant problem with the present system and that changing the voting system will fix the problem. Every debater who has been around for a while will say they think they should have won a debate they lost, and they are right at least some of the time. So how do we improve judging? Con argues that by eliminating all standards as to what is good and bad in a debate, voting will improve. I think it should go the other way. Better voting comes from having common standards as to what is important, and in making debaters and voters aware of that. Judges of academic debates are presumed to have a good understanding of what's important. We cannot safely make that presumption here.There are no clear examples of bad outcomes from strategic voting on DDO Voters sometimes shade their voting strategically. If a voter believes strongly that one debater ought to win a debate, he will tend to award more of the seven points to the side he thinks should win. The voter may be correct in his judgment about who should win. He may be enthusiastic about the subject and read the debate very carefully, making a reasonable judgment about each category. Or he may not be so careful and just make a subjective appraisal of by how much he believes the side he favors won, which could be unfair. A vote counted as suspect by one side is likely to be counted as unusually perceptive by the other side. How many debates have been wrongly decided by strategic voting? In a close debate strategic voters will tend to cancel automatically. If the suspect votes make no difference in the outcome, we should be satisfied that they either offset or do not affect the tide of voting. Con offered only one example of a debate where there was a potential that strategic voting affected an outcome. In that debate, more people voted for the losing side than the winning side. But Con just assumed the outcome was unfair, without arguing it was in fact unfair. I had voted on that debate and at the time judged it to be very close. The debate could have gone either way, so there is no cause for complaint. Without even a single clear example of an unfair vote, Con has not established either that there is a problem of strategic voting unfairly affecting outcomes, or that up-or-down voting would provide an improvement.DDO debates show the change would produce more ties Of twenty debates examined, in only one was there a reversal of the winner and loser if each vote was presumed to translate to a full vote for one side or the other. The 0-1, 0-1, 0-2 voters might have called the debate a tie instead. Again it wasn't clear whether that made the voting more fair or less fair. Con dismisses my sample of twenty debate as too small, but con offered no data at all. A sample of 20 is not definitive, but it gives a reasonable idea of what is going on. I used the Bidwell-Wilson approximation to the confidence limits on the binomial distribution to get the error bounds. [10.http://en.wikipedia.org... If found in my sample that 17 of 20 debates were unchanged by up-or-down voting. The 95% confidence interval is that between 13 and 19 debates would be unchanged. The increased number of ties is put between 1 and 7. The number of reversals is between one debate in five and one in 120. Since Con only cited one reversal, even when pressed, it's likely the number is on the rare end of the interval. Clearly more debates would end in a tie because of the quantization, in my sample twice as many. I think it is less fair to the debaters to declare a tie when voters considering the categories thought that one side had won. How many debaters will say, \u201cThe new voting system is terrific, I'm getting more tied scores now!'? All subjective judging benefits from standards Con argues that the analogy of debate voting to judging subjective sports is invalid because debating is not an athletic competition. But the object of the competition is irrelevant to the logical process of scoring a subjective competition. In terms of judging, subjective sports, dog shows, flower shows, and pie baking competitions are alike in having subjective judging. The goal is to establish both for competitors and judges guidelines for what is better and what is worse, and how much each category counts. Con claims that because academic debate uses a primitive up-or-down system so therefore, DDO debates should use that system. The subjective sports moved to more sophisticated voting systems as a result of voting scandals. If academic debating became a competition having general interest and suffered a scandal from biased voting, academic debate would have no alternative but to move to more sophisticated point system as well. Despite the use of a point system, the Olympic figure skating in Sochi still had a voting scandal. But there is no effective Moderator checking on judges in the Olympics. A moderator could examine each point addition and deduction, and an inflated score would then be very difficult to defend. Reverting to an up-or-down system wouldn't cure the judging problem, because that was already tried at the Olympics without success. Having standards doesn't work if there is no threat of enforcement.The silly poll Con points to a poll of debaters that revealed that each debater thought that strategic voting was used on their debates. That's a standard bit of nonsense used all the time by poll takers. It's along the lines of \u201cAre you satisfied with current government policy on X?\u201d No one is completely satisfied, so there will a high percentage saying \u201cNo.\u201d Upon getting the expecting \u201dno,\u201d proponents then proclaim that they have a ringing endorsement for policy Y, which was not mentioned in the poll. I would have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the poll as well. However, my remedy is to better educate voters and to improve the ability to moderate voting. That choice wasn't posed.Not simpler, better Con said I wanted a simpler voting system. I don't. I want to keep the present system. I allowed the weights on categories could be tweaked, but I think they are now about right. What I'm proposing is a more elaborate system available as an option to help voters who want to know more detail on how to vote decide who should win each category. The same guidelines would be used by moderators. Saying \u201cVote for whomever you thought did best.\u201d doesn't work, because \"best\" is undefined. It doesn't say, for example, that the relevance and quality of sources is far more important than the number of sources. It doesn't say what is a serious conduct violation and what is not. It leaves everything to the intuition of the voter, and that is not a good idea, particularly with the highly mixed character of DDO voters. When everyone uses there own standards, there are no grounds for claiming bias. It is officially arbitrary.Academic debate is not the real world I did not say that academic debating was worthless. I said it does not reflect the real world of jobs, community organizations, and politics. A gave a list of the significant differences between real world debate and academic debate. Con ignored every item I listed without giving counter arguments as to why the difference was unimportant. Con asserted that everyone wants to live in the world of academic debate forever. That's impossible. For example, conduct is a problem in academic debate, because debaters know that bad conduct is sure to be punished. Academic judges are individually selected. Con did not address any of the differences. My study of randomly selected debates showed the categories were working well. People were, to perhaps a surprising degree, considering each aspect of the debate. Making voting simpler makes it unpredictable, because each person has complete freedom to decide what is important and what is not. Judging can be improved only by making the standards more clear, not moving closer to polling.",

First, I'd like to clear up a very, very stupid mistake I made in my last round- namely that people have no choice in the right to be innocent until proven guilty. Obviously, they can plea guilty. Note, however, that my opponent did not point this out, and has dropped my other rebuttals - even if they were terrible, they still stand. Instead, I'd like to argue that voting is in fact a civil duty, not a civil right and as such should not be compulsory. -- Arguments -- 1. Countries that vote are, obviously, democracies. This means they are founded on the principle that they are run by the people, for the people. This entails certain responsibilities. It means that every citizen who can should take an active interest in the well being of the country and this entails, among other things, that they should vote. 2. By making everyone vote, we can select an individual (or individuals) who reflect the core values of the democracy in question. If only a proportion of the population does this, the country is less likely to get the candidate (Or candidates) that it actually wants. -- Rebuttals -- *Thank you for your response! Sorry about the confussion - i put it under politics but did not specify in the debate title! =/* Don't worry. My blatant misrepresentation of your argument has probably lost me the conduct point anyway. I didn't even know there were countries where voting is civil duty. Sorry for claiming you were putting me in an unreasonable position :/ *now the 'donkey vote' especially in Australia* A: This is problem, but could be solved. For instance, by putting a 'no suitable candidate' box at the top. This would mean truly uninterested voters, or people who feel there is no candidate that represents them would not poison the results by voting for the candidate at the top of the list. Note this is not the same as not voting-by selecting that box, you are still making a statement about the candidates. The next five arguments my opponent presents appear to have been copied piece meal, then altered subtly from the 'Arguments used against compulsory voting' article shown here- http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk... - just thought I should point that out. She should have at least referenced it. *It is a limit on freedom. The right to vote contains the right to not vote* However, I have already argued that it is a civil duty, not a right. *A higher voter turnout cannot be said to heighten the legitimacy of a government when the voters have been forced into giving their support* I'm not saying they should be forced into giving their support. As I said, there should be a 'no suitable candidate' box. Those who vote for the government will have done so legitimately. *Making voting compulsory hides the problem rather than solving it* Whatever measures the government takes, there will still be substantial portion of the population that does not vote. * People forced to vote will vote against the people making them vote* Even the site you got this from admits this isn't much of a problem- 'This isn't such a problem, however, as incumbency has enough advantages of its own' *It would be unfair for minor - new parties and independents* This is unfortunate. However, the fact remains that the end result would better reflect the thoughts of the country as a whole. I await my opponent's response.",

            "premise": "I would argue that paying people to vote would not be a reasonable way to increase voter turnout, the poor do not vote because they want money out of it. It is because they feel as though they aren't represented and do not think its worth the time if there vote does not count. And by implementing a test that slows that process down even more it would simply lead to a larger loss in voter turnout. How much would you offer to vote? The amount offered would have to be a state decision, which would just lead to political corruption. States that are predominately one party would offer almost no payment so that voter turnout doesn't change, while battleground states would offer incentives making them even more important to candidates, which would just corrupt the system even more. I am not suggesting paying voters at all. But to further illustrate the flaw in paying individuals to show up to vote. You have to consider that many of them are at work and cannot lose the 1-4 hours of work. So in order to incentivize them to show up to vote you have to at least meet their requirement for work. So assuming everyone who voted was payed minimum wage, and there were 126 million people who voted in the 2012 election[1]. so with simple math (126 million x 7.25 minimum wage) =913.5 million dollars. And assuming this process worked you would have higher voter turnout meaning that this price would be higher. By offering a billion dollars in incentives to vote, you are basically bribing for votes. The cost of the 2012 presidential election was 6 billion, so we would have a massive increase in the cost of a presidential election.[1] Sources: http://bipartisanpolicy.org...",

            "premise": "Indeed, according to Article II section I the constitution, the framers of the constitution upheld that the president would be selected based on the electoral process. First and for most, the electoral college in my perspective, is a suitable solution in regards to electing the commander in chief because it doesn't cause multiple faction but rather sustain a well-functioning two-party system. In addition, the electoral college is the best alternative towards selecting the upcoming president of the United States because it prevents constitutents from electing an unsuitable candidate. Lastly, the electoral college should remain as the ongoing system because it's capable of equally representing both large and small states. In particular, as opposed to a country that is governed based on a parlimentary system, the winner take all system is capable of preventing a coalition from occurring because this system only elects the candidates who attain the majority of the votes. However, In a parlimentary system functioning government, the candidates who attain five percent of the votes are proportionaly granted the same amount of delegates. With that being said, if the United States creates the presidental process to be selected based on a direct democracy radical candidates will be capable of seeking power within a year. However, the electoral college designs a two party system in which it prevents third party candidates from gaining power. In addition, the electoral process is an effective process in terms of selecting a president because like big states small states are also equally represented in the electoral proccess. According to Article 1 section 2 the house of Representatives is capable of selecting who becomes the president of the United states if any of the candidates do not attain 270 votes in the electoral college the house of reps selects who becomes the president by using state delegation. Therefore, this allows both large and small states to only attain one vote when selecting the president. Therefore, the small state will be as effective as the big state in the electoral process. In the same essence, the electoral college should remain as the official process for electing the president due to it causing candidates to focus more on independents than on straight ticket voters. For Instance, throughout the past two decades it has been evident that California has the tendency of voting for a presidental candidate with a liberal ideology. Therefore, in the electoral process it causes candidates to focus mostly on states that are considered swing meaning that they could vote for any type of candidates. By doing so, this is a crucial element in representation because the constituents living in swing states compose all aspects of America's demographics. WIth that being said it encourages candidates to also use retail politics, meaning that candidates are actually capable of attending in local events in order to target the independent voters. The founding fathers established a winner-take all system in the electoral process in order to prevent radical candidates from forming a coalition because those third party candidates are incapable of negotiating with moderate candidates since they do not attain electoral votes proportionally to their polls.",

            "premise": "Thank you for your quick response. Pro agrees that the Vote Removal System (VRS) is vital to correcting the problem of voter abuse. It is his contention that the ideal situation would include both the VRS and Publicly Available Voting (PAV), as well as greater moderator presence. On this point we are both in agreement. The disagreement comes on importance. Pro places PAV above VRS. With PAV, he claims, voter abuse is more easily identified. However, as I stated in the first round, this does nothing to dissuade certain people from creating a number of 'suicide vote bomber' accounts. By definition, these accounts do not matter to the vote abuser, so he will not care if it is public knowledge that his account participated in vote abuse. Worse still, the damage is already done. Without a VRS, the suicide vote bomber account is highly successfull because his votes will remain, and he can create new accounts to repeat the process. In any Vote System Reform proposal, the VRS should be at the top of the list. The VRS is effective where the PAV is not. It dissuades people from attempting to abuse the voting system because their time will have been wasted once their accounts are banned. They would have no reason to even attempt such a thing when their actions literally produce no success. I admit, the PAV would be a very helpful companion to the VRS, since it would make it easier to identify abuse. However, the VRS should take first priority. To pick up the work for PAV would require time away from completing the VRS, which I have shown is more effective at eliminating the problem. I would like to close the debate by thanking the eminently respected KRFournier for providing the opportunity to debatee this most interesting of topics. I would also like to thank him on behalf of the DDC community for his efforts to improve the community as a whole.",

            "premise": "The main effect of the voting change would be more tied debates Con claims the proposed change would fix problems. I collected some data to look for voting problems. To get a list of debates I did an advanced search for the string \u201cthe\u201d sorted from new to old. I examined the first twenty debates in the list. At the time I did the search the first debate was: [7. http://www.debate.org...] If the search is done later, it should be possible to scroll down to start at that point. Of the twenty debates, three were ties. If the debates were scored up-or-down based upon the awarded points, 16 of the win-loss outcomes would be unchanged, including the three ties. However the voting method change would make three more of the win-loss outcomes into ties. That's logical, because if arguments are tied the debate may tip based upon one of the other categories. The point of the proposed voting change is to make voting less discerning, and it accomplishes that. What the change accomplishes is along the lines of \u201cArguments were about the same, but even though one side was substantially more difficult to understand, so we'll call it a tie.\u201d That doesn't help the debater or the site because it does not reward better debate. Reversals are not necessarily better For one debate in my sample of twenty changing the voting method would have reversed the outcome, with the winner becoming the loser. Call it a reversal. Con assumes that the only reason a reversal occurs is because a vote bomb is overcome, but that isn't necessarily true.The reversal was in Hierocles v. donald.keller [8. http://tinyurl.com...] In this debate the score was 13-8, but the up-and-down votes were 3-4. Of Con's votes, three scored the debate 0-2, 0-1, 0-1. One voter scored Pro the winner 7-0, claiming in his RFD that Con had made a semantic argument in the final round, losing both conduct and arguments. The voter gave a reasonable RFD for each category. I don't know whether the 7-0 vote would hold up to very close scrutiny, but it was at least prima facie. Pro's other two voters scored the debate 3-0, 3-0.Suppose the voting system were changed to an argument-only vote. The 0-1 and 0-2 voters thought arguments were tied, and we don't know if they would have scored the win based upon the non-argument categories. If the voting system were changed, the debate might reasonably have ended 3-1 rather than 3-4.With up-or-down voting, some debates where the scoring was lopsided looked more even. Some voters seem hesitant to score categories other than arguments.The debate Con cited was innomen v. bluesteel on the \u201cThe US should not recognize the results of the latest Nicarguan election. [9. http://www.debate.org...] (Con gave the wrong link.) Pro won 42-41, while if everyone went with the majority of points, the up-and-ddown vote would have been 9-1-11. I voted for bluesteel in that debate, but I and many other voters thought it was very close and said so in the RFDs.In my view, there was one clear vote bomb, 7-0 by a voter who said he was countering another voter's vote bomb. He said nothing else in his RFD other than that he adjusted his vote for that reason. There may have been some back-and-forth not apparent to me. The debate seems to have been completed before the Moderator took over countering vote bombs. In any case, the outcome was not by any means a travesty of justice in which vote bombing prevailed. It was a close debate with one vote bomb that the Moderator should have corrected if current site rules were in play. When there are many votes in which small factors tip the voter one way or another, the statistics may go either way. It reflects no more than that it's tough to pick a winner in a close debate.In all the debates I reviewed, and especially the two reversals, the categories were accomplishing exactly what they were supposed to accomplish: they were causing voters to examine each aspect of the debate. I think debaters remember what they consider to be errant votes, and don't notice that 95% of the time the voting is quite reasonable. The solution to bad judging is to better guide judges. Judging on DDO can be imporved. It's no surprise because judging a debate is subjective. There are two responses to the problem: a. Try to reduce the effects of bad judging. b. Try to improve the quality of judging. We would like to be able to do both, but we cannot. To improve the quality of judging we have to have judging standards and improved enforcement of those standards, but a simple up-or-down vote makes standards largely pointless and unenforceable. With up-or-down voting, we move closer to an opinion poll, and that's inherently moving away from more thoughtful analytical judging. The way to educate judges is to tell them what they should be doing by having standards and to then question bad votes in terms of the standards. This promotes good debate by telling the debaters exactly what is expected of them. That's why the judging of subjective sports have moved away from thumbs up or down voting to categories and points. If someone, for example, makes a seeming unjustifiable vote for sources, standards are the means by which the vote can be questioned. Con claims that the \u201creal world\u201d of debate is academic debate. I don't think so. I think the real world of debate is informally debating friends and associates about the issues of the day, arguing about what to do in the work or school environment, judging talking heads on video as they debate the issues, and evaluating the claims of politicians. Academic debates rarely have conduct violations because of the certainty of immediate punishment. Real world debate often enough degenerates into ranting. Academic debaters are less likely to lapse into incomprehensibility, because people who cannot express themselves clearly are rarely attracted to academic debate; the real world poses endless problems of misunderstanding. Politicians and talking heads do not worry much about sources; they pose as experts stating claims as facts. Informal debates are even less likely to be troubled with facts. Everything happens sometimes in academic debate, but in general internet debate needs more guidelines reflected in categories. Academic debate is burdened with jargon incomprehensible to the average person, but which academic judges embrace. Academic debates worries about technicalities. Try telling your boss or your spouse that drops count as concessions and see where it gets you. L-D style academic is especially perverted, with very little concern over facts. Making it a single up or down decisions makes vote bombing prohibitions virtually impossible to enforce. Here is a generic RFD that anyone can use to justify any vote: This was a complicated debate and a close call in many respects. Overall, X did a better job of putting together the logic of his case with the supporting facts from his sources. Y never overcame X's basic argument. Both X and Y were difficult to follow at certain points, but not enough to affect the outcome. It was a good debate with valid points on both sides, but I have to give the edge to X. This generic RFD can be decorated with a few debate-specific comments, like \u201cX's confusion of \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201cthere\u201d was distracting, but not really serious.\u201d With no voting standards, the job of writing a fake reason for decision (RFD) is so trivial that the RFD requirement might as well be abolished. Summary My review of a sample set of debates shows that the categories are working fine, and are inspiring voters to consider the individual aspects of a debate. I think members would like to have optional guidelines on how to judge debates, and that would improve both judging and debating. The main audience, the lurkers, would appreciate the improvement in debate quality.",

            "premise": "The state governments could choose any way to fund this, but I would prefer it be funded through a progressive income tax. Regardless, that's not going to be part of the debate.For this debate, we will make this one assumption:1) the government will be able to pay for paying everyone to vote. So, it won't affect the deficit of the government in any way. Everything else is fair game to debate on though. If you do object to that assumption, you can offer reasons why in the comments, and I may be persuaded to not go off of that assumption. Now, here are the rules for the debate:1) No personal attacks, insults, or ad hominem2) The total number of rounds used for argument should be equal to the total number of rounds you see here minus one because I am not using round 1 for argument. This is to keep the total number of rounds used for argument even between us. I don't care which round you choose to waive. Though, it would make more sense to waive either the first or last round. The middle rounds would be awkward if waived.3) The first round used for argument should just be main arguments, no rebuttals in this round. In other words, if you're second to post your main arguments, it should not be in rebuttal to the person who was first to post main arguments. 4) The last round used for argument in the debate should be just rebuttals to your opponents arguments and/or conclusions. No new arguments used in this round. New information and statistics are fine to present in this round, provided they are in rebuttal to your opponent's arguments. If any of the above rules are violated by either side, this is justification for voters to award the point in conduct to the one who did not violate them,If you have any questions or want to have one of the rules edited/removed, say so in the comments. If you want one of the rules edited/removed, provide reason why and I may be open to editing/removing that one. Be sure to do that BEFORE accepting the debate. If you accept the debate, you accept the rules that are written here. If I agree to removing/editing one of the rules, I'll physically edit this round and remove/edit it.Here's my full position:State governments should pay voters for voting in elections. The amount will depend on how many positions or laws you voted on. The more of these things you vote on, the more money you get. Additionally, a test of political knowledge will be given, that depending on what you get, will control how much money you get. I'd say if you fail it, you wouldn't be paid for voting. If you pass it, then depending on the percentage you got right, will control how much money you get. Say, for example, someone got 100% right on the test and voted on 20/20 measures/positions that needed to be voted on. Perhaps the 100% means they will get $100 per vote they cast, for a total of $2000. Maybe you get $1 per percent right, starting at 60% right(anything below that won't get any money).",

Even with a highly capable moderation team, there may just be to many cases to handle. Pro says that, \"there should be more ways to register as a voter such as submitting one's email and give them a verification code...\". When you sign up on debate.org, you already give your E-mail address so that you can see notifications. The Debate.org moderators need a method to hold voters to accountability. Making voters give a phone number is a way to make sure that they are serious voters. Pro also says that, \"I am certain that creating a campaign to teach people to vote will be ineffective...\". I am not so certain. I think that a diligent, well designed campaign to teach people how to vote and streamlining the look, appeal, and process of registering would increase the number of voters. I think that by doing nothing about this problem , Debate.org risks losing popularity to other debate forums. However, there are other ways to boost usage that do not lower the quality standards of this great website.",

            "conclusion": "May/June Beginners Debate Tournament: Voting should be mandatory",
            "premise": "I thank Deonatus for an understandable lengthy rebuttal, but let us not be fooled with quantity. In this last round, I shall refute his assertions, expose his fallacious logic, and display what true quality is. I.The General Will This metaphysical argument stems from the ideology of Jean-Jacques Rosseau, the general will. My point remains unscathed as Con did not counter this philosophy with another, and by doing so the next violates the rules as I didn't stipulate new arguments in R4, but was available in R3. The contention still holds its might for flagging what the collective will is. Even with a mass of polarized ideas, the result will always be the general desire of the people. The philosophy states that the more diversed, the more genuine the general will is. With less people, more of special groups, and a voluntary voting system, the general will is not at its finest. Also, the sources here were bent images, inflated.Con did this many times and I shall expose this unacceptable behavior as we go on.Con said almost 1 in 5 people who did not vote said they're busy. The right figure was 18.9%, far from 20%, far from almost. There's absolutely nothing wrong with writing the exact but it was surely done for appeal. Moreover, the chance to vote shouldn't be dismissed with just an 18.9 or 3.9 figure. There are millions of us that could change the Congress and the future policies of our nation. The people's power to improve the government should be taken seriously. This strengthens our democracy and political will for change. Also, let me put an end to political pandering that had been such a problem. Pandering basically means to do what one demands even though it's not proper, good, or reasonable. When this occurs, people are sure who deserves the vote more since pandering sheds light upon the misdeeds of coercion and dishonesty. I shall refute more of their assertions herein as we go through where they are most suited. II.MV dismantles bad tactics Con asserts that my argument defeats itself because Jewish lobby groups are minorities themselves. However, Con attacks the objective and omits the subjective value, the real focal point that intrinsically links to whether they are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination. Therefore, the minority status is conditioned by questions of political power, not only in cold numerical. Ostensibly, in the context of my arguments, the minorities are the people who are politically weak, oppressed, unheard, and abused. The Jewish lobby groups are strong communities that have power to control running officials and influence votes. With MV, we undeniably level the playing field that constitutes equal opportunities for problematic communities. III.Voting is a civic duty Again, voting is a civic right. There are government tasks that infringe the right to freedom of speech, but is needed to support our democracy's health. One is jury duty, we are forced to do this even though it clearly violates the 5th amendment. We harm the potential condition of our nation when we leave it to the higher classes and ruling elites, Con says we don't, but we actually harm the rights of our brethren when sly tactics become available and oppressed minorities are unheard. Even one of Con's sources, the Brennan Center of Justice, states that the right to vote is the most fundamental right in an electoral democracy, which people are sometimes deprived of.[1] When we vote, we not only exercise our civic rights, but also fortify our democratic stability. IV.MV increases voters political knowledge Con attacks the CSES data because it helps political knowledge with just an \"ever so slight\" increase. This is false. The study concludes that political knowledge does accrue with age, and to deny this would deny simple, natural logic and reason. Also, the study showed that men tend to be more knowledgeable about women, but with MV enforced, the gap was fixed with the result of evenly distributed knowledge. This strongly supports the notion of General Will, women representation and equal opportunity. Moreover, Con has used my data wrongly and again proves to my favor since the study proved that strongly enforced and voluntary systems show the same correct answers, but weakly enforced systems show the leading points.[2] Still,enforcement is better than no enforcement. Moreover, MV highlights a progressive growth through time, it may be effective now, but it will be more effective then. Con failed to refute how habit grows out of tradition, which helps accrue knowledge, and is prospective in the long-run. When there's a presidential election, we are apt to get involved in social media and pour out our thoughts while acquiring some in the process. This is a natural societal stimuli during elections and is arguably hard to perturb and erase. Black propaganda will be there, but in today's time the media can easily provide what's true or not, especially when interviews are made and politicians can explain what is false or not. After the elections, things will go back to normal and the people have 6 years to know what was outrageous and remained precise; the next time there are elections, the people would know. Humans are rational beings.Once we vote, we do things rationally. Again, we may be less rational in voting now, but we will improve as we go on. ---- I.MV doesn't undermine liberty and democracy It strengthens the integrity of our government and its valued democracy. I have already explained why by not voting, we harm the future state of our nation, undermine integrity, and prolong the problems of our abused brothers and sisters. II.MV does incentivize political learning I have strongly refuted this. Accrual of knowledge will prospectively help higher voter turnout, enthusiasm, and representation. III.MV leads to better representation for the most affected MV levels the playing field no matter what happens, it eradicates targeting strategies, and pays equal opportunity for the unheard to rise up and represent themselves. This is the most heroic value of MV, its salvation. Other than that, activistic movements can be deployed with leaving the ballots blank and spoiling votes. This can be essential data for further research and study, which in turn would help better social programs and policies. Especially when it is the presidential elections, there are millions of us who can finally change the congress, the policies, and the nation's future. MV is a transformative tool, that when utilized again and again, becomes the best arsenal for political change and betterment. IV.MV doesn't punish the poor and disabled Previously in this section Con said of voters who failed to vote, about 1 in 3 said they couldn't afford to or couldn't get the day off work. The right figure was 31%, not 33.33%. Con failed to be exact and truthful, for '3 in 10' is a whole lot less from '1 in 3'. Con asserts I attack my own argument, however, it is their own argument that self-refutes.Con provides data from BPC's Democratic Project, which helps election administrators ensure that all voters who are eligible to vote can successfully participate in the democratic process.[3] Con's 14% data remains true, but it turns counter-intuitive for the source supports my argument by giving ways to assist voters with disabilities, from accessible voting machines, polling places, curbside voting options, web-interfaces for completing absentee ballots..they must incorporate available, workable solutions into the process to reduce the number of Americans who report that disability and illness keeps them away from the polls.[3] With the aforementioned, voting holidays, scheduled voting periods for the busiest businesses, and express agreements, voter turnout will increase. It is greatly essential that our people's voice is represented to ensure the uttermost integrity and honor. In conclusion, I have strongly refuted Con's fallacious and inconsiderate assertions, they remained negative and oblivious to the fact that MV helps in the most profound and sympathetic way. The metaphysics of the General Will remains powerful and unscathed, and is an infallible philosophy. We level the playing field for every eligible voter and dismantle bad tactics, uphold our civic duty, safeguard the future of nation, political knowledge and voter enthusiasm accrues with age, strengthen our integrity and democracy, represent marginalized minorities, and helps the lower class. I have successfully laid out information the most accurate way possible, while my opponent resorts to giving bent images of their statistics, and used sources that were absolutely counter-intuitive and counter-productive in their part. Thank you for a wonderful match, I hereby affirm the resolution. And may everyone cast their votes and voice in the future. [1]http://www.huffingtonpost.com... [2]http://blogs.lse.ac.uk...

            "premise": "First, it should be readily apparent that denying a convicted felon the right to vote is NOT unconstitutional; my opponent has already (and apparently without realizing it) quoted the very text from the Constitution which shows this. Repeating that quotation - the 14th Amendment - here, with the relevant text highlighted: \"Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Carefully note that phrase, \"without due process of law.\" The rights enumerated in the Constitution, and specifically in the Bill of Rights, are not and never were intended to be absolute and inviolable. The fact that we imprison people in the first place (a clear violation of the \"right to liberty,\" if that right were to be considered \"absolute\"), and that such imprisonment and other punishments were clearly and explicitly anticipated by the Constitution, shows this. The States can, through the due process of law, deny various rights as punishment for infractions of the law. But why deny voting rights to convicted criminals? First, this is clearly a part of the punishment prescribed for various crimes (in general, that class of crimes that we call felonies). You know going in that if you commit certain criminal acts, and are convicted of them, that you are going to be stripped of certain rights that otherwise would be yours as a citizen. In short, this is your choice - and if you value your right to vote, it is an additional incentive not to commit the crime in the first place. And from society's perspective, this makes sense. We do not grant the right to participate in government, through voting, to just anyone. You must be of a certain age, and in general you must be of reasonably sound mind. But a convicted criminal has already demonstrated one major shortcoming regarding a quality that any reasonable society should expect of its voters. Simply put, in committing a crime, you are demonstrating that you are NOT willing to abide by your society's laws in the first place - should you then expect to have a hand in the making of those laws? Our system of voting rights is based on the assumption that voters will have an interest in promoting the good of the society as a whole - why should we grant voting right to those who have demonstrated the exact opposite? It might be claimed that the permanent loss of the right to vote constitutes an unusual and extreme punishment, one which is not warranted in many cases. That's fine, and the law already provides a means through which it may be addressed. The ex-convict retains the right to petition the State, through legal channels, for their right to vote to be returned. In many states, the right to vote is automatically restored after a specified time period following completion of the convict's sentence, assuming of course that no further crime has been committed by the individual during that period. Given, then, that the franchise IS very commonly restored to ex-convicts - especially if it is important enough to them that they pursue it - what justification can there be for eliminating this part of the punishment for such demonstrably anti-social individuals?",

            "premise": "Defense: ==Voting is a Right, not a Duty== I disagree that this is invalid; the point is that there exists legal protections that, if one were to accept, should extend to the issue of compulsory voting. These legal protections are themselves based on certain principles that are central to the underpinnings of democratic societies. Since I didn't establish otherwise you're entitled to attack this as a kritik, but in the context of this debate it seems we've both accepted a democratic governmental framework as the starting point, so it would indeed be relevant. -Informed Apathy- I think this US presidential election cycle demonstrates loudly and clearly that informed voters can easily be inclined to reject available options. I would accept that those who do not wish to actively support any candidate could spoil the ballot, but then why compel them to participate in the process if it does not equate to actual participation? Why compel people to turn up at polling stations and waste an hour of their day just to spoil a ballot, when staying home would have accomplished the same thing? ==Poorly Informed or Random Votes Compromise Elections== As I demonstrated with the \"donkey vote\" phenomenon in Australia, it's inevitable that some people will cast random votes instead of spoiling the ballot. It is an act of protest in itself; they are deliberately derailing the integrity of the electoral process as an objection to being coerced into voting. In tight races, this can be a game-changing factor. As for \"compelling them to be informed,\" not only is that not realistically possible, but to the marginal extent that it could be, it raises a whole host of problematic questions about how the state is going to present information to voters. Especially when incumbent candidates are already part of the government that would be tasked with this, and therefore they could and would manipulate things to give a more favourable impression of themselves and less so of opponents. This would just further expand the existing incumbent advantage. You can mandate voting but you can't mandate knowledge. People who do not care and do not want to know won't suddenly absorb information by force. And if they could, that's even more troubling a prospect.",

I'll skim through the opening statements, and get a gist of what each party is arguing, and place my vote even though I am in no place to do so. There is a very simple solution to this problem.\" I have an even simpler solution that involves voting without reading the debate: counter vote bombing. \"Debate.org should implement an option when starting a debate to allow people to set a minimum amount of time someone must spend on their debate (hopefully reading it!) to be allowed to vote. This time could either be a fixed time or a time reflecting the word count in the debate.\" The resolution is that there should be a minimum time voters must spend on a debate before voting on it, not that there should be an OPTION to set the minimum time voters must spend on a debate before voting on it. I am not opposed to making a minimum time optional; I am opposed to making it required. 1. Troll debates: Sometimes, the contender ignores the resolution completely \"Why should debate.org put useless, 'offtopic' debates before high-quality, thoughtprovoking ones. Also, in cases such as troll debates, many votes are not needed like are needed in lengthy and high-quality debates because the winner is obvious.\" I concede that troll debates are unimportant and can be closed. 2. Rule violations: Sometimes, rules violated in the first round of the debate determine the way voters ought vote. \"Voters should still be required to read the debate before voting, otherwise, their vote is simply binary logic in action. Also, if the rule violtaion [sic] takes place so close to the beginning of the debate as you're suggesting is necessary as to make this time limit a nuisance, why do people even need to vote on it? It's a useless debate and should NOT be put before useful debates.\" If Con takes the time to put together a superb argument, then just because Pro ignores the resolution or violates one of the rules is not a reason to ignore Con's argument or close the debate. Instead, it is important for people to vote for Con so that Con's effort can be rewarded with a win. 3. (Fast) Forfeits: Sometimes, the contender forfeits in the first round \"In this case, the word count will most likely be quite low and the time required will not be high allowing at least one person to vote. Also, should debate.org value people's win/loss ratio over DEBATE. The ENTIRE POINT OF THIS WEBSITE. I think not.\" How does not setting a minimum amount of time voters must spend on a debate before voting on it devalue a debate where one side forfeits? \"All of the situations my opponent described above should not be dealth [sic] with in a way that makes for poor, unjustified voting in legitimate debates. Debates like the ones mentioned above should be dealt with by a 'report' feature in which a set of people simply remove these debates, not subject them to the resource-wasting process of user votes that should be allocated to legitimate debates.\" This is unrelated to the resolution. Regardless of whether or not troll debates, etc are allowed or reported, there is no reason not to make setting a minimum amount of time voters must spend on a debate before voting on it optional. Indeed, not setting a limit makes it is easier for people to counter obvious vote bombs without having to read the debate. Since there is at least one legitimate reason for not setting a time requirement before voting (counter votes), vote Con.",

Here is by affirmative constructive: \" One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by you inferiors.\" This is a famous quote from the philosopher, Plato. Because I agree with Plato, I support the resolution. Please note that my value premise, democracy, is the most important value because democracy, in this case, is a duty of citizenship. According to the Harvard Law Review in 2007 called, \" The Case for Compulsory Voting in the United States,\" in volume 121 page 591, \" Individuals who live in a democracy benefit from the fact that the country they live in is democratic. Given the benefits, citizens have a duty to vote, which is an essential part of that democracy.\" My value criterion is civic duty. Christine Pelosi, who is an American Democratic Party Political strategist, states that \" voting is a civic sacrament-the highest responsibility we have as Americans.\" Contention 1- Self- Responsibility. A- Compulsory voting improves life and political decisions. Citizens will most likely pay attention to candidates and their speeches and make a more informed choice; according to Stephan Bauschard, who is from Harvard University. B- Accurate vote results for polls. Since more people would vote based on watching the candidates speeches, there would be more accurate votes. If there wasn't compulsory voting, citizens would just guess which one is better and there would be inaccurate results. Contention 2- Reduces the burden on citizens A- Compulsory voting reduces access barriers to citizens. Voting is difficult because of work and long distances from a voting booth, and lack of transportation. The society will work to reduce barriers. The government knows that there are houses and families that are miles away from a barrier, but having barriers closer to most citizens is better than having the barriers far away from all of the citizens. For example, voting usually happens on weekends where countries have mandatory voting. Those who do not turn out due to access barriers are often minorities and poor individuals, Failure to account for these perspectives in politics undermines the legitimacy of democracy itself. B- With mandatory voting, more opportunities will have to exist for citizens. Compulsory voting would create more opportunities for citizens to show responsibility, to truly express your opinion, and to have a more friendly environment of politics. Also, the voter isn't that pressured because voting is still by a secret ballot. Conclusion- Without compulsory voting, we wouldn't be as civilized to participate in America It is our duty to vote; the government has done so much for Americans that it would be disgraceful if we didn't pay them back by voting. Also, gas would be spared because of the closer access barriers and we all know how much of a pain gas can be. Compulsory voting makes us whole.",

            "premise": ":D I thank CON for her quick response.CON asks \"Wouldn't you agree that having your voice heard through the senate would make your vote less chaotic and more balanced?\"1) Not necessarily... Senators don't always fully represent what you want, but rather what they believe you want. In the electoral college, its a winner-take-all system. This means that if you are a part of the minority in a state (ex. Democrat in a Republican state), your vote won't count towards anything, as all of the Electoral Votes goes to whoever wins in that state. Your voice wouldn't be heard.2) I fail to see how, in any way, would a vote be \"chaotic\" or \"unbalanced\". Your vote is your vote....There aren't many characteristics to a vote.Con says \"Don't you want balance between large and small states?\"1) Don't you want candidates to campaign in all states, instead of the few closely divided ones? A handful of closely divided battleground states get disproportionate attention from presidential candidates.She writes \"Wouldn't you want recounts confined to a few states and not the whole country?\" 1) Computerized voting systems are operational.2) With the newer, fully computerized voting systems, including optical scan and direct recording electronic systems, the vote totals may be transmitted automatically to the central counting facility.3) Recounts shouldn't stop are government from doing its job.Con says \"Where would the justification be in spending over 2 billion dollars per candidate just for campaigning?\"1) She presents no evidence for this \"2 billion\" figure.2) Spending limits exist to make sure rich candidates don't have an advantage over poorer candidates. http://www.fec.gov...If everyone has the same budget per state, everyone would be at the same disadvantage. Now if everyone was at the same 'disadvantage', it wouldn't truly be a 'disadvantage'. http://dictionary.reference.com... Con says \"Electoral vote provides organization, wouldn't you agree that order is needed for everything?\"1) She doesn't explain how the Electoral College provides any 'organization' or why it's true. 2) Sure, order is ideal, but wouldn't a popular vote system have 'order' too?Con says \"Electoral vote allows smaller states with a smaller population to have an equal pull to a larger state. Does popular vote allow this or any kind of balance?\"1) Through Electoral Vote, the minorities in any state won't have any voice in who becomes president. Why? Because no matter who they vote for, all of the electoral votes will still go to the majority's choice. This decreases and discourages voters.2) In popular vote, I don't see how any boundaries will be drawn between states. A democrat vote in a Republican state will have the exact same affect as a democrat vote in a Democrat state. All votes would be equal, and no one would be discouraged.3) Everyone will have the power or ability to decide an outcome through popular vote. One of the definitions of balance is the power or ability to decide an outcome by throwing one's strength, influence, support, or the like, to one side or the other. Needless to say, popular vote can allow the existence of 'balance'. http://dictionary.reference.com...==Questions== If constantly, the majority of America pushes for a popular vote system, why should the government continue to ignore them? Why should our voting system discriminate against candidates who have a broad-based support? Popular vote would encourage more voters, as everyone's vote will have the same affect and importance. Does the electoral college present the same benefit? Through the electoral college, the majority can actually be ignored. A candidate could lose popular vote, but yet be elected president through key states. Wouldn't a popular vote system better represent the interests of America? Candidates often only campaign in battleground states, where the support is still divided somewhat evenly. States that they are winning tremendously or losing too much will be ignored by candidates and forgotten. Why would this be fair and equal, or even justifiable? I await your response! :D",

            "premise": "Thanks you for accepting the challenge! I would like to begin by presenting evidence supporting my views previously stated in R1. 1. Compulsory Voting Decreases Political Polarization and Solves for Disenfranchisement of Voters According to Eric Liu, (Former Policy Adviser to President Bill Clinton), TIME, Aug. 21, 2012. Retrieved Aug. 16, 2013 from http://ideas.time.com.... Many reforms could increase turnout, from same-day registration to voting on weekends. But the most basic is also the most appropriate: making voting mandatory. Here\"s why. Mandatory voting would make elections truly valid. \"Protecting the integrity of our elections\" is the rationale Republicans give for the cynically restrictive voter ID laws they\"ve enacted in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. But if we truly cared about the integrity of elections, we should ensure that they reflect the will of all eligible voters. Second, as William Galston of the Brookings Institution argues, it would temper the polarization of our politics. In today\"s electorate, hardcore partisan believers are over-represented; independents and moderates are under-represented. If the full range of voters actually voted, our political leaders, who are exquisitely attuned followers, would go where the votes are: away from the extremes. And they would become more responsive to the younger, poorer and less educated Americans who don\"t currently vote. What we see is in a voluntary system the views of the partisan people are heard but the moderate middle go unheard. Through compulsory voting we would see moderate voters receive legitimate representation. 2. CV Increases Political Participation Margaret Kelly, (Prof., Law, Macquerie U., Australia), THE ADVERTISER, Oct. 22, 2007, 18. The turnout at Australian elections has never fallen below 90 per cent since the introduction of compulsory voting. This compares favorably to the situation in the U.S. and Britain. In 2001, the turnout for the federal election for the House of Representatives was 94.85 per cent. In the same year, the turnout for the general election in Britain was 59.4 per cent. With such a large percentage of the electorate voting, the Parliament more accurately reflects the will of the electorate, the silent majority, not just the noisy minority. Parties must consider the total electorate in policy formulation not just those inclined to go to the polls. Not only does it increase political participation, but it also increases the political process as a whole. Politicians will have to appeal to a new range of voters rather than campaigns just go get there base out to vote. ------------------------------------- A few points I would like to address before my opponent presents his evidence supporting his position. 1. All CV does is force you to fill out a ballot (none is an option). CV does not force you to chose the lesser of two evils since you can always vote for none of the below (or above). 2. The Quality of Elections will increase because politicians will now have to represent the whole voter base rather than the few hardcore partisan voters that come out and vote. 3. All laws require citizens to do things they don't want to do. Jury duty is a good example of this, taxes, and much more. CV is no different than our other day to day civic duties. Forcing someone to vote is not undemocratic.",

Sorry for this mislink and thank you for correcting me. You state in round 3 that every citizen that is entitled to vote should vote and go on and say that it is in the interest of the people however I disagree as many people do not vote because governments say things and when they get into power they dont act and many of these bad pasts make it unrewarding to vote. You go onto say that it reflects the core values of democracy If people who want to vote vote it gives a bigger voice to people who care about democracy and governments what is the point of making voting compulsary when people have random votes. And this eliminates voters that have no interest or belief in the process and people who vote are serious about the government. so vote for Voting to NOT be compulsary because we have a right to be heard and a right to not be heard when we choose!

            "premise": "The electoral college is a more fitting system for the United States of America than popular vote. Many voting machines, in the United States, are rigged [1][4][5]. In order to prevent such fraud from scaling to a national level, we must first stop rigged votes in the states. Dead people can be placed into the election process not by others, and the vote still remains valid [6]. We can prevent this fraud from reaching a national level with the electoral college. Popular vote, as being a direct democracy, is unconstitutional! These persons are trying to form something of a democracy from us, the matter of which is unsanctioned by our forefathers. How dare those vouching against this system consider such an injustice, as the constitution has not had such an unreasonable change, as to change what we are governing ourselves with. The electoral college amplifies the votes and opinions of minorities as majorities in some states although minorities when placed on a national scale, contrast hispanics percent in New Mexico and in the United States as a whole[1][2]. Over 45% of the state of New Mexico is hispanic[2]. The hispanic opinions are amplified by the entire state's votes being in a great deal, what they believe is best for themselves as a region of the United States of America. \"A popular election in this case is radically vicious. The ignorance of the people would put it in the power of some one set of men dispersed through the Union, and acting in concert, to delude them into any appointment.\" said Delegate Gerry, July 25, 1787. We can stop the whims of many voters on a state level before that of national. This is the will of the state in general, and nothing less. Every single vote counting, from the nation as a whole, is not what our country stands for. The majority of a state does represent the will of the state. Voting to find what the majority of the state believes, is the best way to find what is best for the state. It counts out a great many of the votes cast by those who know little to nothing about politics, nor do those persons care to any extent in many situations. States are, in many cases, with different markets and political ideals from one another, and for each person to speak up... you might as well be a Union supporter in Georgia during the civil war. Your opinion is not for the good of the state, but what the good of the state is, shalt be what a majority of its population agrees upon, exemplified by chosen representatives who meet with other persons who represent the different views of their states!

            "premise": "I. Uniformed PublicFirstly, my opponent said that he presented evidence to prove that voting would increase public knowledge and awareness. However, I believe that I properly refuted that argument, as he didn't respond to my rebuttals. .Then, my opponent questions the accuracy of my source to prove how uniformed voters are. However, here's a paragraph taken directly from the article I found my information in. \"The poll was conducted by Conquest Communications Group, a professional polling firm located in Virginia. The responses were obtained through live telephone surveys of 700 likely voters across the continental United States on Dec. 15\u201320, 2015. Likely voters are those who say they vote 'every time there is an opportunity' or 'in most elections.'\" [1]Lastly, my opponent says that every voter will have blind spots when voting. I will concede a bit to this. Yes, every voter will have blind spots, but let me reference even more data to share how uniformed voters are.\"Despite years of public controversy over the budget,surveys consistently show that most of the public have very little understanding of how the federal government spends its money. They greatly underestimate the percentage of federal funds allocated to massive entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security\u2014which are among the largest federal expenditures\u2014and vastly overestimate the proportion that goes to foreign aid (only about 1 percent of the total). Voters are also often ignorant about the basic structure of government. The Annenberg survey found that only 36% of Americans can name the three branches of the federal government: the executive, legislative and judicial.\" [2]This is a huge problem. If most voters don't know about issues like Medicare, Social Security, or even the basics of our government, then why bring even less informed people in instead of focusing on bringing accurate information to the masses?II. Freedom of Choice and SpeechIf we skip ahead a little bit in his rebuttals, my opponent quotes Harvard Law Review notes. With my defense, I'll pick parts of it to really dissect.\"[C]ompulsory voting is a legitimate infringement upon individual liberty for the purpose of ensuring that political outcomes reflect the preferences of the electorate...the very idea that a right, by definition, can be waived is false. Numerous rights cannot be waived; and, although many others can, this still does not imply the general existence of inverse rights.\" [3]It isn't that the right is being waived necessarily, they just simply aren't being exercised. Let's say that we have a man. We'll call him Jim. Jim is unregistered to voter and is simply not interested. Let's say a few years later that Jim wants to register to vote. Just because he didn't vote previously doesn't mean that his right was taken away. He still has the right, he just didn't acknowledge it.III. Universal Declaration of Human RightsI will concede to this rebuttal.ConclusionI still stand by the fact that mandatory voting would be harmful to Democratic societies. To end this debate, I'd like to thank ThinkBig for his participation. Thank you for a fun debate. I wish you luck. So long and goodnight!

            "conclusion": "Debate.org should Change their voting system",
            "premise": "Thanks to my opponent for posting the challenge on this interesting topic. The challenge makes clear that we are only considering two alternatives, either to change to a system in which voters only cast a single vote for the winner of the debate or to keep the present system of awarding up to seven points in categories for each of the two debaters. I suspect that nearly everyone would like to make some improvement or other in the voting system, but what we are now debating is only whether a system of a single point would be an improvement. 1. Vote bombing won't be cured The change advocated by the resolution wouldn't solve the problem of vote bombing. With the voting categories for awarding points and required reasons for decisions, it's usually easy to see who is vote bombing, and we have quite a few DDO members who systematically counter vote bombs. Awarding all seven points is rarely valid, and the lopsided vote is a giveaway. There's a thread for reporting vote bombing, and most new members find it quickly. If voting is reduced to single point win or loss, a vote bomber will have an easier time of concealing a poorly reasoned vote. He can say, \u201cThe debate was close, but Con failed to rebut Pro's most important contention \u2026 blah, blah.\u201d With unreasonable voting harder to detect, the number of bad decisions is as likely to increase as decrease. 2. Having categories improves the debaters skillsMany people who use the formal debate feature on the debate.org site are trying to improve their skills as debaters. If they just want to give opinions and seek reinforcement they can use the Forums or the Opinions features of the site, or they can just blog or post on facebook. The formal debates are for people who are more serious about structured debating. Reducing the serious-debate component of debate.org diminishes the feature that makes the site distinct from other social networking sites.The elements of a good debate are effective communication, logical presentation, avoiding the distractions of bad behavior, and backing up opinions with good sources. The site article \"Tips for a better debate\" makes these points explicitly. [1. http://www.debate.org...] The site article \"How to Vote\" specifically relates these criteria to voting. [2. http://www.debate.org... ]Having points awarded by category encourages the debater to pay attention to each aspect of the debate for fear of losing points in a neglected category. Having categories of judging is typical of competitions in which the judging has a substantial subjective component. Sports like artistic skating [3. http://en.wikipedia.org... ] and gymnastics [4. http://en.wikipedia.org...] have elaborately detailed criteria for judging. The performer is thereby made aware of what he must do to win the competition.3. Having categories improves judging skills A reader can casually evaluate a debate based upon a general impression of who did a better job of making a case. Having judging categories, however, demands a more thorough analysis of exactly why one side did better than the other. There is an adage that a person does not really learn a subject until the person teaches it. Accordingly, critically analyzing debates helps build understanding of good debate practices. If anything, the site should have a more detailed template for judging debates, spelling out the different types of conduct violations, the elements of argument (structure, logic, and rebuttal), what constitutes good sources, and so forth. My point is that to develop debate skills, the direction might be in having a more detailed categories, but it is certainly not in having less. We want the best possible judging by the great majority of members who are not vote bombing. The best judging is a product of the more careful analysis fostered by having point categories. Abbreviating the process in an attempt to foil vote bombers is likely to reduce the quality of analysis by members who want to do their best in fairly evaluating the debate. ---------------- Changing to a single point system will make biased voting easier to conceal, it will obscure the requirements for winning debate, and it will make honest voting less thorough and accurate.",

            "premise": "Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan are in a boat in the Potomac, when suddenly the boat develops a leak. They have only one life preserver jacket. Bill says: \"Let's do the Democratic thing. Take a vote to see who gets the life preserver.\" They each write a name on a piece of paper and stuff it in a coffee can. Bush and Reagan get one vote each; Clinton gets six. Obviously in this joke there was some voter fraud happening (regardless of whether your for or against Clinton), but it could have been prevented with just a little supervision which is what ID's will be providing. Pro stands for one person, one vote. But how can we keep this idea if we will do nothing to protect it? My opponents only argument in round 1 is that in person voter fraud is rare. My response to this is that even though it may be rare voter ID's can help to deter and prevent these rare occurrences of voter fraud thus providing voters with more assurance in their political system. Since my opponent has not directly argued at this point that there is any negative effects of voter ID then there is not reason to not add an extra safeguard to our voting system. Any positive impact, change or deterioration of fraudulent votes is a reason to vote pro. I'd like to illustrate my point with a quote: \"Their other claim is that voter fraud is so exceedingly rare, so unlikely, such an impossibility that there's no need for any voter identification. According to the Democrats, we can afford to assume that everyone will be honest on Election Day. So, there's no need to take any basic precautions or take any steps to prevent fraud because it just doesn't happen. Well, to the contrary, voter fraud happens all the time and it does sometimes occur on a level large enough to impact close elections. Furthermore, it undoubtedly happens much more than we realize.\" (http://townhall.com...) In regard to mail in voting, ID's will be required to register for absentee or any other form of mail in ballot. People may also be required to submit their ID's or a photo copy of their ID when they mail in their vote as well. In regard to California, voter fraud is generally only detected after the fact, if at all and investigating and prosecuting election crimes is difficult and costly. It\"s far better to prevent fraudulent voting than to track it down after the votes have already been counted. My next point is that people support voter ID's. In a Fox poll 70% of people said they supported voter ID's. Only 27% of people say that it is unnecessary (http://www.foxnews.com...;). As a country created by the people and for the people there is no reason not to follow the will of the majority in this case. If the vast majority of the population is in favor of something and it doesn't harm anyone else, why not implement the policy? At the end of the day however what will we be gaining by requiring voter ID's? Well, requiring a state-issued photo ID enables the use of common technology to further improve the integrity and efficiency of our election system. A simple computer terminal and a card reader could replace old-fashioned, wasteful and error-prone paper voter registrations and roster books when coupled with an ID requirement. Long lines could be eliminated, voter check-in would be faster, data more accurate and less money would be spent on inefficient, out-dated data entry practices. It is for all of these reasons that I would encourage a vote for pro.",

Awesomeness started a debate about why personal electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and laptop computers should be allowed in a classroom, and proceeded on listing 18 reasons about why they would be beneficial to learning in class, which I have rewritten below. The ones I have underlined were the ones that made the most sense to me1 - They have built in dictionaries and tools to improve grammar2 - They can integrate video to make learning more stimulating3 - Some have access to newspapers4 - They save money on textbooks5 - They save money on fictional books6 - Valuable skills in logic7 - Access to educational websites8 - Interactive and extra curricular learning9 - It improves graduation rates in schools that implement these policies10 - It improves Standardized Test Scores in schools that implement these policies11 - Improves writing skills among students in schools that also implement these technologies12 - Twice as many students meet state standards in courses compared to those students who dont have this access to these devices13 - Encourages diversity14 - More interaction in learning (he counted this twice)15 - Peer feedback16 - Can encourage the flow of ideas between individuals17 - Efficient working where students can access work on different computers18 - Improves learning experience19 - Improves grades in 76% of cases where students have access to these gadgetsThat was the Pro's opening arguments, the Con (DeadBrownApple) responded not by showing that personal devices like phones more often are used for social media and prove to be just distractions, or source any evidence suggesting that the Pro's claims are false, and instead bases his entire argument that electronic devices decrease the quality of education, even though Awesomeness showed four times how it has a dramatic increase on it. DBA then starts by saying that the frontal lobes of these students are not fully developed and thus would decrease their performance, but he does not show why students still show improvement in their grades with these devices despite allegedly having undeveloped frontal lobes. Then after that DBA Immediately quotes that \"I do agree with the contention that Electronic Devices administered by the school would help in the quality of education. \"Which completely nullifies everything he just argued and reinforces Awesomeness's claim that these electronic devices do help students. He then gives a borderline semantics argument about how since the students dont own the devices and are renting them from the school that these devices all of a sudden cant be used as evidence. After that, DBA drops all other arguments, dismisses the rest of them as inelegible since \"they can be learned without electronical devices\" and then argues that since they dont need those devices that they shouldnt be allowed, even though the Pro only was arguing that they IMPROVE these things. That was round 2, In Round 3 awesomeness responds to the few arguments that DBA did not drop and argues that these devices could be put away so as they would not be used for cheating. DBA then does the unthinkable and then starts to counter the arguments that he had previously dropped in the final round when Awesomeness cannot argue against is and after DBA had already dropped all of those arguments. On top of that poor conduct DBA even finishes the debate by saying, \"You basically argued for the wrong thing and therefore it is automatically void. You have lost this debate. At the very least, I hope you understood why you lost this debate.\"And that alone could have cost him conduct, along with arguing dropped points when Pro could not defend his own points because it was the final round========================================================================================================================================================As for my actual vote, I could have easily given the Pro (Awesomeness) arguments and sources and conduct since the Con (DBA) didnt source any statistics and had very poor conduct, particularly at the end of the debate. But instead I simply gave the arguments point to the Pro (Awesomness) since the con dropped over half of the Pro's arguments, then readdressed them at the very end of the debate, and still wasnt very convincing. So my vote was not only justified, but I was giving DBA some mercy by only giving Awesomeness 3 points when I could have justifiably given him 6.",

            "conclusion": "Voters should be required to post their reasoning behind each vote they make.",
            "premise": "The PRO starts off his round by claiming that I'm attempting to prove that comments are not helpful, but this is an obvious straw man. He even does my work for me through explaining the part of my case were I used the terms \"almost never.\" Speaking of almost never, the PRO acts as if this benefits his case, but it actually does not. As I suggest below, debate.org should not employ a system that's only going to benefit a few users every once in a while (as it's merely a waste of bandwidth if the system cannot benefit all debaters most of the time). Also, there is the fact that users who wish to explain their reasoning already comment on debates. Users who don't can avoid this. Also, notice how the PRO drops my argument which explains how becoming a better debater depends more on the debates themselves rather than the audience. Since he drops this, he concedes that debaters already have a quality means of augmenting their debate skills. Not only that, but in doing as I suggested, all debate outcomes will be beneficial. As the PRO agrees, the same cannot be said for merely relying on the voters. The PRO then goes on by agreeing with my statement that suggests that this system will hardly ever benefit you. And given the flaws which I've pointed out (such as how voters can get out of having to actually explain their reasons for voting), this only further hurts my opponent's case. Re Response 1: I covered this above. Re Response 2: Keep in mind that the PRO yet again admits to how faulty his system is by conceding to the fact that many voters will easily get around having to explain their reasons for voting. He also states that debaters will be coerced to include intelligent remarks, yet this is completely false. All they will actually HAVE to do is provide a comment. The status quo point goes about assuming that most users will care about how other users label them (good examples of users who ABSOLUTELY don't care are Solarman1969 and bsergent). The only statuses which users on this website are encouraged to care about are their win/loss ratios. Anything which isn't visible (as in it isn't something which is permanently labeled upon certain users for ALL to see) won't prove effective. Of course, even then, those kinds of statuses would come with problems similar to the ones we are discussing now. Re Offense Point #1: There are 2 points to note. 1) This system can actually encourage trolling/flaming. Take for instance \"blond_guy\" in this debate: http://www.debate.org... . He is pretty much advocating the same thing my opponent is and he even admits that he would DEMEAN the users who had voted against him in his debates which he thought he clearly won. In fact, the debate which inspired him to make this debate ( http://www.debate.org... ) was reported and shut down due to the content on the comment section. As shown on the front page, the debate.org administration wishes to uphold a clean and friendly atmosphere and users having the ability to start flame wars against users whom they know are voting against them (even if these users don't really bother explaining their position) will no doubt prove detrimental to debate.org. 2) The PRO states that it would be easier to spot people with multiple accounts, but this system would IRONICALLY make it harder. With users having the ability to see who is voting, reports on this matter is will increase ASTRONOMICALLY. This will no doubt prove to be a HEAVY burden on the administrators here, thus slowing down the process of finding people who actually have multiple accounts, due to the so many reports being received. Not only will that occur, but users whom the other users merely SUSPECT to have multiple accounts will become ostracized. This will no doubt make debate.org experiences regrettable for many innocent users. Re Loss Justification: See the point which the PRO conceded as he goes about suggesting that voting turnout justification can occur without the need for comments. Re Offense Point 2: The PRO goes about assuming that criteria for voting are universal. In other words, he is suggesting that lack of refutation objectively means an automatic win for him. Lack of refutation can play a big role in voting, but the main focus is the content that was presented on the table of debate. Heck, even debate.org believes this. Debate.org: \"Even if you don't have time to leave a full response, DO NOT forfeit a round. Forfeiting a round destroys your credibility and makes it less likely that voters will vote for you.\" http://www.debate.org... Now, although they aren't in favor of forfeiting, they merely suggest that it will make it less LIKELY that voters will vote in favor of the user who forfeits. However, if debate.org truly agreed with my opponent, debates such as the ones my opponent cited would automatically be won by my opponent. Thus, we can conclude that although forfeiting can play a big factor (hence the reason more than half of the people on that page voted for my opponent), it's not to be considered a reason for handing down an automatic win at least by the standards of debate.org. Furthermore, my opponent does nothing to strengthen his case in the rounds after his first debates, thus one could conclude that he gave his opponent some leeway and treated the debate as if it were one round. As for that second debate, his first argument can be considered a red herring since it does not address whether or not the Government should be responsible for building a missile defense system. It's merely suggesting that building such a system is beyond possibility (which is not true, but that's another matter). His second argument could actually be seen as supporting his opponent's argument. Building a missile defense system is a means of preventing war. Simply having the most powerful military force will give other nations an idea such as \"Oh, we don't wanna mess with the US since they have such a kickass missile defense system.\" With those facts being noted, a voter could be justified in voting against his case (especially due to his 2nd argument since that could be seen as conceding to his opponent's case). And again, if a debater knows who is voting (and perceives the ones voting to be \"bad\" at voting), the debater can wreak havoc for the voters via flaming/trolling. Re Offensive Point 3: This is basically a minor alteration to point 2. It fails for the reasons which I've pointed out in both 1 and 2. That said, a troll would only need to become slightly more crafty in order to maneuver around this system. Simply put, coming up with a BS explanation, using more than one computer (especially easy if you're at a school library or if you are at college), and/or simply getting friends to sign up and vote (again, an extremely simple task) are all sufficient means to avoid retribution. Re Offense Point 4: It does nothing but prompt voters to provide a comment. As for status quo, this goes back to my point on how many innocent users will be bullied by others users for not living to their expectations of explanation. In fact, the comment section in this debate is a good example of this: http://www.debate.org... . Notice how the user who goes by the name of mrmazoo ends up attacking the users who disagree with him in their voting explanations. This also goes to suggest another problem with the PRO's plan. The comment section is reserved for commenting on debates rather than continuing debates. Debates continuing in the comment not only unnecessarily tax this website's bandwidth, but it also defeats the very purpose of their being a comment section. Besides those two factors, it will encourage flame wars. Your move! =D",

            "premise": "Greetings. First, I'd like to thank my opponent for starting this debate. Second (AND MOST IMPORTANTLY), I'd like the voters to vote based on who supported their position better rather than which side you personally agree with. With that said, let us proceed carefully. First, my opponent insinuates that it is difficult for one to modify their strategies and improve their debating skills without commentary from an audience, but this is certainly not so. Having been an online debater for a number of years, the audience's opinion has almost never been of much help in letting me know when I've sorely been pummeled intellectually; the ones who were helpful were almost always none other than my adversaries (regardless of whether or not it was their intention). As my opponent suggest in his profile, debate is a game. Like any game, it is your adversaries who help you increase your skill level. The most beneficial debates are the debates where you've debated on an equal footing or have been sorely defeated. If both of these cases, you've allowed your opponent to make more good moves than you have been willing to allow. You get better by understanding these good moves your opponent has made and by coming up with ways to prevent them in future debates. When debating in the eyes of an online audience (such as the kind of audience's you'll run into on debate.org), their concerns on the debate (which are mostly represented through the votes) are hardly ever beneficial to the many of the votes being made for partial reasons. Sure, there are times when a voter will actually provide some beneficial reasons as to why he/she voted impartially on the debate, but this is sadly not often. Thus, the debate.org votes should not be used as a means of determining the level of your argumentation skills. My opponent then proposes that voters be required to post a reason as to why they voted, but concedes to the fact that many comments will undoubtedly be unhelpful. There are two problems that come to mind merely from reading this statement. 1) My opponent is aware that this plan will no doubt encourage irrelevant posts in the comment section. If he is aware of this, he is aware of the fact that this system won't be of much help in solving the problem he brings up. So if that is the case, what is the point? Why should the administrators allow more bandwidth to be wasted if this solution will hardly be beneficial to the members of this website? 2) If the majority of voters who vote don't comment now, what will be their incentive to actually take the time to EXPLAIN (to the level my opponent wishes) why they voted when this program is initiated? Voters who don't feel like typing much (which is most of the voters on this website if you take the time to compare the number of votes in the debates to the number of comments from different members in most of these debates) would merely have to say something along the lines of \"Oh, I thought PRO won because he argued better. 25 character limit.\" I now stand ready for my opponent's first rebuttal.",

            "premise": "\"...people most effected by the messes caused by the government must be heard, instead of a select few who passed a test. Every vote counts. We cannot allow ourselves to be silenced.\"The problem with the premise here -- that government's problems must be solved by the masses -- fundamentally misunderstands the nature of our government. Our government is an extension of the people. Any messes caused by government are messes incurred and tolerated by an electorate that keeps putting the same people in power. We have had government of the masses for a while now, and we can see it is not as effective of a system as it could be.\"Now, before I start arguing my side for legal and moral purposes, I should let my opponent know that the effort to suppress the vote is already abundant in this country.\"My opponent went on to list ways in which the vote is being suppressed. The examples are immaterial. In my opinion, some of his railing against voter ID laws and felony disenfranchisement is off-base in this particular debate. The kind of voting restrictions my opponent talks about is restriction for purely political reasons. All the restrictions target minorities, a group of people that generally aid the Democratic Party. Therefore, Republicans oppose liberalizing voting laws, and Democrats support doing so.But what I'm talking about is voting restriction for reasons other than petty party politics. I'm suggesting voting restriction to those who are most qualified to vote. The difference here can be summed up in the following metaphor:On one hand, a business owner refuses to hire someone because of their race ( i.e. poll taxes).On the other, a business owner refuses to hire someone because they're not qualified for the job (i.e. my idea).\"Firstly, the fifteenth amendment, which says that voting rights cannot be based on race. The twenty fourth amendment outlaws poll taxes. Finally, the twenty sixth amendment lowers the voting age to eighteen. Now sure, these do not guarantee voting rights to all, but my opponent must agree that these all take steps in the direction of equal voting rights for all. So if we were to add a constitutional amendment to have a test to see if you could vote, that would actually be a step backwards in everything we have fought so hard for to this point.\"I agree that all of the amendments listed go along with the theme of expanding and protecting voting rights, but this theme does not legally or constitutionally bar us from implementing my plan. Sure, it would be a step in the opposite direction we've been heading, but it wouldn't violate anything in the Constitution. And to not implement the plan simply due to the fact that it would be a reversal of historical trends is silly; doing so would completely ignore the merits of my idea and the drawbacks to the current way of doing things.\"He knew that if a group of people were silenced, then the country's decline would follow. Are we going to so carelessly give up the right to vote to all, or are we going to be like Dr. King and fight to preserve those rights?\"This sounds nice, but it lacks backing. Why would our country's decline soon follow if the majority of voters ceded their right to do so? I've outlined why we would be better off with more qualified voters, and I don't see how unqualified voters not voting is a problem, especially if the majority of them approved of such circumstances during the process in which this idea would be engraved into the Constitution.",

            "premise": "First allow me to likewise thank my opponent for entering this debate. Concerning the electoral college, I would like to point out that there are 27 states which supposedly require electors to stay true to the popular vote. However, I use the term \"supposedly\" because even though these 27 states claim that electors are bound by state law or by pledge to vote honestly, there is still no constitutional or federal law that actually requires electors to vote the way they pledge to. For that reason, there has never been any real punishment for what they call faithless voters, regardless of the state law. So in reality, what it comes down to is how much do you trust your vote in the hands of a stranger who can very easily get away with changing your vote? As for the presidential process itself, it leaves more than enough of room for corruption and it is highly likely that presidents are chosen by higher powers. My opponent seems to be very naive when speaking about this process. But voting, Just like everything else in government, along with the entire presidential process, has a strict hierarchical platform. And in this hierarchical platform, we the people are the least effective in choosing our president. First we have the primaries, where delegates and even superdelegates vote in presidential nominees. Again, we the people have little to no say so as to who chooses these delegates to choose our candidates, or as to what candidates they choose. So right from the start we have the ability for the puppet master (higher power) to step in and choose his presidential puppet. So by the time the general elections come around, a president can already be paid for and sold into office, and we the people would never know it. My opponent seems to underestimate the power of special interest groups and the power of the almighty dollar within politics. Money is what rules over all government affairs, it's what influences the media and controls what people see. Any higher power who wants a certain candidate to win, can easily make sure that the candidate of his choosing takes office. Again, what the whole thing comes down to is how much do you trust these people to do the right thing? Sources: http://www.archives.gov... http://www.cfr.org...",

And I personally have no problem with the 16-18 age group being allowed to vote. If they can be tried by a jury as an adult they should have the right to vote. And right now people do not spend a lot of time voting once they are in the poll. It is the long lines that will only get longer once a test is required. And by giving states or the federal government to decide what can go on this test it can very well turn into a literacy test that is meant to prevent certain groups from voting. There would be nothing that would prevent a state like Alabama to simply only print the test in English, therefore preventing non-english speakers from having the right to vote. Simply put, having any sort of test opens a pandoras box of possible corruption and voter rights being in jeopardy. And when a person would only need a 20-30% completion it would not address voter ignorance or help combat it. For those who do not think they will pass the test, they will simply not go vote and it will lead to poorer voter turnout.",

            "conclusion": "On balance, people over 65 should not be able to vote in the United States political system",
            "premise": "MENTAL CAPACITY OF SENIORSMy opponent makes the case that seniors are not capable of voting well, due to the fact that they suffer certain degradations in their mental capacity as they age. He uses two sources to support the claim that seniors do suffer mental degradation. I will begin with the second source of the two used, for reasons that will soon be apparent.The following belongs to his second link regarding mental capacity, which is also the 8th of the entire argument:\"In general, however, the symptoms of cognitive decline that are associated with aging include: 1.Slower inductive reasoning / slower problem solving 2.Diminished spatial orientation 3.Declines in perceptual speed 4.Decreased numeric ability 5.Losses in verbal memory 6.Few changes in verbal ability\"It is important to note that the decline of these mental processes don't negatively affect the ability to vote. The ability to reason and solve problems may be slowed, but that does not mean the quality of their conclusions is diminished. Spatial orientation is related to one's ability to \"see and understand the relationships between shapes, spaces, and areas.\"[1] Good quality spatial orientation is obviously not needed for acceptable quality voting. The rest of the 6 issues listed hardly need defining, and we can see that they don't affect one's ability to decide who they wish to vote for. Now let's talk about the first link regarding mental health that my opponent used. He quotes the page, saying, \"Due to age, \"there are declines in mental domains such as processing speed, reasoning, memory and executive functions, some of which is underpinned by a decline in a general cognitive factor.\"(7)\"The one worrying thing in here is that it seems to imply that the ability to reason diminishes with age. Two things about this. First, my opponent mis-represents the fact by cutting off the beginning of the sentence, which states, \"Beginning from early adulthood...\" Not only does this show that his source does not talk about the specific issues seniors face, but it shows that most voters who aren't seniors are not entirely removed from those issues, raising the question of whether or not seniors are especially worthy of being singled out. Secondly, and far more importantly, this fact is only briefly mentioned, goes unsupported, and is listed in a section titled, 'Areas of Agreement and Controversy'. The statement that my opponent utilizes goes unspecified as either something that is widely agreed upon or widely debated, and as such, the validity and reliability of this information should be considered suspect. SUPERIOR POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE OF SENIORSA recent study has found that seniors are far more knowledgeable and informed than the other age voting blocs in America.[2] And no, 'informed' doesn't mean that they all watch Fox News religiously. At least, we can reasonably assume so, since in our last election only 56% of seniors voted for Romney.[3] Compare that to the way those 18-29 voted, 60/37 in favor of Obama[3], we can see that seniors are hardly blind, impulsive voters. If any age group is likely to be mentally incapable, based simply on the impulsiveness of their voting, it would be the youngest group of voters.Often the phrase, \"An uniformed voter is a bad voter\" is spoken. In a country whose political system relies on the people voting to represent their needs, this is certainly true. The issue of uninformed voters is something that certainly begs addressing, and blocking your most informed group of people is a step in the wrong direction.I would submit that the mostly irrelevant information presented by my opponent regarding decreasing mental processes is negated by the fact that seniors are more informed voters, and informed in a way that doesn't mean they've been propagandized en masse.FUNCTION OF DEMOCRACYIn a democracy, everybody is supposed to have a voice, in order that everyone has the best shot of having their needs met. How are seniors to voice their needs if they don't have a vote? My opponent might suggest that everyone else will do it for them. After all, we're all gonna be seniors one day, so we don't want to screw seniors only to find ourselves dealing with the mess years down the road. Have you ever assumed life would be one way down the road, only to get to that point 'on the road' and find that you were wrong? I think we all have. It is a normal occurrence, and I see no reason why this could not occur if we were to take the right to vote from seniors. It is very possible that misconceptions about dat #seniorlyfe will lead us to vote in a way that is contrary to the needs of seniors, without knowing of our errors until we are seniors ourselves. Think about all the misinformation circulated in regards to politics. It's reasonable to say that this propensity towards misinformation could negatively affect non-seniors voting for seniors. SLIPPERY SLOPEIn a world where the American public can approve of taking away roughly 25% of registered voters'[4][8][9] right to vote, the idea that the right to vote can be taken away if one is perceived as a somehow deficient voter would have to be widely accepted. If it is accepted enough to take out that large a chunk of voters, where else can that concept be applied?IQ? Government-decided and created political knowledge tests? Singling out of other voting groups? If one takes the justification behind barring seniors from voting, one could end up with any of these things taking place.Take the concept of seniors having their needs poorly represented as expressed in the previous section, and apply it to groups who've been singled out because they don't have a certain level IQ, or don't know the information the government deems necessary to be able to vote. In the former, we could definitely see attitudes of elitism develop, where those who can still vote see themselves as superior in such a way that only their opinions really matter, thus not properly representing the needs of the supposed inferior. In the latter, we could see government corruption running rampant, where authority controls the vote, instead of the other way around.All of this may sound alarmist, but this is about contextualization. If society can accept the idea being debated here, they're comfortable with saying, \"They are inferior, they will not be allowed to vote,\" in regards to large groups of people.INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSSimply put, doing this would make America look extremely bad in the eyes of our democratic allies, especially the eyes of the UN. The UN fervently supports democracy[5], and has established legal international bases regarding the requirements of democracy.[6] It is likely that if America were to break the status quo and take away voting rights from a whole group of people, there would be repercussions, possibly in the form of harmful economic sanctions.I say there would likely be repercussions because America is supposed to be a haven for democratic principles. A country as large as ourselves turning our backs on democracy could create a trend that pushes back against democracy, especially in countries where governments have only grudgingly accepted democracy. The UN would prioritize reversing America's decision, in order to ensure that no anti-democracy trends were set.Not only is the UN likely to pressure the US in some way, so too are many of the world's other democratic nations. Perhaps political leaders of many countries would not care if we were to restrict voting for seniors, but many of their voters would care, and urge some sort of reaction. 43% of the world's population are free, living in societies with respect for civil and political rights.[7] It is important to note that many of these people are our European allies.With a number that high, reprecussions are sure to be generated.BETTER ALTERNATIVESIf the issue is mental capacity, there are more effective ways to 'solve' that problem. Testing. Clearly it's possible, or else there wouldn't be any statistics regarding the mental health of seniors. All we would need to do is take the average ability for mental processes relevant to voting, and have anyone testing too far underneath that average prevented from voting.This way, the issue raised here regarding poor mental capacities is completely dealt with. Both of my opponent's sources regarding mental health of seniors shows that 1) Mental degradation takes place as soon as early adulthood, and 2) Mental degradation of seniors is not uniform. Clearly, generalizing seniors as incapable voters, and non-seniors as capable voters, is a fallacy. Testing would be a way around this, while also satisfying my opponent's problem.ON BALANCEOn one hand, you have the questionable idea that seniors are declining in mental processes necessary for voting. On the other, they're our most knowledgeable voters, there's potential for poor representation with harmful effects, and potential for harmful international repercussions. To top all of that off, there is an alternative that is less sloppy in its solving of the problem my opponent has. I believe it's reasonable to say that at this point, there are far more reasons to be against this idea than for it. It would not make sense to defer to my opponent's idea when this one solves the issue more elegantly and completely.

            "conclusion": "Super pacs harm the election process.",
            "premise": "In order to be fair i will refrain from posting a rebutall this round. Before I start I would like to offer one sole observation: 1) As noted by political watchdog the electoral knowledge the three pillars of any electoral process are voter participation, informed citizens and transparency. Contention 1: The Citizens united ruling increase voter turnout. According to \"the Center for Responsive Politics, in the 2012 presidential race over $380,000,000 have been raised by super PACs and $330,000,000 have been spent\".This money according to the wall street journal is so super PACs can run advertisements for or against political candidates.. This is important because these advertisements are essential for maintaining voter turnout according to Paul freedman of the University of Virginia \"respondents were as much as 10 percentages Points more likely to vote if they watched television in media Markets that were bombarded with presidential ads\". Furthermore, according to Dr. Hillygus of Duke University \"Among those who early in the campaign did not intend to vote, exposure to ads increased intentions to vote by 18 percentage points\". The impact of this is that by increasing voter turnout we get a more accurate representation of the publics will which is the purpose of the election process. Contention 2: citizens united allows voters to make informed decisions According to political scientist David Downing \"without freedom of media and wider freedom of speech people cannot make informed decisions on how they should vote\". This is important because according to Hans von Spakovsky, former member of the Federal Election Commission \"many associations we have in this country (no matter which side of the political aisle they are on), from the NAACP to the Sierra Club to the National Rifle Association, are also corporations. Yet those corporate associations were prohibited under penalty of criminal and civil sanctions from expressing the views of their members. This means that before this landmark decisions many important organizations where barred from expressing their opinions and thus the public lacked vital information that may have significantly affected the outcome of previous elections. Lastly this increase in corporate spending does not favor either political party since according to matt bia a correspondent for the new York times campaign spending tends to be cyclical since when one party increases its spending the other party tends to mobilize and increase its spending. Thus not only does citizen united create more informed voters but it also prevents any one party from gaining an advantage. Contention 3: Citizens united increases transparency According to the center for political accountability 85% of company\"s increased their disclosure over the last election cycle and there has been an 11% overall increase in disclosure rates. David Weigel a correspondent for the Washington post supports this consensus and notes \"there's more information out there about super PAC donors than there is about virtually any other kind of campaign fundraising. The impact of this increased transparency is twofold: sub point a) Transparency reduces political corruption, as noted by political watchdog the electoral knowledge \"Transparency makes institutional systems and the actions/decisions they take widely accessible and understood [and] It is difficult to maintain or publicly justify a system that permits abuse and corruption\". This corruption is devastating to the democratic process as noted social advocate John Samuel states \"The subversion, misuse and abuse of power tends to undermine the process and content of the democratic process\" sub point b) Transparency allows voters to maintain confidence in our democratic system according to John Wonderlich of the sunlight foundation \"Public knowledge of the money flowing into our politics is absolutely fundamental to public accountability in campaigns and elections, [because] without it we can\"t properly\" maintain confidence in our democratic system\". Voter confidence is essential because as Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico notes \"If voters do not have faith in this most fundamental aspect of a democratic society \" then the legitimacy of representative government might be at risk\" and If we can\"t even trust are representatives then we have completely undermined the entire purpose of the election process. Thus for all the aforementioned reasons I urge a con ballot.

            "premise": "I affirm the resolution Resolved: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory. Definitions Ought - \"used to indicate duty or correctness.\" (Oxford Dictionaries Online) Compulsory Voting \" A system of elections in which citizens who have the right and means to vote are required by law to vote. Nonvoters in this system face fines. Democracy \" \"government by the people; especially\": rule of the majority\" (Merriam-Webster online) Equality \" \"the state of being equal, especially in having the same rights, status,\"and opportunities\" (MacMillan Dictionary) My value\"will be democracy, defined earlier as a government by the people. This value is appropriate because the resolution is a question of how to uphold democracy. It is important because a democratic government should uphold the principle of the \"rule of the majority\" as strongly as possible. My\"criterion\"will be equality. Equality is an important pillar of democracy that compulsory voting strengthens by ensuring that all individuals get a voice in government. Without it, democracy cannot exist because certain groups may face disenfranchisement as a result. Note: In this system, all ballots will have an option of \"none of the above.\" This option is intended to protect the right not to vote. Checking this option is still meaningful to candidates because it shows that there are a number of votes that are still up for grabs, and if politicians address the needs of the groups who tend to pick this option, they can persuade those individuals to vote for them. Contention 1: Low Voter Turnout Threatens Democracy a.\"Low Turnout Threatens Majority Rule Low voter turnout is an issue in many democratic countries. Even worse is that with each passing generation, the average turnout is dropping steadily. The United States is a perfect example of this. Jason\"Marisam, Post-Graduate Research Fellow-Harvard Law School, 2009, \"Voter Turnout: From Cost to Cooperation,\" St. Thomas Law Review, Winter, 21 St. Thomas L. Rev. 190, p. 192-3 First, I will present the facts.\"Voter turnout has fallen significantly during the past several decades.\"Most\"estimates show a decline of ten to fifteen points for turnout in both presidential and non-presidential elections from the 1960s to today.\"The official numbers from the U.S. Census report turnout at 69.3% in 1964 and at 58.3% in 2004, which was up from the low of 54.2% in 1996. The drop in turnout looks better or worse depending on how one crunches the numbers, but the bottom line is that\"turnout in the past several decades has declined in most advanced democracies with the United\"States at the\"bottom of the pack among this group in terms of overall turnout. Some may be satisfied with the fact that turnout is up so far this decade in comparison to the last decade. However, it is imprudent to depend on once-in-a-lifetime campaigns or political events to mobilize voters. If the goal is sustained, high turnout nationally among all demographic groups should increase. In a democracy, it is ultimately the will of the people that decide the outcomes of elections and influential policy decisions. If voter turnout is low, then it\"s possible that the so-called majority could actually be a minority of the population making decisions for the entire population. This goes against the very definition of democracy as the rule of the people. Compulsory voting fixes this problem by increasing voter turnout. Australia is an example of how compulsory voting has been successful. Scott Bennett, Parliament of Australia, 2005, Compulsory voting in Australian national elections, Parliamentary Library-Research Brief, October, No. 6, [http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au...], p. 1 Academic analysis shows that\"compulsory voting is likely to produce a high turnout of voters,\"wherever it is used. \"There is no doubt that the Australian arrangements produce a high figure, for\"Australia's is one of the most consistently high turnouts anywhere in the world -- an average of 94.5 percent in the 24 elections since 1946. \"The Netherlands averaged a turnout of 94.7 percent before compulsory voting was abolished in 1971, and a turnout of 81.4 percent in the years since. \"A similar drop in Australia would amount to about 1.5 million fewer voters in a national election. In the older democracies that have voluntary voting, the turnout has usually been in the order of 70 to 80 percent, though in recent elections such countries have actually experienced a marked decline in turnout.\" \"Compulsory voting solves this problem by giving individuals an equal say in their government. More people go out to vote, and as a result, the majority actually rules. As a result, the decisions of the democracy become more legitimate because the results are being decided by a majority of the entire population, not just the majority of the portion of the population that decided to vote. The equality in status that compulsory voting provides makes the decisions that people make for the democracy more legitimate, which thus upholds democracy. b.\"Low Voter Turnout Creates an Unrepresentative Democracy Sarah\"Birch, Reader in Politics-University of Essex, 2009, \"The case for compulsory voting,\" Public Policy Research, March-May, p. 23 An election can be thought of as a political census in which near universal participation is required to generate political decisions that are an accurate reflection of what the population actually wants.\"When less than two-thirds of the electorate goes to the polls, the government that results from this election typically has the expressed support of well under a third of those eligible to vote.\"Democratic legitimacy concerns may not weigh heavily with the ordinary voter, but they certainly do trouble the collective minds of governments, and it is no wonder that falling turnout should have generated hand-wringing among the political elite.\"Compulsory turnout would ensure that virtually all voices are taken into account, and that the outputs of the electoral process thus have full democratic legitimacy. Unless a true majority of the population votes, an election is illegitimate because a minority of the population is masquerading itself as a majority. By giving all individuals equal access to ballots, this problem can be corrected because the voices of all individuals would be taken into account. This is the only way to ensure a legitimate democracy; a democracy cannot represent the people unless all voices are accounted for. Contention 2: The Status Quo Creates an Imbalance of Power Skewed Towards the Wealthy It has also been shown that there are large gaps in voter turnout between different socioeconomic groups. Studies have shown that wealthier individuals are much more likely to vote than those who are impoverished. Sarah\"Birch, Reader in Politics-University of Essex, 2009, \"The case for compulsory voting,\" Public Policy Research, March-May, p. 22 The gap in turnout between socio-economic groups is\"less pronounced, but still\"alarmingly large: depending on the measure of socio-economic status employed, it ranges from 13 to 16 per cent between those at the lowest and those at the highest rungs of the ladder\"(Keaney and Rogers 2006). These figures suggest that\"there is a serious inclusivity problem associated with electoral politics. As long as the poor don\"t vote, politicians will not spend much time addressing their needs because they are unlikely to vote. Instead, they will cater to the needs of the middle class and the wealthy because they will likely make up the majority of the people who vote. As a result, the status quo has a system of elections that is biased towards wealthier individuals. This leads to policies that are skewed towards these groups because the politicians are catering to them so that they can guarantee their vote in the future. If compulsory voting is instilled, this problem will be solved because now, everyone is voting. As a result, politicians will address to the needs of these disenfranchised groups, which leads to equality amongst all groups because policies will be passed which fairly benefit both the wealthy and those in poverty, which benefits democracy by taking into account the voices of all groups of people. Democracy is also enhanced when this happens because a key principle of democracy is that the government serves the people. In this case, compulsory voting serves the people by reducing income inequality. Because the will of the people dictates that the government should do whatever it can to help the people, the will of the people dictates that the government ought to enact compulsory voting. Contention 3: Compulsory Voting Decreases Political Polarization Political polarization occurs when political attitudes diverge towards ideological extremes. Compulsory voting can solve this problem. Eric Liu. \"Why Voting Should Be Mandatory.\" Times.\"August 21,\"2012. http://ideas.time.com... Second, as William Galston of the Brookings Institution argues,\"it would temper the polarization of our politics. In today\"s electorate, hardcore partisan believers are over-represented; independents and moderates are under-represented. If the full range of voters actually voted, our political leaders,\"who are\"exquisitely attuned followers, would go where the votes are: away from the extremes.\"And\"they would become more responsive to the younger, poorer and less educated Americans who don\"t currently vote. Even though the evidence specifically mentions the United States, it is easy to cross-apply this analysis to other democracies. Those that have multiple parties are bound to run into this problem because in the status quo, the first goal of the parties is to get their partisan bases to vote, and whichever base gets more votes wins the election. Moderates are left out in this system. Compulsory voting eliminates this strategy because now, individuals from varied views will be voting. This equality amongst all types of political views will mean that politics will become less polarized. This is because candidates must now focus on those with moderate views that were previously left out of campaign discourse. This improves democracy because the will of all people, not just those with partisan views, is represented. For this reason as well others stated throughout my case, I strongly urge an affirmative ballot in today\"s debate.",

            "conclusion": "Voter photo id laws.",
            "premise": "Rebuttal round (1) Photo ID laws place a severe burden on a significant number of voters. \"Studies indicate that 11 percent of American citizens, more than 21 million people, don\"t have a state-issued photo ID.\" The study linked to does indeed show that number. What my opponent fails to show is how many of those 21 million people can still easily vote, with their military ID, government or employer ID, school ID, certificate of live birth, passports and several other methods that escape me at the moment. Claiming that 22 million people are cut off from voting as a result of a few common sense laws to eliminate voter fraud is extremely dishonest. My opponent cites a few studies that show voter ID does effect voter turn out, but let's take a look at what these citations, actually say. \"Voter identification requirements alone do not determine turnout. Multivariate models that take into account other predictors of voting can paint a more complete picture of the relationship between voter identification requirements and turnout.\" http://www.brennancenter.org... \"Indiana passed its voter ID law in 2005, and it is among the strictest in the nation. The law requires voters to present a state or federal government-issued photo ID with a valid expiration date.47 If the voter does not possess an ID, they may cast a provi- sional ballot. In order for the ballot to be counted, the voter must appear before the circuit court clerk or county election board within ten days eitherto present ID or to execute an affidavit declaring that the voter is indigent or has a religious objection to being photographed.48 Indiana does provide a free voter ID card, but obtaining it requires identification documentation. The district court found that the law placed no significant burden on the right to vote. \" http://journalistsresource.org... Even my opponents citations, support my position. \"note that photo ID laws impose much more than a small cost; low-income individuals simply cannot afford to pay $75 to $175 just so that they can vote. That cost virtually guarantees that they won't vote, given the perception that their \"one vote\" won't matter.\" I don't know where my opponent is getting his stats, but my ID cost me $20. In Indiana where they have voter ID laws, they made state issued ID's free for those who couldn't afford them. I think we can all afford free. (2) Voter-impersonation fraud is exceedingly rare and doesn't justify photo ID requirements. Voter impersonation fraud happens, and it happens frequently. We can use Occam's Razor to know this. People will get away, with what they can, and when it comes to idealogues, the ends always justifies the means. I think we can all agree that idealogues are quite attracted to the political realm. The reason it is so hard to detect in person voter fraud is because it is almost untraceable. It is not like the person showing up, shows ID and that ID to prove their identity. We just have to have the honor factor, without voter ID laws. Do you guys actually trust the guys on the other side of the aisle not to cheat? We know in voter fraud occurs, because every time a watchdog organization attempts to do it, they are successful. According to the National Review: \"But New York City\"s watchdog Department of Investigations has just provided the latest evidence of how easy it is to commit voter fraud that is almost undetectable. DOI undercover agents showed up at 63 polling places last fall and pretended to be voters who should have been turned away by election officials; the agents assumed the names of individuals who had died or moved out of town, or who were sitting in jail. In 61 instances, or 97 percent of the time, the testers were allowed to vote. Those who did vote cast only a write-in vote for a \"John Test\" so as to not affect the outcome of any contest.\" http://www.nationalreview.com... Even if one of these voters were caught (highly unlikely), it would still be difficult to prosecute them. \"Lawyers say that fraud is the most difficult crime to prove because showing that the act complained of actually happened is not enough. It must be proven that the perpetrator had intent to defraud. Like any fraud, voter fraud is by its nature generally very difficult to detect and prosecute. Voter fraud in the form of actual fraudulent balloting is especially hard to demonstrate in court. A prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person voted without having the right to vote, used fraud (deception) in the process, and intended to defraud the victim (in this case, the public). These facts can be hard to establish after the voter leaves the polling place.\" http://www.americanthinker.com... If this was election time, I'd take a hidden camera into a polling place and commit voter fraud to submit for evidence, right now.",

            "conclusion": "Expert Tier Tournament: Compulsory Voting",
            "premise": "Thanks, Pro.Rebuttal time!R1) TurnoutPro argues that having a large amount of non-voters is detrimental to democracy because it would mean a large portion of the people go unrepresented, which defeats its entire purpose (rule by the people). He goes on to argue that enforcing compulsory voting would increase voter turnout (obviously...). But this argument is very ideological in nature; sure, it is \"more democratic\" to have more voters, but one thing that democracy guarantees is the protection of rights, and compulsory voting is a clear violation of some people's right to inaction, as explained in my opening argument. On that note, Pro observes that a lot of the non-voting population consists of socio-economically disadvantaged groups that cannot vote simply because of \"situational forces\" (i.e. that it's often not a purposeful choice to exercise the right to inaction). And in that case, compulsory voting IS a justifiable method of getting more of them to vote. However, compulsory voting, by definition, doesn't just apply to those disadvantaged groups; it applies to ALL citizens... and we must note that there are plenty of other non-voters who make a *conscious decision* not to vote for a variety of personal reasons, thus exercising their right to inaction (http://www.people-press.org...). For these people, the enforcement of compulsory voting results in a violation of their rights.What compulsory voting does, then, is that it solves one problem (low turnout from poorer citizens) while creating another (a rights violation for purposeful non-voters). Thus, it is far more beneficial for the government to find other ways to mitigate the \"situational forces\" preventing socio-economically disadvantaged people from voting.This contention does not affirm the resolution at all; the rights violations that it would entail make alternative solutions to socio-economic voting barriers preferable to the enforcement of compulsory voting. Also, I can cross-apply my argument regarding \"bad\" voting here, to show that a lower turnout could plausibly be *better* for society as a whole, from a strictly practical perspective. R2) ViolencePro argues that compulsory voting causes more people to be involved in government, which oftentimes reduces social unrest. I do not deny that having a large portion of the population to be unrepresented is dangerous. However, it is completely illogical to believe that people who choose not to vote would be causing turmoil over a lack of representation... And if Pro his referring to those \"socio-economically disadvantaged groups\" here, then this contention falls into the same trap as the last contention; compulsory voting, while it may be one possible method to increase voter turnout among the disadvantaged, is rendered unfavorable relative to alternative methods because of the rights violations it entails.R3) CitizenshipPro suggests, here, that being a citizen in a democracy naturally includes having an obligation to vote.However, the argument fails, as there is no logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. It is true that a democratic government affords each of its citizens political power in the form of voting, but that does not mean that all citizens have an obligation to *use* that power; they should be able to utilize their natural right to inaction to abstain from using their power if they wish to do so. The power being vested in \"the people\" does not necessarily mean that each and every person needs to participate in exercising that power. If someone refuses to exercise their power, it is their own loss.CONCLUSIONS-Compulsory voting may have its benefits when it comes to helping those who are simply unable to vote due to external circumstances, but when it comes to people who purposefully choose not to vote, it is nothing more than a violation of their right to inaction.-Voting cannot be said to be a democratic obligation because being *allowed* to do X is not a valid logical basis for being *required* to do X. A person who does not wish to exercise the power given to them in a democracy should be free to do so.Back to you, Pro!",

            "conclusion": "Direct representation should be adopt for legislatures",
            "premise": "1Alyssa, I appreciate You accepting this challenge. On point #1, if the only \u201cmore procedures\u201d which would \u201cslow down the entire decision-making progress\u201d of concern are the \u201ccareful calculation\u201d of Each Representative\u2019s votes, that data can be easily automated. Currently, in the United States House of Representatives, the institution which I reference as \u201cthe existing model\u201d, in order to vote, Each Representative takes Their official congressional identification, places it into a voting station and presses a button indicating \u201cAye\u201d or \u201cNay\u201d; the voting station reads from the identification, the identity of the Representative and records the vote electronically; to accommodate direct representation, the information stored on the identification could also include the relative voting weight of the respective Representative and the voting machinery could easily adjust accordingly. Regarding point #2, minority voices will indeed be heard and will be given weight proportionate to that of the Voters; the \u201climited\u201d power concern raised is actually experienced now under what We might call the \u201cWinner take all\u201d system. Presume, for a moment, Americans all voted along racial lines: Whites only elect Whites, Blacks only elect Blacks, Latinos only elect Latinos. Under direct representation, One would expect ~17% of the votes to go to latino Representatives, ~13% of votes to go to black Representatives, ~5% of votes to go to asian/pacific island Representatives, 1.2% of votes to go to american indian/alaskan native Representatives, and ~63% of votes to go to white Representatives. Meanwhile, under the Winner take all system, We currently see only 6.9% of Representatives are Latinos, 8.1% of Representatives are Blacks, 2.4% of Representatives are Asians/Pacific Islanders, less than 0.5% of Representatives are American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and over 80% of Representatives are Whites. As such, the representation of minority populations can only be enhanced by direct representation. Contrary to the assertion, incentives to compromise will not be lacking: if One is elected to the legislature in a direct representation system, Voters expect One to accomplish certain goals and, if those goals are not met, the One would more readily find Voters transferring Their votes to Someone Else, diminishing One\u2019s influence in the legislature; if compromise is necessary and/or helpful to accomplishing those goals, One will have a good reason to compromise so as to keep Constituents satisfied. As a result, polarization will actually be less likely than now, where One only needs satisfy a majority or sometimes only a plurality of Voters in order to retain the same influence in the legislature. With respect to point #3, the premise seems faulty: in no democratic republic is the \u201cpublic\u201d expected to compromise; only Legislators are expected to do so and, as I note above, direct representation provides Legislators more incentive to compromise and not less. As We have seen with the United States in the last few years, Representatives can and, to a sizable degree, do represent \u201ca highly adamant force that refuses to compromise\u201d and America has had gridlock as a result. Cf., \u201cshowdowns\u201d over the debt ceiling and the recent shutdown of the federal government. Conversely, under direct representation, instead of asserting directly or indirectly a mandate to represent an entire electoral district, Representatives will only have a mandate from the Voters selecting Them as Representative and then only to the extent of the said specific Voters. Additionally, Representatives in this new system will not be able to turn Voters having preferred a different Candidate into \u201cpolitical hostages\u201d because said Voters will have sent different Representatives, though They may have less voting weight, undercutting the ability to remain stubborn in the manner described. For example, if Izzy Idiot currently holds the only seat from Wyoming, Izzy is going to try to assert just as much influence in the congress if 100% of Voters approve or only 50%+1 Voters approve. Meanwhile, in a direct representation system, the state might send 4 Representatives and, if voting weight in the congress is proportionate to the fraction votes received, the republican Representative might have only 65% of the influence Izzy has under the current system, the democratic Representative might have only 20% of the influence Izzy has, the independent Representative might have only 13% of the influence Izzy has, and the \u201cEverybody Else\u201d Representative might have only 2%, resulting in a wider mix of voices and views being considered and the interests and desires of the People more accurately reflected. As noted, Each of the Representatives will have increased incentives to compromise and achieve goals. The assertion \u201cif each representative can get elected by being highly polarized, he/she will compromise\u201d seems contradictory to the rest of the argument made.",

            "conclusion": "Personal Electronic Devices in the Classroom should be allowed",
            "premise": "AffResolved: Personal Electronic Devices in the classroom should be allowed.WLPPFDef: Personal electronics refers to any instrument that uses electricity, for ex: tablets, cell phones, and computers that is owned by the student for at least a one-year term.Standard:The standard, or weighing mechanism, for this debate should be the quality of education. Since this debate is about personal electronics in the classroom, it will impact education the most. The team that can best prove that their side of the resolution betters the quality of education should win today\u2019s debate.WTS, WH3AContention 1: EbooksEbooks, or books read on screens, are the new revolutionary way of reading.Educause.edu asserts that ebooks improve learning because they: have built-in dictionaries, pronunciation guides, and highlighting, motivating students to check the meaning of each word and pronounce it correctly can also integrate video, audio, animation, and interactive simulation Access to newspapers for freeIn addition, there is cost benefits, according to about.com: Average of $5.50 savings per nonfiction book and textbooks Average of $2 savings per fiction bookSo judge, clearly ebooks have more capabilities that regular books. These capabilities have been shown to enhance learning, and provide costs at a lower price. This argument ties into the standard because, obviously, if you have something at a lower cost, you would most likely buy it. Therefore, students will have more educational materials with them, and the savings can also translate into increased funding for other classes that can further enhance student learning.Contention 2: Enhances learningAccording to Report to the President on the Use of Technology to strengthen K-12 Education in the United States, co-authored by Charles Vest, the former president of MIT, electronics have been very promising to improve America\u2019s education by giving us: valuable skills in logic Access to educational websites More extracurricular and interactive learningThese skills have been shown to yield the following results: Carrollton City School District (Georgia): Computer technology has reduced the dropout rate from 19 percent to 5 percent (74% decrease), and the failure rate in ninth grade algebra from 38 percent to 3 percent (92% decrease). Clearview Elementary School (California): the use of technology resulted in an increase in standardized test scores from the bottom 10 percent to the highest 20 percent in the state.Maine.gov also states that student assigned laptops have improved the student\u2019s education: Writing scores improved by 33% 2 times more students met the state standards vs. students who weren\u2019t assigned a laptop in class.As you can see, judge, personal electronic devices have already prevailed in classrooms that have already allowed them. They are shown to enhance learning and improve the quality of education, tying into our standard.Contention 3: Group learning and file sharingAccording to thirteen.org, group learning encourages: diversity more interaction in student learning Peer feedbackAccording to \u201cPros and Cons of File Sharing\u201d, file sharing, or exchanging files on a computer network, encourages: Flow of ideas from everyone Efficient working: each student can revise on different computers at the same time. Therefore, file sharing can involve more students compiling up their ideas into one report, thus improving the learning experience for children.Since dictionary.com defines file sharing as exchanging files on a computer network, it can only be done electronically. In addition, email and other network servers promote group learning, and all of its benefits. If personal electronic devices were allowed in the classroom, the quality of education for students could improve a lot by promoting both group learning and file sharing.",

            "discussionTitle": "Autumn Regular Tournament: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory",
            "conclusion": "Autumn Regular Tournament: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory",
            "premise": "IntroductionTo first know what ought to be the case in a democracy, we must know what is most democratic. It is an implicit assumption that, if one is to ask what a democracy ought to do, the correct answer would be that it ought to do what is most democratic. A good democracy is democratic, a bad democracy is undemocratic - any other properties a democracy may have are irrelevant to whether it is a good democracy, only whether it is democratic pertains to what it ought to be like.I presume thett3 accepts this observation, but if he disagrees, I would challenge him to provide an alternate criteria for a good democracy.So, the question of this debate is; would making voting compulsory to all eligible voters be something that is more democratic and better for the general welfare of this country? I will argue that the answer to this question is yes.Note that whenever I mention 'the people' or 'all the people' within the context of this debate, I extend the caveat that this does not mean those who are ineligible to vote, such as children or the mentally handicapped.A1 - Voter turnoutThe principle of a democratic government is that in which all the people are involved in either governing the country or voting for representatives to govern on their behalf. This is supported by the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines a democracy as:'Government by the people; esp. a system of government in which all the people of a state or polity (or, esp. formerly, a subset of them meeting particular conditions) are involved in making decisions about its affairs, typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly' (1)The emphasis is my own, and highlights the principle that democracy requires that all the people be involved in the governing process, either by voting or by actively developing legislature. In other words, it is more democratic if all the citizens of a country are democratically involved as opposed to only a certain amount of them. Of course this excludes children and the mentally handicapped, since these persons are, by their nature, unable to use sound judgement and hence would be unable to take responsibility for having a role in the governance of their country.Furthermore, a crucial principle of a legitimate democracy is that it must have a mandate. In other words, the government must be able to justify its authority. Yet if we have only around 50% of citizens actually voting, then it would usually follow that less than half of the population actually expressed their consent to be governed by the victorious political party. Let us say that a country has a 60% voter turnout and the winning party wins by a majority of 70%. This means that only 42% of the people actually voted for this government. But this raises the question of whether a government can legitimately have a mandate to rule if the majority do not explicitly support them. Democracy is defined as rule by the people, but if the majority of the people didn't actually choose to be governed by the goverment that now governs them, then this somewhat contradicts the definition of a democracy. Therefore, a strong mandate is necessary for a strong and valid democracy, and a strong mandate can only be achieved with a high voter turnout.Now, let us take two possible worlds:1. Our world, but voting is non-compulsory2. Our world, but voting is compulsoryWhich, then, would be more democratic? As I have elucidated above, the more democratic world is (all else being equal) that which has the most amount of its people involved. So which of the above worlds, 1 or 2, has the most amount of its people democratically involved?Many countries have systems in which voting is not compulsory, and in these countries the voter turnout is generally low. In the USA, the 2012 presidential election saw only 54.7% voter turnout (2)- meaning that nearly half of the voting age population were not involved in the democratic process. This phenomenon is very common in democratic countries with non-compulsory voting - rarely does it happen that the overwhelming majority of citizens decide to vote; the figure is commonly around 60% (3).Compare this to countries in which voting is compulsory, the prime example being Australia. Their voter turnout is consistently around 95% (4). In case anyone suspected that this was an anomaly, I only need to present the cases of Argentina and Brazil, which both have voter turnouts of around 80% (5)(6).The evidence lends strong credence to my hypothesis that making voting compulsory will improve voter turnout. Voter turnout is a valid analogy for political/democratic involvement because voting is the primary (and often only) manner in which the average citizen is able to express their political interest.Since making voting compulsory increases voter turnout, and a high voter turnout is more democratic than a lower one, then it follows that making voting compulsory is more conducive to a democratic society. In other words, democracies with compulsory voting are more democratic than countries without compulsory voting.A2 - Accessibility to votingIn systems where voting is not compulsory, the democratic process is skewed to give more political voice to those who are able bodied (7), those who haven't got strict employers and those with more spare time. These people are more likely to vote simply for logistical or convenience reasons, but there is no justification for a democracy to allow its system to be unfairly biased against groups of the population simply because of the state of their employment, where they live or their ability to get out the house.This problem would be solved by making voting compulsory, because people would have a significant motivation to vote (threat of punishment) regardless of convenience. Employers would also be obligated to make allowances for employees to vote. It is pertinent to mention that those in busy jobs are more likely to be unable to vote, simply due to the strains of living a busy life, whereas those who are unemployed will have plenty of time to vote. But surely it is the former that is contributing more to society by working hard? Therefore it is unjustified for the busy person to be less represented in parliament/congress than the person with lots of free time, since if anything it is a virtue to be busy and hard-working, certainly not something to be punished for.To summarise, a non-compulsory voting system allows for a biases to arise that arbitrarily discriminate against certain groups of people. Such a system is undemocratic when compared to a system in which these biases do not, or are less likely to, arise. It just so happens that the latter system requires that voting be compulsory.A3 - EducationMaking voting compulsory, as opposed to something that is optional, will most likely prompt more people to educate themselves and become more interested in politics. This is because, in a non-compulsory-voting system, it is very easy to ignore politics. One can easily live their lives paying no attention to politics, and this is made easy due to the fact that politics doesn't, at least explicitly, intrude on one's everyday life. It is very much a scenario of 'out of sight out of mind'.Yet if voting is compulsory, it is much harder to ignore politics because you are legally obligated to involve yourself. It stands to reason that this will create a demand for poltical education; after all, people are naturally curious and so it is natural that they would seek to learn more about what they could be voting for. Of course, this argument is theoretical, but nevertheless makes a lot of sense.But why should a democracy require voters to be educated? It all comes back to considerations of a government's mandate. If very few people were politically aware, then the government would have a weak mandate because it cannot be said with much confidence that the voters actually knew what they voted for. In contrast, an educated electorate gives the victorious government a strong mandate, because we can reasonably say that the majority of the voters did know who they were voting for.As explained earlier, a strong mandate is a requirement for a valid democracy. Hence because compulsory voting will incite the electorate to become more politically educated, and because an educated electorate is crucial for a valid democracy, compulsory voting is conducive to a valid democracy,A4 - ExtremismEvidence shows that those on the far-left and far-right of the politcal spectrum are more likely to vote than those with more moderate views (8). Regardless of the reasons for this fact, its truth is not conducive to a healthy democracy. This is because it means the composition of government is disproportionately controlled by non-moderates to a greater degree than moderates, despite the majority of people not identifying as non-moderate (9).The definition of a democracy is that which involves governance or representation of all people equally - if a democracy disproportionately represents non-moderates, a minority, then it cannot be said to be a good or valid democracy (given that a good democracy is loyal to its definition). If voting was compulsory, then moderates would be encouraged to vote - hence uprooting the disproportionate bias towards non-moderates and making the government more democratic.ConclusionI have presented four cogent arguments in favour of the resolution. All of them show why a compulsory voting system is more democratic than a non-compulsory voting system, and hence why the former ought to be the case in a democracy. This is because the criterion for the quality of a democracy is the degree to which it is democratic.___(1) http://bit.ly...(2) http://bit.ly...(3) http://pewrsr.ch...(4) http://bit.ly...(5) http://bit.ly...(6) http://bit.ly...(7) http://bit.ly...(8) http://bit.ly... figure 4(9) http://pewrsr.ch...",
