            "premise": "I will argue that police officers should be legally required to wear body cameras while on duty. Since purchasing body cameras for law enforcement agencies would be a public expense, I will accept the burden of proof in this debate. Sources can and should be posted in text after the arguments they are being used to support. -Power and authority should be accompanied by accountability. This is something that Sir Robert Peel recognized in his principles of policing which were developed to guide the first professional police force. One example: \"The ability of the police to perform their duties is dependent upon public approval of police actions.\" Body cameras an oversight tool which can be used to better hold officers accountable and maintain public trust. (Source: http://www.nwpolice.org...) -Body cameras have the two-pronged effect of encouraging police officers to act professionally and also defusing situations with subjects (who are less inclined to behave in discrediting ways when they know they are being filmed). In pilot projects where body cameras worn by police officers have been implemented and studied, complaints against officers have dropped over 90%. (Source: http://cjb.sagepub.com...) -Further expanding on the point of cameras being a tool to defuse situations, they will improve officer safety as subjects will be aware that their actions will be recorded on camera and those recordings could be used as evidence against them. -While cost is sometimes cited as an argument against the implementation of police body cameras, lawsuits against police agencies for misconduct can be extremely expensive for the agencies and the government bodies that oversee them. Body cameras can capture evidence that can discredit false complaints against officers and can prevent frivolous lawsuits from succeeding or forcing governments to provide unnecessary settlements. -Individual officers themselves are protected from false accusations in the form of complaints or lawsuits if they behave professionally and appropriately and their conduct is captured through body cameras. I'm looking forward to further debating this with anyone willing to argue the contrary position.",

            "premise": "Today as the con, I am going to prove to you that police officers should not wear body cameras while on duty at all times. My value today is morality. The reason why this is my value because I am going o prove that it is immoral to wear a body camera as it harms the people's rights, and the community as a whole. Contention 1: Body cameras are seen as an invasion of privacy. When body cameras are on, they will capture all civilian and police behavior. Now, not all people would like this. Some people find it very uncomfortable to be recorded while talking, as they find it invades privacy. Current law prevents a search, which invades privacy, and would everyone is not exactly comfortable for recording them, which will be there forever, and it is an embarrassing memory. Contention 2: Body cameras cost too much. A single camera costs about $350. Many small areas do not have the money and resources to provide these cameras for EVERY officer. Doing so would put the budget at a very uncomfortable position, and it leads for more debt to rise. Contention 3: A camera will never replace a whole investigation. Yes, it might replace many witnesses, but witnesses are more reliable. Witnesses can see 3-D, a camera can only see 2-D. A camera can not provide sole truth for the event because we still need a fair, through investigation. A recording shows 2-D, which only shows around. What we do no know is what really happened because we still need second guessing, and it will take much longer. It also gives a lot of the playing of the should've-couldn't game and a lot of guessing, instead of real testimonies. So with these reasons and many more, police officers should not wear body cameras while on duty. I respectfully, but strongly urge you to put a vote in the Con side today. `TheResistance",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: Police officers should be required to wear body cameras",
            "premise": "* This is not necessarily a round of police debate* Humanity has been on an ever eternal quest in search of felicity and safety. However, throughout mankind, there has been a series of crimes gone unsolved and detectives failing to solve assigned mysteries. Sadly, all have been failing to notice the very blatant solution to all of these. A way to ensure public safety and solve crimes is right in front of us and the proposition team wants this resolution to be implemented.Hello, I am Forever 23 and I am going to debate pro on the topic that police officers should not wear body cameras.I will first provide definitions and then introduce my own points.Body cameras- The cameras put on the uniforms of the police officers. They are of very high quality and NOT easily breakable. Now onto my own points.1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. Racial apartheid in the police force may seem impossible and implausible. However, that is the current reality. Today\u2019s world criminal justice system is not at all filled with justice. In fact, many times, the fortune and faith of the one convicted will depend on his race, ethnicity and skin color. Cameras however, will provide a much more objective view on the situation. Nothing can bestow more truth than the situation itself on a video. http://www.discoverthenetworks.org..., \"Los Angeles congresswoman Max Waters thinks that the system is racist, she stated that \u201cthe color of your skin dictates whether you will be arrested or not, prosecuted harshly or less harshly, or receive a stiff sentence or gain probation or entry into treatment.\u201d The late law professor Derrick Bell claimed that the justice system \u201cdisempowers people of color.\u201d At a presidential primary debate in 2008, Barack Obama charged that blacks and whites \u201care arrested at very different rates, are convicted at very different rates, [and] receive very different sentences ... for the same crime.\u201d That same night, Senator Hillary Clinton likewise disgrace the \u201cdisgrace of a criminal-justice system that incarcerates so many more African-Americans proportionately than whites.\u201d\"The only way to ensure honesty in our justice and jurisdiction system is by having objective footage. The \u201che did it because he is African American\u201d approach is not the way to go. The only way to make this system more fair to those of different races and skin colors is by implementing cameras. The real video will show what really happened, not from different people\u2019s point of view. The video is better than any testimony. Since, African Americans are judged many times by the skin color in court, they mostly get unfair punishments. In order for the punishment to fit the crime and to know what the crime even is, we need cameras on officers. Cameras on police officers will stop deliberate, false accusations against African Americans and make the justice system much more stronger and efficient. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. http://www.cam.ac.uk..., \"Knowledge that events are being recorded creates \"self-awareness\" in all participants during police interactions. This is the critical component that turns body-worn video into a 'preventative treatment': causing individuals to modify their behaviour in response to an awareness of 'third-party' surveillance by cameras acting as a proxy for legal courts\u2014as well as courts of public opinion\u2014should unacceptable behaviour take place. According to, http://phys.org..., \" During the 12-month Rialto experiment, use-of-force by officers wearing cameras fell by 59% and reports against officers dropped by 87% against the previous year's figures.http://www.cam.ac.uk...\"The 'preventative treatment' of body-worn-video is the combination of the camera plus both the warning and cognition of the fact that the encounter is being filmed. In the tragic case of Eric Garner, police weren't aware of the camera and didn't have to tell the suspect that he, and therefore they, were being filmed,\" said Dr Barak Ariel, from the Cambridge's IoC, who conducted the crime experiment with Cambridge colleague Dr Alex Sutherland and Rialto police chief Tony Farrar. The belief in police officers is at an all time low. That is quite harrowing because officers are the ones who protect us and safeguard us. People seeing officers as pernicious is not the way to benefit our society. In fact, many people dislike police force because of the utmost use of force. With officers being aware about the cameras strapped to their chest, they will be less likely to provide a criminal with unjustified force and more likely to do their jobs with fairness and the not needed force. That will result us in a much stronger police system and at the end, a stronger nation itself. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. The people of the USA see the benefits of the propositions plan. The majority of the US citizens want to see the plan in action. They want to ensure a safer future by not only arming officers with guns, but also giving them cameras to record the happening events. Judge, we need to listen to our public and make the safe. We should give the people what they want because in this particular case, the implementation of cameras will provide support to the security and democracy of the public.According to Huffington Post, 56% of voters stated that police body cameras would be beneficial to the police force. 13% stated that it will protect the unalienable rights of the US citizens. 25% of the poll takers figured that it would invade the privacy of people.6% figured that the officers should have the choice. 65,064 votes were supporting the resolution and 28,272 were considering this an invasion of privacy. http://www.nbcnews.com..., Tracey Knight, community liaison and PR officer for the Fort Worth Police Department, told NBC News. \"However, more and more officers are requesting to have one issued to them and some have even purchased their own.\"The people want it! The officers want it! The officials want it! The question is, then why not? Most people from different areas including the police officers themselves are willing to record the data happening on the streets. They are willing to have objective, documented footage. People are waiting to switch from the \u201che did it\u201d and the \u201cno I did not\u201d approach. The citizens of the USA are willing to make this nation change for the better and with the substantial support and assistance, the propositions plan will be able to function and even support the stance on majority decides. The propositions team plan is to make it required by law for every police officer to wear the Trascendent ProDrive Body 10 Body Camera. It will be very effective for this cause. I will further expand on this in the 2nd proposition speech. Thank you, vote pro.",

            "premise": "His refutation to my first point was that. We never stated the the crimes were fair. In fact, the opposition has completely misunderstood and obfuscated the simple argument that it will ensure a fair punishment to the criminal. Afterall, after seeing the situation, the decision makers will see what punishment fits the crime. And well of course, the punishment will in no way be unfair. If an unfair verdict is passed, there is always the video for evidence and the very simple statement can be said: Based on the video, the verdict was to strict/lax. He deserves a fair punishment since his rights are protected under the 8th amendment. Next, he refuted my majority point by saying that society may sometimes consider something wrong, right. He gave a few completely irrelevant examples. Such as, Nazi Germany. However, there is a very blatant difference between these to cases. The main difference is that the genocide was NOT made to HELP the public. It was a very obvious detriment. Here however, the public supports a movement which is supposed to ensure equality, and the use of less police force. In addition, the people did NOT support Nazi Germany. That is why brave soldiers from the US, Russia, France, England, etc have fought and risked their lives in order to end the terror. The second point, about the decreased use of duress remains standing as it was not refuted by the opposing side.Now, to restate my own points, introduce a new point and finally expand on my plan.So, my points were:1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police.3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. Now onto a new assertion:4. If we do the hard work to figure out how to maximize the accountability of the police and minimize the privacy risk, this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States. The opposition case in this debate will mostly be pointing out the ineffectiveness of these cameras, the costs and even uselessness. But in order for this plan to be successful, the police department must find the correct camera, find the most cheapest and yet efficient product and finally do more tests to find the effect of these cameras. If we do not take a serious approach to this situation, this plan will be a fail. However, with the right equipment, this system will run very well and efficiently. http://www.bhphotovideo.com..., Record your every move with the DrivePro Body 10 Body Camera from Transcend, ideal for security personnel like bodyguards and police officers. The camera can record up to 3.5 hours of continuous 1080p video recording and has a built-in microphone for recording audio. Integrated IR LEDs are automatically triggered in low-light environments allowing the camera to record footage regardless of the light setting. The front of the camera features an easily accessible snapshot button for taking still pictures while recording video. The body camera features a 360\u00b0 body clip which can quickly and securely attach the camera to a jacket or vest. IPX4-rated, the camera is water-resistant against splashing and rain, as well as shock-resistant. Footage is recorded to a microSD card and can be managed using the DrivePro Body Toolbox. While the camera is compatible with Microsoft and Mac operating systems, the DrivePro Body Toolbox is compatible only with Microsoft Windows systems.360\u00b0 clip for connecting the camera to a jacket or strap IR LEDs for night vision capability Built-in battery for easy charging and up to 3.5h of continuous recording Built-in microphone for recording audio, in addition to video Snapshot button for capturing on-demand stills IPX4-rated against water Shock resistant They pricing is affordable, 149.99. Currently however, according to CNBC, the TASER cameras are being used. These cameras are also very effective. In fact, they are able to get really clear footage. This camera is 359.99 only. Overall judge, throwing this idea into the trash can because of expenses and trouble finding the correct camera is such a waste. If the government puts some thought into this idea, it will happen. The prices are not as extreme as the opposition may suggest as shown in the evidence. In addition, the cameras brought for these practical prices provide with a clear image that helps resolve the conflict in minutes just by watching this video. Overall, judge the body cameras will have a major effect on the issue of abortheid in the justice system and duress used by police force. Simply, the decision of the court will be based of real objective footage. If something seemed or was unfair, just looking at the video would be proof. The punishment will start to truly fit the crime because once you have the video, the mass, nothing can really defy it. With body cameras strapped to their chests, police officers will second guess themselves and therefore will not use an excessive amount of force.Thank you, vote pro.",

            "premise": "My opponent brings up the very valid concern of privacy. However, the issue may not be a prevalent as it appears. Firstly, my opponent seems to b concerned with the general public gaining access to body camera footage. He specifically mentioned the Freedom of Information Act. The FIOA has many exceptions; the general public is not entitled to all government records: \"Exemption 7: Information compiled for law enforcement purposes that: 7(A). Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings 7(B). Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication 7(C). Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 7(D). Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source 7(E). Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions 7(F). Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual\" The government has already considered the privacy of the general public. Simply put, I can't file an FIOA request to receive footage of DUI arrests for an arbitrary reason. If, for instance, I was a lawyer taking a case against an alleged malpracticing police officer, I could easily receive footage. http://www.foia.gov... In terms of informants and traumatized victims, they would not have to worry about this information becoming public for the reasons mentioned above. The police should be instructed to inform the public of the exemptions of the FOIA. In the example of the 7 y/o boy, special procedures are in place to protect and respect victims. In that situation, it seems highly unlikely that serious questioning would occur directly after the event. The first responders will not be trying to extract information. At the end of the day, this is a problem not with body cameras but a with policy. In regard to police officers and discretion; the hierarchy of law enforcement agencies understand the massive role that discretion plays. There is good discretion and bad discretion. The hierarchies need to evaluate LEOs on their use of discretion. Body cameras can be invaluable to preventing bad discretion. Your specific example displays a poor use of discretion. The old women has an illegal firearm, when she could have easily registered it. She could have an insidious motive for having motive for having an unregistered firearm. Should that weapon be used in a crime, it will be difficult if not impossible to trace. With the presence of a body camera, his supervisor could inform the officer of his mistake and make a positive change.",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: Police officers should be required to wear body cameras",
            "premise": "Hello once again, I am Forever 23 and I will debate that police body cameras must be implemented. Firstly, I would like to to a rebuttal of my opponents refutations (he has not brought up any point and no new arguments in round 3), restate my assertions and summarize my plan. So first of all, I would like to point out that throughout his refutations, my opponent has been cherry picking my arguments, instead of letting the message pass on as a whole. Firstly, he pointed out that this will be fair only based on the government. However, the people agree with the government. The sane, they agree that murder is immoral, that stealing is immoral and that those who commit such crimes must be punished. The proposition team agrees that fairness is completely subjective. However, in our era, in our nation, there are certain moral values. Value that are followed because they are accepted by the general public. If the public did not accept these values, they would be different. Something subjective stays in place as long as the majority accepts it. Nobody is forcing \"fairness\" onto anyone. The people are accepting and praising the current moral standards. To take the root and heart of their refutation, \" Body cameras will allow one group of people to force their own subjective ideas of \"fairness\" unto other people. That was my point.\". Not one group of people at all! The majority. The population. This is not a single group, but an extremely large portion of the populace. Body cameras fit the current \"fair\" which makes the implementation of them necessary for the US government- a government based on the values THAT THE PEOPLE CREATED, NOT THE GOVERNMENT. Next, he mentions how once again everything is subjective. He expecially attacks the point on how genocide does NOT help the public by mentioning that some people thing that it does. He points out how Hitler thought that it was beneficial. Hitler was a man WITH AN INSANE MIND. It it not at all subjective that murder ir wrong. If you come up to a stranger on the street and ask, \"Why is murder wrong?\", the most common response will be, \"Just because it is wrong\". The majority of the public holds the opinion that both genocide and murder are wrong, making it applicable. And while a subjective opinion is applicable and accepted by the general public, it must be used and applies. Same with body cameras and modern day laws. Most have the subjective opinion that police officers should wear cameras. That makes it applicable. Since it is applicable, it must be implemented. My opponent talked a lot about how many support genocide. Does HE support the extremination of a certain race? I hope not. Which once again supports my case. Now, I would like to point out that my opponent has completely misunderstood all of my arguments. 1. Dwindle the amount of apartheid. This argument is about how objective footage will lower racial discrimination in the justice system. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used. Simple enough, the refutation was irrelevant. This argument was how police officers will use less force. 3. The majority supprots this. Not majority of government people. But of our citizens and even the officers. 4. If we do the hard work to figure out how to maximize the accountability of the police and minimize the privacy risk, this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States. Not personal values. The prop has evidence. If you look at some of the previous speeches, there has been evidence to proove how it result in less discrimination and force used by the officers. Which will then ensure safety. People want safety. Safety is what is wanted by the majority of the public, making this argument applicable. Overall, I would just like to summarize by saying that my opponent failed to understand and address 3 of my claims and my plan. Finally, to restate my plan. The Transcendent DrivePro Body camera will be put on all police officers. Well, how is it affordable? The 75 mil dollars given to the police dept, just the need for security, taxes, donations, and the price of the cameras- only 149.99 Thank you, vote pro.",

            "conclusion": "Law enforcement (in America) should be required to use body cameras during civilian interaction",
            "premise": "So I guess there were two other studies. The policies of the other departments still don\"t require body cams be turned on for every civilian interaction. For example in Orlando the policy is:\"Officers shall activate the (body-worn camera) whenever there is a potential for dealing with a suspect of a crime,\" states the policy. It adds that, \"(the camera) may be activated whenever the officer feels its use would be beneficial to his/her police duties.\" http://www.clickorlando.com...The San Diego guidelines advise police to not record victims of violent crime, or record peaceful protestors, when they perform their protection duties at those. http://voiceofsandiego.org...We can see that my opponent is advocating for a policy that has likely never been implemented before, and using data from studies that never required police to record all civilian interactions. If my opponent wants to replicate the results of those studies, he should follow the body worn camera guidelines they have. Not create his own unproven guidelines. My opponent should lose because the use of bodycams can be implemented with the same results, and without requiring the use of bodycams in every single civilian interaction.Impact analysisI\"ll keep this short. There isn\"t much to say, because this is such a clear loss for my opponent. Even without me adding anything. My opponent must show that bodycams should record every single civilian interaction. He has not done this. He has showed the usefulness of body cams for sure. Officers should use them for traffic stops, and when responding to service calls, but he has not given a single good reason (or any reason at all) to use them when talking to informants are victims of violent crimes. He needs to give some good reasons as to why bodycams should be used while talking to victims of violent crimes or why informants who may have to admit their own illegal activity to help a cop catch a bigger fish, should be recorded. I haven\"t won because I\"ve presented some sort of compelling evidence that police shouldn\"t be wearing body cams in every interaction with civilians (I have). I\"ve won because my opponent has failed to give a single reason why informants and victims should be recorded.Responses\"In response to the point about victims and informants, my opponent has resorted to insults and anecdotal evidence (which hardly even relates to the point of traumatized victims anyway, as he was not such).\"I have not insulted anybody, but this is an insult. How dare my opponent say an accident where I killed somebody and watched their mangled body squirming in odd and inhuman ways on the ground is not traumatic. How dare my opponent say I was not a victim who has had to live with the knowledge I have killed somebody, because of his own criminal behavior as well as the behavior of his buddies. My opponent should definitely lose some conduct points for this rude behavior. Between the conduct point, arguments and loss of the source point, my opponent cannot be allowed to win this debate.\"I can't see why a victim would be willing to talk with an LEO but be absolutely opposed to being on a body camera.\"This is silly to even say. There is a huge difference between talking with a cop who is acting like a trusted confidant, and talking to somebody with a camera where the footage will be reviewed by whoever puts it in the database, the chief of police, the district attorney, 12 jurors, a judge whoever happens to be in the courtroom that day, and numerous media outlets displaying the footage to millions of people. Without the bodycam a victim is crying on the shoulder of a trusted confidant, with the body cam (AKA evidence for a court case, likely pulled up by the defense team to find tiny contradictions), the victim is talking to a large group of people. The situation with an informant is worse, especially if we are dealing with organized crime. Way to give somebody the death sentence who gave a police officer who used his information to bust a hitman pro. \"This is what my opponent failed to prove. The footage would also be helpful in determining what exactly the victims initial responses were. What if they changed their story later on to help their case?\"This is what a written witness statement is for. The victim can type down a statement about what happened, and still have a shoulder to cry on where she can say whatever she wants (Personal wise not evidence wise) in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. I won't even respond to the discretion point too much. My opponent has completely went off the rails with it. Just read my previous round to see how I\"ve already addressed every single thing he says. Look this is a clear win for me. Do the right thing. Thanks voters.",

            "premise": "\"my opponent has been cherry picking my arguments\" I actually copied and pasted literally all your arguments, which you, very conveniently, listed. Here is the exact quote: \"Now, to restate my own points, introduce a new point and finally expand on my plan. So, my points were: 1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras.\" And here is how I copy these points and provide counters: \"So, to re-state my counters to your arguments. 1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. That being a good thing is merely your subjective opinion, not a fact. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. Again, your own, personal morals. Just because you, subjectively, believe it to be a good thing does not mean it actually is. Moral relativism. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. Which does not mean that it is right thing to do. As I stated earlier, argument on grounds that something is right simply because majority believes so, is illogical (ad populum). What is \"right\" can be decided by each culture, or individual himself.\" Thus, I took into account and replied to ALL points. No cherry picking took place. \"Firstly, he pointed out that this will be fair only based on the government.\" I did not. Here is exact quote. \" The thing is that whether or not government or society approves situation does not prove that situation was indeed fair.\" \"What you are arguing here, is essentially to force your cultures and majorities values unto those who disagree.\" It was acknowledged that government will have majorities support. \"The sane, they agree that murder is immoral, that stealing is immoral and that those who commit such crimes must be punished.\" Ad hominem. The sane agree with me. Implying that those with different moral standards are insane. Text-book ad hominem. \"Nobody is forcing \"fairness\" onto anyone.\" They are, on minority. On those few who disagree with their ideas of fairness. \"Not one group of people at all! The majority. The population. This is not a single group, but an extremely large portion of the populace.\" Which is still a group... thus my point stands. \" It it not at all subjective that murder ir wrong.\" FOR THE RECORD- I DO NOT SUPPORT MURDER. I BELIEVE IT TO BE WRONG. That being said, unlike my opponent, I realize that this belief of mine is merely a personal opinion. It will be pleasure for me to inform my opponent that up until this day, no set of morals have been proven to be objectively correct to any other set of morals. Thus, morals are subjective. deal with it. My opponent believes that his personal, as well as his cultures morals are objectively correct, which is the problem. On a side note, I am not arguing that society can't and shouldn't enforce their subjective understanding on others. Society must exist somehow, which means laws must be enforced. I fully support that. What I explained in first round, was that if one day society and government will come up with unacceptable morals, those who disagree with said morals will have no way to avoid unjust punishment. This is why, in my opinion, we should not give government (and majority) full control. There must be a back door for instance if society turns evil, so that you could escape. \"My opponent talked a lot about how many support genocide. Does HE support the extremination of a certain race? I hope not. Which once again supports my case.\" I do not, but this is my personal opinion. I realize that me NOT supporting genocide is merely my subjective opinion, not objective truth. \"1. Dwindle the amount of apartheid. This argument is about how objective footage will lower racial discrimination in the justice system.\" It will lead to a situation which is classified by majority as \"lower racial discrimination\". Whether or not their classification of what counts as \"lower racial discrimination\" is objectively correct, is unknown. \"2. Downtrend the amount of duress used. Simple enough, the refutation was irrelevant. This argument was how police officers will use less force.\" And while it might be that police officers will use less force, it is only assumed by my opponenet that using less force is a good thing. If person does not agree with this premise, then this argument holds no merit and does not lead to conclusion that police should wear body cameras. 3. The majority supports this. Not majority of government people. But of our citizens and even the officers. I realize that. It was acknowledged by me on several instances. 4. If we do the hard work to figure out how to maximize the accountability of the police and minimize the privacy risk, this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States. Not personal values. The prop has evidence. If you look at some of the previous speeches, there has been evidence to proove how it result in less discrimination and force used by the officers. Which will then ensure safety. People want safety. Safety is what is wanted by the majority of the public, making this argument applicable. You are drawing conclusion on what is beneficial for US citizens based on your own personal values. It is you who believes that less discrimination = beneficial for US citizens. If all your arguments are based on your personal values, then one has to simply reject your values and the conclusion (that police should wear body cameras) will not logically follow.",

            "premise": "Wow... I'm incredibly sorry about my initial sources. I had the same debate with someone else, but he bailed. The old debate was automatically deleted, so I started a new one. I copy and pasted my previous opening statement from that page, and apparently the links didn't copy properly. Here are my actual sources: http://www.afscmeinfocenter.org... (this is the Rialto study my opponent mentioned) http://www.latimes.com... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Getting on with my closing statement... Police body cameras are a step in the right direction for improving police practices. The evidence shows that police body cameras reduce the use of force and complaints levied against the police. Police body cameras would also be instrumental in protecting police officers against false allegations. In response to the point about victims and informants, my opponent has resorted to insults and anecdotal evidence (which hardly even relates to the point of traumatized victims anyway, as he was not such). Further, he has not supported his contention that cameras will offend traumatized victims with any evidence, just conjecture. My opponent seems to have a gut feeling that it is the case. Honestly, I can't see why a victim would be willing to talk with an LEO but be absolutely opposed to being on a body camera. This is what my opponent failed to prove. The footage would also be helpful in determining what exactly the victims initial responses were. What if they changed their story later on to help their case? My opponent is either failing to acknowledge or is downplaying the fact that discretion can be used poorly. LEOs have a lot of power. That power is meant to be held in check by their superiors. Just as you say discretion can be used to not enforce an unjust law, it can also be used in a corrupt or otherwise illegal manner. We should not give such massive amounts of power to LEOs and then refuse to supervise them and hold them accountable. Also, I will restate one of my previous points: the law enforcement hierarchy understands and respects the role of discretion. Your example of \"a kid dropping his candy wrapper on the ground should be fined $1000 for littering\" is, well, ridiculous. What police chief is going to look at that situation and demand swift justice? If he did, there would be riots.",

As my opponent stated, today\"s world criminal justice system is not at all filled with justice. What he is not considering is that this same claim applies to his own stance as well. He is arguing that wearing body cameras will provide objective footage, which, in turn, will allow society to judge on situation. The thing is that whether or not government or society approves situation does not prove that situation was indeed fair. Society have their own idea of what it means to be \"fair\". Their own core values and principles. Some people might not share those values and principles. Just because majority are majority does not logically lead to conclusion that their stance is automatically correct. Think about ancient rome, where slavery was legal. Or think about middle east, where killing homosexuals is legal. Or think about nazi germany, where gassing jews was legal. Just because something is considered \"legal' does not mean that it is right thing to do. With body cameras government will have absolute control over police force, meaning that governments own interpretation of \"right\" and \"justice\" will be forced upon people more effectively. I am against that. Even tho I do, generally speaking, agree with most (if not all) of the governments values, if one day I will not, I will have no way to stand up to the government. Everything will be recorded and people will be jailed based on governments own, egoistic interpretation of \"justice\". I believe that granting government ultimate control will lead to disaster, because if government is going to change, there is going to be nothing you can do to avoid their \"unjust\" (according to you) punishment.",

            "premise": "First off, many thanks for accepting this debate and being willing to play devil's advocate. Also, I'd like to apologize for the lack of formal rules and structure to this debate (I am new to the site and this is the first debate I posted); we'll have to freestyle this. Now then, addressing your points in order: --- \"Now we should make sure they are not betting people because of race\" I'm sorry, I don't entirely understand what you mean by this (I'm assuming that \"betting\" is a typo there). But I'm going to infer that you mean to bring up racial profiling here. I would actually counter that body cameras can serve to reduce racial profiling in that they can be used to show that officers had probable cause in their interactions with subjects (including minorities). It makes it more difficult, if not next to impossible, to fabricate evidence or charges. --- \"what if it slows them down when they are actually taking on a criminal? It could have fatal consequences.\" With respect, I don't see how it would. During a physical altercation it is certainly possible that a camera could be knocked off. It happens in this body camera footage for example: But officer safety takes precedence over protecting equipment so I don't see how wearing a body camera could put officers any more at risk. Keep in mind they already wear a lot of equipment on their person. Anecdotally, I was an LEO who wore a mic (but not a body camera) at all times on shift, I never once felt it posed an officer safety threat and I'm struggling to imagine how it could. I'm open to further argument on this point if you could elaborate. --- \"i do think that all city's could just install cameras in their car and if they break it they could amuse things.\" Again, I'm sorry but I don't understand the last half of this sentence. I will, however, address the first half: Dashcams are already standard in police cars but they have several disadvantages compared to body cameras. For example, they have a static position. Body cameras are dynamic and move along with the officer's POV. This is an instant process and they do not need to be adjusted. By contrast, with a dashcam at best you can orient it to face a specific area you believe will be most relevant to capture footage, but that both requires foresight to do (which is difficult in the heat of a high stress situation) and will not follow the officer and/or subject if they move out of the line of sight where the camera is oriented.",

So therefore, that leads to MORE spending, which decreases spending in more needed areas. Currently, there isn't a fund for body cameras. \"3. 2d cameras are still cameras, most investigations don't even have video to go off of. Once again, video can't lie.\" Interesting point. Body cameras cannot lie, but however, they degrade civic values, which adds on to the morality of my cameras, which are wrong. Camera speed differs from the speed of life, and your body may block the view of the cameras. 1 camera might not be enough. If someone robs a store, they won't just look at 1 camera. They will use multiple cameras. 1 camera, at one point of view, cannot replace 1 through investigation. Just because we saw a masked person kill another person, do we know who the masked person is? Of course not. We still have to do more analysis for the blood and fingerprints. \"4. Guessing game? Once again, the reason the cameras are there is so that the judge does not have to play the guessing game.\" The reason why these people have to play the guessing game is due to the fact that they have only 1 point of view. The officer has to then guess the conditions, and then assess a 1 sided pov, unlike the many witnesses with many pov. \"5. Witnesses can take the oath and still lie, what if they were threatened by the criminal themselves?\" The Witnesses have to tell the truth no matter what. The courts will protect them. I have shown all the bad things about the body cameras and added in my values, which my opponent has failed to provide. The cost is just to expensive, and cameras can't replace an entire investigation. So with these reasons and many more, you should deposit a ballot in the Con side today. ~TheResistance",

            "conclusion": "Law enforcement (in America) should be required to use body cameras during civilian interaction",
            "premise": "Sources My opponent has listed 3 links that merely go to the front page of 3 news sites. These sources do not verify the existence of 3 different studies done on police body cams. He should be deducted source points for providing fake links, and punished accordingly. He should probably also be deducted conduct points, because I\"m only aware of one major study done on police body cams. I assume he lied about the number of studies found. Use of Force and Civilian Complaints I\"m going to go ahead and concede these points, because they don\"t matter. They are also a waste of time, though I could easily shed serious doubt on them. The debate is not whether police body cams are useful, or should be required. The debate is whether police should wear them in every civilian interaction. You can support body cam usage and still be opposed to them recording every interaction. Now I support officers turning them on during traffic stops, or during calls into tense situations, but when dealing with a rape victim or an Informant (for example), the officer should be allowed to turn them off. What reason is there to record an informant telling the officer about some drug dealers on the corner, openly selling? It has the down side of preventing informants from speaking, while carrying absolutely no upside. Responses \"In the example of the 7 y/o boy, special procedures are in place to protect and respect victims. In that situation, it seems highly unlikely that serious questioning would occur directly after the event. The first responders will not be trying to extract information.\" This is just stupid. This is not Law and Order SVU. Often times detectives don\"t even talk to victims. I was personally in a situation, where I killed an escaping robber. His friends actually ran off and let him to die. I was never once talked to by a detective, and was later issued a subpoena for court, never talking to a detective at all. The only people I talked to were first responders. This is how the real world works. Most victims of crimes, only talk to first responders. The witness statement they write up should be enough. They shouldn\"t have to have a camera in their face, during the worst time of their life. Beyond that, you have yet to state a reason why victims or informants should be forced to be recorded. My opponent most likely attempted to link to 3 articles on the same Rialto California police body cam study. What my opponent doesn\"t realize, is that even during these studies, the body cams weren\"t rolling during every civilian encounter. There is no police department in the United States that requires that. According to Police One who reported on the study, and on whose article a link to the study can be found; \"For 12 months, Rialto\"s 54 frontline officers all were assigned randomly to wear or not wear TASER HD Axon Flex video/audio cameras attached to their clothing during each of their 12-hr. shifts. On shifts when they wore cameras, \"the officers were instructed to have them on during every encounter with members of the public, with the exception of incidents involving sexual assaults of minors and dealing with police informants,\" the study team explains.\" https://www.policeone.com... So even the studies my opponent are linking to, don\"t show the results of every police interaction with civilians. No such study has been done, nor will it be done. \"In regard to police officers and discretion; the hierarchy of law enforcement agencies understand the massive role that discretion plays. There is good discretion and bad discretion. The hierarchies need to evaluate LEOs on their use of discretion. Body cameras can be invaluable to preventing bad discretion.\" The whole point of personal discretion that nobody is in the officers shoes and can judge that better than him. If an officer has somebody sitting over his shoulder judging every discretion as either good or bad, and punishing or criticizing him for what is viewed as bad discretion, well that takes away the discretion altogether. Now there are certain laws that are known as \"must arrest\" laws, and officers are required to arrest for those laws or risk termination, but that is not what we are talking about. We\"re talking about the discretion of whether or not a jay walker is ticketed, or whether a kid dropping his candy wrapper on the ground should be fined $1000 for littering. The officer needs the discretion of whether or not to lock up somebody for public intoxication or not. Without this discretion, this country will turn into one where anybody can be arrested or fined for just about anything. Most legal experts believe that the average citizen commits 3 felonies a day. http://www.wsj.com... You certainly can\"t tell an officer he can\"t use his discretion to fine or arrest somebody who broke a law, so now with the second guessing for free passes, you incentivize officers never using their discretion to give somebody a free pass. With the fact that every single one of us breaks the law, every single day. This becomes a very dangerous thing to incentivize. Conclusion My opponent has not disputed my claim that leaks of footage can and do happen, embarrassing people unnecessarily. This is a point in my favor. He is acknowledging that people will be seen in their most private moments, when they should not have been. My opponent brings up some good reasons to have body cams, and I agree with them. However he has failed to show why they should be used in every single civilian encounter. The Rialto study showed that using the cameras in most civilian interactions as opposed to all of them, got the desired results my opponent is asking for. If the Rialto study was so successful at getting the desired results without shoving a camera in a child victim\"s face or without compromising confidential informants, why don\"t we replicate that study in real life?",

            "premise": "Round Structure: First round - opening arguments Second round - counter arguments Third round - closing statements This is a semi-formal debate. You will be expected to use evidence and logic to prove your position. Please use acceptable grammar, good structure, and easily identifiable sources (I personally prefer URLs). You will only have 24 hours to make each argument. Clarification of terms: American law enforcement - while it may be of benefit to other nations as well, this debate is only concerned with the current wide spread discussion of this new policy in the United States. A law enforcement officer (which is common abbreviated to LEO) is any public sector employee concerned with enforcing laws. This includes city police officers, county sheriff deputies, state/highway patrol officers, border patrol officers, federal marshals, etc. Body camera - any sort of recording device carried by LEOs. While this specifically means a camera mounted on the officers body, it will also include head mounted cameras for the sake of this debate. We will not be concerned with vehicle cameras. Civilian interaction - This includes traffic stops, initial investigation/questioning, crowd control, or any other instance where LEOs respond to a call or intervene in a situation. We will not be including interactions within police facilities, where it is expect that most areas are already under surveillance. Today, there has been a resounding call to reform police practices. This is the result mostly of the various instances of alleged racially provoked shootings at the hands of police. Many cases result in disappointing verdicts, based on a lack of evidence. A prime example was the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted on the basis of a lack of evidence. Because there was no video evidence, it was difficult for the courts to paint a clear picture of what occurred that night. Even though the shooting was highly suspicious, it would have been near impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Wilson wasn't engaging in legitimate self defense. Due to the accessibility of recording equipment in this day and age (thanks to smart phones), some cases have experienced the opposite effect. When Walter Scott was shot in North Charleston, SC by officer Michael Slager, video evidence led to a swift indictment. The question remains why do we not utilize this new technology in full effect. My contentions Protection of the rights of civilians: Simply put, surveilling the actions officers take with civilians holds them to a high standard of professionalism. If an officer knows they are being recorded, they realize they will also be scrutinized for their actions. Many studies have noted the positive effect cameras have on use-of-force trends (I will list three separate studies). All three studies noted a drastic decrease in instances of use-of-force and complaints filed. http://www.afscmeinfocenter.org...... http://www.latimes.com...... http://www.huffingtonpost.com...... Protection of the rights of officers: Police officers are also concerned about faulty complaints and false assumptions about events. Anyone can file a police report, be it justified or not. Police body cameras would provide clarity to the circumstance surrounding the report. Video evidence does not lie: More evidence is better evidence. One common court room dispute is whether or not a detainee was read their Miranda rights before being questioned. According to the supreme court, any evidence obtained through an interrogation of someone who has not been Mirandized is inadmissible in court. Whenever there is a dispute over whether or not the defendant was read the Miranda warning, it often comes do to the officer's word versus their's. With body cameras, it will be easy to show video evidence of an officer reciting the warning or not. This is just one example.",

Governments? Societies? Punishment will be fair only according to their interpretation of \"fair\", which can be unfair according to person being punished. It is you who completely missed my point, which was that concept of \"fairness\" is subjective, meaning different people can have different understanding of \"fair\". Body cameras will allow one group of people to force their own subjective ideas of \"fairness\" unto other people. That was my point. \"The main difference is that the genocide was NOT made to HELP the public.\" Which is, again, your subjective opinion. Each person can have his own subjective opinion regarding what helps public. Just because you believe that genocide does not help public, does not mean that Hitler or average Nazi had same belief. Again, relativity and subjectivity. \"It was a very obvious detriment.\" Again, personal opinion. Someone who believes Jews to be cancer of this world would have different opinion. \"That is why brave soldiers from the US, Russia, France, England, etc have fought and risked their lives in order to end the terror.\" My point exactly. Not all people share same morals. Some believe right/fair thing to be X, others believe Y.This is exactly why those soldiers fought- because they did not share same morals, values and understanding of \"rightness\" as nazis did. So, to re-state my counters to your arguments. 1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. That being a good thing is merely your subjective opinion, not a fact. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. Again, your own, personal morals. Just because you, subjectively, believe it to be a good thing does not mean it actually is. Moral relativism. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. Which does not mean that it is right thing to do. As I stated earlier, argument on grounds that something is right simply because majority believes so, is illogical (ad populum). What is \"right\" can be decided by each culture, or individual himself. Now to your next arguments. \"this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States\" Again, your personal opinion. You base this claim upon your own, personal values, which are just that- YOUR values. Dont try to pull them off as anything more than mere opinion. \"The opposition case in this debate will mostly be pointing out the ineffectiveness of these cameras\" No, I will not. I will point out that you are making claims in accordance to your own values and morals, which are subjective. Things which you and your society believe to be \"right\", \"moral\" and \"fair\" can be considered \"wrong\" \"immoral\" and \"wrong\" by someone else, and you really have no evidence to prove your set of morals to be objectively superior. What you are arguing here, is essentially to force your cultures and majorities values unto those who disagree.",

Your opinion on my value is not considered.\" Currently, you have provided absolutely NO value(which I did of morality), and NO value criterion(which mine was enforcement), which you might have a value, but until then, you do not have one unless stated. By default, since I have a value and value criterion and she has not stated hers since, mine are the standing values. \"You're also wrong about the cameras having to be in 3D. First of all, you invalidate your own argument about the cameras costing too much. Equipping the officers with 3D cameras would cost even more! Also, the investigation does not need 3D cameras, a regular video is just fine. Most investigations aren't lucky enough to get a video at all! 2D video can still help everyone make a fair judgement.\" 1. I never said that all cameras needed to be in 3D. I only said that cameras only had a 2D perspective. I never implied that we needed 3D, which implies the STRAW MAN! 2. Ok. Let's look at a police officer employment. Let's look at my local city. If a local city has, let's say, 500 police officers, and you are saying that they should all have body cameras, then look at the cost provided. 500*350=$175000 dollars! This is a lot of money! Money does not grow on trees, as this will increase debt in the country and decrease spending in many needed areas. 3. 2D movies cannot make a fair judgement. Cameras cannot perceive the 3rd dimension that is perceived by the human eye-which is distance. Cameras can't record danger cues because you can usually tell when you touch a subject whether he/she will have an objection, but cameras lack the sensory cue, which makes it lacking the important thing:the danger cue. 4. Cameras will always make us play the guessing game, and the speed is very difference. Cameras record at MUCH higher speed, and the camera will make us play the coulda-shoulda game, because it is not what someone perceived. It is a nonliving thing, and we can scrutinize it for detail, but that is only 1 sided-by the officer. Witnesses are far many more and they will be multi sided. \"By the way, everyone lies. By saying that witnesses do not lie, you are saying that people don't lie.\" 1. I never said that people don't lie. 2. It states in the witness oath, \"I swear that the evidence that I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God. Affirmation: I solemnly affirm that the evidence that I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" This is the basis I am stating. Many witnesses can be provided, so we can get multiple things from the whole truth. How can they lie if they swear before the oath? My opponent thinks I am strawmanning. However, I am not. The fact that you did not break down my 1st and 2nd contentions make the fact that they are valid, and that you don't have any say to it. Secondly, my opponent did not state her value. This is what I stated. I never said her case had no value whatsoever. Thirdly, everything she said was copied directly and in quoted. Then, I broke down on the thoughts I had to counter. With this, she did not answer my basic status quo of my argument:the morality of cameras. I have proven with many reasons and examples why my contentions stand. I have a direct value of morality, which has been PROVEN with the 3 contentions. In fact, she is strawmanning with many examples. (ie.with her saying that the cameras have to be 3D). I never said that. I said that cameras can only see in 2D, and witnesses are more reliable because they see it in 3D. Then, she stated I said that people don't lie. I never stated that or implied that. I only implied that in the jury oath, when the people are stating their evidence, they can't lie. So with these reasons and many more, it has been obvious to vote for Con today. ~TheResistance",

            "conclusion": "Law enforcement (in America) should be required to use body cameras during civilian interaction",
            "premise": "Framework The resolution says police should us body cams in civilian interactions. The wording of which and the lack of mentioning any exceptions to the rule of requiring body cams in civilian interactions, implies that they should be used in all civilian interactions. This is how the resolution is written, and should be interpreted. Privacy Concerns There are some definite privacy concerns with body cams. Police don\"t only deal with suspects of crimes, and traffic infractions on a daily basis. Officers also talk with witnesses and informants. They talk to rape victims. They also are sometimes the first to arrive at car crashes and interact with the victims of horrible tragedies. The main concern is that all the footage would be public property and therefore public can get access to it through the freedom of information act, but even if laws were made to protect the privacy of people, leaks still happen and the civilians still know the film is being made which has an effect on their psychology. You can easily go to youtube and already view dash cam footage of a lot of people in the worst moments of their lives, we don\"t need to make this problem worse. Informants, many of which are in the criminal underworld will be less inclined to provide evidence needed to capture and prosecute dangerous criminals. Scared and shaken witnesses will also be more scared to and less inclined to give information. An officer talking to a 7 year old who just watched his mother raped and murdered, does not need to have a camera in his face bearing witness to and forever immortalizing the greatest tragedy he will ever face. Even when filming the arrest of somebody perhaps a batterer, the officer is often going into a private residence and there is all kinds of private information lying around, and no way should a victim of domestic violence have her private life exposed to whatever prying eye makes a FOA request, or youtubes the video, because some cop thought the interaction was funny enough to upload on the internet. Bureaucracy concerns Just like any other occupation, and especially with government agencies there can be a lot of bureaucracy. There is a lot of concern that having police cams on too much can make the jobs of officers harder, it can also make it harder on good cops. Right now an officer has a lot of discretion. If he sees an old lady in a dangerous neighborhood with an unregistered gun, he can turn a blind eye but with the cameras, he may be forced to prosecute every single tiny infraction. If you think broken windows policing is bad now, just wait until the police can no longer let little things go. The cameras can be used for his bosses to nitpick about every tiny thing he does, from improper uniform, to some off the cuff remarks to fellow officers. Everybody needs to blow off steam on occasion, and especially so in a high stress jobs like policing. Conclusion I know everyone thinks these body cams will be used to keep an out of control government in check, but in reality, just like every other tool. It will be used against citizens. Anyone can watch Tru TV and see \"Top 20 Drunks\" shows, shaming people seen in dash cam videos or videos in a police room, we don\"t need to embarrass random people by allowing these shows more material. We don\"t need to handcuff good cops, by forcing them to lose their discretionary privileges. If unjust laws are made, we\"re somewhat protected by the fact that cops can use their discretion to stop enforcing stupid laws, with body cams you can forget that. Vote Wylted",

            "premise": "Today, my opponent did not answer the clear contention 1, which is morality of the cameras. This proves my 1st contention that it does invade privacy, and since my opponent did not answer, she agrees with the point. Also, she did not even touch on my 2nd contention that body cameras cost too much, which pads on to her agreement with my point. There are 2 points she agrees with the con, because she did not touch on. Let's look at her case. Value: She has no value what so ever, which adds on. Contention 1: \"Body cameras can help an investigation\" As said by my con contention 3, cameras can only see 2-D. As my contention 3 states, \"Yes, it might replace many witnesses, but witnesses are more reliable. Witnesses can see 3-D, a camera can only see 2-D. A camera can not provide sole truth for the event because we still need a fair, through investigation. A recording shows 2-D, which only shows around. What we do no know is what really happened because we still need second guessing, and it will take much longer. It also gives a lot of the playing of the should've-couldn't game and a lot of guessing, instead of real testimonies.\" As seen, we will have to play a lot of guessing games, as it can only see 2D. We cannot see the background or the situation the person was in and why they reacted that way. Witnesses are emotional, unlike cameras, and can see 3-D, which can then see more things, and prevent people from playing the guessing game. Also, a camera cannot always replace a full investigation, which my opponent refused to answer. Let's look at her next contention:\"it helps to keep innocent people out of jail. No more people will be wrongfully jailed, because direct evidence does not lie.\" Interesting. Witnesses do not lie, because they will have to swear they will tell the truth before their testimony. So with these reasons, my opponent does not have a value, while I have provided the true value of morality,and my value criterion is enforcement(i forgot to add), which she has not provided, has failed to answer to 2 of my contention, which suggests she agrees with them. She hasn't really proven any what so reason why cameras can see more clearly or why witnesses are inferior to cameras. So by what's obvious today, vote Con! `TheResistance",

First of all, you invalidate your own argument about the cameras costing too much. Equipping the officers with 3D cameras would cost even more! Also, the investigation does not need 3D cameras, a regular video is just fine. Most investigations aren't lucky enough to get a video at all! 2D video can still help everyone make a fair judgement. By the way, everyone lies. By saying that witnesses do not lie, you are saying that people don't lie. Also, I don't agree with you on cost at all. It's worth preventing false witness statements, wrongful jailing, and it helps the investigation tremendously because again, you cannot argue with the facts! My opponent verges on strawmanning.

            "premise": "I would like to accept this debate and since my opponent has made his opening arguments, I will as well. My opponent makes the claim that we need security cameras installed in school to catch illegal acts and that since there are security camera's in malls and movie theater's they should also be in schools. He goes on to claim they can prevent illegal activity, prevent bullying, and even school shootings. My rebuttal's 1. Security camera's are expensive to buy, install and maintain. The cost of a good security camera can cost up to hundred's of dollars and it also would cost another large sum to install and run them .[1] In a time when schools across the country are having budget cuts, good security cameras costing up to 1000 dollars each would be a huge financial burden on the school which would more than likely result in the lay-offs of employee's, academic classes being dropped, extracurricular activities such as band and athletics being eliminated, etc. Simply to buy security camera's. 2. Security camera's would be useless. My opponent also claims that security camera's could stop school shootings as well. In order for camera's to prevent a school shooting, the school's we all need to hire armed security guards to constantly monitor the camera's and act in such an event. School shootings are also highly unlikely as only a handful occur in the U.S. every year which normally result in either no casualties or mere injuries and many time are perpetrated by adults who simply walk onto campus, a situation where cameras will have no effect.[2] A better way to prevent school shootings would be to allow teachers to have permits to carry their weapons at home on campus. This would not cost any money at all as the teachers would simply bring weapons from home. This would turn a significant amount of teachers into persons with the ability to put down an armed intruder or student faster than a single guard watching the screens of dozens of live security camera's. Many schools in the U.S. are already following this method as well as countries such as Israel and Thailand [3] Most if not all illegal activity on school campuses, do not occur out in the open such as in the quad, in the gym, etc. They occur in the bathrooms, the locker rooms, etc. The sale or use of illegal drugs, weapons, etc occur in those private areas. In order to make security cameras somewhat worthwhile, we would need to install security cameras in those areas. The girl's locker room, the boy's bathroom stalls, etc would need cameras. It would be extremely inappropriate and a major violation of personal privacy if the students were forced to appear naked, half dressed, and using the restrooms to school personnel. Young females and males should not be forced to appear nude, half dressed, etc to school officials. It is a violation of personal privacy and is extremely demeaning and stressful to students, who will now know that their math or science teacher has seen how large their breasts are, or who will now know how small their penis is, or how fat they are, or how skinny they are, etc. For these reasons security cameras are extremely costly, and in order to avoid the violation of the personal and intimate privacy of students, cannot be placed in the areas where illegal activity can occur the most.

            "premise": "Police abusing power by planting a weapon is simple enough that if you are hearing about it much at all it is probably happening pretty often without being detected. Though in this case a camera would be a good idea, it would also be quite costly. Considering you said -which is not all that surprising seeing how poor our economy is-, this might simply not be a feasible solution for your country. Of course situations do and will happen that could put police at risk, and a solution for that is not so easy. If the economy improves, body cameras would be a good idea. A temporary solution I could see working is, instead of outright allowing officers to kill on sight, if they or someone else provides a video of the advent which shows the officer is at risk and kills they would be pardoned on the spot. Also, in the advent that deadly force need not be necessary, for instance a suspect running at the officer with a knife, carrying a strong police grade pepper spray may be a better choice. Now none of this would solve all your countries problems overnight, but could still be a good start. I have my own strong opinions on how drugs should be handled so I will give my ideas for that. First of all, drug addicts should not be punished. Drug addiction is a mental illness that is very hard for someone to kick, I have watched my own sister fight drug addiction and seen firsthand how hard it is. Often the very act of starting isn't a direct choice for addicts at all, but rather started due to other mental illnesses. My sister started drugs while bipolar, severely depressed and suicidal, with severe ADHD. Not to say at all nothing should be done, but that is the wrong target. Drug addicts should have mandatory treatment if caught with drugs, and that is a much more lasting solution. The real target should be the drug dealers, and they should get a punishment fitting of someone who lives off of ruining people\u2019s lives. For each proven sale they should be charged with assault, and any proven overdoses murder. For lasting change more than just hard drugs should be targeted, but also tobacco and alcohol, as for most addicts that is what they start with.",

I feel that instead of having a camera watch us, we should have traffic police or Suffolk police watching the intersections just the way they used to. I find it to be annoying to have to now think about whether a camera is going to snap a picture at you, obeying the law, but being under a yellow light through an intersection. While it might make some people more cautious, safer drivers, I think that too many people are retarding traffic because they are fearful of getting a ticket. I feel that the money that they are spending to put all of the traffic lights in is almost a waste of time. By the time the government hires people to put them in, pays for the camera and the electric to run the thousands of cameras, hires people to monitor and scan through all of the pictures, and sends out tickets, it is barely worth it to even have. I think that the cameras have become a hazard to the everyday drivers and the government is taking advantage of our privacy, in a way. What next? We have cameras at every corner now, who's to say they won't start bugging our hotel rooms like NK!!",

            "conclusion": "Speed cameras only detect 5% of all road accidents",
            "premise": "Speed cameras are placed in locations where there is a significant accident record. Introduction usually leads to lower vehicle speeds and a better accident record. Speed cameras also act as a deterrent to dangerous driving and have successfully contributed to lowering average vehicle speeds on the UK roads hence lowering the accident risk. Road Casualties Great Britain 2006, found that injudicious action, which includes going too fast for conditions, following too close and exceeding the speed limit, accounts for 34% of fatal cameras highlighting that problems still exist with speed management. The 5% figure should be treated with caution as on average the police recorded two factors for each crash. With regards to speed limits, the DfT has always emphasised that they are legal guide that should be adhered to but that driver judgement should also be utilised as well. Speed cameras successfully lower vehicle speeds and have drawn attention to the need to drive at appropriate speeds within the designated speed limit. Camera policing of speed limits can only be introduced after all else has failed. In some cases, on roads identified by projects such as the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP) there is evidence that the collisions are not speed related and therefore new cameras would not be installed and other measures used. Cameras are only installed at sites where at least 20% of drivers exceed the speed limit and there have been four deaths or serious injuries on a given 1km stretch of road within three years. Research (Stradling et al, 2003) has also shown that drivers stopped by police for speeding or who had been flashed by a speed camera had double the incidence of recent crash involvement suggesting that speed cameras have been successful in targeting dangerous drivers. http://www.pacts.org.uk",

A camera is essentially a silent police officer: would you walk up to a police officer and ask him to stop watching you walking down the street? It would be very suspicious to make that request. Freedom: \"The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants\" [1] Being watched does not harm your freedom. You can still act how you want to act. The only place where cameras will not be is in private property, but the beauty of having cameras everywhere else is that you can see who is going in and out of a house. If someone was murdered inside a house, you can watch who leaves the house and then follow their movements to find out where they go. Most crimes will be solved by observing their travels. If the power goes out, we are back where we started: no CCTV. This isn't a problem because it is no different from the situation we have right now. [1] - http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...",

            "premise": "Cost \"Do you think all security cameras cost $1000?\"No, I very clearly stated in the first round that they cost from 250 to 1000 dollars depending on quality.\"Oh yeah, every school need giant 3D boards to watch movies.\"You've offered no evidence whatsoever that they are attempting to have 3D boards in every school to watch movies. Your entire case built against smart boards rests on your own personal assertions and nothing more.You have failed to find sources showing that schools are using them for ridiculous reasons such as for spanish classes or watching movies.You have failed to find sources showing that they aren't effective learning devices.Therefore your case against smartboards has crumbled.You have also made little attempt to mask the fact that you are asking schools to spend thousands of dollars to buy expensive and unnecessary security cameras.Security (Armed situations)I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but over 1 million americans have a job in the U.S. armed forces. These employees have assault rifles, fighter jets, tanks, etc all at their place of work. How many of them have gone on homicidal rampages? You can probably only name the Fort Hood Shooting.The fact of the matter is that millions of Americans own guns, are responsible gun owners, and don't start going Rambo on children when they get mad. For this fact you have no reason to stand on the argument that you fear a teacher is going to go on a rampage.I want gun owning teachers to bring their firearms to school for defending the children if need be.Just as I want military personel to use their firearms for defense if need be.To make the argument that we should disarm responsible gun owning teachers who have the purpose of defending their students is as ridiculous as making the argument we should disarm the military who have the purpose of defending U.S. soild as well as U.S. interests abroad.Should we also disarm police officers as well? Think about, police officers carrying guns walk around in public with a pistol in their holster easy for anyone to grab.Just as teachers walk around campus carrying guns in public.Your argument is just as ludicrous. For your reasons against arming teachers, a notion that has become a reality in many U.S. and Israeli schools already, we should disarm the U.S. military as well as Law enforcement.I very clearly stated that teachers who have guns at home should be allowed to bring them. People don't go out buying revolvers to keep where they live if they don't know how to use them. \"In conclusion, my opponent thinks guns can solve all our problems.\"Oh I'm sorry, I must have missed were you explained how security cameras, PHYSICALLY STOPPED GUN WIELDING MANIACS!!!This is a scenario you brought up.You specifically said that we need security cameras to prevent school shootings like Virginia Tech.You make the claim that we need cameras to prevent school shootings, and yet you give no explanation how they will actually stop a school shooting. You know how school shootings end? They end when either the police or the the shooter themself, blows out the brains of the shooter. Either way, guns end school school shootings, not cameras.Security (misc)I was against the idea of spending money hiring security personel, but janitors have the job of keeping school grounds sanitary and administrative personel have the job of running schools.You have yet to prove that they have time to watch security cameras all day while they are already doing the jobs they are paid to do.Your claim that \"The people at the front office could watch the cameras because they're not doing anything half the time!\", is without basis and again, merely assertion.BullyingI'm not asking for children to fight with others that are twice as large. I'm asking them to report misconduct and misbehavior from fellow classmates to administrative personel.It would save schools thousands of dollars and possibly the jobs of other school employees. That is not an unreasonable request.I never said they were wimps, you are putting words in my mouth, I said that it did not make sense that taxpayers should be forced to spend thousands of dollars on cameras when kids being bullied aren't willing to report the bullying.Privacy\"Who said they have to be put in bathrooms\"Anyone with common sence knows that when people conduct illegal activity, they conduct it in privacy.Students don't sell drugs in the principles office, not out on the quad during passing period, etc.Students use and sell drugs in bathrooms were it is private. In order to catch a decent amount of illegal activity, cameras need to be placed in bathrooms, which is a violation of personal privacy.Therefore cameras cannot catch illegal activity.ConclusionMy opponents claims regarding the futility of Smartboards are mere assertions.My opponents claims regarding the laziness of school employees are mere assertionsMy opponent says that cameras won't be placed in school bathrooms, the areas were nearly all illegal activity on school occurs.My opponent thinks it is reasonable to have the taxpayer shell out millions nation wide for security cameras to stop bullying, when children should be reporting it themselves to the school.My opponent has not given any explaination as to how security cameras will stop school shootings while she opposes the presence of firearms on campus. Which, by the way, is becoming a method of preventing school shootings in my already stateded sources.All in all my opponent has not shown that security cameras can catch illegal activity when she doesn't want them planted in the areas where illegal activy occurs, that security camears do a damn thing to prevent school shootings other than simply record the massacre, that security cameras are not a violation of personal privacy and that security camera's are worth the cost when they don't prevent illegal activity and when you need to hire additional personel to monitor them.Vote Con",

            "premise": "Do you think all security cameras cost $1000? Only the most expensive and the ones used by people like the navy or army. The perfectly good security camera I found was way less than $1000. You don't just put the most expensive camera price down to make all cameras look expensive. A smart board also has a projector that you can purchase for less than $1000. Now their coming up with 3D ones. Oh yeah, every school need giant 3D boards to watch movies. Besides, do you really think teachers should bring guns to school? What if one day a teacher got fired and he or she went on a rampage? That makes no difference than having or not having security cameras there. But what happens if some crazy kid stole their teacher's gun? Also a camera RECORDS stuff. They don't just capture something important and forget about it. You think half the teachers know how to shoot a gun? Or do you suppose we train them like the seals?Why not just a janitor to view it or something? A security guard has one set of eyes. Multiple cameras means multiple views. Do you really think one security guard can watch over 300 kids. If we hired more, then we might spend more money on the guards than the cameras. We don't need a security guard or officer to babysit kids. The people at the front office could watch the cameras because they're not doing anything half the time! There are only a handful of kids that have the strength to stand up for themselves. Do you think the football jock gets slammed into lockers everyday? The kids that are picked on the most are the shy ones. Who said they have to be put in bathrooms? If people are so uncomfortable about their bodies that they won't even go to the airport, then it's time for some counseling. Plus, of course smart boards are expensive. Have you ever seen one? However, if you don't believe me, then Google a smart board that's good, and under $3000 with a projector. In conclusion, my opponent thinks guns can solve all our problems. He thinks kids that don't stand up for themselves are wimps. He also thinks that people are going to put cameras in private places and frame the teachers as creepers.

The end result would be a world where everything is recorded on camera except for events that take place within private property and homes. The benefits of this would outweigh any consequences for one pivotal reason: Any crime that takes place in public will likely be solved. The suspect has nowhere to run; the police can trace the suspect's movements right back to his home address, where they can visit and subsequently arrest him. Kidnappers, murderers, rapists -- everyone will be caught and brought to justice. You will be CON; you will argue that CCTV cameras should not be in every public location.",

            "premise": "There has been much debate as to whether public surveillance or the existence of cameras in public places is an invasion of privacy. A few have made reference to the fourth amendment and its protection against unreasonable searches as a key element to discourage such practice. Nevertheless a tsunami of public cameras has flooded out neighborhoods, primarily used as a means of enhanced security especially in areas where police officers are not able to be present. In a recent article posted on cbsnews.com titled \"Surveillance cameras and the right to privacy\", law enforcement officials assert that an increase in high-tech tools such as cameras was a big reason why violent crimes nationwide decreased in 2010. Citizens should demand their rights to privacy! This is a claim that, like me, many others concur. However should we sacrifice our need for safety and security simply to avoid being featured on public camera casually walking down the block?",

In a two-year pilot study of cameras in six counties, there were 280 fewer people killed or seriously injured at camera sites than would otherwise be expected. This means that the total cost saving of casualties at camera sites over two years was around \u00a358m. This figure is several times higher than both the amount spent on camera enforcement (\u00a321 million) and the amount raised in fixed penalty income (\u00a327 million). When the reduction in casualties across the pilot area (4% reduction in KSI) is taken into account, it is estimated that the total benefit to society over two years is approximately \u00a3112 million. A previous Home Office Police Research Group cost benefit analysis of speed cameras found that cameras generate a return of five times the investment after one year and 25 times the amount after five years. http://www.pacts.org.uk",

            "conclusion": "There Should Be More Security in Schools",
            "premise": "I Believe that schools should have better security for the sake of the students and staff inside. Better security would lead to less shootings, bullying, and Sexual Harassment. Better security would lead to better health and safety of students as well as staff. To begin with, better security in schools would lead to less mass shootings relating to students inside of a school campus. According to The Washington Post, the have been over 300 school shootings (meaning a gun was discharged on a school campus) since 2013. That means at least 1 a week. This number would be reduced dramatically if school security was a big priority. Students go to school to learn and should not have to burden the stress of academics, and the stress of a possible shooting, or dangerous incident. The numbers of shootings would be reduced dramatically by adding metal detectors, police officers, and locker checks around the school. With more security, bullying would be noticed more easily than without. In many schools, bullying has a zero tolerance policy, but oftentimes this is overlooked. Often the student has no way to stand up for him/her self, and may find it difficult to find someone they trust to speak with. With cameras, and officers around the building, bullys would be caught easily, and would immediately face consequences. Sexual harassment is a huge problem in schools that can be illegal, and needs to be responded to by higher authority. With cameras and officers, the amount of sexual harassment in schools would be lowered, and consequences would be established. 8 out of 10 students will experience sexual harassment from peers or teachers, and 6 out of 10 will experience physical sexual harassment from another peer or student. This is in all grade levels, and could be at least lowered if there were more cameras in schools. Some may say that using money on security is a waste, and that crime will happen either way regardless of the set security. Although not all crime can immediately be stopped it can be reduced to a much smaller number with even a small amount of extra security. Someone trying to commit a crime in a police station with armed officers will have a harder time trying to commit a crime in a school bus where there are no present armed officers. Schools should have better security whether it be cameras, officers, door checks, locker checks, or even just locked doors. If a crime happens that could have been stopped, but wasn't, it is inexcusable for the school to have no security.",

Studies have found that much more money is saved for the state and society through prevented casualties than is gained in penalties or spent on the cameras. The public can be educated to appreciate this benefit, especially as systems which apply penalty points for speeding offences instead of or as well as fines are clearly not solely motivated by greed.",

And it makes others more of knuckleheads than they already were. The part where I disagree is the use of our police officers and adding other employees to monitor the cameras. For one, I think it is better to have real cops out taking care of other things, rather than having them sit near stop lights. Let them do other law enforcement duties that are more important than traffic duty. Suffolk cops make huge salaries and I would rather they were out to better use. And if a few more jobs are created by the camera venture, then I am cool with that. We need jobs! And the government needs money, so let them raise some funds by snagging a few redlight runners!

            "premise": "I'll start off with my case, then my opponents case. And yes, I agree that this debate is specifically about the United States. On my number 1. What I am arguing is that public area are free of watch, and have less strict rules. Adding the cameras takes away this idea. On my number 2. I never said you have to provide a plan, all I am saying is that your plan will be too expensive. Also, in debate, you are supposed to persuade the judge or audience to vote for you, by stating why your world would be better than mine. And by not saying how much this will cost, or HOW it will be done, the judge can't know what will happen in your world. Also, guards cost less than cameras(Ill further explain in my number 4) On my number 3. First of all, don't listen to his argument of no counterplans. I am saying why surveillance cameras should not be substantially increased(Cost, and efficiency) And giving an alternative.(Linking back to my number 2) I am giving why cameras should NOT be substantially increased, and why guards should be, so disreguard this argument. Next, The cameras can show where they are. Thats it. They don't physically stop them. What if the viewing area for cameras is on the 3rd floor of a building, and the criminal is getting away THAT SECOND. Immediate action is needed! So in this case, guards do that. On my number 4. So lets continue this cost argument. For a Target that has, lets say, 2 cameras, you're going to need about 10 cameras, one for each corner, one near door, one near electronics, and others spread throughout. So if I agree that they cost around 2 thousand dollars(I do) Thats 2 thousand times 10, which is 20,000. Compare that to my 4760. Its a huge difference. My plan is more cost efficient. Also, cameras don't always keep criminals off. If they did, there would be no crime in places with cameras. Period. Which isn't true. In my area, there are flashing blue lights(Police cameras) around many corners, and are crimes committed? Yes. Guards would be more efficient. Also, his argument about no counterplans is abusive. He provides a plan/idea, and I counter it with disadvantages, and another plan/idea. Without my say in the debate, its not a debate, and not fair. I said why Surveillance cams should NOT be substantially increased, and what to do instead. This is fair. Now, to my opponents case. 1) You don't accomplish complete saftey. What trustworthiness do you get from a guard on the third floor, running after someone on a skateboard? And fine, for this part of the argument, I'll specifically talk about why cameras shouldn't be added, and don't help. 2)To keep security guards out, extend my number 2 and 3, stating that cameras are expensive, and don't stop the criminal. 3)His definition of substantial is right, but not appropriate for this debate Substantial-to a great extent or degree A set number of cameras isn't needed. All I am saying is explain why the number of cameras now isn't working, how to fix it, and how it will impact the company/place in a positive way. This is a Should resolution, yes. And with that, these answers are needed WHY should this happen? HOW is this going to help? HOW is this the BEST solution(Most important) The argument of why it is best will be key in this debate. If my opponent says that all computers should be white, I want to know why this needs to happen, why he wants this, and how white is better than black. Because of my definitions, my counterplan, and those questions(If not answered) I encourage a Negative Ballot. Thank you for a great debate so far!",

The fact of the matter is is that people still run red lights regardless of whether there is a red light camera or not. Pro cannot disprove my statement of the 5th amendment and how red light camera's are unconstitutional. http://activerain.com... The link above talks about the red light cameras in Chicago. If you come to a rolling stop into the intersection and go over the crosswalk most cameras will flash. You don't have to run a red light, you just have to be in the intersection while the light is red. You could possible get a fine for making a right turn at a red light as well. The cameras are just another way to make money and they don't stop people from running red lights.",

I do see what you're saying about people knowing where the cameras are, but call me old fashioned- I would still rather have an actual human tell me that I am doing something wrong versus a camera snapping a picture! To me, I think we would be better off as a community if the streets were patrolled more. Maybe- instead of making jobs for people to sit behind desks and monitor the cameras, we can have police officers more frequently patrolling the area. I do, though, see the positives to having the cameras in place. I just think that it becomes mroe hazardous to us because now- everytime someone goes under a yellow light, they are cringing because they don't know if they are being put on candid camera! It becomes a sticky situation with me now because I can see both sides of the argument, however, I still see it as a money making scheme for the government's benefit and a hazard to us.

            "discussionTitle": "There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law",
            "conclusion": "There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law",
            "premise": "I want to acknowledge my worthy opponent. I admire his formal debating skills and I thank him for his politeness. P1: A person is free to do what they wish so long as they don't infringe upon another is how I am understanding my opponent's rebuttal, and I do agree with this concept. However, my opponent has not proven or shown that anyone is being infringed upon. In his example of a student 'wising off' to his teacher there was a victim, someone was wronged, someone had their rights infringed upon. In the case of not wearing a seat belt no one else is harmed or infringed upon. I do agree for instance that the government should have a role in ensuring that a vehicle has working brakes, to protect the safety of others, but where there is no victim to protect, such as in the case of mandatory seat belt laws, I believe the role of the government to be to preserve rights and liberties, and to stand up to it's ideal of protecting life, liberty (emphasis added), and the pursuit of happiness. As a final example: There are no laws against overeating, which significantly contributes to a large number of health related preventable deaths, but rather, it is given to the individuals to decide what they will or won't do. I will close on this point by reiterating the fact also that anyone who desires to wear a seat belt is free to do so and would not be affected at all by allowing other people the right to exercise their freedoms as well, as the saying goes, live and let live. P2: My opponent claims that it doesn't make sense that the government would need to resort to this tactic to raise revenues, but rather could simply raise taxes. While I agree that on the surface it may actually appear that way, that a government can simply levy taxes upon a population and there is nothing that the said population can or will do about it. That is nice to think in an ideal sense, but in reality it is not so easy for a government to raise taxes. Politicians and leaders who attempt to raise taxes sometimes find out the hard way that the people do not like being excessively taxed, and they actively resist efforts of the government to do so. As an example of this I will use Gray Davis, former Governor of California, who attempted to raise taxes on car registration and was subsequently removed from office by a recall election, in the which the current Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, came to power[1]. Greed does make sense to a lot of people unfortunately. One example I will use is the state of Maryland: \"Some states, such as Maryland, are so eager that they've equipped their officers with night vision goggles, similar to those used by our servicemen in Iraq. Maryland state troopers bagged 44 drivers traveling unbuckled under the cover of darkness.\"[2]. Another example, which is common knowledge to most people, would be the police 'quotas'. By having police 'quotas' the police are using their powers not to protect the people, but to extract revenue. A problem occurs however when the people start seeing the police not as protectors, but as oppressors, if this happens then serious consequences can result. According to the social contract by John Locke the government can only maintain power by having the consent of the governed.[3] I have saved the most insidious example for last. My final example of the seat belt law being a revenue generator is the issue of federal highway funding. In order to qualify for federal highway funds the states are effectively blackmailed into compliance. To put it in simple terms, if a state refuses to have a mandatory seat belt law then they will lose their highway funding. This topic segues well into my next point so I will elaborate further there. P3: My opponent seems to imply that the mandatory helmet laws are good, and that mandatory helmet laws should simply be added on to mandatory seat belt laws. I would like to illustrate what really is going on, and as I stated above it is directly linked with the federal funding issue. I will start by stating the fact that some states have a mandatory seat belt law, but not a mandatory helmet law. Two states are Arizona and Idaho. I would like to examine the logic and thought process that those states have adopted. Why do those states not have a mandatory helmet law? I would say the logical answer is that they do not desire to have either law, but they have been coerced into adopting the mandatory seat belt law in order to secure their funding. The mandatory helmet law was not required and so they didn't impose that. To me, and hopefully all who will read this, that is a clear signal that they know they do not have the cause of righteousness on their side. They are willing to take away liberties and individual freedoms only when they are forced into doing so by economic blackmail, and given the choice they would rather not have that law. As a further proof, a paltry fine for breaking that law was instituted at first, somewhere around a five dollar fine was all that was assessed, I will concede that now however, as the state realizes they can get more money from it, it is being exploited and the amounts of the fines have increased. In summary the state decided to preserve the freedoms of the motorcyclists, as long as their funding (and jobs) were not at risk, so I am implying what you stated, but in reverse. Since they find freedom to be right, in the case of not requiring helmets, they also should find the same with regards to seat belts, and they would, if it wasn't for the blackmail pertaining to the federal highway funds. P4: My opponent's main point appears to be that Seat belted vehicle occupants have about HALF the chance of dying in a car crash as non-belted vehicle occupants. It is simply a fact that many accidents a person could be involved in would be safer for them if they were not wearing a seat belt. The most common accident site is at intersections. The type of accident most common at intersections is a \"T-bone\". Side Impacts: In the 11-17-90 Status Report, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is quoted as saying: Even in low-severity side impacts, serious occupant injuries may occur, especially to drivers on the struck side of the vehicle. The Plymouth (shown above) was struck on the side at a relatively low speed but the driver, who was using a lap-shoulder belt, suffered multiple rib fractures and other injuries. In severe side impacts, even worse injuries often occur. The passenger in the Chevrolet (shown above) was trapped in the car after this crash and subsequently was hospitalized for seven days with injuries. It's because of the seriousness of injuries that occur in such crashes that NHTSA plans to add side impact tests to NCAP[4]. Two professors at the University of Winnipeg, Canada, completed a three year study based on 2,715 drivers from 1982-88 who were injured and matched up with hospital records. According to the study, seat belt use result in more injuries to specific parts of the body, namely: 2.9% more to spine; 2.8% more to chest and pelvis; and 2.3% more to the head[4]. This brings me to a ludicris example, but one that is obvious and needs to be stated. If a person is involved in an accident and they survive the crash. But they only survived the crash because they were not wearing a seatbelt, then they must, by law, be cited for not wearing the safety device, or rather it should be said \"so called safety device\". This is not logical, I don't know what more that I can say than that. My contention is that laws should always be made for the better. Which brings me back to my original idea, that there should not be a mandatory seat belt law. 1.http://en.wikipedia.org... 2.Click it or ticket to socialism, Walter E.

            "premise": "In regard to the equality argument: I posited that equality is insufficient to justify a mandatory act. The accuracy of my analogy withstanding or not, I entreat my opponent to give reason why equality is an higher order value than freedom from enslavement (mandatory service). In regard to the tradition argument: My opponent states that mandatory service results in an individual not only serving those who served before himself/herself, but also those serving after himself/herself. This tidy delineation of generational duty, however, is not sufficient cause for the policy. It implies that reciprocity is inherently necessary to the act of protecting. However, if a fraction of the population is capable of providing protection for both the prior and succeeding generations, then not all the population is obligated to provide protection. Therefore, mandatory military service is not necessary for this reason alone. In regard to the skills argument: There is a problem regarding what skills we consider desirable versus what skills an individual may consider desirable. There is a balance to be struck here. For example, some may consider literacy to be an unnecessary skill, but many consider mandatory nonetheless and the skill is mandatory in public education. I posit a weak version of the argument: there are some skills that should be mandatory, but it is not necessary they be taught via military service. In regards to the government participation argument: I am unsure what my opponent's rebuttal means, yet I retain my stance that increased government participation should be only be a second-hand benefit of a democratic government's policies and not a determining factor. Before summary, I will entreat the audience to believe that freedom from coercion creates a better society. As long as systems are able to ensure the basic needs of a sovereign society, freedom should be the primary goal. As such, mandatory military service should not be implemented.",

Things happen in school all the time, just ask teenagers I\u2019m sorry, but I just asked a teenager and they said that this never happens in schools! My opponent has provided no proof that this at all happens in classrooms where teachers are often present. My opponent has not refuted this. This is the exact same as pulling out a gun in front of a police officer. Are you going to do it if you fear being arrested? Of course not! This point has gone completely unrefuted, my opponent has merely said that \u201cthis happens\u201d, but has not proved it nor has he provided any evidence to support his blanket claims. The school would not have to worry about money, since Americans will more than likely be paying for it. Seriously? The whole point is that America doesn\u2019t have any money to pay for this. Have you heard about the trillion dollar deficit lately? And you think we\u2019ll have money to pay for $1000 cameras for EVERY classroom when we can\u2019t even keep teachers on the job? Seriously, having teachers getting laid off, has nothing to do with this topic. Yes it does, it shows the complete lack of money in the system. This would be a safer place with cameras and I don\u2019t see why you do not agree with me. Would you want your child going to a place with bulling, drugs, etc. going on without cameras or protection. As I pointed out (with sources and evidence) the cameras in place in schools aren\u2019t supposed to instil a sense of safety. They shouldn\u2019t a child feel safe because there is a camera nearby. Kids aren\u2019t prosecuted if they bully someone in front of a camera. This place would not be safer, this place would lack privacy. Let\u2019s put cameras in the washrooms as sex and drugs might occur there. It makes the place safer! But of course not, because of the massive violation of privacy! Privacy is important too! Whenever I pass this bill in the state of Kentucky Good luck with that. My opponent has provided no substantial evidence, attempted to change his plan, hasn\u2019t refuted my arguments on privacy, cost, and ineffectiveness, and hasn\u2019t responded to my challenge of this bill\u2019s effectiveness in an elementary school. I have refuted all of my opponent\u2019s arguments, defended my own, and it is a clear and easy vote CON.",

            "discussionTitle": "Should we abolish speed cameras?",
            "conclusion": "Cameras are money making, not life saving",
            "premise": "\u00a3120 million was collected in 2006 from speeding tickets. That money helps pay for an entire industry built around designing, manufacturing, installing and maintaining speed cameras, not to mention the army of administrators or the traffic police officers who spend time sitting in wait with a mobile camera instead of going after the more dangerous 4 million estimated drivers who are on the roads illegally. The money from fines now goes straight to the Treasury. (Local authorities were once allowed to keep it) Originally when cameras were first introduced in Britain they were used with honest intentions and erected at genuine accident black spots. But when the money started rolling in from drivers caught by these new devices the authorities realised how much money can be made if they keep on planting new cameras. If it really wasn\u2019t about the money then why have they focused so hard on an offence that causes just 5% of accidents and have done proportionally very little in preventing the other 95% causes of accidents? http://www.speedcameras.org In favour of road safety, not revenue Further to this opening argument.... The PACTS reply (and the pilot study and all their other quoted analyses) is based on a gross misuse of the figures in Highways Economic Note #1 (HEN1), which gives estimates for costs associated with a road fatality, serious injury, etc and also the value of preventing a fatality (VPF). The Costs are the true costs to the county of an incident (emergency services, hospital, repairs to roads, etc.), typically up to \u00a310,000 (for the worst case, a serious injury). The report makes it clear that VPF includes amounts for pain, grief, loss of earnings, etc. (totalling around \u00a31.5M for a fatality) and explains that VPF cannot be equated to costs. Any use of VPF to show return on investment is bogus and potentially fraudulent. The values assigned to pain, grief, etc are hypothetical amounts that someone might be prepared to pay to bring their loved one back, and are to be used to compare alternative road schemes. Those values do not exist and would never appear on a balance sheet. To get \u00a358M \"cost saving\" from two years of \"280 lives saved\", PACTS are using an average figure of about \u00a3100,000 as the costs of a fatality/serious-injury/minor-injury. This is a blatant misrepresentation of official government figures by a governemnt body. Further, most of the 280 reduction in KSI per year at camera sites is due to the statistical phenomenon \"regression to the mean\", in other words those 280 accidents would probably not have happened anyway, regardless of cameras. It is a fanciful number and bears no relation to reality (ask yourself how any camera can save a life!). So, with a massive reduction in costs per death/injury and a massive reduction in the number of \"lives saved by cameras\", the return on investment argument is exposed as totally bogus. I believe the \"return on investment\" in terms of safety/casualties is less than 5% per annum. I am currently pursuing this issue with the Head of Scrutiny with my local County Council, who have been using the same tricks. Bripe - an advanced driver and safety professional",

I'll split my response into different sections for easier comprehension and reference. =The Problem================================================================== My opponent states that to do good, we (humans) must leave the Earth, which can be done by aborting all children. However, this is not the most efficient way to rid the planet of humans. For one thing, everyone will have to wait out the rest of their lives, continuing to do whatever we do that is bad for the earth until everyone dies. I'd be sitting here for about 65+ years emitting carbon dioxide, feeding landfills, and numerous other harmful activities. This will make the Earth take even longer to recover and will be unsafe for the environment. Also, pro-life activists would protest and ignore the law. If half of the world is pro-life, for instance, then the law would really only affect half the world. This is also inefficient because the entire world is not simply one country. We would have to convince every other country to abort their children. =The Solution================================================================= Because mandatory abortion is very inefficient at bringing the human race to extinction, I propose that abortion should NOT be mandatory. Instead, every human in the world should go to the nearest body of water, bathtub, etc. and drown themselves*. This will not only be faster, but will also be safer for the environment, and will not anger pro-life activists. The whole world could be rid of humans in a matter of weeks. =Just in case I don't make next round========================================= Just in case, I'm going to refute some possible arguments. Now obviously, one may wonder, who would willingly drown themselves? It doesn't matter, because whoever doesn't obey the law would be killed. This obviously is not right, but who cares about morals when the goal is to go extinct anyway? We wouldn't be alive to worry about it a week or two later. Furthermore, what about the people who are enforcing the rule? What if they don't drown? Well, there's the same problem with mandatory abortion. Who is to stop everyone from having a child sometime in their life? Any problems you could encounter with my method are also problems with my opponent's method. =Conclusion=================================================================== I doubt my opponent will disagree, because here I am agreeing to the fact that humans should leave Earth. However, I have shown that by my opponent's own reasoning, my method is more efficient and safe. I have proven that abortion should NOT be mandatory; rather, that everyone should drown themselves*. So at this point, there is little choice but to vote CON. * Please don't actually drown yourself. That wouldn't be good.",

            "conclusion": "Red Light Cameras need to go",
            "premise": "I would like to thank my opponent for his debate. ARGUMENT 1# You argue that they are handing out ticket's to drivers with no seat belts through the red-light camera. This is what they were always going to use them for thankfully they don't have them every were but they are a safety precaution to let driver's know, and also show them they were in the wrong and they could have been killed if they got into a crash. But not just that you are trained, shown how to drive you need to remember those rule's it\u2019s the law there is not excuse it\u2019s for everybody\u2019s safety. ARGUMENT 2# Now you are arguing that our rights are taken away when we take don't take responsibility for our OWN actions. Common sense should have told you own up to what you do wrong if not why would you be on the road you should be walking not driving. Now you claim \u201cWe aren't robots and we have rights.\u201d Ok that\u2019s fair enough but we still have to obey the law and rules, but not just that, you should have learnt from school and \u201cLife\u201d that disobeying the law is not acceptable. If that is not enough you claim that Citizens should not have to shell out hard earned cash, why not? You broke the law and the rules set in place for your safety and the others around you. If you don\u2019t see the point in red-light camera\u2019s you need to take a step back to realize the bigger picture for example: Safety for you and other\u2019s Another income for the government to pay for everything other\u2019s wreak while running a red light\u2019s Now you may oppose this idea but if you were to take every Red-light camera down and let the traffic go wild, you would surely see that there would be 10 times more crashes then there would be if there were not red-light camera\u2019s. ARGUMENT 3# How can you possibly assume there is going to be black boxes\u2019 in car\u2019s there is no way this is going to happen. Now you claim that there will be a camera, radar gun, and a \u201cblack box\u201d all going to go off at the exact same time making your case nothing, now this is highly unlikely unless you are doing 200 KPH down the main street, and this assumption you are throwing that we should not have to pay a fine that you committed on your own why won\u2019t you own up and take responsibility for what you did wrong. You should know the age long quote \u201cA picture tells a thousand words\u201d you should know that a picture go against everything you say if it is on paper you don\u2019t have a case this is where common sense should kick in and own up to your mistakes and cough up and get on with your life. The only person losing when you dispute the ticket is you. Beside the point you have claimed you believe that people have possibly edited your picture that landed you in all this mess, now this can be true but 99% of the time the government can be trusted in that section but not any other sections. ARGUMENT 4# You claim that it was good before red-light cameras were invented no it was hell for the council and the local police to deal with crazy drivers and hear about people going crazy up streets acting \u201ccool\u201d. But not only that they got into crashes and killed others, and as soon as the red-light camera was implemented there was a sharp fall in illegal doings that citizens were doing in there car\u2019s. Yes I agree that people fought wars to keep us free but we still are free to go about what we want to do if it is safe for us and everybody around us near and far. Now I want you to consider this if you were traveling 110 KPH down the highway it\u2019s a busy day busier than normal you have cars everywhere and you are running late you have just seen the light turn to yellow so you speed up but little do you realize you have no seat belt and you have just run a red-light now you have tens of cars hurtling towards you as you enter the intersection. Then you are then hit by a car from the right then as you are hit you are smashed against the window you then are dragged across by other cars if thing\u2019s could not get any worse the cars have pushed you just enough to nudge you into the other side of the lane you are then hit by another car from the left this second car has hit you with enough power that you are ejected through the FROUNT windscreen you then promptly die as you hit the asphalt if the cars impact had not already killed you. There is not official fact stating that they cause more \u201crear end crashes.\u201d But there has been a survey taken that shows the majority of people want the red light cameras because it enforces the law not breaks it like corruption in the police force. Thank you for reading I await your reply.SOURCES:http://www2.law.ucla.edu... http://articles.sun-sentinel.com... http://www.forbes.com...",

I believe that the person in question driving around in an unregistered car is a \"real police matter\". There may be more pressing matters to attend to, however you cant claim its not a police matter. In my argument you don't know that the police officer was not scanning every car that went past and running there details for: Stolen vehicles, uninsured vehicles, unregistered vehicles. I you wondering how they could do that ill include a video in my sources that shows a device like the one described in action, it has cameras on the front, sides and back so it could easily read the registration number where it was parked. You stated that the officer claimed the car was pulled over because it was unregistered, not so the officer could check if it was unregistered, not because the officer thought it was unregistered. Because the officer knew it was unregistered. This also points to the likely use of cameras on the police vehicle to check out the registration plates of passing vehicles. Lastly there is obviously a basis and probable cause upon which to act if the car has been scanned and found unregistered by a device such as the one mentioned earlier.

Continuing on from my last argument, if people thought that being videotaped was intruding into their personal life, going out in public would be considered an intrusion as well. Security cameras are placed in public areas like human eyes are. We look at people, people look at us. If we don't want to be seen going about our daily life by cameras, then why don't we have a problem with humans? The one thing that is different about cameras is that they don't lie and they always remember what people look like and what time it was. Cameras are much more reliable in a police investigation than witnesses, because their memories of the events aren't forgotten or altered. If the only reason why people don't like security cameras is that they remember fine details down to the second, I think that those people are very aware and private about their actions, leading the average person to suspect something is up with them, and that it would be a good idea to indeed have that person taped.",

            "conclusion": "Sex education should be mandatory in schools.",
            "premise": "Throughout this entire debate I've noticed that you never justified WHY sex ed should be mandatory. I've been explaining my reasons, but it seems to me like you've spent most of your time just refuting my claims. I'm not mad or trying to bash you or anything, I'm just wondering why you spent most of your time rejecting instead of EXPLAINING to me WHY sex ed should be mandatory and WHY you're not convinced otherwise. I may not have had the strongest arguments, but I at least explained in detail why I felt a certain way. Again, not trying to bash you or anything, I just think you've spent your time disagreeing and refuting rather than explaining YOUR side. Anyway, why don't we finish this shall we? Another thing that may serve as a good reason NOT to have sex ed be mandatory, is money. I noticed that you never stated money in the beginning, which is very crucial. In order to be able to have certain classes, schools must have a certain amount of money. I also noticed that in the beginning you stated that \"I will argue that sexual education should be taught at all schools, not only in the United States, but in schools in every single country\". This means that you stated that this should be implemented in every school in every country. The problem with that argument is that not every school is going to have enough money to implement this class, and since you didn't address this in the beginning, this counts as a valid flaw. You need money to buy technology, books, desks, not to mention teachers. Problem is, not every school in every country can afford all of this. And again, with my last argument, students should be able to take whatever class they want to. Classes like sex ed should definitely be more of an option, especially if you consider that some schools have health classes which ARE mandatory, and DO teach lessons about sex. Maybe not in as much detail as the sex ed would, but still enough to get you through life. And as I've stated earlier, don't forget about the students and how they would feel about this. They might not want to take sex ed if they are staying abstinent or just don't like the idea of having sex, and if that's true then I'm 100% sure that they won't take too kindly to being forced into taking sex ed. Again, sex ed, a nice idea yes, but do we really need it to be mandatory? And one more thing, that 'condition' you made earlier about: \"sexual education is not the only thing that is mandatory. Counseling, parent conferences, and experience are among the solutions.\" That is technically an invalid condition because you did not state it in the beginning, and you used it as a defense to my other claims. If you would've mentioned it earlier, I would've avoided my initial argument overall and choose a different point of view. Remember to state all of your conditions before starting the debate. Well, that's all I want to launch for this one. I really enjoyed this debate. This is actually my first one. See you! And may the better man win!",

            "premise": "I thank my opponent for his comments. I would like to take this time to refute the arguments brought forth by my opponent. So how could I prove these experiences? It\u2019s not like I have it recorded or anything, but I know that they happened, whether you believe me or not. That\u2019s the point, in a debate personal experience cannot be proven, and as it cannot be proven it isn\u2019t evidence. For all I know you could\u2019ve made this up! But I did not mean that he/she just views them whenever a problem approaches. I meant, that when he/she is in his/her office then they can just see what is going on in every classroom. Do you think that a single principal would be able to concentrate on administrative duties and watch over 20 monitors minimum at the same time??? Of course not, either the principal would only be watching the monitors, thus taking away from administrative duties and slowing the entire school down, or will only be doing administrative work, not focusing on the monitors, thus rendering them useless. Another possibility is that the principal occasionally glances at the monitors, but in a 40 minute period there is a very short time frame. There has always been perverted things going on in school, people has had sex In a classroom? I didn\u2019t think so. Oh, and doing drugs does not always have smoke, like actual pills In a classroom? No proof, I don\u2019t think so. This is just like my police analogy (which has remained unrefuted). The reason why teachers are being laid off is because of our idiotic president This is unrelated, whatever the matter, schools do not have the money as teachers are being laid off. Over 132, 000 teachers were laid off in 2011 alone! [1] Most schools have money, so most wouldn\u2019t be a problem. I have disproved this in the above source and argument. Oh, and most schools have cameras in the hallways The fact that schools have cameras in hallways has no bearing in this debate. The hallway and the classroom are very different, in a classroom the teacher is there to supervise, not in the halls. Also, the cameras are not there to catch anything per se, as said in the following source [2] the camera should never make it feel like if a person is attacked that they will be rescued. Thus, their effect in the hallway is minimal as well. Plus, I think it should be only for middle and high school. I\u2019m sorry, but I posted in R1 the definitions as you hadn\u2019t, and the definitions were from grade K \u2013 12, you did not dispute this so it was accepted as the definition. Thus, this point (which is really just your opinion) is null. Bringing up definitions, we have focused this debate on junior and high school, yet what about elementary schools? Does my esteemed opponent think that perverted acts and drugs will occur in an elementary school?? Clearly, the implementation of a camera system in elementary schools is a massive incursion of privacy and a massive waste of money. I beg my opponent to address this point in his final round. I have refuted my opponent\u2019s arguments, defended my own, and have fulfilled my BOP. Thus, it is clear for voters to VOTE CON. SOURCES:1. http://thinkprogress.org... 2. https://www.ncjrs.gov...",

            "discussionTitle": "Surveillance cameras in public areas should be substantially increased.",
            "conclusion": "Surveillance cameras in public areas should be substantially increased.",
            "premise": "I will start off by attacking my opponent's case then attack the points he made against my case. But before that, pull through the point that we are talking about the United States as the basis country and governmental system we discuss, as he must agree that it is. Off of his 1 argument: Private is defined as not open or accessible to the general public. My opponent tries to argue the point that a public area no longer becomes public once you put cameras into it. Public as I defined before is open to all persons. So if we put more surveillance cameras in a grocery store, does it become a private venue? No, it does not. It is still accessible to the public, but rather the increase in surveillance cameras will make the public feel safer. Private areas can also certainly have cameras, but that's not the point of this debate. Off of his 2 argument: Look to my third contention where I talk about how this resolution says should happen. I don't have to provide a budgetary plan or show the pragmatics of the situation. But even if I had to compare budgetary plans, his alternative to cameras are security guards which would cost a lot more money than surveillance cameras, and you would have to keep paying them every single year. I will further discuss this in his third and fourth arguments. Off of his 3 argument: The security guards can stop criminals right there, but cameras can also catch them and make sure they don't get away. Do not let this debate round become surveillance cameras against security guards. We are here to discuss surveillance cameras and whether or not they should be substantially increased in public areas. Not whether security guards or surveillance cameras are better. Both are affective, both can stop the rate of crime, and both can potentially insure the three Ss very well. But the obligation of the con is not to bring up other options, cause if that was so he could abuse that by saying we should increase satellite surveillance of people, or bring in the military to protect public areas. Once again, let's stay topical and let's have a discussion about the pros and cons of substantially increasing surveillance cameras in public areas and if it should happen. Off of his 4 argument: Okay, he likes to bring the issue of money, and I don't think it needs to be a huge issue, but if he wants it to be an issue then let's talk about the costs of a security guard to a camera. A good surveillance camera would be two to three thousand dollars. So for example\u2026..a Target wants to increase security in a store. So they can either get two more surveillance cameras for a cost from about four to six thousand dollars or they can hire two security guards for $20 dollars an hour as my opponent said. Let's say a Target is open 6am-11pm. That would be 17 hours, 40 dollars each hour for the two shifts (more than two guys would hold the shifts). In that day alone it would be $680, for a 7 day week, it would be $4760. In nearly a week, the store would have paid the shifts for the security guards as much as they would for a surveillance camera. If he wants to bring up maintenance, then I'll include that, but that would be chump change to the amounts his security guard idea would bring up. The store could install many cameras even before touching the costs of what two shifts at security guard alone would cost. But even beyond the cost, surveillance cameras, will keep criminals off. If a criminal knows that a store is full of surveillance cameras they will be extremely less likely to commit a crime. But once again do not buy his counter-plan because this is not intended to be a comparison between anything he can bring up against surveillance cameras, but rather, once again, a discussion and debate only about surveillance cameras. Now moving on to my side of the debate. Against his attacks on my 1st contention: Safe is defined as dependable or trustworthy. It can also be defined as careful to avoid danger. I do accomplish increasing safe because by installing more surveillance cameras I install something that is dependable or trustworthy. I also, by substantially increasing surveillance cameras, do what is careful to avoid danger. It keeps tabs on dangerous people, so that if they do commit acts in these public areas we discuss, they will get caught, and plus by using a surveillance camera you get a sure view of what happened in the crime, thus making it easier to catch, indict, and prosecute a criminal. He may try to bring up security guards again, but still that's not the point of this debate round, it's too discuss surveillance cameras. I think that they indeed SHOULD increase the number of surveillance cameras, because that would accomplish increasing safety, thus I'm doing what is right. Against his attacks on my 2nd contention: I grow tired of his security guard arguments because my obligation is not to prove why surveillance cameras should be substantially increased in public areas. So I will prove why I do accomplish the three Ss. But I will not tell you why I do it better than security guards, because that is not my obligation. The resolution would have made it an issue if it was, but I do not have to continue comparing surveillance cameras to security guards. I accomplish the three Ss in this way. Safety is accomplished because of what I discussed in the paragraph just before this one, so look to those for how I accomplish safety. Security is accomplished, because security is can be defined as well founded-confidence of one's protection. There is no doubt that surveillance cameras can make one have well-founded confidence of one's protection. I have don't have to compare whether or not security guards do this better or worse, because that is not what the resolution asks. Finally, stability is found on the pro as well. Stability is defined as the state or quality of being stable. I do accomplish being stable because by having a structured system of surveillance cameras I have balanced stability. So because I provide and accomplish the three Ss it is shown that surveillance cameras are beneficial to society, therefore that's why I believe surveillance cameras in public areas, once again, should be substantially increased. Against his attack on my 3rd contention: Substantially \u2013 something basic or essential; fundamental. There is no set number, but the resolution implies that some camera were already in place, so I believe by increasing the number of them, I increase the potential of maintaining the three Ss. Also, pull through the points that he some what rebutted in other spots, that we don't have to discuss economics. It is a SHOULD resolution, not a plans and policy resolution. So in the end, I provide as to why surveillance cameras should be substantially increased in public areas. I show how I get the three Ss of safety, security, and stability. We are here to debate surveillance cameras, and not security guards. Please do not accept his counter-plan because as I just stated in 3rd contention rebuttal that it is a SHOULD resolution, and not a plans and policy resolution. That is why I can only see a Pro vote at the end of this round",

            "conclusion": "Resolved: Governmental implementation of surveillance cameras in public places are beneficial.",
            "premise": "Introduction: Former Governor of Connecticut Jodi Wells was once quoted in saying, \u201cAt the end of the day, the goals are simple: safety and security.\u201d Security and safety are essentials to living a happy, contented life. When individuals feel insecure, problems ensue. A just government should do all they can to ensure a secure and safe life for their citizens. It is because I believe that the goals politician Jodi Wells mentioned are achievable, I affirm the resolution which asks: \u201cShould governments install surveillance cameras in public places?\u201d To begin, I would like to point out a few terms mentioned in the resolution. Governments: The term implies that the ones in power of the country/state/city/etc. are installing these surveillance devices. As the government in the resolution is not specified as federal, it should not be restricted to such. Surveillance Cameras: Merriam-Webster dictionary defines \"surveillance\" as the act of carefully watching someone or something, especially in order to prevent or detect crime. Cameras are obviously going to be a tool used to achieve surveillance. Thus, these cameras' primary purpose will be used as a form of security. Public places: I will once again use Merriam-Webster dictionary to define this term; exposed to general view. As an area where it is obviously going to be exposed to general view, privacy should not be an issue. With this in mind, let us move on to the remainder of the case. Benefits of Surveillance Outweigh Supposed Harms: Security is inevitably achieved for public places. As brought up by politician Jodi Wells, the goals of the government and for people in general includes security. It is a big problem, and we should be concerned about it. Recently, the city of Baltimore installed over 600 surveillance cameras all around the city. The reasoning behind this is simple. In a study taken by NeighborhoodScout, they found that Baltimore was one of the top 20 (18 to be exact) most dangerous cities in the United States. [1] Danger comes in all forms, but one is generally of more prominence--crime. Surveillance cameras, being their primary purpose, would assist in dealing with crime. With crime running rampant, people cannot feel secure in simply going to a public place. When individuals are in fear, they definitely aren\u2019t secure in the power or ability of their government. These cameras can also prove what actually happened, rather than unreliable \u201ceyewitness\u201d accounts. The majority of the time, these accounts aren\u2019t the whole truth. As law professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA School of Law explains, \u201cPeople are notoriously bad at observing and remembering exactly what happened.\u201d [2] Either one of two things is the result of such fallible memory: 1) they can\u2019t remember exactly what happened, so they tell the closest to accurate tale they can, or 2) they have the liberty to blatantly lie to law enforcement. Neither result is beneficial to achieving justice in whatever matter is at hand. With surveillance cameras strategically positioned in public areas, they can accurately display the chain of events. People will be secure in knowing that judgment that is due will be given, and any harm caused will be adequately dealt with. Surveillance cameras also have benefits in school settings. They allow students to be physically, mentally, and emotionally safe. School shootings are becoming distressing problems, and many people are worried about the safety of their students. Security cameras can allow teachers and school guards (which many schools now have) to monitor any intruder that may approach the campus. If a suspect becomes aggressive, the school can monitor the actions of the attacker to prevent students from being in harms way. If the students can be mentally and emotionally safe, they will be better able to concentrate on their assignments and increase productivity. Privacy is Not a Valid Argument: The resolution explicitly states that it is referring to public places. If an individual is in a public place, it is reasonable to expect exposure to everyone. By going to a public place, every individual temporarily gives up their right to complete privacy. People (in most scenarios) are already allowed to film in public without requiring explicit consent from other individuals. Surveillance cameras only validate that right on a government level. A common argument against this relates to how the government seems \u201cstalkerish\u201d and how they However, the resolution clearly states that it is referring to a public place. Eugene Volokh once again explains, \u201cThese cameras are in public places, where people\u2019s faces and cars are visible to everyone.\u201d People are already going places where ANYONE can see them. That\u2019s more people than would see government surveillance films. Furthermore, the information will only be accessed when needed, not out of leisure or stalking purposes. These surveillance programs simply allow the footage to exist in case a problem needs to be addressed. Even if people think privacy is harmed, the simple fact is that it is not. The security cameras are in public places, and there is always private areas which are not monitored. Problems Remain Unsolved Without Surveillance: Court decisions can only go off of the evidence they have, and from there, their only option would be to trust witness accounts. In practically every case, each witness account contradicts with another in some way, shape, or form. Solvencies for these types of discrepancies are easily discovered by systems of surveillance by the government. Police tickets for running red lights, stop signs, and other traffic related difficulties would be cleared up simply by using surveillance programs. Not only would these unsolved problems be solved, but it would discourage individuals from committing crimes when they feel they have a regulated sense of accountability and punishment for illegal or adverse behavior. There simply is so many benefits and no real arguments as to why we should not have public places under surveillance that the resolution should be affirmed by any just government seeking to protect its citizens. Once again, I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate and would wish him/her the best of luck!Sources:....................................................................................................................................................................................................[1] http://www.neighborhoodscout.com...[2] http://www2.law.ucla.edu...",

            "discussionTitle": "Organ Donation Should Be Made Mandatory",
            "conclusion": "Organ Donation Should Be Made Mandatory",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting my debate challenge. However, I do not accept the changes in definition made by my opponent to the term \"mandatory\". This is because this MUST occur upon death. This resolution could not be accepted if the person was still living as it can be considered murder, therefore to keep the debate fair the person must be dead before donating their organs. I will be bringing forth 3 contentions arguing for why organ donation should be made mandatory. 1. Saves Lives 2. Increases Scientific Knowledge 3. Curbs illegal activity First of all, before I even proceed on to my contentions, I would like to counter some of the arguments that I have no doubt my opponent will raise. Firstly, the point that the body is your own body, nobody else. However, after death is your body still yours? Why waste an organ that you won't need when you can save some body's life? Would you rather leave a kidney in an 83 year old man, or save the life of a 7 year old boy? Furthermore, I have no doubt that my opponent will raise the point of religious tolerance, and how religions such as Hinduism do not allow the body to be tampered before cremation. However, with the prospect of saving lives and organ donation technology, almost every religion has made allowances for organ donation as they recognize the value of saving lives [2]. I will now proceed on to my first contention, it SAVES LIVES. 1. SAVES LIVES A new nickname has appeared amongst the medical community. The nickname is for motorcycles. The new name for motorcycles are \"Organ Cycles\". Why? Because of how dangerous driving a motorcycle can be. The increased risk of car crashes increases the chance that the drivers will donate their organs to those on wait lists. Horrifyingly, people do listen to the radio hoping to hear the news of a car crash. Currently, in the United States, 114 827 people are on a wait list, waiting for an organ. Everyday, 18 people die waiting for an organ. Furthermore, just donating 1 organ can save 8 lives.[1] Organs can survive for a very long time after death, allowing for time for the organ to be transported and the person receiving the organ to be contacted. Heart/Lungs: Can be preserved for up to 4 - 6 hours after death Pancreas: Can be preserved for up to 12 hours after death Liver: Can be preserved for up to 24 hours after death Kidneys: Can be preserved for up to 48 - 72 hours after death Corneas: Can be preserved for up to 5 - 7 days after death Heart Valves, Skin, Bones: Can be preserved for up to 3 - 10 years after death [2] After death, the organs can be removed and prepared for transplant to another human being. Making organ donation mandatory could prevent 18 people from dying each day. Organ donations can also be used for scientific purposes, which I shall now move on to in my second contention. 2.SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Donating organs (or whole body donations) furthers scientific research as more test subjects are available for testing. This is also an alternative for someone who donates a diseased organ. This will undoubtedly save more lives in the future as cures could possibly be found from conducting tests on these diseased organs. Donated organs have resulted in an increase of understanding and research for these disease: Heart Disease Diabetes HIV Spinal Injuries Joint Replacements Cancer Research Osteoporosis Colon and Liver Treatments Breast Cancer Reproductive Advancements Advanced Drug Delivery Paramedic Training Alzheimer's Research Cochlear Implant Development [3] This increased knowledge will lead to a change in future health care, making it more efficient and effective. 3. CURBS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY In the current desperation of those who are impoverished, one of the options is to donate one of their kidneys on the black market. In Bangladesh, those who donate a kidney on the black market receives around $1500 [4]. Furthermore, in American these organs can be taken by force when the body is waiting for cremation. Organs and tissue is taken from these bodies and donated to hospitals and research facilities around the country. When these tissues are donated, tissues that have diseases are often passed off as \"healthy\" with forged papers. Illegal tissue from a single cadaver has reached 90 tissue transplant recipients. Clearly, the black market organ donation is very dangerous to the health of those who need organs. So, what have we learned today? Organ donation saves lives and has been associated with advanced research and knowledge in the field of medicine. Furthermore, mandatory organ donation curbs the need for black market organ donations. For these reasons, Vote Con.

            "conclusion": "Cameras increased fatalities creating a \u201cfatality gap\u201d as decades of declining fatalities flattened out",
            "premise": "There is no evidence and no logical reason to suggest a correlation between the advent of speed cameras and the declining rate of road casualty reduction. Research has consistently shown that speed cameras have a major impact in reducing casualties. Despite the positive impact of speed cameras on road casualty figures, however, the steep decline in road fatalities achieved in the 1980s has not been matched by the more gradual drop in fatalities in recent years. Sharp reductions in the number of road deaths were achieved between 1983 and 1993, and have been largely associated with the 1983 law making front seatbelt wearing mandatory, better car design and major reductions in drink driving fatalities. Factors likely to be responsible for the slowing rate of reduction between 1993 and 2003 include continued increases in traffic (up from 583 billion passenger kilometres 1993 to 634 billion passenger kilometres in 20025); sharp increases in motorcycle casualties (up from 427 in 1993 to 609 in 2002); a levelling-off of drink drive fatality numbers (up from 520 in 1993 to 560 in 2002; a decline in seatbelt-wearing and the increased use of mobile phones while driving. The factors contributing to the slowing rate of fatality reduction are currently under review as part of analysis of progress towards targets for 2010 casualty reduction set out in the road safety strategy. http://www.pacts.org.uk",

I agree with the fact that the smarter driveres will become more safe and the knuckleheads will just become more knuckle-headier. In many respects, I can see what you're saying with having the police patrol other areas and take care of situations that would take precedence over traffic lights. I just feel that the majority of accidents that happen are not due to people blowing red lights, but on the other hand; people doing that won't make others safe. And you're right... if traffic cameras help the way people drive, in any way, I can see that as a definite positive. In some ways, maybe I feel like my privacy is being taken away in the slightest bit because of these lights, but like you have said... if it makes it safer, why not. I do, though, feel uncomfortable with the traffic lights because I feel as though that it was not even that big of an issue for them to place cameras, but apparently it is getting some work done considering most people probably think twice before \"flooring it\" through the yellow light.",

            "discussionTitle": "Organ Donation should be made Mandatory",
            "conclusion": "Organ Donation should be made Mandatory",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting my debate challenge. I will be bringing forth 3 contentions arguing for why organ donation should be made mandatory. 1. Saves Lives 2. Increases Scientific Knowledge 3. Curbs illegal activity First of all, before I even proceed on to my contentions, I would like to counter some of the arguments that I have no doubt my opponent will raise. Firstly, the point that the body is your own body, nobody else. However, after death is your body still yours? Why waste an organ that you won't need when you can save some body's life? Would you rather leave a kidney in an 83 year old man, or save the life of a 7 year old boy? Furthermore, I have no doubt that my opponent will raise the point of religious tolerance, and how religions such as Hinduism do not allow the body to be tampered before cremation. However, with the prospect of saving lives and organ donation technology, almost every religion has made allowances for organ donation [2]. I will now proceed on to my first contention, it SAVES LIVES. 1. SAVES LIVES A new nickname has appeared amongst the medical community. The nickname is for motorcycles. The new name for motorcycles are \"Organ Cycles\". Why? Because of how dangerous driving a motorcycle can be. The increased risk of car crashes increases the chance that the drivers will donate their organs to those on wait lists. Horrifyingly, people do listen to the radio hoping to hear the news of a car crash. Currently, in the United States, 114 827 people are on a wait list, waiting for an organ. Everyday, 18 people die waiting for an organ. Furthermore, just donating 1 organ can save 8 lives.[1] Organs can survive for a very long time after death, allowing for time for the organ to be transported and the person receiving the organ to be contacted. Heart/Lungs: Can be preserved for up to 4 - 6 hours after death Pancreas: Can be preserved for up to 12 hours after death Liver: Can be preserved for up to 24 hours after death Kidneys: Can be preserved for up to 48 - 72 hours after death Corneas: Can be preserved for up to 5 - 7 days after death Heart Valves, Skin, Bones: Can be preserved for up to 3 - 10 years after death [2] After death, the organs can be removed and prepared for transplant to another human being. Making organ donation mandatory could prevent 18 people from dying each day. Organ donations can also be used for scientific purposes, which I shall now move on to in my second contention. 2.SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Donating organs (or whole body donations) furthers scientific research as more test subjects are available for testing. This is also an alternative for someone who donates a diseased organ. This will undoubtedly save more lives in the future as cures could possibly be found from conducting tests on these diseased organs. Donated organs have resulted in an increase of understanding and research for these disease: Heart Disease Diabetes HIV Spinal Injuries Joint Replacements Cancer Research Osteoporosis Colon and Liver Treatments Breast Cancer Reproductive Advancements Advanced Drug Delivery Paramedic Training Alzheimer's Research Cochlear Implant Development [3] This increased knowledge will lead to a change in future health care, making it more efficient and effective. 3. CURBS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY In the current desperation of those who are impoverished, one of the options is to donate one of their kidneys on the black market. In Bangladesh, those who donate a kidney on the black market receives around $1500 [4]. Furthermore, in American these organs can be taken by force when the body is waiting for cremation. Organs and tissue is taken from these bodies and donated to hospitals and research facilities around the country. When these tissues are donated, tissues that have diseases are often passed off as \"healthy\" with forged papers. Illegal tissue from a single cadaver has reached 90 tissue transplant recipients. Clearly, the black market organ donation is very dangerous to the health of those who need organs. So, what have we learned today? Organ donation saves lives and has been associated with advanced research and knowledge in the field of medicine. Furthermore, mandatory organ donation curbs the need for black market organ donations. For these reasons, Vote Con.

            "premise": "By using behavioral neuroscience principles, we can create a world where criminals are either given the help they need, or summarily executed, police brutality is physically impossible, and the community self-polices. High blood pressure, muscle tension, sweating, and increase in heart rate are signs of stress and aggression. High levels of stress and aggression lead to crime and societal and personal dysfunction. By reducing and eliminating stress and aggression, we can have a functioning society once again. Police brutality is another problem that we can solve. An officer's judgment is very important, but we cannot allow the officer's judgment to be clouded by personal bias in deciding on whether to use non-lethal and lethal force to take down a criminal. What we can do is develop mandatory wristbands to measure a person's heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response, and electromyogram. These levels can be distilled into an index from 0 to 600, where 0 is stress-free, 100 and above is dangerous and prone to violence, and 300 and above is an immediate threat to themselves and others. We can also calculate the historical volatility of the index, and use that to determine someone's coping skills. Those with a low index volatility and low index should be the only ones allowed to be law enforcement, and they will be automatically removed if their levels become high, because that indicates instability. We can have a system monitor every region for the average stress index of the population, and if that level spikes, dispatch officers to investigate. The NSA should be responsible for all policing and law enforcement, due to their superior investigative and surveillance capabilities. The officers should be outfitted with special guns, and only these special guns, that can read the target's stress index levels, and if the level is below 100 , the safety cannot be released, if the level is at or above 100, the gun fires tranquilizer dart, and if the level is 300 or above, it fires lethal slugs. And these guns can only be used by the officers they're registered to. The job of the police will be to investigate and report on situations of stress indexes above 100, and to try to get the target's stress index down or take them into custody if they are actively committing a crime. The victims will also be taken into custody so they can receive help. When a target is taken into custody, they are to get a full physical, neurological, and psychiatric examination by a physician, and be placed into mandatory psychoanalysis by a certified psychiatrist or psychologist once their stress index goes down, which is when they can be released with whatever restitution a magistrate orders, plus a punishment ranging from a income-proportional fine, to house arrest, to physician-supervised flogging, plus a course of haloperidol and lorazepam. If they re-offend again, they will be committed to a hospital for intensive treatment. Psychological stress index monitors and cameras should be ubiquitous, and should compliment people who have low stress indexes and index volatility, and encourage those with high stress indexes and volatility to get help. The goal of law and law enforcement will be to encourage a stress-free society.",

            "conclusion": "Policing sexual \"harassment\" should not be the responsibility of employers",
            "premise": "Pro wrote: \"You know that girl in the office you have been admiring from afar for so long? Yes, that's right; the nice, slim, pretty one with one with the outsize breasts. Well, how does she know you find her attractive? She won't unless you let her know.\" I disagree for we communicate and interact with others mostly by body language/action than actually speaking. Therefore a girl can tell if a male likes her through his body language/actions that can be appropriate which excludes any actions that are viewed as sexual harassment. My opponent also mentioned how the the primary responsibility of a public company is to maximise profits for its shareholders and having to police sexual harassment takes money away from the shareholders. Now, yes I agree the primary responsibility of a public company is to maximise profits for its shareholders, but the action of not policing sexual harassment could also and mostly likely would lead to affecting the shareholders profits too. How? Ok you are an employer of a company and you don't police sexual harassment and therefore it is solely in the hands of your employees. Sexual harassment starts to become an issue in that a good portion of your employees are constantly taking off work to meet with their lawyers and/or you are constantly hiring and firing. These actions as well as the action of policing sexual harassment in the workplace affect the shareholders and their profits. Another statement my opponent mentioned was the law would apply to all companies not having to police sexual harassment and therefore the reputation wouldn't be a concern. Just because something is a law (or not a law) it can still have an impact on the reputation of the company. For example there is no law that says big corporations such as Merck, Glaxosmithkline, Microsoft,Google, etc have to offer its employees services such as having national food chains on site, day care services on site for the employees young children, on site bank(s), and other services. Offering these services keeps the employee happy and in return the employee is more likely to increase his/her work productivity leading to the increase profits for its shareholders. So these factors combined together would affect reputation of the company as far as those who are looking into being an employee and/or investor for that company. So why wouldn't companies have the same attitude and go above and beyond of what is expected of them in relation to sexual harassment, no matter if there is a law stating that employers don't have to police sexual harassment? The last thing I would like to comment on is that my opponent had ask if anyone would want to work in such an Orwellian environment? I hate to say this but we live and I repeat we live in an Orwellian world to a degree. Yes, everyone to a point is under surveillance. Just look at things like Face book where anyone can view what you post (if you allow it) and some have gotten in trouble from their employer for what has been posted on their face book page, despite the fact that the postings occurs while off the job or its something that was part of that person's past. Everything we do, for we have smartphones, tablets, credit and debit cards, and the list grows that tracks our movements and you are worry about being under the microscope while at work? Hell, cameras are becoming smart that not only do they recognized us by our facial features, but there are companies trying to develop or maybe they have already where cameras talk to each other and they can predict where you will likely go next when walking in the streets of a city. Thank you and I hope you are having a good time enjoying the debate.",

            "discussionTitle": "There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law",
            "conclusion": "There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law",
            "premise": "==== 1 - My opponent has misunderstood my point here. I am not saying that we should all be able to do whatever we want, unless it infringes on someone else's freedom. We should be, and are, however, able to do whatever we want that people with power do not want to stop us from doing. If those we have put into power decide that certain drugs, for instance, are harmful to society if people take them, then those in power - who are charged with protecting society at large - are justified in doing what they can to stop people from doing these drugs. This situation is the same for seatbelts: people not wearing seatbelts harms society at large, by causing, on average, twice as many deaths as wearing seatbelts (See point 4). Since legislative bodies are charged with making laws to ensure the prosperity and welfare of our society, they are quite justified in supporting mandatory seatbelt laws, since these laws increase the number of seatbelt-wearers and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary deaths. My opponent says that he is in favor of mandatory car inspections, [requiring that the brakes are in good working condition, etc], since these laws protect the safety of others. First, note that lawmakers are supposed to protect all citizens, not just 'others.' Second, note that there are always 'victims' when someone dies. If I die in a car crash because I wasn't wearing a seatbelt, I'm not the only person affected by that. It sends a ripple throughtout the chunk of society I inhabit - my friends and family are left mourning, my employer is shorthanded, etc. If my opponent needs for there to be a 'victim' other than oneself to accept seatbelt laws, he can simply consider the multitude of people besides himself who would be negatively affected by his needless death. === 2 - My opponent continues to argue that seatbelt laws are simply in place as an additional source of revenue. This is nonsense - I have and will continue to show in other points that there are other reasons. Additional revenue is but one of the many reasons the government has for supporting such laws. Perhaps I was mistaken in saying that raising taxes would be so easy, and I'm fine with accepting error on that point. Next, my opponent brings up that some places like Maryland overdo it - wasting their money on night vision goggles and their time on ticketing '44 drivers' for driving unbuckled at night. First, the waste of money seems to go against my opponent's point here, that the government is simply using this as a way to get more money. Second, enforcing a law that is beneficial to society is not something that should only be done during the day. And lastly, my opponent fails to mention the timeframe during which 44 drivers were given tickets for driving with no seatbelt. But it doesn't matter; if Maryland was overzealous, that is a problem with Maryland's zealotry, NOT a problem with mandatory seat belt laws. Mandatory seat belt laws can be enforced too little or too often, as it is with every crime. Mandatory seatbelt laws should continue to exist, and if they are enforced in certain places too often or too little, then the level of enforcement should be raised or lowered accordingly. My opponent also brings up police quotas. These sometimes may cause tickets that really weren't worth given out, no matter what the laws are in question. Seat belt laws don't cause police quotas - police uotas are a problem that exists separately from seatbelt laws. If police quotas really are bad, as my opponent suggests, then they should be abandoned. My opponent quotes John Locke as saying that a government cannot be successful without the consent of the people. It has just that - and in cases where it doesn't seat belt laws are not the issue. The overwhelming majority of people are fine with seatbelt laws - this is why you've probably never seen a protest against them. My opponent also brings up the 'insidious' example of highway funding. The federal government, in wanting to protect its citizens, decides that states will only get federal highway funding if certain safety regulations are followed - one of these regulations is the mandatory seat belt law. The fact that such seatbelt laws are necessary for our states to get highway funding stands out as yet another reason why each state SHOULD have mandatory seatbelt laws. === 3. My opponent suggests that the states that have seatbelt laws but no helmet laws do not really want either law, they have simply been coerced into the seatbelt law by federal funding. This is simply not true - motorcycle helmet laws are one of many safety regulations that must be followed to obtain federal funding. \"In 1967, the federal government began requiring states to enact motorcycle helmet laws in order to be eligible for certain federal safety programs and highway construction funds.\" Among these states are Idaho and Arizona, according to my opponent. http://itd.idaho.gov... That is an Idaho government page, the authority on Idaho's position about these laws. There are some interesting facts there - here is one of them: \"In 2007, the 22% of Idahoans that did not buckle up accounted for 65% of the people killed in traffic crashes. (ITD 2007 Crash Report and 2007 Observational Seat Belt Survey)\" Further, let's look a little further down the page: \"Idaho is ineligible for federal seat belt grant funds...\" Looks like funding ISN'T their reason for seat belt laws after all! And here's some more interesting information on the page: In 2007, the economic impact to Idahoans for motorists killed or injured due to lack of seat belt use was $861 million. (ITD 2007 Crash Report) I can assure you, the ones who paid that $861 million were not the victims of the accidents - they were those left behind - those affected by the recklessness of these drivers. And from Arizona's government website http://www.azdps.gov...: \"Every hour someone dies in America simply because they didn't buckle up. Failure to buckle up contributes to more fatalities than any other single traffic safety-related behavior. Despite terrible traffic problems such as aggressive driving, increasing seat belt use is still the single most effective thing we can do to save lives and reduce injuries on America's roadways.\" Note, too, that this might be why seat belt laws exist there but helmet laws do not. Relatively few people ride motorcycles, and helmets don't save lives as effectively as seatbelts. In fact, according to some studies they don't have a statistically significant effect at all [1]. By this logic, it is obvious why seat belt laws would exist in all states, where motorcycle helmet laws do not exist everywhere. === 4 - My opponent once again states that sometimes, seatbelts can actually be harmful. This is true, but much more often, seatbelts are good. It is impossible to know whether you will get in an accident where a seatbelt will help you, do nothing, or harm you. People do not 'plan' on getting in certain types of accidents. To be better prepared for the majority of accidents, people should wear seatblets. The proof is in the pudding - seatbelt-wearers are, on average, half as likely to die in an accident. Getting more people to wear seatbelts therefore saves lives, and reduces the negative economic and social impact of car crashes. My opponent points out a study where seatbelts were found to lead to slightly (2-3%) higher likelihood of certain types of injury. When we compare the measly 3% increase in likelihood of certain types of injury with the 50% reduction in likelihood of death, we find that seatbelts are still worth it overall. And now, to the much anticipated final round. [1]http://www.bikersrights.com...",

            "conclusion": "CCTV cameras in public places are morally justified",
            "premise": "I thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and hope it will be a good one. === ON THE META-ETHICAL CHALLENGE PROVIDED BY MY OPPONENT === As with most ethical debates, I am arguing what I believe, and nothing more. Were the resolution to say, \"Christians should accept the need for CCTV cameras\", or \"There is room in Satanic morality for CCTV\", then clearly I would be arguing within a certain framework, and my opponent by implication would be as well. The resolution in fact doesn't say anything like this, and so my opponent is free to challenge my argument however he wants. \"Assuming what is right or wrong is subjective, we must both debate through the eyes of the same specific mode of morality.\" No, we don't. It is equally possible for us to argue _between_ modes of morality. One of many examples of this happening on this very website can be found here: http://www.debate.org.... Indeed, the entire point of meta-ethics is to debate between alternative ethical theories to see which (if any) are successful. Accordingly, my opponent has two possible avenues of attack in this debate. He can either accept my premises/assumptions and then attack my conclusion (\"debating through the same mode of morality\") or he can argue that my premises/assumptions themselves are flawed (\"debating between modes of morality\"). Accordingly, I need not specify which \"mode\" I'm taking, as the arguments will speak for themselves. === MY SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENTS === Onwards, then, to my arguments. There are three of them, which I will outline very quickly in syllogistic form - making my argument clear, but without wasting too much time writing out prose on what my opponent may very well concede without problem :-) I'll be happy to expand on premises in later rounds, if and when it becomes clear exactly which ones my opponent will be attacking. 1) Limits of the right to privacy There are two types of people: people who are guilty of a crime, or are suspected of committing a crime; and those who are law-abiding citizens, and recognised as such. a. For guilty people - When you commit a crime, or are suspected of one, the state has a right to infringe your privacy insofar as it helps them investigate this crime. - CCTV cameras, where they are put, provide recorded evidence of any crime committed under its gaze. - Therefore, if someone commits a crime in the vicinity of the cameras, s/he has given up his right to privacy in this regard. b. For law-abiding people - When someone is in public, they recognise that their actions may be seen, and that they may be watched by regular passers-by. - People therefore concede elements of their right to privacy every time they leave their home (or other such private places) and go into the public realm. - When put in public places, CCTV cameras record what takes place in public. - Therefore, such CCTV cameras do not infringe upon the right to privacy. 2) Property rights - Public areas are the property of the state - People have a right to do what they want with their own property, so long as it doesn't infringe unnecessarily upon other people's rights. - For the reasons outlined in 1) above, no such unnecessary infringement happens with the installation of CCTV in public places. - Therefore, the state has a right to place CCTV cameras in public areas. 3) Solving crime - The primary point of CCTV cameras is to record crimes happening, and to facilitate the capture of the guilty after the fact. They may also be used in real time, by the police who wish to track and catch criminals on the run. - The state, being charged with the duty of defining \"crime\", has the right to better ensure the capture of criminals. - Therefore, the state is justified in setting up CCTV cameras, and in making sure that they catch as many criminals as possible. I may as yet have reason to introduce more substantive arguments as the debate goes on. But so far, for all of these reasons, the resolution is affirmed. I await my opponent's response.",

            "conclusion": "Should Students Have To Wear Mandatory Uniforms",
            "premise": "School uniforms may deter crime and increase student safety. In Long Beach, CA, after two years of a district-wide K-8 mandatory uniform policy, reports of assault and battery in the district's schools decreased by 34%, assault with a deadly weapon dropped by 50%, fighting incidents went down by 51%, sex offenses were cut by 74%, robbery dropped by 65%, possession of weapons (or weapon \"look-alikes\") decreased by 52%, possession of drugs went down by 69%, and vandalism was lowered by 18%. (M. Sue Stanley, \"School Uniforms and Safety,\" Education and Urban Society, Aug. 1996) A 2012 peer-reviewed study found that one year after Sparks Middle School in Nevada instituted a uniform policy, school police data showed a 63% drop in police log reports, and decreases were also noted in gang activity, student fights, graffiti, property damage, and battery. (Claudene Wharton, \"College of Education Researchers Conduct Study on Impacts of School Uniforms,\" unr.edu, Apr. 23, 2013) A 2010 peer-reviewed study found that schools with uniform policies had 12% fewer firearm-related incidents and 15% fewer drug-related incidents than schools without uniforms. (Seunghee Han, \"A Mandatory Uniform Policy in Urban Schools: Findings from the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2003-04,\" International Journal of Education Policy and Leadership, 2010) A 2007 peer-reviewed study found that, in schools with historically higher rates of sexual violence, sexual attacks were less likely if uniform policies were in place. (J. Scott Granberg-Rademacker, Jeffrey Bumgarner, and Avra Johnson, \"Do School Violence Policies Matter? An Empirical Analysis of Four Approaches to Reduce School Violence,\" Southwest Journal of Criminal Justice, Spring 2007) School uniforms also prevent students from concealing weapons under baggy clothing, make it easier to keep track of students on field trips, and make intruders on campus more visible. Frank Quatrone, superintendent in the Lodi district of New Jersey, stated in Feb. 2011 that \"When you have students dressed alike, you make them safer. If someone were to come into a building, the intruder could easily be recognized.\" (John A. Gavin, \"Schools Find Stricter Rules, Uniforms Can Lessen Bullying,\" northjersey.com, Feb. 8, 2011) Wearing uniforms enhances school pride, unity, and community spirit. A 2007 study from Oxford Brookes University in the United Kingdom found that uniforms \"often directly contributed to a feeling of school pride.\" Christopher P. Clouet, Superintendent of the New London, CT school district, stated that \"the wearing of uniforms contributes to school pride.\" A 2002 study of over 1,000 Texas middle school students found that students in uniform \"reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group.\" Arnold Goldstein, PhD, head of the Center for Research on Aggression at Syracuse University, stated that uniforms help troubled students feel they have the support of a community: \"There is a sense of belonging.\" A 2007 peer-reviewed study found that after uniforms were introduced, \"Teachers perceived an increase in the level of respect, caring, and trust... throughout the school\" and said \"students are made to feel 'important' and as if they are a part of a team by wearing a uniform.\" (John A. Huss, \"The Role of School Uniforms in Creating an Academically Motivating Climate: Do Uniforms Influence Teacher Expectations,\" Journal of Ethnographic and Qualitative Research, 2007)",

            "conclusion": "Surveillance cameras in public areas should be substantially increased.",
            "premise": "Okay, I'll start with my opponent's case, move to mine, then I'll wrap it all up with some key voting issues in this round. Off of his 1 argument: He continues to uphold the idea that once a camera is put in a public area, that it is no longer public, but rather it becomes private. But you'll see as I defined private (not open or accessible to the general public) and as I defined public (open to all persons), that just because I put up a surveillance camera or several surveillance cameras in a public area, does not make it private. To be private is for something to not be open or accessible to the general public, and installing cameras does not take away public areas, in fact cameras keep the public safer. And just because someone thinks cameras are cramping their style does not mean you sacrifice the three Ss just so their style is not cramped. You cannot accept his 1st point because basic definitions and logic alone will tell you that just because I put a camera up in a public area, doesn't magically make it private area. Off of his 2 argument: First let's talk about the different worlds argument\u2026..we are debating whether or not surveillance cameras in public areas should be substantially increased. We are no debating which world is better, more cameras or more guards. We are not debating that. The con burden in the round is to prove why we should not put more cameras up, but instead my opponent uses smokescreen tactics to try and avoid the actual dialogue of the resolution we should be discussing. Since it is a should resolution, it appears to be more philosophy based, and not so much who provides a better plan. Let's get back to the pros and cons of surveillance cameras, and let's not do this cameras (vs) guards debate\u2026..because that is not what the resolution asks of us. Anyways, he brings up some economic arguments in this argument as well, but I'll discuss these in his 4 argument, so we can get to it all there. Off of his 3 and 4 argument: I need to touch on some major misconceptions and as a result, I will fuse my arguments against his 3 and 4 arguments into one long argument against both. Alright let's talk about some economics here. Even though it should not be cameras (vs) guards, I will show you why cameras are still more cost efficient. Okay, I do not really accept 10 cameras counter 2 security guards. But even so, the $4,760 dollars is based on how much they earn per week. That means multiple that by 52, and you will get the number the store has to pay the shifts of security guard every year. That number would be $247,520 dollars every year for two shifts at security guard. Whereas 10 cameras would only cost $20,000 dollars, maybe a little maintenance, but that can not counter the idea that 2 security guards cost more 12 times the amount of 10 surveillance cameras. In addition, as a report of job listings said on monster.com, a person who watches a surveillance camera is paid an average of 12 dollars per hour. So let's I even had 2 guys watching with 10 cameras all that cost together would cost $168,512. That is still dramatically less than the $247,520 dollars that two security guards alone would cost. Moreover, surveillance cameras can actually look at the entire store, whereas guards can only be in a certain little area at a time. Surveillance cameras do cost less and they do stop crime. So even though I believe we should you know\u2026\u2026actually debate the resolution, I still provide why surveillance cameras are better, because they cost less, they can view of more of the store, thus stopping more crime, and that's why they are better than security guards. Off his counter-plan argument he made after the 4 argument: Forgive me if I actually wanted to debate the resolution. I think we should have some direct debate about surveillance cameras and once again the pros and cons of why they should be substantially increased in public areas. I think that we should just debate the resolution, but as he continues with this counter-plan, I continue to offer two arguments, that 1) I believe we should talk about surveillance cameras and not bring up anything you could think of in a counter-plan, and 2) I beat his counter-plan anyways, with the effectiveness of viewing the entire store, and costing way less than security guards would. He thinks I'm cheating him, because I'm not allowing him to make up some plan to go against mine, but I'm not. I got handed the job of defending surveillance cameras and why they should be substantially increased. That is what I have to do, that is the burden of the pro. You would be cheating me if you decided to try to throw up smokescreens to the resolution. But nevertheless, you still try to uphold this counter-plan and whether or not the judge accepts or not, I have efficiently beaten it. Moving on to my case\u2026.. Off his attacks on my 1st contention: Surveillance do accomplish safety (dependable or trustworthiness), because they can view the whole store, the camera does not lie, it doesn't hold grudges, it doesn't have emotions, like a guard would, and a camera can only show the truth. Since it can only reveal and show the truth that makes it both dependable and trustworthy. Off his attacks on my 2nd contention: Of course cameras can't physically stop people. But the people assigned to watch the cameras can either stop them, they can call a manager, or call the police to take action. He pulls through his money totals, but I've shown why I win of those two. Plus, I like to point out that I don't ever have to get rid of security guards. He wants to get rid of surveillance cameras and only have security guards. But you see, the pro doesn't have to get rid of anything, by substantially increasing surveillance cameras, I don't get rid of anything. Because in the end, I can have my cake and eat it too, whereas he can't. Off his attacks on my 3rd contention: Increasing implies getting more, so I'm trying to avoid that I'm trying to get more surveillance cameras. But since he offers no dictionary source for substantial and he previously agreed with mine earlier, my definition is still upheld as the one in this round. I will answer all of your questions in my voting issues right now. Voting Issues: Why the number of cameras now isn't working, how to fix it, and how it will impact the company/place in a positive way? (I don't of course have numbers for each public place, but I can tell this is talking about a general impact, and by increasing the number of cameras I potentially insure the three Ss more.) Why should this happen? (Because more surveillance cameras can bring more safety, security, and stability to society as I've explained throughout this debate round.) How is this going to help? (By installing more cameras, more criminals are caught, less shoplifting will happen, and it will make people behave in a more civilized and un-criminal manner in public areas) How is this the best solution? (The resolution never specifies that I have to offer the best solution in the debate, but rather asks the question should this happen, as in\u2026is this a good thing. And yes, I do believe substantially increasing the number of surveillance cameras is good for society. More so, you're trying to compare guards to cameras again, but once again, that shouldn't be the debate, but even if it was I provide why cameras are better, but as I said before the Pro doesn't have to get rid of guards, I can have both them and cameras. But the Con's plan is essentially asking to eliminate cameras, and have the guards. So that's just another reason on top of the effectiveness and the cost that I win that part of the debate.) CLOSING STATEMENT: I truly do believe you must vote pro, I win the round at it's pure core, and I win it even with his counterplan. I urge the judges to look at the arguments and see that the Pro does win the round. I thank my opponent for what has been a very enjoyable round.",

            "discussionTitle": "There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law",
            "conclusion": "There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law",
            "premise": "Alright, time to finish this. === 1. My opponent has interpreted my definition of freedom as 'Might makes right.' This is a little bit inaccurate - I am simply stating that the freedoms a person has are related to their ability to do things. It doesn't necessarily make right. What I mean by this is that freedom is not inherently good or bad. My opponent's first point was that these laws take away freedom - I am simply saying \"So what? That does not have any implications on its own.\" Let me give an example that might be more easy to see with. Bob is a would-be murderer. He approaches a friend of his, venting his frustration: Bob: Bah! Anti-murder laws should not exist. Friend: Why's that? Bob: Because they take away my freedom to kill people. Do you see what Bob has just done? He is begging the question. These laws are supposed to take away freedom. For Bob's argument to be valid, he would first have to independently show that people should actually have the freedom to murder one another. You see, it is the same with this debate we are having now. With the other three points, we will find that either people should have the right to not wear a seatbelt without violating the law, or we will find that people should not have the freedom to not wear a seatbelt without violating the law. I believe I have sufficiently shown that this point has no significance of its own - whoever wins the rest of the debate wins this point. We can see another example of this begging the question in my opponent's third round: \"What it comes down to is if the person stood up for what was right and died, or did the person die because they submitted to an unjust law?\" This is assuming right away that the law is unjust, but that is pretty much exactly what we are debating. My opponent also brings up a quote I failed to address in a previous round: \"A person is involved in an accident and they survive the crash ... because they were not wearing a seat belt, then they must ... be cited\" This is technically true, but it doesn't mean anything in practice. While seatbelts are mandatory by law, police officers have the ability to enforce or not to enforce the law, depending on the circumstances. Further, the cop will not be able to know whether or not a person was wearing a seatbelt while actually driving. And further, I did address my opponent's above statement - it just wasn't as direct as he must have wanted. I stated that laws are NOT made so that every single thing will always be perfect, they are made so that OVERALL, society will benefit. Sure, there will be times when laws do not make sense, exceptions if you will. However, we keep these laws around because despite their flaws, they serve a useful purpose. In the case of seatbelt laws, they save lives. And lastly on this point, we have one more fallacious statement: \"This is not supposed to be a socialist country, but rather a constitutional republic which protects individual's (emphasis added) rights and freedoms.\" Is it? My opponent certainly hasn't shown that it is, he's just assuming it is, because that lets him jump to his desired conclusion. === 2. I never said that revenue generation is not a consideration at all for seat belt laws. In fact, it is one of the reasons why seat belt laws should remain. To say that these laws should not exist requires an advocacy - it requires that someone change things - those someones would be state lawmakers in this case. These lawmakers not only want to protect their constituents, but they also want to ensure the strength of their government. Seat belt laws actually fulfill BOTH of these wants! Legislators have no substantial legitimate reason to get rid of these laws, thus the laws should remain. However, it is obvious that revenue generation is not the primary reason for seat belt laws. They are simply a positive secondary side effect thereof. This is evidenced by the fact that in most states, police cannot stop you solely for not wearing a seatbelt. This reduces the revenues a state can reap from the law, if they did want to harvest money from it. Also, remember that even with these restrictions, the law states that seatbelts are mandatory. === 3. My opponent points out that in one of my sources, the fine for adults who break the law is $10, while the fine for minors is $51.50. He assumes that this is because 'they' feel guilty enforcing it. First off, I'll point out that legislators make the law, and police officers enforce it. Police officers do not determine the fines, so the guilt they have enforcing it cannot possibly affect the fines. Let me conjure up a separate explanation: money is a bigger problem for minors than it is for adults. Paying a small fine like $50 isn't too bad for an adult with a good-paying job - the real incentive to wear a seatbelt for this age group comes from the trouble one must go through when given a citation. Further, minors are still forming their driving habits, so it is much more important to get them to wear seatbelts. My opponent also brings up a supposed Police Officer he knows who refuses to uphold the law. That is only a testament to the hidden flexibility of a mandatory seat belt law. Sure, the law might make it mandatory that seatbelts be worn, but cops don't have to enforce it all the time. In fact, if all cops were like my opponent's supposed acquaintance, then my opponent would have nothing to complain about. In fact, it accomplishes the same thing as his advocacy, removing the laws, except is saves us the trouble of actually removing the laws - therefore, it is a superior advocacy, assuming the goals my opponent seeks are worthwhile. My opponent then reveals the real reason he opposes seatbelt laws - a personal experience. My opponent was in an accident, and he didn't wear a seatbelt, and he walked away uninjured. My opponent must be making a very hasty generalization, I assume - to advocate that therefore seatbelts don't help increase safety overall. In fact, the facts bear me out on it - seatbelt-wearing people die half as often in crashes as non-seatbelt wearing people. I have already given the source for this, and it has not been contested. === 4. My opponent admits that it is impossible to know which type of accident you will be in. However, from this, he somehow concludes that each person should decide whether or not to wear a seatbelt. That makes little sense - if individuals have no information about which type of accident they might get into, they are quite unqualified to make that decision. Here is something we DO know, though. When we consider all accidents on average, wearing a seatbelt is half as likely to kill you as not wearing a seatbelt. This is not a statistic concerned with individual accidents, it is a comprehensive statistic including all accidents. Fortunately, we have a body that can make decisions on this same scope - the government. We know that overall, in all accidents, seatbelts increase safety. Therefore, on this same scope, we have each person wear a seatbelt. Let me give an example to make the point more clearly, before this is all over. Let us say that there are two different games in a casino. Game A has odds that will, on average, provide you with twice the winnings of Game B. It is optimal, therefore, to play Game A with all of your money, and not play Game B at all. You see, the Government is the one playing in this casino, and we are its money. Of course, unlike money, we are autonomous decision makers. However, even with autonomous decision-making money, it would be best to at least try to make your money go towards Game A rather than Game B. That is exactly what the government is doing. One last thing before I go: my opponent left me with a link to supposed statistics at the end of his R3. The link is a 404 - the page is not found - at least at the time of this writing. I thank everyone who read, and I thank my opponent for having this debate",

            "premise": "Counter-Plan Text: The United States will initialize civilian oversight to determine justice in cases of qualified immunity. Meltzer \u201814[1] \"the current ... qualified immunity doctrine ... permits the use of nonjudicial statements of law in the qualified immunity analysis but impliedly demands it as a practical matter for continued constitutional \u2026 norm generation \u2026 qualified immunity \u2026 is rooted in considerations of notice, fairness, and culpability, the proposal rests on the premise that findings of external oversight bodies serve the same purpose and bear many of the same characteristics\u2014as \u2026 sources of law cited by the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts in qualified immunity rulings \u2026 the findings of oversight bodies should be entitled to at least the same weight in the qualified immunity analysis as internal police regulations and advisory reports \u2026 where binding case law supports the existence of the right asserted by the plaintiff, an oversight finding can serve as additional evidence of notice or culpability, similar to the ATF directive in Groh and the ADOC regulation and DOJ report in Hope. \u2026 where binding case law is conflicting, an oversight finding can serve as a tiebreaker\u2014occupying a space somewhere between an internal policy statement and a persuasive judicial opinion. \u2026 where no binding case law exists on point and persuasive case law is either supportive or conflicting, an oversight finding can serve as a tiebreaker with a thumb on the scale in favor of recognizing the right in question\u2014situating the finding closer to a binding judicial opinion. \u2026 oversight bodies should formalize and publicize all of their merits findings.\" This solves for unjustified qualified immunity claims, which solves for the entirely of the harms from the Aff. The board takes things out of the hands of the courts and thoroughly review each case with unbiased standpoints. Meltzer \u201814[1] \"Civilian oversight represents a critical component of the patchwork of police regulation in the [US]. Given the limited effect of constitutional criminal procedure,the problems inherent in internal police oversight mechanisms and the ... barriers to ... criminal \u2026 sanctions on individual police officers \u2026 external oversight bodies reach police conduct that might otherwise escape reproach. \u2026 civilian oversight agencies play a vital role in developing the law of the police by addressing legal claims silenced by settlement in the civil arena. ... civilian oversight ... involves participation by persons who are not sworn officers (citizens) in the review of citizen complaints against the police and/or other allegations of misconduct by police officers. ... Civilian external supervisory bodies ... examine the investigations conducted by internal police investigative units. ... investigatory agencies \u201cembody a criminal trial model of citizen oversight.\u201d Investigations are directed at determining guilt or innocence in a discrete case and are governed by \u201celaborate rules of procedure designed to protect the rights of accused officers.\u201d ... investigations are highly fact intensive, requiring the collection of testimonial, physical, and documentary evidence akin to what might be seen in a criminal or civil trial. ... the investigative findings of oversight bodies resemble the sources of law that may support a ruling on qualified immunity. ... unlike civilian in-house oversight bodies, civilian external investigatory bodies are entirely independent from the departments they regulate. This separation confers a presumption of neutrality\u2014and ... legitimacy\u2014on their investigative findings. ... by virtue of the novel factual scenarios they routinely encounter in the course of their investigations, civilian external investigatory bodies are constantly engaged in constitutional-norm generation. ... for qualified immunity purposes. ... the Court has endorsed the use of various forms of nondecisional law to demonstrate the sort of fair notice and culpability required to justify imposing individual \u00a7 1983 liability on a government agent.\" Meltzer \u201814[1] continues, \"the Supreme Court ... never set forth a categorical rule demarcating ... sources of law that may clearly establish the relevant law to a reasonable official for the purposes of qualified immunity. ... The Court ... indicated ... willingness to consider nondecisional law in the modern qualified immunity inquiry in Wilson v. Layne. ... As this weight of authority indicates, the federal courts have reserved space for nonjudicial statements of the law to contribute to the qualified immunity analysis. Such sources of law are increasingly important in the post-Saucier era, as courts are now accorded largely unfettered discretion to reach the merits of constitutional tort claims. It is in this context that the work of civilian external investigatory oversight bodies constitutes an essential\u2014albeit untapped\u2014resource for constitutional articulation. .... By engaging in fact-finding, legal research, objective evaluation of compliance with internal regulations, and, sometimes, policy review, civilian external investigatory oversight bodies mirror the work of courts and compliance agencies and serve a function similar to the internal policies and regulations cited by the federal courts. \u2026\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now to respond to the Aff. As an overview to the AC: First, Jurisdictions just indemnify officers. They don\u2019t have to pay anything - this kills any incentive to stop doing the harms in the aff. Schwartz \u201814[2] \"indemnification of officers is virtually certain and universal. During the six-year period across the 81 jurisdictions, there were over 9,200 civil rights cases in which plaintiffs received payments. The total awarded was over $730 million, but there were just 37 to 39 cases in which officers contributed something. When they contributed, it was a rather small amount. The median payment was just over $2,000 by officers per case. ... No officer paid more than $25,000 in any case. ... Those findings amazed me, but what I found particularly amazing was jurisdictions indemnified officers for punitive damages. ... I found 20 cases ... in which a jury had awarded punitive damages ... In many instances those awards were reduced by the courts, often based on argument by defense counsel that the punitive damages awarded would be a financial hardship for the individual officer\u2013but not one officer paid a nickel toward any of those punitive damages. They were either indemnified, paid by the cities and counties that employed them, or the cities and counties entered into some post-trial settlement that waived the punitive damages judgment, and essentially the city paid the entirety of the settlement ... There are cases in which officers planted evidence. ... Officers went to prison for between five and 10 years for their conduct, but they were indemnified in the civil case. \u2026\" Second, limiting QI is counterproductive - QI allows cops to do their jobs better. Coates \u201812[3] \"Qualified immunity balances \u201cthe need to hold public officials accountable ... and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.\u201d ... qualified immunity assumes that \u201cit is better to risk some error and possible injury . . . than not to . . . act at all. ... qualified immunity \u201cgives ... breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments\u201d \u2026\" Third, Courts have ruled that police have no specific obligation to the people - this means that a lack of QI will lead to police being bystanders to horrific crimes. This means that by limiting QI we make the harms listed by the Aff worse. Only negating solves. Eyre \u201813[4] \"If you pay for a good or service, don\u2019t you expect some benefit in return? ... Such deliverables \u2013 the supply of a good or service paid for, or even adequate customer service, are entirely void from policing as it\u2019s currently structured. Not only are police \u201ccustomers\u201d told to pay \u201cor else\u201d ... courts ... have ruled that police employees have no obligation to provide you \u2026 any good or service. ... \u201cWhen the news was brought to my attention that police had an opportunity to intervene and maybe prevent the whole incident, and it was explained to me they chose to stay in the motorman\u2019s compartment instead of coming out, I was very upset.\u201d Lozito sued for negligence, but city lawyers say his demand for unspecified money damages should be tossed because the police had no \u201cspecial duty\u201d to protect him or any individual ...\" Sources: [1] - http://www.texaslrev.com...

            "premise": "1. How it worksI'm not from the U.S. so correct me if I'm wrong but these US providers of traffic lights from what you say seem to be like the Private Parking Companies in the U.K. such as \"UK Parking Control - UKPC\" who issue tickets on privately owned land even though they are not backed explicitly by law (a grey area of law), and because many people can't tell whether they were issued by the council or police they often believe they must pay. Such companies can make millions each year by managing one or two car parks, and are often called cowboys because they wait to pounce on someone for leaving their car unattended for a second even to help someone who's collapsed [1]. Should you pay speeding, red light fines or any other fine if you don't have to? I don't believe you should pay if you are tricked in some way, or given a ticket unfairly. But I suspect the US providers of red light and speed cameras are not as shifty as you make them out to be. I have taken the following extract from a source of yours:\"Overall, people like them: In a 2011 poll conducted by the insurance institute, two-thirds of drivers in 14 big cities with cameras expressed support for them. And last November, voters in Longview, Wash., and Pohatcong, N.J., rejected ballot measures to remove the cameras\" [2]The cameras are not just a revenue raiser, they reduce the number of serious accidents, though it should be noted an increased number of accidents have occured due to drivers braking harshly to avoid getting a ticket. However furthur extracts below from the same source as above show the cameras are managed in a fair way.\"State legislation typically sets the ground rules for the use of the cameras, and then cities negotiate the specifics of the deal with the camera vendors. The vendors, which include American Traffic Solutions and Redflex Traffic Systems, install the cameras and generally charge communities a flat fee for camera rental each month\"\"The camera shoots video of the offender and sends it to analysts at the camera company for closer examination. If the analysts think the situation merits a ticket, they forward the video to local law enforcement agents, who review it again. Law enforcement officers have the final say about whether or not a driver receives a ticket\"If you are captured breaking the law on a video belonging to an official provider, which you can even view after committing an offence, you should pay. There is no good reason why someone other than an emergency vehicle should go through a red light. Drivers have a responsibility to keep their self safe, their passengers safe and other drivers safe via being medically and physically fit, not being distracted and not exceeding the speed limit etc. Apparently the yellow light have been shortened to increase violations and profit at the expense of causing more accidents. But on roads with limits of 25mph they last for 3 seconds, and at 55mphlimits they last for 5 seconds, see extract belowYellow light times will be increased from 3 seconds to 3.4 seconds on roads with speed limits of 25 miles per hour and increased from 5 to 5.5 seconds on roads with speed limits of 55 miles per hour. [2]I've done some smple caluclations, when travelling at 25mph (11.176m per sec) your car will travel 33.53m in 3 seconds. Your overall stopping will be between 12m and 23m (20mph - 30mph). When travelling at 55mph (24.59m per sec) your car will travel 122.94m in 5 seconds. Your overall stopping distance will be between 53m and 73m (50mph - 60mph). So, if you drove at a speed that allows you stop within the distance you can see to be clear and only go on at a yellow light if it appears after you have crossed the stop line or when you are so close to it that stopping might cause an accident, you wouldn't have a ticket, or an accident. Since you have recieved a ticket which you say was due to driving too fast then you have not taken responsibility and should pay. 2. Reasons you don't respond to these tickets The people who decide whether you should have a ticket or not after reviewing the video or photos will know if you've not paidbecause it will be held on a computer, and I'm sure you will recieve a number of letters or phonecalls reminding you if you haven't. Also video/photo evidence is reliable, and is reviewed by the police. I don't believe someone should not pay just because someone else could take their car, get caught on camera speeding and return the car, as people should be responsible for their own car but anyway this is not something that happened to you as you say you sped.The time length of yellow lights is being increased, and red light cameras are being removed in areas where low violations occured before the installations due to causing more accidents. This shows that safety is their main concern.3. SafetyThough more accidents have occured when red light cameras have been introduced, it is due to drivers inability to anticipate, and drive at an appropiate speed, so they are having to make split second decisions to brake or not at interesctions with lights designed for the speed limit, which is something they wouldn't need to do if they simply followed the law. If you accidentally go through a red light due to being tired, upset, angry, feeling unwell, distracted by kids in the back seat etc then you should have taken measures to prevent that. Unfortunately I can't read the letter my oppoent has provided as the writing is too small, I ask my opponent to provide a link to this. It would be great to read what it says about a formula to ensure motorist safety and adequate time to stop safely. I'd like to know why you think \"traffic cams violate physics which must be there to actually prove you were speeding, as seen in the letter\"Con does explain that it unlikely for anyone to be punished if they choose to ignore a speeding fine and this is a reason for not paying, but I believe that if you make a mistake you should pay for it, because if you don't accept you've done something seriously wrong like running a red light then you may end up killing yourself, killing others, or injurying yourself or others. Since the cameras operate fairly, there is no good reason not to pay.sources:[1] http://www.parkingcowboys.co.uk...[2] http://www.usatoday.com...",

            "premise": "Argument #1 My opponent claims \"you need to remember those rule's it\u2019s the law there is not excuse it\u2019s for everybody\u2019s safety.\"I'd like to quote Benjamin Franklin:\u201cThose who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety\u201dThe cameras were intended for people who go through red lights. Now they are being abused and used for other violations.This is all about money and nothing to do with safety.The cameras, according to a study, actually cause more accidents.http://www.motorists.org...Argument #2My opponent wants to claim that the cameras are for: Safety for you and other\u2019s Another income for the government to pay for everything other\u2019s wreak while running a red light\u2019s I doubt very much that they are for safety, since it's been proved that cameras cause more accidentshttp://www.nj.com...Also, car insurance is what pays for car wrecks, not government. The money the government collects on tickets goes intheir pockets and could be used for anything.My opponent claims, \"Now you may oppose this idea but if you were to take every Red-light camera down and let the traffic go wild, you would surely see that there would be 10 times more crashes then there would be if there were not red-light camera\u2019s.\"Where's the evidence for that? Studies show that the cameras actually cause more accidents to happen.http://watchdogwire.com...Argument #3My opponent claims \"How can you possibly assume there is going to be black boxes\u2019 in car\u2019s there is no way this is going to happen.\"It's already happening.http://www.npr.org...My opponent claims, \" 99% of the time the government can be trusted in that section but not any other sections.\"Where's the evidence for that? That sounds made up.Argument #4My opponent describes what can happen when you drive recklessly. That has nothing to do with red light cameras. It's just a red herring.Conclusion:Red light cameras are there for generating money for the government, which my opponent admits to.They do nothing for safety, since studies prove they cause more accidents.They also violate our Constitutional rights to face our accusers in court. This is why red light cameras need to go. Thank you for the debate",
