            "premise": "Even though my opponent forfeited, I'll still see what I can pick apart from her arguments.Notice that not once throughout my opponent's main arguments did she ever distinguish between a church and a non-profit organization. In that light, she also failed to provide you a single reason to vote Pro.As I said in my opening argument, churches are like non-profit organizations, which provide benefits to the community as a whole without being taxed for it. My opponent didn't even try to argue against this in her opening argument, possibly because she, as well as I, acknowledge all of the good that can come out of a local church.The problem with my opponent's case is that she doesn't realize that taxing a church will simply discourage it from providing these benefits to the community. People who work at churches or even people who volunteer are already taxed at an individual level. This poses a problem for taxing the churches, as Professor Dean Kelly writes in his book \"To tax them again for participation in voluntary organizations from which they derive no monetary gain would be \u2018double taxation\u2019 indeed, and would effectively serve to discourage them from devoting time, money, and energy to organizations which contribute to the upbuilding of the fabric of democracy.\"[1] And what does this mean? If churches spend less time helping the community, who picks up the slack? Either the government does so, which ultimately means more taxes for all of us, or nobody picks it up at all. Both situations are undesirable and completely avoidable by not taxing churches in the first place.Looking at my opponent's arguments, all I can really see are complaints about what the churches have. So what if churches own land? So what if they have facilities on this land? Pro hasn't given you a single reason as to why these are even bad things, except for that some people feel like they can't use those facilities.The last sentence the Pro says is the most fallacious of all: \"Religious affiliations only remain tax-exempt if the government sees the religion as legitimate.\" Looking at my opening argument, you can see this is blatantly false. The IRS outlines specific guidelines that the church must follow in order for it to remain tax exempt. Believe it or not, there ARE churches that are not tax-exempt, because they choose not to follow those guidelines. But what my opponent said about churches \"making millions\" was REALLY true (and we have no reason to believe this without a proper citation), they wouldn't qualify for tax-exemption in the first place.Thus, this resolution has been negated.Citations(s):1. http://www.opposingviews.com...",

You are saying that assuming churches serve the general welfare of the population, and the IRS lists churches as serving the welfare of the population, then they should not be taxed. This is based on assumptions which I will now tackle. Churches claim to offer some benefit towards the welfare of the population, but most churches, specifically the Catholic Church, run like a business. They have outlets in every country, they provide advice, morality and salvation to their customers and even have competition from other religious businesses. These religions often require tithes from their members, which provides income for the church. Religions are business as much as any other corporation. Next up, there are clear benefits to taxing the church. If we were to tax the churches, we would make 71,000,000,000 Dollars annually, and that's only in America. http://taxthechurches.org... http://churchesandtaxes.procon.org... Churches make more than most businesses on the planet, and yet are able to use the claim that they benefit the welfare of the people to remain tax exempt. Saying \"if the law says it's right, then it must be right, this is legal, so it too, must be right\" doesn't cut it. Anything that claims to \"benefit the welfare of the people should then be exempt;\" doctors, civil servants, anyone who helps others. This only means that the laws need to be changed.

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting this debate, I will first lay down my points of why I am pro, I would like you do to the same for con, before countering my argument. Assuming Churches count as NPO(non-profit organisations) they should be taxed in the same ways. All other organizations (like corporations, including non-profits) pay taxes on everything, profits, franchise tax, business license tax, property tax, payroll tax. Churches are often a big part of communities in America, they typically use a lot of the communities resources, occupying large areas of land and real estate that they do not have to pay tax on. The amount of property owned by churches is vast compare to any other single co-operation, if the churches were to pay only this tax alone the personal property taxes you and I pay would go down considerably, many tons and cities property tax rates would drop and lets be honest, the government would have a LOT more income. Not only are churches using vast amounts of land they are not paying tax for, they also use the services paid for by tax payers, why is it fair churches get the same treatment by police, fire departments and schools that us ta payers do, when they provide nothing towards it? However you may claim churches to be non-profit, they still collect money and revenue in many forms, donations, events, fund-raisers, trips, selling merchandise (whether they pay sales tax on this I am not sure, I think it may vary church-to-church and depending on the merchandise) at the end of the day, successful churches such as those run by the Baptists and Catholics make millions, many churches in my area have their own gyms, libraries, day cares and swimming pools, they also seem to afford excessive trips and camps. Where does all this money come from and why is none of it going back into the economy? You may claim that it is being put to good use for the churchgoers to use these facilities, but what about atheists like me, or people from non-Christian organisations? Religious affiliations only remain tax-exempt if the government sees the religion as legitimate. At the end of the day everyone would benefit from Churches paying tax; they are such a huge part of the American society and the gain a lot of revenue (whether they are meant to or not!) Every other organisation has to claim their earnings, there is no reason churches should be exempt.",

            "premise": "I thank Zwatt for the opportunity to debate this topic. Since my opponent has made opening round arguments, this gives me licence to open with arguments, too. I am going, at least initially, to use the United States as an example of why churches should not pay taxes. Negation Case A1: The First Amendment In the United States, \u201cthe First Amendment prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances\u201d [1]. It would violate the U.S constitution to infringe upon the free exercise of religion. It would also violate the right to freedom of expression (freedom of speech) in that the government could shut down or reprimand a church that defaults on their payments, which would not allow them freedom to expression. In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the US Supreme Court found this very conclusion to be the just one: \u201cthe power to tax involves the power to destroy\u201d [3]. Violating the constitution strips humans of their basic human rights, which are natural and require good arguments to explain why they should be infringed upon. A2: Churches are not-for-profit Not-for-profit organisations are not taxed because they are not charging for a service. You can attend your local church, receive a service and not pay a dime. Yes, there are collection bowls, but you are not required to give anything, unlike a business wherein you will not be served if you do not pay. So, my opponent\u2019s claims of \u201creligion in general is a multi-billion dollar business\u201d is incorrect, for religion does not register as a business. Religion meets the \u2018tax-exemption\u2019 requirements of 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and hence classifies as a not-for-profit organisation [2]. Therefore, taxing churches would violate this religious legislation which exists to protect not-for-profit organisations since not-for-profit organisations contribute to the public\u2019s wellbeing without charging a price. What my opponent is suggesting is equivalent to taxing charities which also fall under the tax exemption of 501 (c)(3). A3: Disadvantaged and poor people rely on assistance from churches If churches were to be taxed, churches would suffer according to Vincent Becker (Monignor at the Immaculate Conception Church in Wellsville, \u201c[his church] base[s] all the things that we do on the fact that we do not have to pay taxes on the buildings\u201d [4]. In effect, what this will mean is that the once charitable services performed by the churches would now be eliminated or delegated to local governments. A4: Church members who donate will be taxed twice First, there will be an initial income taxing for the members, Then, the money that is donated will be taxed again the church is taxed. Why is it fair to tax these institutions twice? A5: Small churches will suffer greatly A survey, undertaken in 2010, found that \u201ccongregations facing financial strain more than doubled to almost 20% in the past decade, with 5% of congregations unlikely to recover\u201d [5]. If churches were forced to pay taxes on top of that, a lot of church\u2019s existences would be threatened [7]. Counter-Arguments \u201cYes, of course all churches should pay taxes, there is no legitimate reason why churches should be exempt from taxes\u201d Here, my opponent has committed a Negative Proof Fallacy, in which he shifts the burden of proof onto the people who should be negating [6]. Seeing that he is to affirm, he is the one to give reasons why \u201cchurches should pay taxes\u201d (i.e. the resolution). To put this into perspective, it would be like him asking me to disprove that pink unicorns exist (his effective words: show why churches should not be taxed), and if I cannot, then pink unicorns exist (his words: \u201cthere is no legitimate reason\u201d). \u201c\u2026just because you claim religious belief does not mean you are exempt from taxes so why should a church be exempt.\u201d As shown earlier, churches are exempt due to not-for-profit status, not due to \u201cclaim[ing] religious belief\u201d. \u201cReligion in general is a multi billion dollar business the only difference between a corporation and a church is we tax a church.\u201d As shown earlier, religions are not businesses.

            "premise": "It seems my opponent has failed to provide any form of rebuttal against my arguments. Very well, I will proceed. I. Property TaxThe Walz decision The U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of 8-1, upheld the tax exemption of churches in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970). Walz, a self-described Christian who did not belong to any church and owned real estate in Richmond County, N.Y., sued the tax committee over property tax exemption for churches. Walz claimed he and other taxpayers were forced to indirectly subsidize churches.The majority decision, written by Chief Justice Burger, held that the tax exempt status granted to all houses of worship is the same privilege given to other nonprofits organizations:\"The legislative purpose of a property tax exemption is neither the advancement nor the inhibition of religion; it is neither sponsorship nor hostility. New York, in common with the other States, has determined that certain entities that exist in a harmonious relationship to the community at large, and that foster its 'moral or mental improvement,' should not be inhibited in their activities by property taxation or the hazard of loss of those properties for non payment of taxes. It [397 U.S. 664 , 673] has not singled out one particular church or religious group or even churches as such; rather, it has granted exemption to all houses of religious worship within a broad class of property owned by nonprofit, quasi-public corporations which include hospitals, libraries, playgrounds, scientific, professional, historical, and patriotic groups. Source: http://ffrf.org...Importantly, my opponent failed to inform the audience that the so-called luxury home was built using the pastors personal money that he earned from book sales and paid personal appearances around the world. The pastor himself is known as a \"rock star\" of the community with a congregation of roughly 14,000 every week. Furthermore, even though his private home has absolutely nothing to do with the property tax exemption argument my opponent is trying to make, his church has contributed over ten million dollars to the community. This is all within the last eight years. Not only does the amount of ten million dollars in eight years dwarf the amount my opponent is trying to use as an argument, but it also is far more than that community would have received via government spending going-back-to-the-community.Source: http://www.wcnc.com...II. Sales TaxA sales tax is something that can be avoided by most non-profit organizations, not just churches. So to claim \"avoiding\" a sales tax as necessarily a bad thing, perhaps we should also be targeting the boy/girl scouts, or the local gardening club or even our local charity fundraisers. Furthermore, sales tax exemption is a very fine line usually defined on the State level of politics. This implies that your math is incorrect in the sense that not only is your portrayal of an 8.25% sale tax something that isn't verifiable without sources but also that not every state permits every church sales tax exemption. Furthermore, while churches might be exempt from sales taxes in certain states - depending on their legal status, they might be subject to paying a \"franchise\" tax. Thus, in reality, churches aren't always as 'tax-free' as my opponent is implying.III. Capital Gains Tax Once again, my opponent made the mistake of attempting to claim that when churches sell 'stuff' they don't pay capital gains tax. This tax law has several exceptions that even require churches to pay taxes in certain situation. For clarification on those situations I have provided some information: Property used for exempt purposes. Any gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property used for the exempt purposes of the foundation is not included in figuring the tax on net investment income. If the foundation uses property for its exempt purposes, but also inci\u00addentally receives income from the property that is subject to the net investment income tax, any gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of the property would not be subject to the tax. For example, if a tax-exempt private foundation maintains historic buildings that are open for public inspection, but it requires a number of employees to live in these buildings and charges rent, the rent is subject to the tax on net invest\u00adment income, but any gain or loss resulting from the sale of these buildings is not subject to the tax. However, if a private foundation uses prop\u00aderty both for exempt purposes and (other than incidentally) for investment purposes, (for exam\u00adple, a building in which the foundation\u2019s charita\u00adble and investment activities are carried on) that part of the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of the property that is allocable to the investment use of the property must be taken into account in figuring the tax on net investment income. Source: http://www.irs.gov...Considering that the mall leases space to for-profit companies such as Forever 21, they will not be exempt from capital gains tax. The only real point my opponent can make in the case of the mall is that it was built property tax free, but as with the previous example - the money returned to the local community by the church itself has far outweighed the money 'lost' by tax exemptions. IV. Absolute claims made by OpponentIn closing, my opponent made the bold statement: Churches do not have to account for where their money is spent, unlike any other organization. Blatantly, churches are given extra brakes and exemptions that no other organization is offered.This is far from accurate. As I have shown above, it is not just churches that do not have to account for where their money is spent - but rather, most non-profit organizations enjoy the same benefits of tax-exempt status as churches. The claim made by my opponent is baseless and completely false. While I can agree with my opponent that separation of church and state does not mean churches should go unchecked, it most certainly means that church and state are to remain separated. By allowing the taxation of churches we are doing nothing more than removing that degree of separation that has been necessary to maintain the balance between the two dominating forces. What history has proven, if anything, is that cycles of the past are unknowingly repeated - we must not allow that to happen once more. My only hope is that, once again, I have not failed in reflecting the importance of keeping churches tax free, and ultimately - free from external influence or governance.",

            "premise": "Background informationIn order to understand why churches should be tax exempt, we must first outline which taxes that churches already pay, and which taxes they do not.In what way are churches tax exempt?1) Federal income taxAccording to the IRS, [1] \"Churches and religious organizations, like many other charitable organizations, qualify for exemption from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3) and are generally eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions.\"For this to occur, the church must meet ALL of the following criteria:\u25a0 the organization must be organized and operated exclusively for religious, educational, scientific, or other charitable purposes, \u25a0 net earnings may not inure to the benefit of any private individual or shareholder, \u25a0 no substantial part of its activity may be attempting to influence legislation, \u25a0 the organization may not intervene in political campaigns, and\u25a0 the organization\u2019s purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy2) Property taxChurches do not pay property tax under the legal precedent of Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970). The court upheld the tax exemption status for churches on a 8-1 decision. In defense of his decision, Justice Douglas quoted: \"We do not mean to say that religious groups and the press are free from all financial burdens of government. We have here something quite different, for example, from a tax on the income of one who engages in religious activities or a tax on property used or employed in connection with those activities. It is one thing to impose a tax on the income or property of a preacher. It is quite another thing to exact a tax from him for the privilege of delivering a sermon. State aid to places of worship, whether in the form of direct grants or tax exemption, takes us back to the Assessment Bill and the Remonstrance. The church qua church would not be entitled to that support from believers and from nonbelievers alike.\"[2]The court gave the following four reasons for their decision [3]:1. The First Amendment tolerates neither governmentally established religion nor governmental interference with religion.2. The legislative purpose of tax exemptions is not aimed at establishing, sponsoring, or supporting religion, and New York's legislation simply spares the exercise of religion from the burden of property taxation levied on private profit institutions.3. The tax exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, far less than taxation of churches would entail, and it restricts the fiscal relationship between them, thus tending to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other.4. Freedom from taxation for two centuries has not led to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, has helped to guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief.3) Other taxesChurches are also exempt from other minor state taxes, but seeing as this is on a state level, it would be too difficult to outline each and every one.Should churches be tax exempt?In short, yes. As you can see from what I have outlined above, churches and non-profit organizations pay the same taxes. This is because the same reasons that apply to non-profits also apply to churches as well.Churches are vastly known as a positive thing in the United States. An article in America Magazine defends this stance by saying: \"At least where most Catholic nonprofit organizations are concerned, I would say there should be hope: Catholic nonprofit organizations are second to none when it comes to predictably and reliably producing benefits for nonmembers, wider communities and the public at large.\"[4] Even as an atheist myself, I acknowledge that churches bring together a community of generally good people who want to do the right thing to please whatever God they worship. Although they are doing the right thing for the wrong reasons, it is still the right thing nonetheless. Putting a tax burden on these churches would be completely redundant because it would discourage future good work done by the churches, and diminish the amount and the quality of good work that a church community could accomplish, leaving that extra slack to be picked up by the government or not picked up at all.I acknowledge that there are negatives to allowing churches to be tax-exempt. If I had to, I would argue a more progressive approach by saying that churches should pay a little more than what they do now, but applying an extreme solution (such as abolishing the tax-exemption status entirely) to a minor problem (possible abuse of the system) will be both counter-productive and redundant.Thus, I negate.Citations:1. http://www.irs.gov...2. http://ffrf.org...3. http://supreme.justia.com...4. http://www.americamagazine.org...",

            "conclusion": "Debate: Churches ought to pay taxes",
            "premise": "The resolution of this debate can only be fulfilled by the government passing legislation. This is because taxation is inherently governmental. Governments, societies, individuals, and all other forms of entities, act (or ought to act) on a utilitarian basis: things that have more benefits than harms ought to be retained, whilst those that have more harms than benefits ought to be abolished. Goodness is determined by the ratio of desirability to undesirability. This is because every entity or being intrinsically seeks to maximize their desirable states (read: pleasure) and minimize their undesirable states (read: suffering.) Things that overall prevent suffering while promoting pleasure are thus good for that being. Because we know that other sentient beings undergo this as well, we can *empathize* with them and thus seek to extend the same principle (preventing suffering and promoting pleasure) to them. Without empathy morality cannot exist, it is contingent. Given that morality in and of itself is a system used to determine whether entities should or should not do something, morality can be used to determine whether a government should or should not make churches pay taxes. I find that the benefits of taxing churches outweigh the costs associated with it, and thus I affirm the resolution. The first way in which church tax exemption brings a societal cost is through the US government being forced to defend itself in lawsuits over tax exemption status to certain institutions (such as Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and other controversial faiths.) Lawsuits against government entities require that the government spend money in order to defend themselves against the lawsuit. The amount of money required to do this is enormous. For example, Texas has spent $3.5 million defending themselves against voter ID lawsuits [1]. This same issue happens over interpretation of tax exemption laws for churches. This can be seen in the Church of Scientology\u2019s numerous and year long lawsuits against the government wherein they can harness millions of dollars in funds; which the government then has to match. In the end, tax exemption law results in millions of dollars in lost money for the US government. My second argument is thus: churches are not like other (secular) not-for-profit charitable organizations. Churches\u2019 primary goal is in the practice and spread of their religion, rather than charity like other non-religious tax exempt charitable organizations. Research has found that around 29% of the average church\u2019s income is for charitable purposes, the rest is used for internal costs such as wages [2]. Other, secular charities though are able to do *more* good with their funds. For example, the Red Cross uses 92.1% of its income for helping people. A property tax on churches would raise around $71 billion dollars per year [3], while the commercial income tax would raise around $6.75 billion. (This is because the median congregation income is $60,000 [6], and thus the income tax bracket becomes $7,500 + 25% [8], meaning $22,500 payed in taxes per congregation. Given there are 300,000 congregations in America, that ends up being 6,750,000,000.) Reallocating money from churches, where only 29% of it would go to help people to secular charities where 92% of it will be used to help people, would be a massive impact on the effectiveness of charity. Significantly more people will be helped through charity. It is important to note the amount of money that $71 billion dollars is, as it is easy to just put it away as another number. $71 billion dollars is more than the top two wealthiest charities in the world combined [4]. Using all of this money for charity work rather than a fraction of it, as would happen without taxes, is a huge impact. Taxes on churches will also give more funds to local governments, and given that local governance is the most important government, the impact of this on people is substantial. Plus, George Washington said that, \u201cI agree with...Ha...yd\u2019s...argument that...churches\u2026should pay taxes.\u201d (1782) [10] Peace and Love [1] https://www.texastribune.org...

            "premise": "Preface: As my Opponent began the first round with arguments, I will assume I may use this round to post rebuttals and arguments of my own. Synopsis: The Resolution is interpreted to suggest that religious communities (the definition of \u201cChurch/Mosque/Synagogue\u201d being used) should pay Taxes, and not have tax exempt status. The word \u201cChurch\u201d will be used in substitution to all forms of related Religious Communities. Proposition I: Definitions Tax: A compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions. {1} Exempt: Free from an obligation or liability imposed on others {2} Endorsement: An act of giving one's public approval or support to someone or something. {3} Sources: 1} http://bit.ly... 2} http://bit.ly... 3} http://bit.ly... Proposition II: BOP will be on my Opponent, as he desires a change from the Status Quo, is Pro, and the instigator of the debate. Additionally, I claim that all money, being properly acquired, is exempt from tax until otherwise made compulsory. In this way, not being required to pay tax is the natural system, and therefore, Pro must show that there is a proper justification to extend taxation over a currently untaxed organization. Counter-Case I: Endorsement of Religion / Favouring Large Churches Counter: This is purely non sequitur. Allowing people to keep more of what is already theirs does not count as endorsing them. Rather, giving them money would count as Endorsement. They aren\u2019t being given money, they are keeping the money that was already theirs. It would be endorsement to give a different status to other religious communities. Which means all Religious communities would either need taxed, or exempt. My opponent referenced a SCOTUS decision, however it isn\u2019t sourced, so it can be disregarded, since no details are linked. Regardless, I will go ahead and point out that it is still an appeal to authority, and doesn\u2019t matter in a discussion on what we believe should/n\u2019t be done. Regardless of their decision, being allowed to keep more of your money is not the same as being given money. SCOTUS seems to speak from the position that our money is the government's money until we are told we can keep it. But that isn\u2019t how it works.The issue with Pros second claim is that it assumes removing tax exemption will somehow be more fair than allowing both Large and Small Churches to keep all their income. In truth, Larger churches are more easily capable of paying taxes, while Smaller Churches risk falling under and failing, in the same way that small business\u2019 are hurt more than large business\u2019. Whereas a similar tax rate will still allow large organizations enough income to accomplish their goals and obligations, it would leave smaller organizations a smaller income to do so, preventing growth. With that said, I will further point out that there is a break in the logic that says allowing two people to keep all their money benefits the richer more because he has more money to keep. Saying a wealthier organization makes more money, so we should take it, doesn\u2019t work. In actuality, giving a different tax liability to different Religious Organizations risk creating \u201cendorsement\u201d by forcing larger ones to pay more. Giving the same Liability endorses the larger ones by hurting smaller \u201ccompetitors\u201d. Conclusion:I have shown here that there is no endorsement or unfairness in giving the same tax exemption to all organizations of the same type. Rather the only way to avoid the government influencing religion is to keep Government out of Church coffers. Counter-Case II: Use of Tax Revenue. Counter: So? Firstly, I\u2019ll let Pro know that Blogs, which do not have links to direct sources, are not themselves sources. So Pro\u2019s first source is not valid. Regardless, it doesn\u2019t matter. We cannot simply justify increased taxation by the amount it will provide. Instead of sustaining increased spending with increased taxation, we must first work to decrease spending. Funneling the money into systems like the VA is a waste, as it is not an issue of money, but of structure and efficiency, like many other budgets. Other budgets are similarly well funded, but suffer from inefficiency and wasteful bureaucracy (Such as education, where we have one of the highest spending per students in the world {4/5/6}), or otherwise has dedicated revenue (SS is supported by largely by Pay Roll Tax {7/8}). And to say we could fund the Vietnam war is also a terrible thought. Taxing Charities to fund unpopular wars? Pro is listing how we can use the money, but I argue we should try to fix the problems that lead to the failure of these programs. Taxation from Churches look like a lot, but will not fix our problems. So we should try something that can. Streamline bureaucracy, modernize systems, and try to fix our financial problems by decreasing financial needs. If the systems are not able to be fixed without constantly increased taxation, then the system is broken and should be replaced. Pro sets a dangerous precedent of fixing problems by taking more money. I will lastly point out that Religious organizations are highly charitable (sourced in Case I below). Pro is wanting to take this charitable money, lose half of it in Bureaucracy, and use the rest for welfare. It will not help, but rather it will decrease national social assistance.Of course, this doesn\u2019t really matter, as the Churches will not pay taxes regardless of their religious status, as I will point out in my Case below.. Conclusion:Here it is shown that the notion that our budget should be fixed by increasing taxes is flawed and dangerous, and that the problem should be fixed from the expenditure end. If Pro had his way, our government could spend as much as they want, and simply charge us more for the right to exist, rather than taking responsibility for our money which they have forced us to hand over. Why should we be forced to give more and more to an irresponsible Robber Baron that won\u2019t at least try to minimize the costs? No, be accountable to our money, then we can talk about taking our holy dollars.

Case: Churches are Non-For-Profit / Funded by Donation. Thesis: I will prove here that removing the tax exempt status will not change anything, as Churches are inherently tax exempt through being Charitable organizations. Rationalization: Churches are non-for-profit. They are highly charitable {9, yes the source says the catholic church doesn\u2019t provide half of SA, but it does show they alone still provide a great portion}. The church's income largely goes to paying workers (like most Charities, which is subject to income tax), debt {like most Charities}, mortgage/rent {like most Charities}, maintenance {like most Charities}, and Bills {like most Charities}. The remainder is largely charitable or related to religious programs {10}. Like all Charities, they are inherently Tax-Exempt. I will point out that Churches must meet certain 501c3 requirements, such as not attempting to intervene in political campaigns. They may, under certain instances, be subject to UBIT Tax. {11} Churches are Charitable, and therefore tax exempt, even without their status as churches, as their non-administrative expenses deal with social aid, and religious expansion, rather than commercial or financial profit. {12} So even with removing the religious exemption, Churches will not be paying taxes anyhow. Pro would have to also support altering the 501c3 requirements, which risk forcing other non-religious charities to pay taxes, or otherwise to add in a clause preventing non-religious organizations from being class as Charities, which would be worse as that would become religious discrimination. Conclusion:Here I have successfully shown that Churches, being charitable organizations, would be tax exempt even barring religious exemptions. The impact of this coincides with Counter-Case II. Pro spoke of all the ways we can use Religious Taxes, but since these Churches, as charitable groups, will pay no tax anyhow, there will be no extra income for the inefficient social programs that Pro wants to support. All the effort of forcing through a controversial law to get the Churches taxed, and absolutely no increase in revenue. Sources: 9} Politifact: http://bit.ly... 10} http://bit.ly... 11} Score: http://bit.ly... 12} Investopedia: http://bit.ly... Closing Statement: My opponents arguments are basically that we should fix our fiscal problems by increasing taxes, rather than fixing the problems inherent in the current system. I rather suggest we fix the problems so that we need not increase taxes. Beyond this, Pro gives no other real argument because the non-sequitur that letting Groups keep their own money is the same as giving them money, when it is different on principle, and that tax exemptions benefit richer churches more, when in reality, taxation would hurt smaller churches more. Regardless of religious status, the sheer majority of these organizations are Charitable, and would not be taxable regardless. Any money taxed would be used less efficiently with the added layers of bureaucracy. I\u2019ll point out that there are major moral problems if money taxed from Church went to things (or freed other money to go to things) which are fundamentally against the Church\u2019s views.Lastly, I repeat myself, not for the last time this debate: The Budget should be fixed streamlining, removing redundant or aged programs/departments/regulations, and fighting wasteful/corrupt spending. Not by following the never ending policy of increased taxation, which will only reward their fiscal incompetence rather than force fiscal reform. {13/14} Sources: 13} Heritage:http://bit.ly... 14} The Hill:http://bit.ly... ==Unitomic==",

I ask the CON to please refrain from providing any rebuttals in the second round as it is for the formulation of case statements. I have no parameters for this debate, so I move on toward the iteration of my case: [Thesis]The exemption of churches in the case of taxation violates the First Amendment, contradicts the word of US law considering the nature of churches, and economically comprimises the US defecit. Henceforth, American churches should be taxed. [Contentions]Contention 1: Subsidizing religion violates the First Amendment.Subsidizing churches constitutes the establishment of a religion with consideration that American government is providing special protection and privilages to groups solely intended toward the practice of faith [1]. This action and the practice of it violates the Establishment clause, as shown below. Sub-point 1a: Purpose of the subsidization of churches includes the advancement of religion. The Internal Revenue Service explains the purposes of exemption of taxes in its Code Section 501(c)(3): \"The exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3) are charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals. The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.\" [2]Sub-point 1b: American governments are favoritist toward churches. The following presents an analysis on the guidelines from the Internal Revenue Service: \"Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive, and such favoritism is unconstitutional. While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return. \" [3]Contention 2: Tax exemption of churches is economically compromising.Constitutional arguments aside, tax exemption of churches is also economically compromising with consideration that the property taxes of such institutions can greatly reduce deficits. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. [4]Contention 3: The nature of churches warrants removal of tax exemptions according to American law. The removal of tax exemptions can be argued legally as well as constitutionally. Sub-point 3a: Many churches are political machines. The United States passed a law in 1954 explaining that institutions that are tax-exempted in no circumstances can support political candidates. \"Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes \"Pulpit Freedom Sunday,\" encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status.\" [5] [1] Robert H. Jackson, US Supreme Court dissenting opinion, Everson v.

Corn Exchange Bank, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it requires an extremely strong case to overturn a rooted historical practice. Therefore, the burden of proof is on my opponent to make such a case. 2. The bulk of my opponent's argument focuses on the first amendment, which forbids any law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" This prohibits direct state aid to religious institutions, but it does not prevent \"incidental\" aid which is neutral among sects. Thus, in Walz v. Tax Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned as follows: \"The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from demanding the church support the state.\" If churches are taxed, it would actually create an impermissible entanglement between church and state, as it would DEMAND every religious SUPPORT the state. This would be unconstitutional, as it would create a law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" It would also violate the Free Exercise clause, as it would challenge the religious view that religious institutions have tax-exempt status. The purpose of the first amendment is to establish religious liberty and to maintain neutrality among different (often opposed) religious groups. It is therefore imperative that churches are given tax-exempt status, as a tax on churches would violate the fundamental premises of the first amendment.",

I am an atheist, but whether or not any religion is true shall not be the topic being argued. For the sake of debate, we will assume that none of these religions or true, or that we cannot determine whether one is true. 5. This debate is not a debate about taxes in general. This is a debate over whether churches, which are largely exempt from taxes (some counties tax them and some don't., but most do not) should pay them. Namely the tax being discussed is property taxes, which most non-profit clubs (not charities. Charities are usually taxed the same as churches) must pay.

            "premise": "OK, First of all, I would like to thank leoley for accepting this debate and wish him good luck! It seems that he decided to start arguing from round 1-really no problem- so I have to start with the rebuttals:\"I think they should because it takes money to build the churches and it is important to keep it clean with the taxes you pay\" The main problem is that the money that all US citizens pay are not only used for building churches or keeping them clean. I hate to repeat the same things again and again so I advice you to read all the arguments (especially 7) and you'll relize why I support that. 1) Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions ofdollars in lost revenue, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economictimes:According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer,PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property.New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a \"megachurch\" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.[6] 2) Tax exemptions for churches violate the separation of church and state enshrined in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution:By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, government is supporting religion. Associate Justice of the US Supreme court, William O.Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: \"If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith\u2026I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional.\" [1]3)A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines: As Mark Twain argued: \"no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused.\" [2]4) A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion:William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court,declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): \"Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.\" [3]5) The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup \"faiths,\" which benefit at taxpayers' expense:In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in Schemes that \"exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one person,nonprofit religious corporations\" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend \"seminars.\"The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a \"thriving cult of greed and power\" and \"a hugely profitable global racket,\" was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this \"saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes.\" 6) Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government, so their tax exemptions are not justified:Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing. [5] 7) American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors, whose lavish \"megachurches\" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year: US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri. [7] 8) Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive, and such favoritism is unconstitutional: While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return. [8] 9) The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates: As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, \"when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place.\" [9]10) The \"parsonage exemption\" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense: The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000.In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment.Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage. [10]11) A tax exemption is not a right: Governments have traditionally granted this privilege to churches because of the positive contribution they are presumed to make to the community. If a church or other religious group wanted to receive tax exemptions because of the charitable work they do, should they be required to make a case for that rather than benefit from the presumption that religion equals charity? It makes much more sense to see tax exemptions as a way to encourage organizations which work for the public benefit rather than personal profit and a means by which taxpayers put themselves at a relative tax disadvantage in exchange for the benefits the organizations provide. What this means, however, is that it is possible for the government to deny tax exemptions to those groups which are not benefitting the public and/or which are working against a compelling public policy \u2014 and that may include churches or other religious organizations. Tax exemptions are not a right, they are a privilege which the government bestows based upon the nature of what a group is doing.[11] Sources:[1]http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com...[2] Mark Twain's Notebook,1935[3]https://supreme.justia.com...

            "premise": "Thanks, Hayd.Framework:I was extremely surprised to see Hayd go with a purely utilitarian framework and not make any arguments based on higher principles such as separation of church and state. This means that if I can prove that religion is on balance good, and that the resolution would harm religion in this country, I automatically win. Due to his framework, if religion is good than we should pursue policies that encourage religion. I. Religion is a social goodAccording to a Pew survey, Americans who attend religious services weekly are significantly more likely to maintain strong contacts with extended family, to report being \"very happy\" with their life, and to volunteer in their local community[1]. There is not a single metric rating positive life experience that Pew measured where the nonreligious came out on top. Religious people are 9% more likely to donate to charity than the nonreligious[2]. Religiosity is positively correlated with a number of positive health outcomes which is why a study from Duke Medical Center found that the religious had lower blood pressures[3]. A Harvard study recording the life outcomes of 75,000 women over a 20 year period found that religious women live longer lives than their nonreligious peers[4]. Remarkably, the effect was correlated with the degree of religiosity--the most religious women were 33% less likely to die than the nonreligious, but even those who infrequently attended services were 13% less likely to die than those who never attended. Even more remarkably, this conclusion was reached AFTER controlling for the observations that the more religious women were less likely to smoke or to be depressed. Again, because this warrants repeating, not only were the religious women less likely to report depression or to smoke, but they were STILL significantly less likely to die AFTER controlling for these facts (which alone would be impactful enough to win me the debate). Clearly religion is some powerful stuff. Why do these effects exist? The sense of community that a religious community offers is something that greatly benefits social animals like humans. Interestingly, the Duke study notes that while church attendance and active involvement in church activities was correlated with lower blood pressure, viewing religious media was NOT. It's the community. The dangers of social isolation are incredibly well studied--it's about as dangerous for your health as smoking, and twice as dangerous as obesity[5]. For many people, especially the elderly, going to church is the only time they get to socialize. This is the institution that Hayd wants to tax.It's not just beneficial to the individual. Houses of worship are often used as community gathering centers for secular or semi-secular organizations--think things like Preschools or your local Boy Scout troop. Under Hayd's plan, a LOT of these local churches are going to shut their doors.I contend that the government should let organic social goods flourish. Remember, since Hayd only cares about maximizing \"desirable states\", he should concede that the government shouldn't harm religion since religious people are happier, healthier, and less likely to die. At this point, he can only win the debate if he proves that taxing religious institutions will somehow strengthen them. II. Economic effectsBefore I get started, let's clear something up. Hayd claims that taxing churches would bring in $71 billion a year, citing an article from the Council of Secular Humanism. An analysis by DJ Clayworth tears this article to absolute *shreds*[6]. The most absurd part of the fact that the article itself estimates that churches take in about $100 billion in revenues each year, then claims taxing churches like \"everyone else\" would bring in $71 billion. Except nobody else pays 70% of their *gross revenue* in taxes. Clayworth notes that the biased authors of Hayd's article know nothing about taxation law and get their estimate through tricks like denying churches the ability to deduct expenses from their taxable income, wildly overestimating the value of church property, and by counting government subsidies to religiously affiliated homeless shelters or hospitals as grants that provide no value to society. Until he amends his estimate, Hayd is advocating for an economic formula that would utterly bankrupt every religious institution in the nation. In fact, Hayds OWN ARTICLE chastizes religious congregations for donating only an average of 29% of their revenues to charitable causes. Except it notes literally right afterward that 71% of Church revenues are used for legitimate operating expenses that would be written off when paying taxes. The church spends 71% of its income on operating expenses and then donates everything that would be considered taxable income in a corporation to charity. In the status qou, congregations donate everything beyond operating expenses to charity because they are legally prohibited from an income or else they'll lose their non-profit status. Using any reasonable tax code, Hayd only gets the government a chunk of the 29% that already goes to charity. Is it Hayds position that the government would allocate this money better than the charitatable organizations already receiving it?Lets talk some real numbers from unbiased sources. The Washington Post notes that the Catholic Church is the second largest employer in the US, employing some 1,000,000 people[7]. The Church spends about $170 billion in the United States a year. Its primary expenses? Running hospitals that save thousands of lives and schools that educate thousands of children. This is the institution that Hayd wants to tax out of existence. Right now, the business model of the Catholic Church assumes that it is not subject to taxes. Finding what the profit margin of the church would be if it were treated as a corporation is difficult, but we know from estimates from The Economist[7] that Health Care, Schools, and Parish operations constitute 93% of the Church budget. Hayd wants to throw the business model of the second largest employer in America into a tailspin for virtually no reason. It's tough to estimate just how hard taxation would hit the Church because Hayd's plan is utterly absurd and I'm being charitable to him, but considering that the Catholic Church owns over 26,000 properties in America[8] a property tax alone would do significant damage. Hospitals would start cutting staff or closing down entirely. Schools would shut down, forcing the students itno public schools and further stretch municipal budgets. Tens of thousands of workers would be cut off and forced to compete for private jobs or take government welfare. All of this for nothing. Moreover it's certain that many local congregations would wither if they were subject to taxes. Small congregations (7-99 congregants), which represent 59% of American churches[9] would be some of the first to go. In fact, Megachurches that are already run like a business and embody the worst of religion would best weather the storm. III. Separation of Church and StateSeparation of Church and State is a principle that is often misunderstood by secularists. The idea is not merely that the church ought to have no influence on the state--it's that the state also ought to leave the church alone. The spiritual and the temporal are separate spheres. This is so important because a healthy relationship between Church and State has a sense of \"mutually assured destruction.\" Both the Church and the State recognize that open competition for power and dominance would benefit no one, so they leave each other alone to the best of their ability. Hayd wants the government to violate this unspoken truce. Does he really not expect religion to hit back? Right now, religious organizations are prohibited from endorsing political candidates due to a law called the Johnson Amendment. If they do so, they will lose their tax-exempt status. If the government removes this penalty, there is nothing stopping churches from directly influencing government policy or endorsing candidates. The Catholic vote was almost evenly split in 2012[10]. An endorsement from the Catholic Church would swing any US presidential election and any congressional race in an area with a lot of Catholic voters. In fact, they would probably just endorse whichever candidates vow to return their tax-exempt status, negating all of Hayds impacts. Oh, and while it power they would probably repeal the Johnson Amendment.This is not the path to secularism. This is the path to dominionism.Hayds plan also opens up a HUGE religious discrimination can of worms. He complains about the lawsuits religious institutions bring to defend their tax-exempt status, but this cost is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of defending against litigation from religious organizations that feel discriminated against because they were audited or their property taxes went up. The resolution is unworkable.

            "conclusion": "Debate: Churches ought to pay taxes",
            "premise": "In this round, I will be providing rebuttal to Thett\u2019s offensive arguments and defending my own arguments against Thett\u2019s rebuttals. Framework Thett begins by expressing surprise at a purely utilitarian framework rather than higher principles such as separation of church and state. Separation of church and state is not a higher principle. Maybe the purpose of establishing a utilitarian framework was unclear: my framework establishes a system in which impacts are weighed; not a common \u2018theme\u2019 of arguments. My framework argued (and was never contested) that impacts ought to be weighed based on the goodness to badness ratio; goodness being the creation of more positive mental states than negative ones. Because Thett never contested my framework, separation of church and state only becomes a \u2018higher\u2019 principle in that its impact weighed in positive to negative mental states outweighs any other impacts; or, in the sense of a \u2018principal\u2019, categories of impact (such as economic growth, unemployment, crime, and such.) Thett\u2019s claim at the end of this section that if religion is proved as an overall benefit and taxes would harm the prevalence of religion, he would automatically win, is simply untrue. By my established framework, as long as a higher impact is created by taxing churches (a higher impact than harm done to prevalence of religion), I win the debate. Religion is a social good I do not contest the health benefits of being religious. Thus, I concede all of what Thett says here; with the exception community gatherings since that can easily be done at public schools rather than churches. This entire contention only gains impact if Thett can show that taxing churches would result in less religious attendance through the inability of people attending church (because the local church closes down.) I find that this link is unwarranted, and extremely weak at best. If you go back and read through the debate, the only times Thett addresses churches shutting down is through unwarranted claims. There is the exception of bringing up 26,000 Catholic properties in America, of which I address and negate in my second to last paragraph of the next contention. Thus, the link between taxing churches and decrease in health is nonexistent as it is thrown away on the basis of a bare assertion fallacy. Regardless, even if a link did exist and this argument had any impact, the amount of good that could be done with $14.6 billion (see next contention) far outweighs the amount of good that attending church does. $14.6 billion could save millions of lives through preventing starvation and crime. These impacts outweigh decreased stress and lengthened lifetimes. This entire contention is negated on two layers. Economic effects The beginning of this contention is spent attacking my source for the statistic of $71 billion raised from taxing churches. The source can be seen here [1]. I will start at the beginning of the calculation and go step by step until I reach the conclusion. The average church property value is estimated at $1.7 million. This is reached from averaging the property values of 47 different churches in Tampa, Florida. I think this is a reasonable estimate given that the median household property value in the US is $189,400 [2]. The median household property value in Tampa is $165,200 [3]. Because churches are zoned for commercial properties and are only able to be built on residential properties after obtaining a variance, most churches lie on commercial property [4]. And since residential and commercial property values are proven to exhibit strong correlation [5], and commercial property values tend to be significantly higher in value than residential properties [6], the estimation would follow a national trend. As my source [6] explains, it is standard to have a residential property sell for $100,000 and a commercial property of the exact same size across the street sells for $1,000,000. As logic shows, the $1.7 million statistic is reliable. The average property tax on households is 1.29% [7] and commercial property taxes are 20% higher [8], which puts the tax at 1.55%. Thus the average church would thus pay $26,350 in taxes. Given there are 300,000 churches, that ends up being $7,905,000,000. That\u2019s $7.9 billion. Since under the resolution I am only arguing for commercial income tax and property tax, I drop the prior $71 billion to $7.9 billion. Thus my overall money raised from church taxes is $14.6 billion. Thett\u2019s next point is that a tax would shut down thousands of churches and thus lose many jobs. First of all the entire assertion that churches would close down or jobs would be lost is unwarranted, as I explained earlier. But regardless, even if jobs are lost, since the money is reallocated to secular organizations, the same number of new employees are hired at the organization than were lost at the church. This compensates for any lost jobs. Thett makes a sidepoint in the second paragraph noting that 71% of church expenses are on operation costs, which he argues would be tax deductible because internal operations are essential to spending on charity. Thus, the government would only get a portion of that already donated to charity. And since my plan would use the taxed money to donate to charity, my plan would seem pointless since I am taxing charity donations to spend on charity. This argument does not work for a few reasons. Firstly, it assumes that all churches, or even the majority of churches are non profit organizations. This is not true, just as the Ford Motor Company donates some of their income to charity does not make their internal operating expenses tax deductible, neither does a church\u2019s. These internal operation expenses are for religious practice, such as worship, rather than operations relating to charity. Thus, these internal operations would not be tax deductible. The only exception for this is when the church files to be classed as a non profit, or a 501(c)(3) organization. When this happens no income can be used for \u201cprivate purposes\u201d [9]. This eliminates the ability of a church to function as a church, and thus no longer becomes a church since it provides no worship services, guidance, or whatever. All profit is donated to charity except for money spent to maintain the donation of money (operating expenses.) My plan would not tax these non profit organizations, only churches. And churches are inherently for profit, as my logic just showed. Thus, my tax would take away X amount of money, of which 29% would ordinarily be used for charity, and I would donate it to charity making 92% of it used for charity. Based on my uncontested framework, my plan wins out here. The other option is that the church\u2019s donations to charities are written off on their taxes, and thus I am only taxing the remaining taxable income: 71% of their income. The tax on that income would then further be spent on charity due to my plan, and again, based on my uncontested framework, my plan wins out. Thett goes on to cite the Catholic church in spending 93% of their $170 billion budget on charity. This is all true, and it is of course good. But the claim that church taxes would \u201ctax them out of existence\u201d is unwarranted, as I explained earlier. What will happen is a portion of their budget will be deducted in taxes, which then, according to my plan, will be reallocated to secular nonprofits, of which are just as or more utilitarian in spending their money. It's important to note that using the example of the Catholic Church is cherry-picking, and a more topical example would be the national average, which is 29% of the money going to charity. Taxing and reallocating it would make 92% go to charity. More lives are saved, diseases cured, and homes built through my plan. But even regardless of this, as I said earlier, any money that the Catholic church uses for charity is tax deductible. This means that only funds used for non charity related uses, such as worship, guidance, or whatever is actually taxed. Saying that hospitals would close, or any other negative affect to charity is simply untrue, a tax would only harm the worship part of church. Separation of Church and State Thett\u2019s argument here is that the church and the state have a truce of mutually assured destruction. The problem with this is that is makes the unwarranted assumption that churches would retaliate, or that their retaliation is bad. Neither of these are true. First of all, the head of the largest religious institution in the world endorses church taxes for noncharitable churches [11]. Secondly, taxes won\u2019t significantly harm religious organizations, and Thett has given no argument that it would, so significant retaliation is unlikely. Regardless, the only retaliation that Thett brings up is in endorsing candidates. I don\u2019t see this as a bad thing, as religious institutions have every right to exercise their free speech and endorse candidates. There is no negative here, or at least no negative that Thett has argued for. So the idea that taxing churches is bad because it will result in churches retaliating by endorsing candidates has no impact for Thett since he failed to show why churches endorsing candidates is a bad thing. There is no arguable difference between the Catholic Church, Bernie Sanders, or the NAACP endorsing someone for president. None of these are bad things, this argument has no impact. Also, the claim that the tax exemption status would just be returned is outside the scope of the resolution since it is a should proposition, not a *would*. Suing the government because your taxes went up due to a newly passed law has no ground. The government does not have to spend any money defending that kind of lawsuit since there is nothing to sue over. There is room for debate in what's defined as a church though, and these are funded by wealthy organizations making the cost of these courses more expensive. Sources in comments",

            "conclusion": "Churches of all religions should be taxed by the government.",
            "premise": "Why churches of all religions should not be taxed by the government. I. The Constitution The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ....\" and Article VI specifies that \"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. (http://www.law.cornell.edu...) Two clauses in the First Amendment guarantee freedom of religion. First and foremost, the establishment clause prohibits the government from passing legislation to establish an official religion or preferring one religion over another. The implications of such a law to protect the interests of a country that is known for mixing cultures, traditions, and beliefs are more important than ever. The free exercise clause prohibits the government, in most instances, from interfering with a person's practice of their religion. How is this related to taxation? A local pastor in the Western Appalachian Mountains builds a one-room log cabin near his small mountain community made up of local miners and traders. He is a man of God and desires to share his faith with his small community, a congregation of roughly 15-20 people. Knowing he doesn\u2019t collect much from those who can barely afford to pay he opens his mail to find that the State and Federal government are now taxing him for his one-room church. The price is simply too high to afford and thus he is forced to close the doors or suffer the wrath of the IRS. In this instance, not only did the government shut-down his freedom to express his religion, but it crushed the possibility of giving this small community a safe place where they might hear words of inspiration. Without the Constitution, where would we be as a Nation? Would we truly have come to take these freedoms we have now for granted? Let us not forget that we fought against the Monarchy to set ourselves free from oppression from governmental entities who abused their power. We have fought for the right to build our temples for worship, we fought for the right to stand on our church stages and preach our beliefs to the masses without the government standing over our shoulder telling us what or what-not to say. If we truly relinquish the power back to the governments by allowing taxation, what more does that accomplish other than handing over one of the last safe-zones we truly have in this Nation of ours? Freedom from Governmental control and impressions. II. Safe-Zones As an American who is now living in a society engulfed in Post-9/11 paranoia, I\u2019ve always taken comfort in one thing: The fact that if another great world war consumed our planet, that there will always be one building left standing- The Church. It is now a well-known fact that no matter how great the tensions or however great the animosity was between warring nations, the unspoken agreement to avoid churches during bombing raids was carried out and practiced. No matter how differing these nations were in terms of cultural traditions and beliefs, we were able to find a common ground upon which everyone could agree that in the game of war, churches were not to be touched. But why weren\u2019t the churches bombed? For some reason, the most untouched buildings in every country throughout the time of WW2 was that of religious organizations. Firstly, unlike political ideologies or cultural traditions, churches and religions transcend beyond the scope of political influence. Secondly, I believe the morality in soldiers during a time when churches meant more to them than the enemy should not be ruled out \u2013 even soldiers feel empathy or a personal respect garnered within them since childhood if they themselves grew up with the tradition of attending church. III. Most churches are used as places of worship for religions that predate modern government. Respect your elders. While one can argue that most churches were built after the American government was formed, the fact remains that the church buildings built represent something far older than any form of our federal government. If we look at all the main religions practiced in America today we have: Christianity \u2013 A tradition continually practiced for about 2,000 years. Judaism \u2013 A tradition continually practiced for about 5,700 years. Buddhism \u2013 A tradition continually practiced for about 2,500 years. Islam \u2013 A tradition continually practiced for about 1,400 years. Hinduism \u2013 A tradition continually practiced for about 7,000 years. American Federal Government \u2013 227 years old\u2026 The fact remains that a majority of church buildings we see today are built upon the foundation created by these age-old religions. In medieval Europe we see the destruction brought about by letting the church gain so much influence that it, in theory, was able to control the direction of the society at that time. With that being said, the balance that has seemed to work in our own modern society is one of equality and separation. By remaining free from governmental influence, the majority of world religions have been able to spread to provide a safety net for those fearful of the unknown. To provide individuals with the freedom to continue on their journeys throughout life knowing that they have a safe place to return if the pressure of life ever overwhelms them. This goes both ways, by remaining separate \u2013 the government has been able to remain in power over the influence of the people in terms of shaping the direction we head as a Nation. History has proven that in order for a balance of harmony to be achieved between the church and state, in terms of dominating society\u2019s direction of progress, a separation is necessary. The issue we face now is being able to learn from the mistakes we made as a collective throughout history. We have broken the cycle of war for influence between the two and in doing so, we have been able to achieve more technologically, scientifically, and emotionally than ever before in history. To repeat the mistakes would make us no better than those who have come before us, in the name of progress we have finally found a synthesis between the two that actually works, and I will forever stand by my position that we should continue on this path of separation if we are to continue on our path of forward progress. IV. Desperate times call for desperate measures? I like to call it how I see it: The American Government spends more funding on War-time efforts than the next 10 most powerful nations combined. http://www.outsidethebeltway.com... With that said, what good does handing more money over to the government really achieve? Do you honestly believe that money will be used for rebuilding our infrastructure? Do you really believe that money will be used by the government to feed the homeless or help the poor? On September 10, 2001 Donald Rumsfeld came out to a press conference and made a startling, if not, horrifying revelation: The Pentagon had lost 2.3 Trillion dollars. That\u2019s right, not billion \u2013 but TRILLION. This isn\u2019t \u201clost\u201d as in, profits lost, but rather \u201clost\u201d as in *poof* it disappeared with no apparent traces to follow. I will provide the link so you might hear it from the horse\u2019s mouth directly: (Please see Youtube video). http://www.youtube.com... It is not uncommon for a church to host community events \u2013 for instance, as a young child growing up in a Baptist church one of my fondest memories was heading to the local housing projects with my fellow church members and giving the families there free Thanksgiving turkeys so that they would be able to enjoy a meal for the holiday. The money used for such a charity event came from nowhere but the weekly contributions we made to the church. We cannot deny the fact that a majority of churches use their profits for good rather than selfish reasons. A majority of the time, these profits are spent on either people of the congregation in need or the church itself if repairs to the building or renovations are necessary. We musn't forget that churches are business\u2019s as well, if they can\u2019t receive funding from the government, why on earth should they be left with nearly nothing after the proposed taxes? I do not believe the corruption of the majority of churches outweigh the corruption of the federal government. The profits the federal government would make with the taxes would be better spent by the churches who would truly be able to help their local communities with the additional funds. Ultimately, It will be up to the audience to determine whether our nation has stooped so low in its economic woes that we must now tax the only organizations left in our world that truly supersede that of our own government in terms of personal guidance and safe haven. By opening the door to government oversight, we are allowing our houses to be raided by a foreign entity. The moment our churches are taxed, we forfeit our right to use them as neutral zones if there was ever another great war to break out. We forfeit our right to speak our minds and practice our faith in the security of closed doors. We cannot allow our only common ground with the nations of the world to be raped of its dignity by allowing government influence to enter its realm of authority. Remember, it is our freedoms that we fought for that allows us to develop thoughts freely without governmental control. We won our right to remain separated from government influence- at the cost of countless human lives, all of whom we are descendants from. To allow the taxation of church would mean that all their lives lost would have been in vain. Taxation is nothing more than a quick fix to a problem that requires a much greater, long-term solution. We must stop being enablers with these quickfix tax solutions and fix the issue at the root cause - responsible spending.",

There will be a lot of fresh attacks against his case wrapped up in my defenses.I. Religion is a social goodHayd concedes this point entirely, noting only that public events could be held at schools, crowding out after-school activities.You can vote Con. It is not remotely plausible that forcing Churches to hire armies of tax lawyers and pay taxes on their properties (many of which are priceless architectural marvels) will help religion in this country. Remember, active involvement in a religious community extends life, makes that life happier and more fulfilled, and increases that individuals positive impact on society. Does Hayd want to compare that record with the government? His only real response is that my claims that religion will be damaged if it's taxed is unwarranted. I didn't hit this very much because I assumed it was completely obvious, but I'll note that Hayd totally dropped my argument regarding the business model of churches assuming that they don't pay taxes. Adding a massive tax burden throws that model into flux and adds instability for no reason. I'm not sure what else I can be expected to do here. As the complete take down of the Council of Secular Humanism article shows, making accurate estimates about this kind of thing is incredibly difficult and often leaves you with your foot in your mouth. Instead you have to go with the logic that, yes, having to hire armies of tax lawyers, pay property and income taxes, and totally change your business model from the bottom to the top is going to cause damage on the margins. Corporations fight taxes tooth and nail for a reason, the extra expense harms the bottom line. Since Hayd has totally conceded that the bottom line of religion is a massive boon for society, it's difficult to see how Pro can win the debate. But the absurdity of this line of attack really comes through when you get into the specifics behind Hayd's case. Hayd later claims that the government will make tons of money because the average property tax burden on the 300,000 churches would be over $26,000. Doesn't sound so bad if you're thinking about Billy Graham sized crowds. Except the majority of congregations in this country consist of less than 100 people. $26,000 distributed over, say, 50 congregants is an incredible burden that would shut down almost any church. And that's just the property taxes.I'm also going to rebut Hayd's entire case by calling for him to morally justify taxation. The general argument for taxing corporations is that since society provides for them via the roads their goods travel on, the police force protecting them from robbery, and so on they owe something in return. If churches are as great as I claim they are, and Hayd has conceded to every single one of my claims, they are already fulfilling their debt to society. The moral justification for taxing churches is bunk. II. Economic effects Hayd writes: \"[Thett] assumes that all churches, or even the majority of churches are non profit organizations. This is not true, just as the Ford Motor Company donates some of their income to charity does not make their internal operating expenses tax deductible, neither does a church\u2019s.\" This is ***COMPLETELY*** false and not at all how corporate taxes work. If expenses weren't tax deductible, literally every business in the United States would go under. Corporations are taxed on their *income* which is the number you get after subtracting revenue (all of the money the organization takes in that year) from expenses (everything it spends). So for example in 2015 Ford earned some $149 million in revenue[1], but operating costs ate at that number until the taxable income was a mere $10 million. Legitimate operating expenses like building upkeep and employee payment are ALWAYS tax-deductible because they whittle away the corporations taxable income.Hayd says he is not allowing churches to deduct these legitimate expenses. He loses his previous argument that churches won't be hit very hard by his new taxes as he is subjecting religions to a completely unfair and unique tax burden by not allowing them to write off operating costs. If he chooses not to advocate for this exaggerated and unfair tax burden, I hereby turn his entire case: Hayd's impact relies upon more money going to charity if you tax churches. But the reality is that *LESS* money will be going to go to charity. Right now in order to maintain their non-profit status, churches are legally prohibited from having an income. As we've already discussed, on average 71% of their income goes to expenses and only 29% would be considered \"income.\" Hayd gets the government some of that 29%. But the Church keeps the rest. And now that they're no longer obligated to maintain their non-profit status, with many strapped for cash due to the massive financial burden Hayd throws on them, can they really be expected to donate all of their remaining profits to charity? By legally turning churches into a business, Hayd is actually reducing the money that goes to charity and opening the door for unscrupulous religious leaders to enrich themselves from church revenue. Further, if you don't buy that turn for some reason, you still vote Con because Hayd can't just assume that all the money is going to be donated to charity. The resolution does not say \"Churches ought to be taxed and the proceeds will go to charity\"--we have NO REASON to assume that the government will give this money to charitable causes and Hayd has not articulated any.You can vote Con because Hayd literally has no impacts. His plan requires you to assume that no churches are hurt by a sudden tax burden, the church does not retaliate against the government in a negative way, that no churches keep rather than donate their profits now that they have the option, and that the government will donate the proceeds to charity. Give him all of these EXTREMELY GENEROUS assumptions and it is STILL a wash. Even if you don't buy any of my own points Hayd still loses because he adds instability to the status quo without producing any tangible improvement.III. Church and State Hayd fundamentally misunderstands why the sacred and the secular should be separate spheres. He says the argument that churches would retaliate to this violation of their sovereignty is unwarranted, but he is actively undermining their interests by imposing a massive financial burden. Hayd says he doesn't see a problem with the church influencing secular politics, but the vast majority of Americans do. When His Holiness the Pope himself criticized Trump he was roundly condemned and THE POPE apologized. I find it extremely doubtful that Hayd can't see the obvious problem with every election in the United States literally being decided by who the major religions endorse. All it takes is one instance of the church's political position contradicting the public good for there to be an impact when you're working with a government that is completely reliant on the church for its legitimacy. This is the road to dominionism. Remember that since Hayd has no impacts, even the tiniest risk of an undue religious influence on the government harming the public good is enough to win me the debate. Hayd bizarrely responds to my religious discrimination argument by claiming that lawsuits wouldn't cost the government anything because the law is the law, despite making an extremely similar point in his first round. Which is it? Hayd causes a lot of instability without anything to show for it. The resolution is completely negated. Sources:1. http://www.nasdaq.com...",

            "premise": "I understand your outrage at the violation of church and state that has occurred in schools across our nation. I agree that it is indeed a severe problem, especially as it pertains to the punishment of young and innocent children, still developing their ideas about the world and finding their spiritual and religious truth. However, I fail to see the relevance of these instances to our topic. Yes it is a violation of church and state but so is the taxation of churches. The severity of one does not negate the other, nor does it lessen the impact on our society. Let me give you an analogy to clarify my point. Let us say you are a kid at school and there is a bully in your class. His favorite color is red, and he picks on all the kids who don't wear red shirts. Sometimes he makes kids in class wear a red shirt even if they don't want to. You see this and know it is wrong. You should take action. But say you decide to take some of his lunch money every day. You are physically able to take this kid's money. But should you? No. Just because what he does is bad, doesn't make your bad actions good. It is against the rules. It is not right. Similarly, it is \"against the rules\" for the government to tax churches. They may have violated the separation of church and state themselves, but you would also be violating it. You wrote that \"It's no secret churches have abusing extra money and such. I'm not saying all churches are, just some.\" This is not justification either. You cannot take someone's money because they are not using it well. Even if it somehow was justification, which it is not, if you were to only tax those that do misuse money it would be discrimination. But to enact a widespread tax on all churches regardless of their abuse or not because some churches, which may not even be in the same city or state have misused money? If you are trying to reach fairness, this is not it. Another point, it seems as though you are focusing this primarily on Christian establishments, not synagogues or mosques or temples as well, but singling out Christian churches. If you tax only religious organizations of a certain religion, that is discrimination. May I remind you of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\" Throughout many decades and conflicts, this has been clarified and interpreted by the Supreme Court. In 1947, Justice Hugo Black said \"The \"establishment of religion\" clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the federal government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another... No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa.\" Your proposition violates most of this. Should your proposition only affect Christian institutions, that would be classified as aiding or preferring one religion over another. He clearly states that \"No tax in any amount...can be levied,\". Your idea is a violation of church and state. Against the law. Any violation of the law, no matter how small or what other violations have occurred elsewhere, is in violation of the law.",

            "premise": "At a time when ordinary people are being told to tighten their belts and to expect massive reductions in public spending in order to repay the huge government debt incurred as the result of the financial crisis, there are two groups of people who continue to live it up: 1 - The greedy and incompetent investment bankers who caused the financial crisis in the first place and who, nevertheless, continue to use the governments' recapitalisation handouts to pay themselves obscene bonuses. 2 \u2013 Religious organisations. While the United States and the European Union are responding to the bankers' abject failure to show self-restraint by imposing restrictions on their bonus payments, they have done nothing to redress the fact that religious organisations are ripping the rest of us off by not paying any tax. [1] So while decent, hard-working families struggle to make ends meet, televangelists such as Creflo Dollar continue to swan about in their brand new Rolls-Royces [2] and Catholic priests carry on living the life of Reilly in their tax-free, all-expenses-paid parochial houses. [The YouTube clips are humorous, of course, but there is many a true word said in jest.] And how many hard-working, God-fearing family men can afford to hire young sex-workers to accompany them on luxury, ten-day tours of Europe? Not many, but Baptist Minister George Alan Rekers can. [3] That's partly because he doesn't pay any tax. (In the interests of full disclosure here, by the way, I should point out that Rekers denied knowing that his companion was a male prostitute, even though he hired him from rentboy.com). To put this matter into perspective, The Church of England (CofE) rakes in \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1 billion ($1.52 billion) every year tax-free and yet its own website states that even though \"over \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd200 million is given tax-efficiently each year through Gift Aid\" and \"a further \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd60 million is recovered from the Inland Revenue in tax.\" [4] In other words, the CofE not only avoids contributing to the public purse, it is actually jewing \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd60 million pounds a year out of it! And things are even worse in Germany where citizens are subject to the \u2018Kirchensteuer' (Church Tax) which nets protestant priests over EUR8 billion (\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd7 billion / $10 billion) every year. [5] A similar situation exists in Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Finland and Iceland where citizens are also forced by law to give a percentage of their income to the church. It seems to me that, with religious observance on the decline to a point where, according to the CofE's own figures only one million people \u2013 just 1.6% of the British population - go to church on Sundays [5], the church is becoming increasingly irrelevant in today's more enlightened society. And yet the churches are still growing fat at the expense of ordinary, hard-working citizens who have to make up the shortfall in tax receipts. This is a scandalous and outdated state of affairs and I believe it is high time that churches paid their way and, therefore, I duly affirm that religious organisations should no longer enjoy their tax-exempt status.

However, I singled out the Catholic Church as that it is an institution completely within the grasp of a foreign sovereign power. The Pope is very much considered a head of state, although the boundaries of his rule are quite small and limited only to Vatican City. This is a problem as that he often uses his position of religious influence to attempt and influence the political affairs of other sovereign and secular nations. Yes, churches provide those places of solace I mentioned, but monasteries do not. Many Protestant churches sustain themselves solely through the tithes and efforts of its respective congregation, they need no monasteries or convents or schools or support them: However, the Catholic institutions such as monasteries, convents, schools, as well as all other real estate holdings of theirs (not to mention the income of the Pope, Cardinals, and Bishops) depend very much upon the tithes generated by parishioners. This means that hoped for improvements to a church (anything from basic repairs to a new organ) are put on the back burner so that the church's parochial school can be supported....even though many parents in that church may not be able to send their children to said school! This is a small issue, but when one considers that those real estate holdings are taking up a great deal of tithes collected. Money given for repairs at a local church instead are distributed and thinly spread across various schools, convents, and monasteries. This means that the people are essentially being scammed. This, of course, should be applied to all religious sects in a nation. However, as I stated in the first paragraph, the Catholic Church is an entity controlled by a sovereign state. These monasteries and convents, and especially these schools, should be considered institutions where a foreign head of state tries to meddle in the affairs of a sovereign nation-state. Indeed, the Catholic Church is the largest health care system in the world. However, in the largeness comes the threat of corruption. One need only look at the splendor of Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica to see that much of the income of the Catholic church is spent on the comfort and luxurious lifestyles of the Church's higher echelons of leadership (a scam that has been running since Sixtus V). However, there those missionaries, are there not, who are truly givers, like the recently canonized Mother Theresa? Indeed, but the brilliant journalist Christopher Hitchens investigated into her quite a bit. http://www.nybooks.com... The popularity of her and the recent canonization are merely propaganda efforts by the Catholic Church to further push its political agenda into the secular republics which overthrew its Papal Authority in the various revolutions of the 18th and 19th Centuries. So, if the real estate holdings of the Catholic Church (and of course of all religions), which are not houses of worship open to the public, this scam is weakened and so is the political power machine of the Catholic Church itself.",

Property TaxChurches are not required to pay property taxes on their land or buildings. A pastor in Weddington NC purchased a $1.4 million mansion in October of 2013. The mansion features 16,000 square feet with 7 \u00bd bathrooms, according to building permits. The land cost another $325,000, for a total cost of more than $1.7 million. In the year 2013, this luxury home managed to skip out on roughly $344,690.00 (Calculated via http://www.iras.gov.sg...) in property tax.(Picture of pastor's home in Weddington NC. Via WCNC News) II. Sales TaxWhen churches buy stuff, they don't pay sales taxes. From a $2 box of pencils to a $3,000 big screen television churches are not required to pay one cent. Lets take the television and do the math. At an 8.25% sales tax, the $3,000 television would equal to $247.50. Lets be realistic however, what church only has a television inside of it? Take this time to use your imagination. Think of the average American church, and ponder at how much money in sales tax is being avoided.(Picture of the inside of a church) III. Capital Gains TaxWhen they sell stuff at a profit, they don't pay capital gains tax. A Mormon mall named the City Creek Center, located in Salt Lake City (2 Billion Dollar Tax Free Project) is one such place that profits from a lack of capital gains tax. It does not take someone with a degree in finance to fathom how much money a super mall like this profits, again tax free. (Picture of City Creek Center) IV. Why these numbers matterThe substantial amount of money that churches across the country avoid via taxes, is mind blowing. A recent study conducted by the Council of Secular Humanism, compiled numbers into an easily readable chart. 72 Billion Dollars a Year in tax exemptions. You could feed 3,600,000,000 starving people a day, or 9,863,013 people for an entire year! Did I mention that is three square meals a day?V. Why churches should pay taxes?To simplify, churches are earning astonishing amounts of money through various flawed tax exemptions. Churches do not have to account for where their money is spent, unlike any other organization. Blatantly, churches are given extra brakes and exemptions that no other organization is offered. Separation of church and state does not mean that religious establishments should go unchecked. No, separation of church and state is to protect religious beliefs from governing our politics. Tax exemptions should only be applied to donations to the church.Thank you.",

As I said, it would only be .5% taxation. Then they could go on their merry way and do whatever they want with the rest. It's no secret churches have abusing extra money and such. I'm not saying all churches are, just some. Also, the government is not intruding on the ceremonies of the religious, just collecting money. We're not shutting the churches down, we're just taxing them very little.Source: http://archive.adl.org...",

            "premise": "Thank you to Con for their reply. In this debate, I have shown based on common definitions that Scientology qualifies as a religion. Con argues that the Church of Scientology is a \"criminal cult\" but provides no definition for that term. Con at no point provided evidence of criminal activity within the Church of Scientology. Although allegations of crimes committed by individuals in the organization may exist in the public domain Con did not bring those evidences into this debate and thus should not be considered. Con argues that a suitable religion obeys the law and is given tax exempt status, yet Con doesn't provide evidence for this claim. Also in the definitions of religion or church provided in this debate none specifically say anything about obedience to law. Con claims that The Church of Scientology lost its tax exempt status this year. That claim is false. There were erroneous articles circling the internet last year from satire and entertainment websites claiming this and they are false. Con sources abcnews.com.co which is a known fake news site. www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/abc-news-dot-co/369991 The church is still tax exempt www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/.../fake-supreme-court-scientology-ruling/ http://www.snopes.com... http://www.dontmesswithtaxes.com... To conclude, I had the burden of proof to show that Scientology meets the proper conventional definitions of a religion and have done so. I have refuted Con's claim successfully. Con provided no evidence of their claims of a \"criminal cult\" which is not related to the topic and sourced satire news to claim that the church is no longer tax exempt. I have also shown in my proofs that independent Scientology is organized and does meet the minimal definition for a religion under the common dictionary definition. My meeting of my burden of proof means points should be awarded to me. Thank you for you attention and thank you again to my opponent.",

            "premise": "When we look at the religions of today, we see increasingly grand and decadent churches, mosques and synagogues, while at the same time we see secularism rising exponentially [1,2], and all of this begs the question: why should a purportedly secular government not be treating religions like the rest of us? Why are religions considered tax-exempt while businesses and individuals are taxed? But firstly, what is our tax system and why are some organizations not taxed? A tax system in a Western Democracy is a simple on a principled level. The purpose of taxation is so that public services can be made available to all. But in our tax system we allow certain organizations to be let off the hook when it comes to taxation because we believe that these organizations operate to benefit the community as a whole. We can see this particularly clearly when we consider that the organizations that are tax-exempt are predominately charities, trade unions and art organizations [3]. The standard for tax-exemption is clearly the overall public benefit to everyone of the society. In the instance of religions, given that recent surveys suggested there were as many as 45 million people in the United States who were not religious, we think that religious organizations don't help the wider population, and for this reason they should be taxed. Secondly, we believe in the separation of church and state and that allowing religions to be tax-exempt effectively violates this separation for two main reasons. Firstly, we think that not taxing religions gives them in-principle support, which a secular government should not do. Secondly, on a practical level, in the current situation we see a government that is forced to decide which religions are valid and which are not. Currently, our government must decide whether it should tax religions such as scientology [4] (which is currently untaxed by the United States but is by major nations such as France), which many consider to be criminal. Scientology has allegedly abused its members [5] and been involved in other criminal activity. I would ask my opponent: under his model, would religions like this be taxed, or would the government continue to allow a seemingly immoral organization off the hook? Thirdly, we see that religions often have a negative effect on their community. I have already discussed scientology, which is an important example. But even more mainstream religions have a negative impact. Consider America's most widespread religion, Christianity [1]. We think it has a negative impact in twomain ways. Firstly, we say that the church has been accused of worldwide instances of abuse, and that it has even been threatened by legal action in a trial of war crimes in regard to this abuse [6]. Allegations of abuse of children to the highest levels, and the admission by the Pope that he personally has covered up these scandals [6] show the widespread nature of these practices. The government should not be treating these organizations as charitable, or as benefiting the whole community. Secondly, many Christian doctrines take part in inherently prejudiced practices; in some doctrines women are not allowed to become priests, and moreover the religion as a whole has moved against gay marriage [7]. Because religions have a net negative impact on society as a whole, we should tax them, as we do ordinary members of society.

            "premise": "My family tree has just been completed and I have discovered that I am, in reality, an extremely posh personage with an aristocratic heritage - I am related to the Norwegian royal family no less, and I have duly written to the King of Norway asking him to send me a cheque for my share of the family fortune at his earliest convenience. However, when I bank this cheque I will have to pay capital gains tax on the amount, and possibly inheritance tax too, and the prospect of this is making my blue blood boil, especially as I know that my wealthy forefathers here in Britain were never required to pay any sort of tax. Indeed, back in medieval times, the paupers in rural England used to pay the nobility handsome sums for the privilege of farming the common land that used to collectively belong to them before the ruling classes annexed it all and forced the snivelling little peasants into serfdom. One of my Victorian ancestors: Lord Montmorency Wright-Farquhar Saveloy Eggleston d'Eggleston von Gobbscheit, the fifth Earl of Sunderland; famously said \"The idea that the upper classes should be asked to make a financial contribution to the Government just so filthy commoners can educate their children, have access to medication and enjoy the protection of the law is as ludicrous as the idea that they should be allowed to vote.\" Sadly, these days working class scum not only enjoy free education and health care, paid for through taxation, but also the 'right' to elect wishy-washy, namby-pamby, bleeding-heart lefties as Members of Parliament - and this country is going to hell in a hand-cart as a result. Like most financially privileged toffs, I have an enormous sense of self-entitlement, and that's why I affirm that income tax should remain in place, but only the lower classes should pay it, and that the revenue raised from income tax should not be wasted on publicly-funded schools and hospitals but, rather, be used to replace the capital gains and inheritance taxes which are such a tedious burden on socially superior citizens, such as my good self. As my friends in the Conservative Party point out, taxing high net worth individuals drives wealth creators out of the country and into low tax regimes overseas, and because they sack their chauffeurs, valets, butlers, chefs, gardeners, sommeliers, footmen and maids as they leave, this exodus of prosperous people actually damages some of the poorest members of society - the very people those commies in the Labour Party claim to represent. The fact is, if the richest ten per cent of citizens were exempted from tax, not only would all those servants keep their jobs but rich people from abroad would be tempted to move to Britain to take advantage of our low tax policies, and employ domestic staff of their own here - which would be a fantastic boost to the economy. We can expect objections from certain quarters of the media if the Government adopts my proposal, of course, but as Conservative MP, Andrew Mitchell, recently told some upstart policemen who tried to tell him what to do \"Best you learn your f------ place. You don't run this f------ government. You're f------ plebs\" (1) and this is the message that must be extended to any other proles who dare to question the Government's new policy to exempt the wealthiest citizens from tax. Thank you.

            "premise": "Okay, I'm really really sorry. I had a big English project, then I got a little sick. and I lost the charging cable for my laptop...... let's just say that it has been an interesting week. If my opponent would like to continue after we run out of rounds, maybe in the comments section, or in a new debate, then I would be willing to do so. I would just like to restate that this is only over property taxes and tax deductions. These are the only major tax differences between churches in non-profit clubs that is worth discussing. \"The reason they should be taxed differently is because, unlike social clubs, churches are charitable. This is evident in the requirements for their respective classifications.\" I think we have to examine what counts as charitable. As a charitable organization or a government agency/public service (like a library or county courthouse or a soup kitchen) money given to them is tax deductible. Similarly, a religious organization is also on this list of tax deductible organizations. Also on this list is 2 types of private organizations. Domestic Fraternal Societies and non-profit cemetery companies. However, restrictions are placed on even these. For the fraternal society, the entire amount you are claiming as a donation must be used for a charitable action, and for the cemetery company it cannot be used for a specific lot or mausoleum. *1 Now, I agree that a church may engage in charitable actions. This is clear to anyone. I was part of a synagogue for most of my life, and I remember every once in a while them passing around a collection plate or asking for canned food. I also remember them using that money to build a new Synagogue, because they didn't have one (they had services in other locations that they rented out or borrowed). Most religious organizations do not use enough money towards charitable actions to be considered a charity. The purpose of declaring something a charity, and refraining from taxing it at all, and then giving deductions for donations is thus. 1. To convince people to use their own money to fund relief and support programs that the community as a whole supports more. 2. To not have to provide services being rendered by that organization. Does a church do either of these? While the community as a whole might more support the church, is it really providing a relief to the community? Is giving my ten dollars to that church really going to do more, or even a comparable amount then if I had given it to a real charity? Should I get the same tax deduction from donating to a soup kitchen that I get from donating to a church? Now I would like to separate religious organizations into 3 categories, to which I will argue separately. The first will be charities that may affiliate with a religion, but function as charities. I have volunteered with the Jewish Relief Agency, which unless you live in the greater Philadelphia area and are Jewish, probably don't know about. It's a warehouse that packages boxes filled with square meals for the week and delivers it to mostly, but not exclusively, needy Jewish people (mostly recent Russian immigrants). They give the majority of their funds to the charity itself, and give a negligible amount (less then 10%) to religious practices. This is a charity and should be treated as such. There are other examples of things that are clearly more charities then religious organizations, though they may affiliate with some religious organizations. Now there are standard churches that participate in large, or exemplary charitable actions. (as in, 30-70% of their income). These are not charities. Though they may partake in many charitable actions, they should be taxed. However, they can receive large deductions from their charitable actions, and may end up paying no taxes at all, or very little. This is great. They should be able to do this, and I, and most people, should applaud them for doing so. But, they are still a religious organization. My donation will do less then donating to a real charity. It should not be tax deducted equally, or at all like it would if I donated it to a charity. The last is a standard church that participates in little to no charity (0 - 20% of income). They may receive a small amount of deduction, or perhaps none at all. Ultimately though, these are religious organizations. They cannot be considered charities. Their money only goes to benefit those who give the money, and do not give any benefit to the outside community (for religious people; remember point number 4 in round 1). I personally would argue that it gives no benefit to those inside the religion, but whatever. It is a social club that prays. That is all that a non-donating religious organization is. We have separated these with private organizations. We have made it so that we do not tax charities affiliated with private clubs, and give deductions to the non-profit clubs so that if they are charitable, they may not have to pay taxes at all. Why can we not do the same with religious organizations? Maybe we shouldn't tax non-profit clubs. I see rife abuse with that potential path, but maybe there is some merit that me, with my limited mortality and comprehension, cannot see. My arguments are based off of equality. The only difference between a church and a non-profit club is that one prays and the other might pray. And yet one gets massive exemptions, while the other must struggle to do massive charity projects if they wish to pay no taxes, or do rigorous hoop jumping to get qualified under tax-exempt status. 1. http://www.irs.gov...",

            "premise": "I would like to thank Bernardio for his considered comments to which I make the following responses: Ideally, there would be no taxes, but a country must raise funds somehow. In the past, if a king needed money he would assemble a fleet of frigates and galleons that would be bristling with guns and canons. He would load these ships with cargos of soldiers and send them across the Atlantic to the New World to rape and pillage newfound civilisations, and plunder their gold and have it repatriated back to Europe. Unfortunately though, these days the United Nations take a dim view of such activities and it is, therefore, necessary for the government to collect money from the general populace instead. This inevitably leads to the double-taxation my opponent referred to. You pay tax on the money you earn and when you buy something with the money left over the recipient pays tax on the profit from the sale. But my opponent suggests that churches shouldn't pay tax because they \"help others\" in places like Haiti. I looked into this and discovered that a Baptist group from Idaho did indeed travel to Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake to \"help others\" - they were arrested and accused of attempting to traffic 33 children out of the country. [1] Presumably their intention was to sell the youngsters on to paedophiles rings in America and if they had not been caught they would have succeeded in their mission \u2013 their mission being to \"help others\" sexually molest vulnerable children. Meanwhile the Jewish Orthodox Union uses their tax-free donations to fund the Institute for Public Affairs [2] which is an American lobby group that opposes humanitarian aid being sent to victims of military aggression in Palestine, rejects the United Nations and international law and supports the ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem and the illegal Jewish land grabs in the West Bank. At the same time, there are widespread concerns that tax-free donations made to mosques may be channelled into the hands of Islamic terrorist groups. [3] With regard to countries such as Ireland where church attendances are higher, the income from tax paid by the churches would be very helpful in reducing their budget deficits and allow them to spend more money on schools and hospitals. In conclusion, the activities of religious organisations may seem worthy and noble by some: Christian paedophiles; racist Jews; Islamic terrorists and others; but not everybody welcomes having to pay more tax to make up for the shortfall in receipts from tax-exempt churches, temples, mosques and synagogues.

We have made it so that we do not tax charities affiliated with private clubs, and give deductions to the non-profit clubs so that if they are charitable, they may not have to pay taxes at all. Why can we not do the same with religious organizations? How can you expect an organization to pay property taxes if there is no revenue? It's not like they can increase tithing? Conversely, since social clubs \"must be supported by membership fees, dues, and assessments\", they can raise the necessary money, or go under. Lastly, churches have limits and restrictions on how they lobby, while social clubs do not. These differences categorically make the institutions unequal, and since they are unequal, similar tax treatment is not required. \"Maybe we shouldn't tax non-profit clubs.

            "premise": "Pro posited that the status quo be changed, and that religious entities should be, in essence, removed from the list of not-for-profits (NFPs) recognized by the Charity Law. To do so, Pro would have to either prove that religious entities fail to provide public benefits or prove that they operate in the manner similar to a for-profit institution. It is Con's contention that Pro failed to provide cited arguments proving such. Pro began with the Church of England's suffering attendance levels. Con previously noted such to demonstrate that England is largely a secular society and that Pro's assertion that the Church gets by on fear mongering was an unrealistic one (indeed, when Durham Cathedral asked its visitors for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5 donations to cover the building's \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd60,000 weekly maintenance bill, patrons responded with an average donative of 32p[1], which mathematically works out to a one way ticket to hell for 94% of the visitors). Pro did not attempt to counter this, but instead pointed to the declining attendance as an indicator of the Church's declining relevance and that greying of remaining worshipers only serves to show that this trend will continue. Con counters that firstly, such an argument in no way demonstrates that a public benefit is not being derived by those who still attend church every week. Secondly, those deriving spiritual sustenance is not limited to those who fill the pews every week. While only 4% of Anglicans attend on a weekly basis, nearly twice as many visit at least once per month and on the holidays the benches do fill, with Easter and Christmas seeing 1.2 million and 2.3 million respectively[2]. Pro then states that more people fulfill their spiritual needs via mystics and fortune tellers than by the Church. A dubious claim which Con would contest should it make a difference, but Con only seeks to amend it by remarking that in our creature comfort society, capitalist services such as soothsayers, reality television and shoe shopping (i.e. Mrs. Frappe) provide more spiritual sustenance than the representatives of Yahweh, Shiva, Athena and Woden combined. The rub is that such are provided by for-profits entities and the recipients of these incomes can freely use profits for personal gain (and therefore taxed). If Pro wishes to lump the church into that little tangle, then Pro must prove that the Church operates like a for-profit entity, if not in letter, at least in spirit. Unfortunately Pro does not expand on this any further than to mention vicars riding around in nice cars, bishops living high on the hog and Kevin Copeland flying about in planes. With the exception of the latter, no hard data is cited. Mr. Copeland belongs more on Jersey Shore than he does anywhere near a non-profit. He is an example of excess and no one disagrees that excesses occur. And Copeland is not alone. Charity Navigator's 2010 CEO compensation study (Copeland is American, so forgive the American data) noted that the Educational Media Foundation won the \"most generously compensated CEO of a religious non-profit in America\" award, by giving their CEO $648,537 worth of benefits in 2008. That pales, however, next to the New York Philharmonic, which doled out $2,649,540 to its CEO, even though both organizations had similar levels of total expenses [3]. And in weeding out the outliers, median CEO pay paints a more striking picture. Out of the nine types of charitable institutions, CEOs of religious institutions averaged $90,000 per year, trailing far behind charities of Public Benefit ($168,490), Arts, Cultures & Humanities ($190,550) and Education ($272,645) [4]. With the Archbishop of Canterbury's salary at \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd55,660 (plus benefits) [5] a case for religious institutions being any more profligate than other non-profits with its compensation seems untenable. Pro then notes the muscular income the Church makes off its investments. The church makes a pretty penny from its investments, no doubt spurred on by its tax free status. To be sure, a wonderfully pregnant trove for a modern King Henry to do a little church sacking to fill the coffers, but it is relatively immaterial to this debate, for this debate concerns itself with the tax exempt status of religious institutions, not the nuancing of England's Charity Law regarding NFP investment incomes. All NFP's take advantage of this, so what is so egregious about a religious entity doing the same? Pro then notes that it is a moral obligation for the Church to maintain historic buildings, a moral obligation that in no doubt is a public service (though some of that lavish living money is going to have to make up the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd4.68 per visitor shortfall Durham Cathedral has got going on). Pro then insinuates that the church is derelict in this duty because it has decommissioned some churches into condos and pubs. Does Pro suggest that such parishes be kept open, when it is obvious to even the Church that the declining attendance levels no longer warrant the maintenance of the buildings or staff? Any NFP has the right to focus its resources in a manner which best allows it to provide services. Pro's last argument maintains that \"Charities are typically run by volunteers, with a small number of paid staff on modest incomes\" and then implies that the church does not do so. Again, unfortunately, Pro does not cite any data about how non-religious charities conform to this or how religious charities fail to do so. Many charities which do fit the bill Pro has suggested derive income by hiring outside for-profit consultants to fundraise. The Cancer Survivor Fund received $1,107,250 in contributions in 2010, but had $1,005,072 in fund raising expenses [6]. That's a lot of lawyers, accountants and executives getting well on donations. Even Andre Agassi's Foundation for Education (with celebrity do-whop Sir Elton John) paid for-profit fundraisers $2,014,469 to raise $7,536,463 in contributions [7]. Lucky for the Rocketman the foundation also made about $13 million in tax free investments. Perhaps, more interesting are the NFP's that don't fit Pro's vision of a typical charity [8]. Con concludes by begging the same question that Pro did. \"What's so special about the church?\" What evidence has Pro provided that demonstrates that the Church does not operate like an NFP, or that it fails to provide a public benefit? As Con has shown, Pro has made no systemic argument to support such. Con would also like to point out that most of the discussion has centered the Church of England and has ignored the smaller religious institutions of England. Are they to be taxed as well? Con is sympathetic to Pro's argument of declining relevance, but that points better to Disestablishment than it does to declaring religious institutions for-profit entities. Thank you. Despite Con's arguments, Con still hopes that Pro is successful with his centers. [1] http://www.anglican-mainstream.net... [2] http://www.churchofengland.org...

            "premise": "I would like to thank the esteemed I. A. M. A. Bench, Esq. for accepting this debate (I assume at least one of his given names must be Adolf in honour of his infamous relative) and for duly posting his rebuttals. Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't realise Hitler had any surviving relatives but if Herr Bench can prove he is, indeed, the Fuehrer's sole remaining descendant then, not only will he inherit the deceased dictator's castle in Bavaria but also the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Nazi gold that is currently stashed in Swiss banks. With this being the case, I would expect him to join me in arguing that the richest 10% of citizens should be exempted from tax, but in the meantime, I would like to respond to his objections as follows: The proletariat would, indeed, protest if this policy was announced prior to an election, which is exactly why the Republican American Presidential candidate Mitt Romney is so evasive about his tax policies: all he will is say is that he wants to cut them; but he won't say who will benefit (although I personally suspect the rich will benefit more than the poor). Furthermore, here in Britain, the Conservatives were elected and the first thing they did was slash public spending to pay for tax cuts for the top 5% of earners (they didn't mention this in their election campaign, of course, but that was always their plan). This shows it is possible to squeeze the poor until their pips squeak and get away with it - and it's all made possible by ensuring you have the political and financial backing of the bosses of big business and media moguls - which is easy because they are wealthy people who benefit from tax cuts for the rich. You see, democracy may exist in theory, but in practice, members the old Establishment still control the levers of power. Finally, I agree that the government shouldn't give money to big business to create jobs, if they have any money to spare, they should give it to toffs like me - I would happily use the money to employ some forelock-tugging skivvies to attend to my every whim and desire, but I\"m not asking for that, all I'm asking for is to be exempted from tax, along with the other 10% most wealthy citizens.

            "discussionTitle": "Debate: Churches ought to pay taxes",
            "conclusion": "Debate: Churches ought to pay taxes",
            "premise": "This is my response for Round 4, the final round of the debate. I\u2019d like to thank Thett for coming out of retirement to debate this with me. Since this is my final response for the debate, I will not be introducing any new arguments to the debate. I will be mostly responding to what Thett says in R3. Religion is a social good The first point of contention that Thett brings up here is in claiming that churches will have to hire armies of lawyers to pay their taxes. This isn\u2019t true, as the only reasons for hiring a tax attorney is for if you are in debt with taxes, issues with tax returns, facing criminal investigation, or are going to US tax court [1]. None of these would likely happen under my plan, thus this argument doesn\u2019t work. Next Thett argues for his notion that churches will have to \u201cchange their business model\u201d and thus the bottom line of churches will have to shut down. That churches have operated under the model that they don\u2019t have to pay taxes and thus altering the model to having to pay taxes will make churches shut down. I find this notion unwarranted because it assumes that churches or church leaders are extremely irresponsible with money. It assumes that church leaders will literally forget that their is a church tax, then spend the entirety of their budget, and then not be able to pay the taxes. The possibility of this happening, realistically, is extremely low. The amount of churches that will actually be affected by this mismanagement of money is so low that I find it silly to see this as a feasible impact for Con\u2019s side. Regardless, dividing $26,000 among 50 congregants is $520 per congregant, or around 0.01% of the average income [2]. Given the average giving to church per congregant is $1,038 [3], paying all of the taxes will be no problem. The only impact left on Thett\u2019s side for this is the implication of mismanagement of money, which is a slim impact at best.What does \u201cchanging their business model\u201d even mean? And what makes having to change it bad? I don\u2019t see any negative impact in changing a \u201cmodel\u201d that would cause churches to close. The link between taxing churches and churches closing doesn\u2019t work, since it is unwarranted and proven to be sustainable by congregation members. The only way a church can close is if they cannot pay off expenses (since it isn\u2019t for-profit, it's for-religion, profit of a location is irrelevant) and I have shown that congregations will be able to fairly easily. Lastly, Thett calls for me to justify church taxation. This seems strange to call out this late in the debate, but I justify taxing churches through my framework and every argument I have made. By my uncontested framework, if taxing churches is a greater societal good than a harm then taxing churches is justified. That is why taxing churches is justified. Even regardless of that, Thett\u2019s quick argument about the government providing roads and police protection ignores the fact that churches also take advantage of police protection and road transportation. Thus, by Thett\u2019s own argument churches ought to pay taxes. Economic Benefits Alright, here I messed up big. Thett is right, legitimate operating expenses are tax deductible, did not know that until now. This essentially destroys most of my case, since by my own argument, 71% of income goes to operating expenses while the rest, 29% goes to charity. It isn\u2019t exactly realistic that a church would only spend money on two things, and the third thing they spend it on would be taxable. But I said what I said, and since this is the last round I cannot take that back. That means that based on an income tax, the government would be getting a portion of the 0% of taxable profits, or 0$. This means that my income tax part of my case is negated, making the amount of money the government gets through my plan is $7.9 billion through property taxes. The next point of relevance comes when Thett argues that I can\u2019t just assume that the money collected in taxes from churches would be donated to charity. Thett argues that it is not realistic to believe that the government would spend the money on charity. Since I am the affirming side I am allowed to put forth a plan in which to affirm the resolution, as long as it affirms the resolution I am allowed to use that plan. My plan, as I stated earlier, is to donate the collected money to charity. This is allowed and will happen under my plan. Church and State Thett responds to my argument by saying that the majority of Americans believe that religion should not play a role in politics because the Pope had to apologize after criticizing Trump. This argument doesn\u2019t work, it's an appeal to popularity. Just because the majority of people believe that religion should not play a role in politics doesn\u2019t mean that religion shouldn\u2019t play a role in politics. Thett further argues that all it takes is one religious endorsement contrary to public good to sway the election and produce a negative result, and thus negative impact. This doesn\u2019t work since endorsements are a neutral value. A religious organization could just as easily endorse a candidate for the public good than a candidate against the public good, and thus there is no impact either way here. It is a neutral value. The notion that a government relies on the church for legitimacy makes no sense and is unwarranted. The only way that Thett has proposed that religious organizations retaliate against the government is through getting involved through politics through endorsements, which as I just showed has no case. Thett\u2019s entire argument based on separation of church and state relied on the church getting involved in politics through endorsements, which I proved is neutral. Thus Thett\u2019s argument here is negated. Conclusion Through my plan $7.9 billion is raised in taxes. Given that $28 billion is used to save 6 million lives, $7.9 billion will be used to save 1.7 million lives. Even if we accept Thett\u2019s unwarranted link between churches closing and taxes, and then accept that the link is logically sound, the argument still doesn\u2019t work because reduction in people attending church leading to an increase in stress and depression is outweighed by the 1.7 million lives that are saved. In order for Thett\u2019s impacts to outweigh mine, about 6 people would have to die per congregation as a result of taxing churches (1.7m/300k.) This is not realistic given Thett\u2019s argument, thus I win this debate. Peace and Love [1] https://www.supermoney.com... [2] https://en.wikipedia.org... [3] http://amiccs.com...",

In the United States, the form of government is ran mainly by the people in which citizens are required to vote potential candidates into office that will make political decisions that abide by constitutional law. Unfortunately, many of these candidates and elected officials use religious based propaganda in order to persuade voters into making political decisions based on their religious beliefs and use their religion to dictate legislation. However, this is in direct violation of the 1st Amendment of the United States constitution which grants ALL citizens of the U.S. the right to \"freedom of religion\" or the freedom to exercise the religion of their choice and laws are required to be based on secular ideologies instead of religious based ones. However, many religious people, Conservative Fundamentalists Christians in particular, cannot seem to comprehend this, and through politics, they use their religion to take away personal freedoms from others (despite being against \"big government\") and use the Bible, and other forms of religious documentation to dictate legislation. The United States is not a theocracy and the Bible, Koran and Torah are NOT valid forms of documentation when determining what laws and freedoms the American people have.

            "conclusion": "Tax-exempt/tax-deductible status for the poor and homeless...",
            "premise": "Most people don't understand the point of tax-exempt/tax-deductible status for poor and homeless people. Having been on that side of the fence, and having a modicum of experience with the 501(c)(3) criteria, I intend to provide arguments to support my idea of tax-exempt, or tax-deductible, status for poor and homeless people. Legally, corporations - especially tax-exempt non-profits, - are considered legal entities... not unlike human beings. They're \"born\" when they're incorporated; they're fed by the donations and profits they receive; they dress in buildings, and use tools to work; they learn, by keeping records; they keep themselves healthy and functional, with the help of their volunteers and employees; their brains are their boards of directors; their immune systems are the screening processes for volunteers and employees, and legal counsel; they make statements, and follow rules; they grow old; they can develop viruses and cancers, in the form of corrupt employees, volunteers and board members; they can perform first-aide on themselves with limited liability, and get surgery done on themselves by firing or getting rid of the cause of their problems; they can be insulted by other organizations, and injured legally; they can bleed out resources, and starve without resources or profits; they must make up a will to leave their assets to another corporation, in many cases; and, they can even die. The question is: since the Law already recognizes tax-exempt organizations as being legal entities, and human beings are also legal entities, why can't human beings receive tax exemption? If homeless and poor individuals could solicit donations and volunteership from others, without repercussions, and not have to pay taxes on the charity they receive, the government would be able to shut down all kinds of programs that are not only operating in the red, but are also a burden to the average taxpayer. People would be more inclined to act charitably which, if history and psychology are any indicators, would inspire them to a higher standard of morality; nearly-simultaneously reducing illegal and immoral activity on an exponential level, and eventually inspiring them to selfless acts of kindness. In my humble opinion, win-freakin'-win, baby! Other reasons are as follows: I know a lot of people dislike the I.R.S., and want to get rid of them. Their mantra is, \"No Taxation, Without Representation!\". But, from my perspective, the Bible advocates using corrupted systems for whatever good they can provide. It also advocates joining with your enemies, to work toward a common cause... Here's why I believe that tax exemption would be good for individuals: I~ They could get the help they need, when they need it. II~ People could rest easy; knowing that their donations and volunteership are going to people who need it, in the way that they need it, and knowing as well that these people are subject to the same laws that govern other tax-exempt non-profits. III~ In return for donations and volunteership, tax-exempt individuals could give tax write-offs to people who want something in return... which would be almost as good as cash. With fewer taxes being collected, and more people getting what they need to get out of their bad situations into more stable ones, the economy will naturally revive more rapidly than any \"stimulus\" plan could ever accomplish the goal. IV~ They could get whatever they need, from the right sources, ensuring they get the best they can get... including medical help when, and in the way, they need it... hence, ensuring the uselessness of the new \"universal health-care\" laws. V~ People with this tax exemption would be able to file for it for no cost, ensuring that nobody would have to do without. VI~ Keeping proper records, these same people would be relatively free from government oppression and the \"nanny-state\". VII~ It would seriously hurt only the corrupt organizations, which would ensure a change in their policies that would be necessary for them to actually do what they say they're designed to do. VIII~ They could invest in future needs, without actually wasting the donations or volunteering they receive. IX~ At the final fulfillment of their needs, they could re-incorporate for a for-profit business; relinquish their tax exemption; or incorporate with other tax-exempt individuals into a non-profit, tax-exempt organization, with which other individuals could affiliate... ensuring unity of all the interested and involved people, and organizations, under one common cause: the betterment of their fellow \"man\". Of course, some would argue that homeless and impoverished people usually don't have to pay taxes... after all, you can't get blood from a stone, right? That's yet another part of the point: they're already half-way there!",

            "premise": "Prequel arguments: Q- Fair enough... Never claimed to be a lawyer, after all... Bible reference: \"--yes, and we do not owe poor people anything.\" Perhaps \"owe\" was the wrong word for me to use... however, it is mandatory for any believer to look after the welfare of the poor, as best they can; and, in the past, God did destroy entire civilizations for a lack of charitable compassion. One example is found in Ezekiel 16:49... some of Sodom's sins are listed as, \"... pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness... neither did she strengthen the hands of the poor and needy.\" \"--and we still do, through the church. key word \"church\". it is not the governments place to administer charity.\" Were this a few decades ago, I might wholeheartedly agree with you. However, the fact remains that laws have been passed for the government to control the administration of charity. In our Constitution, amendments are allowed for the purpose of ratifying and clarifying those laws. In states, counties, and individual cities, laws are likewise passed for the purpose of regulating more general laws that might otherwise be abused. Why not flip it around, and use a legal loophole to regulate the abuse of legalism? ------------------------------------------ I think I get where you're coming from on this, now... however, I must still disagree on some level. The fact that suffering can bring about some greater meaning or benefit does not negate it's evil. As a matter of expediency, were suffering abolished, it would enrich the quality of life; after all, if good can come from suffering, and suffering limits the quality of the benevolence it produces, it stands to reason that suffering dilutes meaning (where meaning is related to beneficiality). Further, if such meaning can be achieved without suffering, it stands to reason that meaning without suffering is more expedient. This is the argument of the Christian faith, and other forms of monotheism and \"universal\" religions (religions that extend beyond demographics of any kind): that suffering, rather than being an aide to meaning, is a hindrance thereto; and, the goal of the adherent thereof is to abolish as much suffering as he can, as the Almighty allows. While suffering can bring meaning and purpose to life, it is only necessary as long as the suffering persists; and, in my perspective, it is expedient to abolish suffering, and focus the purpose on an attempt at greater happiness. ------------------------------------------- This argument reminds me of the argument made by Abraham Maslow, in his heirarchy of needs. However, the question would then be whether or not the quality of life was enhanced by the need, or the fulfillment thereby. I watched the video, and it is a very convincing arugment; however, I rather hold the position that it is not self-gratification that causes us to seek an abolition of suffering... rather, I hold the position that it is the selfless desire of one for the benefit of others, that causes such a quest. While we may feel some gratification from the accomplishment of a goal, it is my contention that such gratification is only peripheral; and a result of our satisfaction in knowing that others are no longer suffering. There is, as I'm sure you're aware, a noticeable difference between the actual suffering which I'm covering herein, and the desire for greater happiness: one is the deliberate cultivation of something, while the other is a loss of it. God does use hardships to bring us closer; however, we need to get closer to Him for a reason. In the story of Job, Satan - the antagonist, - was attempting to cause suffering, to turn a man against God. God proved that a man will remain faithful, even in spite of suffering; and, as a result, his goal became to alleviate Job's suffering, by reimbursing him twice what he lost. --------------------------------------------- ~~~~~~~~~points~~~~~~~~~~~~ I~Indeed, ironic; however, I'm not sure that \"contradictory\" would be the right term... both philosophies, and the Christian faith, seek to alleviate suffering on some level... From the very beginning, however, it was the Maker's plan that we enjoy life, rather than suffer. God is not willing that any of us perish, but that all of us come to repentance. Furthermore, God provides a way to escape the suffering that leads to suffering. II~ 1. The tax-deductions would encourage people to donate directly to those who need the resources most. With those resources they could get housing, food, clothing, and everything else they need. Thus, these tax-deductions would encourage greater and more effective charity; not to mention the influx of capital into the market. 2. You and I will probably have to differ on the idea of total hereditary depravity. It is my contention that the Bible supports the position that mankind becomes sinful, because of the effects of sin on the environment and pressure from people in one's life; rather than because of inheriting sin or sinfulness. We could cover this later. III~ I'm talking specifically about income tax; not sales tax. Sales tax is far less burdensome. 1. Monitoring it would alleviate suffering from abuses of the system. This monitoring would be a joint effort, between the government and the people; as our government was meant to operate in the first place. 2. Exactly my point. Suffering is an exception to the rule, which causes us to change in response. Therefore, rather than being crucial to meaning, suffering is sometimes indifferent, and often antithetical. IV~ With the passing of this bill, it would no longer be legal to prevent people who are homeless or poor from soliciting funds, like a charity. V~ Tax-exempt status goes hand-in-hand with tax-deductible status. Many wealthy individuals give to charity, for tax-deductions. Hence, giving poor and homeless people tax-exemption would give the rich more opportunities for tax-deduction. VI~ One point of this bill, however, is to give the people greater control over their own funds, allowing for a transition of power back to the people in a way the government really can't afford to deny. VII~ The problem is, if suffering were a truly natural part of life, there would be no desire to alleviate it. The very nature of suffering is to upset a delicate balance. Sin itself is one of the causes of some forms of suffering, but sin is not natural. VIII~ I literally didn't have one red cent to my name. I may not have lived in a war-zone, but I have gotten water from the ground, and done things I don't want to mention here (not illegal). IX~ Correction: we don't lessen the income of the entire government. We cut waste out of the equation. It's wasteful to give millionaires an additional government salary. ------------------------------- 1. Less tax-money, means less money for pork spending and politicians. Less money for pork spending and politicians, means an end to government waste... not an end to necessary programs. 2. I agree that I plan to use the government, using this method. However, like suffering, authoritarian tools can be used for beneficial purposes, as well. As to the statement, \"The poor you will have with you always\", this is a fact, which cannot be denied. However, the number of the poor is entirely up to us. It is my contention that the only thing stopping us from lessening that number is the conspiracy between big government, and big business... especially in the charitable sectors. Questions ------------------ 1. I don't know exactly how much; however, considering last years budget, the number of people on the street, and the current cost of living: probably billions, if not more. 2. The tax breaks encourage people to give directly to people who need it. 5.I wish I could, but there isn't enough space. I'll certainly try my best. 5.5. Exactly my point: using the government to change the government can work. 6. I'm sorry to hear you had to endure that kind of thing",

            "premise": "Thank you very much for this debate, it has been enjoyable. Now, let's finish this off, shall we? As I stated previously in this debate, using a religion is similar to using a philosophy. The origin is different, but using it as reasoning or a starting point for your belief is not in itself wrong when considering representatives. It's a much smaller mix of church and state, but it is not denied by the constitution unless you want to add words to it. I'm confused as to your points regarding the court. You say the government is off balance when religion is used as reasoning behind laws, but you concede that if the courts deem it unconstitutional it'll get shut down. That's the balance I was talking about, and therefore the lack of balance you state exists in fact does not exist. We ought to let people use their beliefs as representatives for the reason that it makes the environment more secular not less, and the law may be debated, and if a minority of people disagree with the majority it can be challenged by the government's own system. My next point will concern your analogy of being pro-slavery and using religion. I would consider that a false analogy. When a representative uses his belief system as a beginning point for his belief is does not constitute the equality of oppressing a demographic. They're too completely different levels of reasoning, and one can easily be shut down by the constitution while the other may not. Regarding your point on the majority agreeing, again I being up that the minority in a situation may still strike down oppressive bills. I would also add the Presidential veto on such bills, and then again, the Supreme Court will be hearing about such a bill as you use in your analogy. I do apologize for the misunderstanding, but my point regarding the people creating the laws was lead through the election of representatives. For clarification, if a district elects someone religious into office because they agree with their stance, then the representative's job ought to be to represent the people not the Constitution. Elections become irrelevant if the representatives aren't allowed to represent the people. My point regarding getting shut down when arguing for a religion was meant simply to serve a point. If you allow the degree of church and state I argue for, then there's nothing wrong with it. If someone tries to go further, then no harm was done because no one will listen to them except maybe a few friends. Your example of Rick Perry is somewhat non-topical as each state has their own constitution aside from the national constitution. The national constitution was made solely for the dictation of the federal government, and in instances where it is specifically clarified, the states. Each state, however, has their own constitution. I don't know the Constitution of Texas by heart, but it is irrelevant to the debate. To summarize, I'll bring back up some of the larger points. One of them I didn't spend a lot of time on. I did bring it up, however, and it was ignored (whether intentionally or unintentionally) by you. It's my argument regarding how something which is meant to be all inclusive should work. By definition it should not exclude religions. We did not create a government that was supposed to be against using religion, but rather, it was meant to be one which included all beliefs. If not all beliefs are included, we go against what our government is designed to be. I would also like to bring up representation. I don't believe this has been adequately attacked. As stated above, if the representative is not allowed to represent his people to the fullest, he is in violation of his duties, the Constitution, and the ideals of a representative government in itself. There is an extent that using religion can be oppressive, but there's an extent it isn't. I touched upon this in the debate, but simply put I will use some agreed upon arguments. When religious arguments get used too much or to too great of an extent it gets shut down. There's already a fail safe for religious representatives, and in respect the their jobs, they must be allowed to use their personal beliefs to represent the people who elected them because of his personal beliefs. Again, thank you for a great debate, and now I leave it up to the voters.",

            "conclusion": "The government should tax churches to fund ethically-aware, women-only drop-in centres",
            "premise": "Originally Con's retort was a dense, tightly worded rebuttal to Pro's contention that the centers he proposes be women only, but after obliterating the 8,000 character limit, a different tack was required. Despite the obvious levity of the debate, a meaty issue exists, one which becomes heartier as one travels eastward over the Atlantic. While Con is a lot more familiar with the issue of the church and taxation in America, the question was poised in merry England, and home field advantage is acceded to Pro. The debate shall be limited to the taxing of religious institutions in England, as England's maintenance of an established church, her lack of a separation between church and state, and the differing legal and tax systems between England and America would make any attempt to discuss both devolve into two debates. However perfectly luscious Pro's suggestion of the destination of the earmarked funds may be, to what purpose the ring fenced funds are destined is relatively immaterial to the primary issue and will not be directly addressed by Con. Religious entities are one of the thirteen classes of charitable bodies recognized in the Charity Law which are exempt from most taxes in England[1]. Such entities are considered to provide a public benefit. The failure of Pro to mention taxing not-for-profit institutions other than religious ones allows us to deduce that Pro does not advocate the doing away with the Charity Law , or amending it in a manner other than removing religious entities from the Charity Law's recognized list. To do so, it is incumbent on Pro to prove that religious institutions do not provide public benefits in a manner which is inconsistent with the public benefits provided by other, non-religious not for profits. Pro will be hampered in proving this. Pro must not only discard the tangible social services which religious institutions dispense, the maintenance of historical buildings and the providing of a center for a community, but also contend with the spiritual services they provide. Psychologists generally regard spiritual wants as a human need[2]. A certain percentage of the population fulfills this need religiously. Even if one can personally write off religion as needless hocus pocus as easily as Mr. Bradlaugh could and instead fulfills his or her spiritual needs via a lager and the bi-curiosity of an assertive vegan Asian girl, one cannot be so contemptuous as to think that they know the best manner in which others ought satiate their spiritual needs. Just as some citizens of AR 72046 [3] find benefits from the not-for-profit services of The American Legion Post 168, The England Youth Athletic Association or the Sunny Day School Inc. (Childcare), some also find benefits from the one of the seven not-for-profit religious entities there. Con can state, from at least personal experience, the benefits provided by an American Legion Post are as much spiritual as they are anything else. Pro maintains that religion uses fear mongering tactics to cull money from their congregations. Fear mongering, naturally, cannot be construed as a public benefit. It is granted that the church makes itself feel needed, but hardly is such unique to the world of charity. Making one feel needed is not the same as fear mongering. Breast Cancer awareness has scared so many athletic teams so quickly into wearing so much pink that only Palermo's Rosanero can be assured of being ahead of the curve. But making one feel needed is different than fear mongering and with semantics aside, are religious institutions particularly more proficient in this area when it comes to squeezing pennies out of pensioners? Certainly a plausible case could be made for a good deal of its history. From its apogee of fear when Pope Innocent mildly humiliated poor King John (perhaps thereafter being humiliated in quick succession by the French and then his own drinking buddies was the harsher medicine), the Church has admittedly made good use of scaring the hell out of (or into) its flock and its less than enthusiastic followers. This fear, however, has been on the wane for quite sometime. Earthly fears started replacing heavenly fears as Henry, Mary, Elizabeth and Cromwell ran amok. The Age of Reason laid out the framework for removing these fears from aristocrats and the industrial revolution democratized them, enough so by the 1880's, even the Conservatives had to finally concede Charles Bradlaugh his duly elected seat in Parliament[4]. People questioned religion through science. In the generation between Lyell and Lord Kelvin the earth aged ten-fold. Darwin made folks question the literal handiwork of the creator and from that people questioned the bible. Science unfolded the mysteries of the universe. Church attendance went into a long decline as it fought a rearguard action against secularism. By 2010, only about a million souls still shuffled into the Church of England houses of worship on a weekly basis, representing just 2% of England and 4% of Anglicans[5]. These people, well worn end-notes of a 1,500 year old rolling saga, will weather no opprobrium should they not attend nor tithe. Failing to do either so earns no serious threats of eternal damnation from the pastor nor social stigma from society as a whole. In fact, in some urban areas, the stigma may go in the opposite direction. They attend because they genuinely want to and give donations because it serves their interests, and gives them greater benefits, than other alternatives (it is granted, however, that a good many pew occupants may be henpecked husbands intent on avoiding the wraith of their better halves, but that's hardly the church's fault, unless of course the church married them in the first place, which incidentally, is also becoming a rarer and rarer thing [6]). If the Church is reduced to making a few fence sitters pony up some spare bucks on Pascal's Wager, then so be it, but that's far from fear mongering. And even should an unlikely case be made that the church scares its followers into donating by fear mongering, the collection plate isn't the church's primary source of income. About 20% of its income is made this way, with a similar block made by Gift Aid[7]. The remainder comes from investments, rents and fee based services. In England, the Church and other non-profits are not taxed on these sorts incomes, while in America they are in certain degrees[8]. Even Italy is considering it[9]. Taxing such is a potential source of income for Pro's ideas, but that's a different discussion, as well as Disestablishment. I will be looking forward to an intelligent and entertaining continuation of this matter in round 2. [1] http://www.legislation.gov.uk...

            "premise": "Preface: I am OK if we make the 3rd round the final round. Proposition: My challenge is what Con referred to later, which is my statement that joining society necessitates being taxed (essentially). I will rebut their attack to that here. One thing Con notes is that my philosophy treats money as the government's. In a literal sense, yes it is. All currency is government property, and the government is the only thing giving the dollar, pound, yen, etc. any value. However, that's probably not what Con referred to (I make that argument in case it was). The government needs money to run. No dispute there by Con. That money must come in the form of taxes. Taxing certain arbitrary groups more or less than others is unnatural. Ergo, taxing churches removes the arbitrary distinction (I will show the arbitrary distinction later when I defend my point that churches are businesses, thus validating my point here). Corporate Tax To quote Con, \"a corporation will make money to benefit its leaders/shareholders through financial profit.\" Well, most churches do this. The church leaders are paid a salary. This salary is generally proportional to the income of a church, just as with a business. In fact, the church leaders are the only group always benefited by a church. Con says a church seeks to benefit everyone else through charitable means. Nothing about being a church NECESSITATES this. None of the ones I went to growing up did such a thing. Let's remind ourselves that the purpose of a church is to be a place for worship or other religious activities, and that religion is not necessarily charitable. I had assumed that it was common knowledge that some churches require a tithe. This well off church [1] (I assume they're well off if they have a website) requires tithing. The social pressures go beyond merely standing outside of Walmart, but it often goes further in places like Utah. These ex-Mormons tell of how much one has to lose by leaving the church (and thus it loses financial support) [2]. 1-http://www.tfh.org... 2-http://exmormon.org... Counter-cases Con claims an economic stimulus constitutes an endorsement of religion. True, it creates an excessive entanglement, which is why it only should be given if the government can ensure it is solely used for secular purposes, and why I said it \"could\" be used. My preferred solution is simply allowing them to take advantage of small business tax credits. It shouldn't be any worse if a church goes under than if a bakery goes under. The so-called appeal to authority in this case is justified. Why? Because the argument the SCOTUS makes is justified by my earlier argument about taxation being the natural state. On the education system being underfunded, I meant that it is not evenly funded. It is often funded through property taxes (common knowledge), meaning that schools in poor areas are worse. Con claims the social security system is broken. Con doesn't show how, and SS is certainly working fine now. Con also says that paying the debt is no better than war. This is simply wrong. The problem exists. Reducing spending stops it, and begins to slowly chip away. More money helps solve it, or slows it down until Congress can get its act together. On the DoD waste, Con's source notes that the Pentagon is already working to get rid of the waste, and the money can still be used elsewhere. Economic growth Con's own source says that tax cuts harm the economy-essentially, a really low tax rate also harms the economy. This means there's a sweet spot-probably between 25 and 40 percent, which is where it's been for the Obama and Clinton administrations, which have had sustainable economic growth [common knowledge]. Thus, the current business tax rate is a lot closer to the sweet spot of economic growth than 0%. Conclusion Vote Pro to protect the separation of church and state, to give the government more money it can use, to call churches what they are (businesses), and because it will stimulate the economy, contrary to the Con's arguments.",

            "premise": "Agreed, a country must raise taxes to run a government though I question my opponents comment on the fact that pillaging is now illegal is a bad thing. I, personally, enjoy the fact that people can't run around burning and stealing. I also concede that there was a, emphasis on a, single group of Baptists who were trying to use the situation in Haiti to there advantage. However, the information that did not get to the media were all the other parishes that collected and sent money for actual aid to refugees. As far as the Jewish Orthodox Union using money for illegal activities is something that ought to be fixed, but you'll note that the Catholic Church does not use their tax free status for illegal activities. If you suggest that one example of someone(s) doing something bad ought to influence laws for everyone, then we ought to all be in single cells. there are people who use the ability walk outside so that they might steal from others which is certainly illegal. Your logic dictates that we should not be allowed outside. Islam is a religion of peace. Therefore, if a mosque is truly Islamic, donations will not be used aid terrorists. If it is a mosque of radical Islam, then the UN ought to be acting in order to shut down a terrorist cell. Additionally, I would like to point out that single examples should not influence all other examples. Furthermore, laws for taxation differ from country to country. I would like to point out that there are countries where a Church Tax[1] is imposed. So in certain countries, such as Denmark[1], you would first be speaking out cutting government support to the church. Also, I would like to point out that corporations such as Wal-mart con the government out of millions[2]. Isn't that a slightly bigger problem ( Wal-mart is also guilty of sexual discrimination, employment of illegals, and many other crimes[3][4]. I am much more fine with the church getting free money then with Wal-mart getting free money.) In conclusion, there are many counter-examples to the ones referring to the usage that my opponent has provided as to the activities of religious organizations, I have provided examples of other organizations that steal more money from the government than the church does and conduct other illegal activities, and I have pointed out that many governments grant financial support from the treasury to churches.

            "premise": "Thank you for accepting my challenge. To initiate my rebuttal, I would first like to address your statements in regards to religion and morality. You claim... \"I will be defining religion as a set of morals or belief system that involves a deity (god to enforce or create such beliefs)\"You cannot redefine what religion already is. Religion is defined to be the following...Religion (noun) - a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.http://dictionary.reference.com...If you want to use \" belief system that involves a deity\" as a basis in your argument, you must first specify which of the millions of deities in thousands of beliefs systems you are specifically arguing for. Otherwise, your claims regarding \"god\" and \"religion\" would be invalid and irrelevant.Now that that has been clarified, I would like to address your claim... \"First I would like to point out you're right about the 1st amendment, but what does it mean? Does it mean that religious people can't vote based on personal conviction? When it comes down to it that's the way everyone votes, but if there's a god involved then is it not okay?\" What is the First Amendment? The First Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that comprise the Bill of Rights. It prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. No where in the Amendment does it state that religious people are not allowed to vote based on their religious beliefs. In fact, restricting the right to vote based on personal conviction is in violation of the First Amendment and would be deemed unconstitutional. However, governmental authorities are required to remain neutral when determining laws and the First Amendment strictly prohibits the exploitation of personal religious beliefs for political control. 'The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from passing laws that will establish an official religion or preferring one religion over another.' The government is also prohibited from passing laws that infringe personal freedoms of others based on personal religious convictions.http://www.illinoisfirstamendmentcenter.com... You claim... \"Honestly, here's the truth, when a god is not involved there is no such thing as moral truth or universal morality.\" This is inherently FALSE. Humans do not need to believe in any particular god to have moral convictions. Morals vary upon the individual, not their faith. For example, murder is strictly prohibited in many religions, but if some people believe in gods that condone human sacrifices. As a majority, most people view murder as something that should be considered \"immoral\" but some religions condone murder, so which one is correct? The answer is determined by science, neurology and basic biology. Our innate determination of what is perceived as \"right\" and \"wrong\" are both influenced by society and by our brains. The frontal lobe is one of the four major divisions of the cerebral cortex. This part of the brain regulates decision making, problem solving, control of purposeful behaviors, consciousness, and emotions. Humans mainly know \"right\" from \"wrong\" of an action based on the consequences involved with said action, which could either be good, bad or neutral. Most humans who have a perfectly functioning frontal lobe know that murder without justification (such as self defense) is wrong based on the consequences associated with the action itself. http://scitechdaily.com...http://science.education.nih.gov...http://www.livescience.com... If the ideology that there is an afterlife is the only thing stopping someone from murdering others, they would be advised to seek professional help immediately. This also applies to people who claim that \"god wants them to murder someone\" etc... These are signs of sociopathy, not morality. \"What then is the best way to determine policy?\" The best way to determine policy, while abiding the laws established in the United States Constitution is to remain neutral on the subject. A government authority must consider...1. How does this affect society and the people in it? 2. Who will be affected by the passing of this law and how? 3. Does this decision abide by Federal and State Constitution law? \"If someone votes a Christian into office or a Muslim into office, then that's the decision of the body of voters. Under the representative system, this person is chosen to represent a body of people who share similar beliefs or desires as him or her.\" If the person elected into office is a devout religious person, they still have to abide by Constitutional law, if they cannot do that then they should not be in office. Sharing ideologies is one thing, oppressing others who do not share the same ideologies is discrimination. The LAW comes first, and their religion should remain a personal conviction not a public one. Doing otherwise is unconstitutional and is grounds for impeachment. It is not the job of elected officials to abuse political power through religious propaganda and self-promotion. \"I'm going to argue under the premise that God doesn't exist. Now I argue moral relativism, which I define simply being that morality is relative to the individual. Essentially, since there is no point in anything we do, whatever one feels to be right is what's right.\"Not quite. Even if we argue under the premise that \"God\" does exist we must determine which out of the millions of Gods out of the thousand of religions and which of the thousands of denominations that god belongs to. Otherwise we would be in the same situation you previously described. In fact, we are already in that situation, Christians versus. Muslims, Muslims versus. Hindus, Christians versus. Jews etc... \"For my final point, I would like to point out the logical contradiction in the policy. If we take away any religion, we are left with an atheist government. What's the problem with that? We are not establishing a religion, but we are establishing a belief system, which clearly contradicts the first amendment.\"The best way to regulate a religiously diverse society is to coexist and make laws that apply to a SECULAR society. The United Stated is a SECULAR society after all. Separating religion and government does not leave us with an \"atheist government\" nor does it contradict the first amendment. You, as a citizen, are free to practice your religion as you please but you are prohibited from establishing laws and policies that restrict others from certain rights and personal freedoms because it's against YOUR religion. In order for a government to be considered an \"atheist government\" there must be laws that restrict you of that right. Atheism and secularism are two different things. Also Atheism is not a belief system, because there is no specific set of beliefs that atheists follow, only a lack thereof. I await your response.",

            "premise": "Prequel arguments: Q- but my point is that your comparing them to corporations using that as justification to give them tax breaks, but when we follow this line of thought to its logical conclusion, it falls flat. that's my point, and it wasn't rely an argument, just food for thought. Bible reference: \"While I respect my opponent's research, I must disagree on the point about the Bible's perspective on taxation and government. Firstly, the remainder of the text reads, \"Give unto God what's God's\", thereby reminding us to give what is owed to those to whom we owe it.\" --yes, and we do not owe poor people anything. \"However, in ancient Israel, the Law of Moses demanded charity from the people; both in the form of personal charity, and in a form of taxation we know today as \"tithing\". If necessary, I can provide specific references; however, there are many references throughout the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy.\" --and we still do, through the church. key word \"church\". it is not the governments place to administer charity. ------------------------------------------ I never said that evil is neccisary first of all, if I remember correctly I actually said \"the Evil is not suffering, but the attempts to rob one of his or her suffering, thus making life incomplete and robbing him/her of meaning as a whole.\" evil is evil, but maby I should explain. suffering is not evil, it completes life and allows us to know meaning and through meaning is produced the value of life. but when you remove suffering, they you create a sort of sped up nihilism which, through consequence, causes the value of life to devalue. ------------------------------------------- I believe the confusion here is I may have been a bit vague in how this work, so I will explain it here: lets start at the beginning. most everyone has some sort of drive. drives are driven by the self and what we deem \"important\". now we must ask the question \"what drives us to want to help others?\". the answer is simple, because of the way it makes us feel, it makes you feel good. this point is made by zizek and explained clearly, its only a few minutes long, blease, I ask you to watch this: http://www.youtube.com... and also, talking from a biblical point, on the contrary, god uses hardship and suffering to bring us closer to him (thereby giving us meaning and creating value to our life). take jobe for instance. he had everything, money, a loving family, power, and he loved god. Satan asked god if he could tempt jobe, and god allowed Satan to basically ruin jobes life, yet as jobe reaccounts, in the end, it brought him closer to god. --------------------------------------------- ~~~~~~~~~points~~~~~~~~~~~~ I~first, I just want to point out how ironic and contradicting it is that my opponent, who uses the Christian bible to support his points, quotes Buddha and Lao tzu.... second , this answer is only proof of what I say. he said \" it is this competition that causes unease and unrest. Suffering causes us to feel impending doom. While useful, it is useful as far as the compulsion to alleviate suffering. One may wonder if it's suffering that is necessary, or effort.\" -it is this fear of an impending doom that drives us as people to do better and to denounce our apathetic and sinful nature. thus without cause, there is no drive, and they would completely lose sight of meaning. II~ 1. but your only proposing tax breaks.... your ideas specifically would not affect the homeless, no where in your points did u mention of any sort of housing programs. 2. even the bible supports this. the bible states that human beings have an inherently sinful nature, and apathy is not of god, therefore is apart of our nature. also, were is your evidence? examples? III~ and we are at war right now, and there was taxes before ww2, just allot more pressure put on paying them in ww2. 1. but why would you monitor it? Didn't you say that you believe suffering is bad? You've just contradicted your whole thesis here. also, our govt is so big that every aspect of it is subject to abuse, what makes this an exception? 2. the only reason people go into survive mode is because of the impending doom they see when in times of suffering. this is not the rule of human nature, merely an exception. IV~ if its purely from the private sector, how can you grantee that they will receive it? how can this even be affected by your bill?... its to vague of a point... V~ but that has nothing to do with tax exemptions... also, how exactly are tax exemptions for the poor going to make richer people become more charitable? sounds like your making quite the assumption here... VI~ not exactly.... look at our govt at the beginning of the U.S. and compare it to now. it have gained an exponential amount of power over us. this is proof of my claim. history proves. go read some ayn rand, she explains this. VII~ the bible does, \"do unto others as you would have done unto you\". but (as supported by the example of jobe), suffering is a neccisary part of life, if you can I would ask you to read the first chapter of the will to power by Nietzsche. it explains this very clearly. VIII~ you obviously don't know what poor is... go visit any 3rd world country, come back, then give me your definition of poor. IX~ so we lessen the income of the govt before we take care of this? that would only result in the multiplication of our deficit.... ------------------------------- but how do tax breaks affect homeless people? ------------------------------- reffer back to the example of jobe for my answer on this. also, im not advocating util.... im only advocating the logical framework of thought utilized by Kant.... nothing more. ------------------------------- 1. you only propose a tax exemptions... how do you solve for frivolous spending? seems like your reaching a bit here... 2. I agree that \"Government isn't the solution... government is the problem\" as quoted by my opponent. But he seems to think that buy the govt handing out tradable tax credits and giving tax exemptions /reductions, that we can solve poverty..... first, that is using the govt, second, solving poverty is impossible. Jesus himself said \"the poor will always be with us\". Questions ------------------ 1. How much of the govt anual income from taxes would be reduced? 2. but how do tax breaks get homeless people to not be homeless any more? 3. got all i need on this one. 4. ok, got all i need here. 5.can you be a bit less vague in your explenation? 5.5. there was also slavery... and sexism on a larger scale... but america has changed for the better has it not? 6.for the reccord, me 2 man, I know where your coming from.",

            "conclusion": "Debate: Churches ought to pay taxes",
            "premise": "Fun debate. I. Religion is a social goodThe conclusion to this point is short and sweet. Vote Con if you think there is even a slight chance of taxation harming religious life. Throughout the entire debate there has never been any attempt to refute the actual impacts that I brought up in this contention. Religious experience betters a persons quality and quantity of life as well as increasing the positive influence they have on their community. Don't let these impacts get lost in all of the numbers thrown around in this debate.It is not remotely conceivable that taxing religious institutions would do anything but harm them. On the margins, extra expense burdens *always* harm the bottom line. This is simply a fact of business, and Hayd pretending like a $26,000 cost spread out over 50 \"customers\" (congregants) is nothing or that massive organizations like the Catholic Church wouldn't spend a ton of money on tax lawyers doesn't make his case any more credible. It comes off more as grasping at straws--he would've been better off to concede some impact and try to outweigh it, because it's incredibly clear that extra expense harms institutions ON THE MARGINS. Small churches that are already struggling will close. Services that are attended by fewer congregants will stop. Struggling branches of large religions, especially in under populated areas, will shut down. And with them community and social capital that has been built up over years, often generations, will vanish overnight. And all of this for nothing.He mocks my argument about a changing business model as vague, but when you're dealing with thousands of diverse institutions making any concrete assumptions is dicey. The point is that churches don't currently account for the extra expense that taxation would impose upon them. The apparatus used for financial decision-making would be totally upended, throwing the system into a state of flux. Hayd doesn't take this point seriously, but all serious businesses take precaution to avoid unnecessary instability. We don't know for sure what taxing religions would look like, but we can ascertain that they would be harmed ON THE MARGINS.I encourage everyone to go back to my opening case and reread my impacts, which are quite substantial. Nothing Hayd has to offer comes even close to outweighing what I bring to the table. II. Economic Benefits The progression of this argument tells you all you really need to know about the resolution. Hayds $71 billion has slowly been whittled down to 10% of what it once was. This is a case study in how all of the supposed benefits of taxing religions fall apart when subjected to close scrutiny. The only impact Hayd has left is the $7 billion or so that he says he'll get from property taxes. Except he won't because like I already said, many institutions will close down rather than manage such a large tax burden. Hayd argues that this money will be used for charity. First, you're still getting less money for charity overall because when you remove the non-profit status of churches you cannot stop them from keeping their incomes rather than donating them. I'm sure that many would continue to donate, but there are enough unscrupulous people out there (and far more money contributed to charity from the \"income\" pool) to more than make up for any gains that Hayd gets.But the most important thing to realize about his argument about using this money for charity is that it will not be used for that purpose. He has offered literally no reason to believe that the government would earmark the money for this purpose, and considering how property taxes are collected by municipalities I'm not sure how it would even be possible for the government to do this. He says that he's allowed to make a \"plan\" to affirm the resolution, but that's absurd if the plan isn't feasible. His plan could just as easily claim that the government would invest the money into a portfolio that would return 100x the money invested. Such investments exist. Would it be fair to claim that the government would be able to do something like this? No. And similarly, you can't assume that the money goes to charity. In reality, the money would go to municipalities where it would be a small drop in their buckets. Refer back to the impacts stated in my original case. While the benefits of Hayd's plan are distributed over tens of thousands of municipalities and thus diminished, the negatives are all centralized. The Catholic Church is the second largest employer in the United States. Subjecting them to billions of dollars in taxes means that many of those jobs are going to vanish. III. Church and StateThis point alone wins me the debate. Under Hayds framework, there would only have to be one instance where a politician was unduly influenced by a religious donor or endorser for the public good to be harmed and for me to gain an impact. We cannot forget that an endorsement from the Catholic Church would swing literally any presidential election. The results for 2016 are in, and once again Catholics were a pretty closely divided group. Trump won 52% of them, and Hillary won 45%[1]. Catholics represented nearly a quarter of all voters in an election where the popular vote was virtually tied. Say an endorsement from the Catholic Church would flip 20% of these voters either way. That would be the equivalent of a 5 point swing, enough to change the result of all but one of the past five elections[2]. In reality, the impact would probably be far larger. This is the power that Hayd will give to the Catholic Church. Not to mention the numerous legislative seats that could be flipped even more easily. All it takes is ONE TIME for the political opinion of the Catholic Church (or whichever religious institution won the race for a politician) to conflict with the common good for their to be an impact. Except this will happen all the time. If you want a Christian dominionism vote Pro, otherwise preserve the integrity of the state by keeping it separate from the church. All hail President Trump.

            "premise": "first off id just like to say thankyou to my opponent for this debate, and good luck :) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ prequel args: Q- \"The question is: since the Law already recognizes tax-exempt organizations as being legal entities, and human beings are also legal entities, why can't human beings receive tax exemption?\" well, looking purely from a legal stand-point, organizations can only receive tax exemptions if they are productive enough and meet the requirements, and I am certain that no homeless person meets the same criteria. Bible reference: the bible, however, does not advocate your stance on how to use the govt in any way shape or form. don't you remember? Jesus said \"give unto Caesar what's Caesar's...\" (Luke 20:20-26) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ so rather than what my opponent says, I propose we deny them tax exemptions, because: we need to allow suffering because without suffering we are excluded from meaning. the Evil is not suffering, but the attempts to rob one of his or her suffering, thus making life incomplete and robbing him/her of meaning as a whole. ~~~~~~points~~~~~ I~ In \"softening the world for them are we really helping them?\" without suffering, they have nothing to compare life as a whole to. thus, even if there life has positive experiences, they would not know so because you would have robbed them of the antonym of witch they could compare there meaning of existence. II~ 1st, homeless people wouldn't have taxes..... 2nd, the poor are poor generally because they rest too much, if they however, had un cushioned suffering, they would have comparison, and thus drive to do better, an causing them to find there \"meaning is suffering\" as Nietzsche would argue. III~ although \"excessive\" taxes are bad, the Govt does need money to run off of, and this would create a double bind: 1. tax exemptions would spread beond the poor, thus alleviating the suffering of a larger group and acting as a larger entity of evil -or- 2. people would be lazy, as is there nature, and would largely ignore the programs witch thus flattens your claim here IV~ this would be no better than the universal health care. here I advocate the status quo as it was prior to universal health care. lets \"NOT\" go the way that Canadian health care system, shall we? V~umm.... lets not go the way of Rome either... they fell majorly as a result of the fact that 51% of there population was on a Govt check, witch means that 49% of the population was providing for 100% of the population. VI~as long as the Govt exists, it will always be power hungry and even if your plan accesses this advantage, the nature of Govt will, inevitably, in time, over-write it. VII~how would it do this? also, extend my suffering argument. by alleviating suffering, we would be, consequentially, majorly harming the entirety of the U.S. population. VIII~They are poor for a reason.... do you really think they would wisely invest? also, extend my argument here about the volunteering/donations section. IX~so we bankrupt our Govt? I would ask \"if the Govt barely has enough money as it is, and really doesn't have any at all, and we lessen the income of the Govt, how will it pay for these?\" also, what % of the GDP would this take away? -------------------------------------- ....umm, homeless people don't pay taxes.... sooooo this would not affect half of the group you claim to help. ------------------------------------- now, I do believe that my opponent has good intentions, however, you know full well it is said that \"the way to hell is paved with good intentions\". He fails to Critically analyze the situation, witch is what I have successfully done. I argue that \" we should do what immanuel kant called 'public use of reason' as opposed to 'private use of reason'. for kant, private use of reason is purely expert knowledge: some authority tells you, 'we have this problem'; you propose solutions. public use of reason is something more radical, where you don't just solve problems, but think about a larger scope of, first, is the problem itself formulated in the right way? is this the true problem? why do we have this problem? you know, you don't just accept...\" (Zizek) -------------------------------------------------- ***Impact calc*** ============ 1. in his proposed world- we exempt people from taxes, but cause the govt to collapse by bankruptcy, and our health care system to go down the drain. also we rob a large portion (with the possibility of robbing almost the entirety of the population) of meaning. thus destroying the U.S. as it were. 2. my proposed world- we protect the necessity of the circle of life allowing individuals to discover there \"meaning in suffering\". also, we advocate for better health care, and we cause the Govt to flourish. and we arn't based off of false premises, we correctly analyze the situation. a critical framework of analization is necessary. Questions ----------- 1. how much of our GDP would this take out? 2. how do homeless people (and largely, poor people) pay taxes in any way shape or form similar to corporations? 3. would your points esentualy be the bill proposed? 4. how does the bible support your stance? 5. how would giving people free things heighten there morality? 5.5. what are your historical examples on the morality argument? 6. personally, what inspired you to to take interest in this matter?",

Everyone disagrees with at least one religion.If your a Christian, you probably disagree with Scientology, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and at least one branch of Christianity, Mormon, Catholic, and/or Protestant. The reverse is also true, if your a Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or Jew you probably don't want Christians to get a tax break. \"the Internal Revenue Service granted tax exemptions to Scientology organizations again in 1993.\" [0]We can't just give tax exempt status to the religion we see as the best religion. We must give the exemption to all or none. II. Religion tends to be partisanI will tell a brief personal testimony about going to church. I found the church to have overt conservative partisan bias. Misogynist remarks were made by the leader. \"God loves woman, but he loves men more.\" source church leaderThe same goes with a strong stance against abortion and socialism. I've found that I am hardly alone. \"Think about the sets of issues that are often at the core of the identity of the working-class folks who elected Trump: religion, personal liberty's relationship with government, gender, marriage, sexuality, prenatal life and gun rights.\" [1] A major part of Donald Trump victory in November 2016 was due to Christianity. More and more the conservative party has aligned itself with Christianity and Christianity with the conservative party. Note, other religions tend to sway towards conservative values by preaching traditional gender roles.\"They are conservative, believe in hard work, family, the military and cops, and they know that abortion and socialism are evil, that Jesus Christ is our savior, and that Donald J. Trump will be good for America.They are part of a growing movement in rural America that immerses many young people in a culture \u2014 not just conservative news outlets but also home and church environments \u2014 that emphasizes contemporary conservative values. It views liberals as loathsome, misinformed and weak, even dangerous.\" [2]Churches are effectively breeding grounds for conservative values. Since it is common knowledge that most of the USA is Christian it is time for liberals to take a stand. Time to demand an even playing field by removing religious institutions' tax exempt status. III. Tax exemptions take money from the poor.The basic theory of economics is that resources are finite. Religious institutions literally often take prime real estate. Prime real estate without paying the full price. This means the poor and middle class have to take up the slack. \"The property taxes they aren\u2019t paying have to be drawn from business owners and private citizens \u2014 in a real sense, you and I are subsidizing Mormon temples, Muslims mosques, Methodist churches.\" [3]IV.

            "premise": "\"Your first point makes a point of saying that the law restricts representatives from using their religion. I'm sorry, but I beg to differ...\"I'm sorry but I think you are completely misinterpreting what the amendment is actually saying. It says \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" which means Congress is prohibited from establishing any form of national religion under constitutional law. It also states that \"...or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\" which means, like every other U.S. citizen, elected officials are allowed to PRACTICE the religion of their choice and this is protected but they CANNOT use their political power to pass laws regarding their religious beliefs. This would be in direct violation of the First Amendment because using one particular religion to pass laws would be classified as a government action that unduly favors one religion over another. The First Amendment also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion.Please read this - http://www.law.cornell.edu... \"Therefore, so long as representatives are voting and debating (just a vote and some argumentation that doesn't infringe on anyone) instead of creating a theocracy, they're perfectly justified in exercising their religion.\" Actually they cannot. When debating the passing of new laws congress must take into consideration the reasoning behind their stance behind the law. They must also express their stance to the courts who will then decide whether of not their stance is a valid one. If the only reasoning they have in support or opposition of law is their religion, they are automatically in violation of First Amendment law, the same law they took an oath to abide by. \"The point of a representative government is to represent the people.\" While this is true, it is only true to a certain extent. Elected officials have an obligation to represent the people, however they can only represent the people so long as they abide by constitutional law, if they do not, their representation is overruled.\"If the representatives don't represent, then they were elected in vain creating an oppressive government who allows people to elect people who want to vote the same way as them, but they're not allowed to because people that don't like religion said so.\" Actually this is not correct. Establishing laws that ALL citizens are required to follow based on ONE particular set of religious beliefs is oppression. The majority cannot use power in numbers to overrule the rights and freedoms of people they disagree with if it does not infringe their own rights. It doesn't really matter who they voted for or why, the law is still very clear on the subject and specifically states that the United States Constitution forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. It also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion. When it comes to the law, the citizens cannot abuse the power of elected officials to overrule the constitutional rights of other people. It can only be done under very specific circumstances and even then it still cannot interfere with the lives of other people. \"No law has created an official religion for the nation. People may use it as part of their personal belief system when voting, but no religion has been established.\" If the government allows the establishment of religious based laws, that would no longer be considered a secular government. It doesn't matter if the religion was made national or not, if religion is used to pass a law, that is using theocratic ideologies. \"I noticed almost all of them were debate (not establishment) concerning the LGBT community, although I would disagree that this is uniquely religious.\" I didn't say they were uniquely religious but many politicians and other elected officials have attempted to abuse political power by using religion as a basis for opposition. That does not work in the courts, which is why many of them have been denied. With the legalization of gay marriage in one state alone, many officials have attempted to pass bills that would prevent same sex couples from marriage, and they have all been struck down immediately because they were in direct violation of Constitutional law. \"The debate concerning abortion and birth control is a scientific debate.\" The scientific debate behind legalizing abortion is already very clear. http://www.prochoice.org...If you would like to debate on the topic I will consider it. Although it is not within my exact area of expertise. 'Some prominent pro-life organizations include The National Right to Life Committee, Pro-Life Action League, Operation Rescue, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Americans United for Life, the National Association of Evangelicals, Family Research Council, Christian Coalition of America, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon Church).' http://abortion.procon.org... \"Drug legalization is a scientific and philosophical debate.\" The scientific debate behind the legalization of certain drugs is also very clear. Drugs such as cannabis, Lysergic acid diethylamide etc, have little to no long lasting negative affects in humans. Whereas drugs like alcohol and tobacco are legal yet responsible for millions of deaths annually and are linked poor functioning in the brain and long lasting damaging effects including shorter life span, and lung/liver damage. They are also a danger to others and puts innocent people in potential risk, including and especially small children. http://www.who.int... http://www.who.int... The majority of American now support legalizing certain drugs, the ones that do not are a minority but mostly religious. \"Stem cell research and vaccinations are scientific debates.\" The scientific debate is also very clear on this as well. However these have also been religiously disputed. \"In the end, you're committing hasty generalizations concerning the arguments on these.\" I never denied that non-religious people were against these topics, nor did I ever say that ALL religious people were either. However, it doesn't change the fact that there are many religious Fundamentalists and elected officials who use religion as a primary reason for their opposition. I am not generalizing, I am merely bringing attention to one particular set of issues regarding the First Amendment. Laws are mainly determined by their affect on society. For example, rape is illegal. Why? Because rape is a violent crime and completely dismisses the victim's right to consent. It is physically, emotionally and psychologically harmful to the victim and this is all determined through scientific analysis (cause and effect). Under no circumstance is rape legal in the U.S. and those guilty will be prosecuted under the law. Through the First Amendment, the rights of the victim come first, not the religion. If this were the other way around, the religion would come first, for it would be the law and the right of the victim would be dismissed. This happens in many Muslim countries under Sharia law. \"You might not want to debate me in that, because you don't want to argue that god exists because if god exists then denying him the control of government is rebellion against him and therefore heretical.\" This proves my point. If you are arguing on the premise that god does not exist, why is this relevant? \"You're arguing that god and an afterlife are not fact.\" A fact is indisputable. The existence of these are not incapable of dispute therefore those aren't facts. Regardless of the reason they were elected, officials must abide by Constitutional law regardless of their religious beliefs.I await your response.",

Counter: Pro claims that Churches are corporations because they pay their workers. As I\u2019ve said before, all charities pay their workers too {2}. He claims churches aren\u2019t always charitable. As I\u2019ve earlier said, Churches can lose their tax exemption, such as Scientology. I will further comment that these church workers do pay income tax. Pro sources that Tithes are sometimes required, however nowhere in his sources is this shown to be required. In fact, his Source 2 deals entirely with \u201cExit Costs\u201d, and admits there are no financial exit costs. There are \u201csocial costs\u201d as Mormonism is a sub-culture, and leaving the sub-culture means losing a lot of the friends and family in that culture. This tends to be the same in all cultures/sub-cultures. Pro\u2019s sources don\u2019t show that the actual religion forces any tithing. The Source makes this clear. Voters should go through those sources to confirm. Sources: 2} http://bit.ly... Counter-Case II: \u201cCounter-Case\u201d / \u201cCases\u201d Summarization: Pro has made several claims, which I shall debunk here. Counter: Pro admits that economic stimulus is endorsement, and therefore is unconstitutional. He further moves to claim that SBTCs could be used. Is that not also endorsement, since they are being given advantage? To say a charity going under is as bad as a business going under in the name of increased revenue is a flawed notion. I will allow Voters to decide how their view these statements. Pro continues claiming that Scotus is right because they said so. Again, Appeal to Authority, as them merely saying something is so doesn\u2019t make it so. If they say our money is government property and taxation is natural, but my statements show the flaws in their views, then that means SCOTUS is wrong, until proven correct subsequently by Pro. Pro failed to show them to be correct, because merely sighting their \u201cauthority\u201d. Ergo, he is using an Appeal to Authority.Pro actually claims SS is working fine. By this reasoning, there is no need to further fund them. He says Education is unevenly funded. So instead of evening the funding, he will prefer to increase the budget unnecessarily. This is the very same inefficiency creating the fiscal issue of government. Pro ends his counter-case by saying that the DODs waste could be spent elsewhere. This is largely the point of my statements. Streamline, Restructure, and Show respect for the money the government takes from us. Don\u2019t increase taxes.No, increasing taxation to pay for the debt, rather than simply decreasing expense, is a flawed and philosophically bankrupt notion. Additionally, the debt is not serviced in the way Pro seems to think. We pay interest for a set amount of time until a bond is repaid. Effectively, we need not increase the money going to this interest (in fact, doing so would hurt our credit rating, as people buy debt in order to make a profit. Paying too fast lowers the profit by lowering yearly interests, hurting incentive to purchase bonds). Yes, my source mentions that the deficit increase can hurt the economy. Not the Tax Cut. The Increased deficit. We need merely reduce the expenditure, as I\u2019ve said several times, through increased efficiency and smaller government. Done right, this will lead to decreased or only slightly altered deficits. Thus the cause of economic slowdown will not be present, and lowered taxation will be able to increase GDP growth. As the economy grows, our revenue will ultimately grow, even with lowered taxation. Increased long-term revenue, with decreased expenditure, will eventually diminish the deficit to such as a point that the debt will shrink, perhaps not in absolute numbers, but as a percent of GDP (the current measurement for judging debt). Best Case Scenario, the deficit eventually vanishes as tax revenue increases (from economic growth, not tax rate increase) and expenditure decreases. Obama\u2019s economy, according to Pro, was a success. In reality, his unsourced statement is wrong. Economic growth was less than exciting. Their GDP growth was 2.1% average, much less than the 2.8% average from the preceding 28 years. This is highlighted by the fact that the average for the 28 years included 2 major recessions, and some smaller recessions {3}. Additionally, workforce participation (better than simple \u201cunemployment\u201d charts, which include people who have stopped looking {4}) has decreased under Obama. {5 / 6} Relatively poor economic growth is a sign of issues with Obama\u2019s economic policy. As Pro has failed to list charts or sources, I have nothing further to debunk on this count.As for Clinton, a lot of his success came from reduced expenditure growth, leading to a lower expenditure/gdp ratio {7}. Many point out that he also increased taxes, however as Forbes and Heritage points out, the economic growth actually increased after turning around and cutting taxes a few years in {8 / 9}. It was the growth after this point which was substantial enough to give Clinton his above-average growth. So while Pro says we saw economic growth under Clinton, the reality is that this growth came from decreased relative spending, and in the end, decreased taxes. As Pro failed to present either charts or sources, there is nothing further to say. Basically, as I\u2019ve been saying, the answer is increased efficiency and smaller government, combined with lower taxes, not larger. His comment in the conclusion basically says we should designate Churches as something other than what they are for the Tax Revenue, actually saying it protects Separation of Church and State, when it actually compromises it by giving Government power over Church money, and creating \u201cexcessive entanglements\u201d (to quote Pro). He says these entanglements can be avoided by requiring \u201csecular\u201d use of the money. The government created Secularization of Churches is a sign of compromising Separation of Church and State. No, Separation of Church and State is created by not taxing at all. He says it will give the Government more money to use, I say it gives them more money to waste. And eventually they will decide they need even more money to waste. What Charity will they reclassify next?

Closing Statement: Pro has failed to substantiate that Churches are corporations, or to defy my Cases that Churches are Charities. In fact, the subject of the Church makes up only a small part of his Round. Nothing else he mentions matters unless he can prove that Churches can be taxed. He hasn\u2019t. He has failed to show that Churches could lose 501C3 status, or that there is any grounds to remove Religious Tax Exemption. In light of this failure, nothing further about the use of the money matters, and actually suggests a desire to compromise Separation of Church and State and a gross breach of government/taxpayer faith by fraudulently miscategorizing Organizations, for nothing other than increased revenue.The fact is, Pro\u2019s views are founded in his Extreme Authoritarian notion that our Financial Property belong to the Government, which ultimately means our very lives are Government Property (without money, we have nothing). This is flawed and dangerous. It is against the very nature of a free nation, and is not compatible with any Western World. This is made worse if we support his idea that we can give false categorization to increase taxes, which gives further power to government to own us, as they need not even follow their own rules. If his views of our money are not adopted, his arguments entirely fall through. His cases rely on this Economic/Political Philosophy, and cannot survive without it (and barely survives with it).I remind Pro at this point that, per our agreement, he must not post any further arguments from here on. He can only sign the next two Rounds, as this is the final debate round. I have refrained from posting new Cases, and merely defended my already stated Cases/Counters, adding new Counters only in regard to his new statements. Any Cases/Counters/Defenses Pro attempts to post will be disregarded, per this agreement. Taxation is Theft. Vote Con. ==Unitomic==",

            "premise": "Argument 1: Tax exemption constitutes an endorsement of religion. Tax exemptions give these institutions more money. This is a simple fact. Regan v. Taxation with Representation (US Supreme Court) decided that a tax exemption has the same effect as a cash grant. This is unconstitutional. Argument 2: Tax exemption favors larger churches, which are often predatory. This credit varies from church to church. Your average church may pull in a good amount, but definitely not as much as Kenneth Copeland's church worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A larger amount of money would be taken from his church if it was taxed than your average church. This means the bigger churches (which don't need help) are helped more. Sadly, these big churches are often the predatory ones, taking money from sick people in exchange for a promise of healing that never comes. Argument 3: We need the money Source 1: http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Source 2: http://bigthink.com... According to source 1, churches have $300-500,000,000,000 in untaxed property. According to source 2, this could make us $71 billion per year. This could have paid for the war in Vietnam. This can pay for free college tuition (estimated cost $60 billion per year). This could be channeled into social security to increase benefits or to be saved for the future. It could be used to help the drastically underfunded VA. This money could be used for so many things that are a good for all of society.",

            "premise": "Thank you for the response. Now shall we continue? Onto your first point, I should address that the article you posted is a translation that is not technically included in the the first amendment. Now there is an extent where using religion for legislation is wrong, but it is not the extent you observe. I feel something necessary to this debate is actually something you used consistently through your last speech. I'll summarize it here, but it concerns points you made later in your later points. You consistently bring up the courts. Why is this significant? It gives the perfect balance for allowing representatives to vote and argue using their personal beliefs. You're ignoring the fact that the checks and balances were put in place so there wouldn't need to be a law against such acts, you just need enough people in the minority to have a problem with them. You bring up how these laws will be stood in front of the courts and denied, and that's exactly why there shouldn't be a specific law against them. There's already a system. I would also like to point out that you're right about representatives needing reasoning behind their stance. That's why they get elected. They're able to convince enough people to stand with them on their issues based on their reasoning. If they get up for a speech in the house and sound stupid because they quoted a religious document and no body listens to them, then where was the harm? Maybe a few minutes were wasted, but that's it. If someone provides reasoning to back their belief and people listen, then where's the harm in that? There is none. Concerning your next point about representing within the constitution, I feel it's necessary to point out that the Constitution starts with \"We the people of the United States of America.\" We are a government of the people, for the people and by the people. No laws are created without going through the people. It is not the constitution which first decides what laws are valid; it's the people. If you have a problem with that, well I'm sorry, but that's the way our government works. Now, I would like to point out that when representing the people, if the representatives argue for a religion or try to establish a religious preference they get shut down. I still have not seen an example where a religion was preferred in legislation. I've seen your assertions that the religious use their religion as a shield for their stance, but these people generally use secular arguments for their reasoning. The fact that secular arguments are used means that our government is still secular even with people arguing for their personal beliefs. The mix of church and state can still happen in a secular government. In fact it's necessary, as secular is meant to be all inclusive of beliefs and not exclusive of religious beliefs. I would also like to comment that you took my responses and moved the goalposts to another debate for arguing. I was merely stating that the arguments for each of your examples were not religious. Your debating what the stance should be on them is irrelevant. I've also noticed that you've come around to my first round arguments, in which I stated that under the only way to judge morality without God, it's based on perception. If ones perception of a matter is religious then he is morally required to vote and act based on his perception. The only immorality that exists is the action one does against his personal view of truth. Therefore the only morality we can judge from this is that it's immoral for a representative to vote based on anything but his/her personal beliefs. Concerning your last attack, you took my sentence complete out of context of the paragraph. I didn't say god and the afterlife are fact. In fact, I said the opposite. Your arguing me on it is therefore irrelevant. My point in that paragraph had to do with MMR, which you didn't attack in your last post. Well that concludes my rebuttal. Thank you, and I'm sure round five will go as well as the others.",

Also I personally go to a poor church with like 18 members and it is Apostolic so yeah I know where you are coming from. My solution to what your suggesting would to be just to remove tax exemptions from of course churches with a decent income but with poorer churches give them maybe 5-10 years before removal and time can be extended a bit if church is starting from scratch. It still would be removing their tax exemptions but after a period of time.",

            "premise": "\"I should address that the article you posted is a translation that is not technically included in the the first amendment.\" Actually the source that I posted is a direct, valid translation of the First Amendment itself. That is one of the many accredited sources that say the same thing. The overview is very clear on the subject and it's the same law that the Supreme Court follows. The clause forbids the government from establishing an official religion or using religious based documentation or scripture to determine legal activity. Doing so is a violation of the First Amendment and is therefore automatically deemed unconstitutional. http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org... http://www.uscourts.gov... \"You consistently bring up the courts. Why is this significant?\" It is important because the courts both make and enforce the law. And the over topic of debate is in regards to how the government handles the establishment of these laws and how religion should or should not be left out of the equation. There is no \"perfect balance\" if the representatives break the law by using religion as a determinant of their political decisions. It is completely off balance. \"You're ignoring the fact that the checks and balances were put in place so there wouldn't need to be a law against such acts, you just need enough people in the minority to have a problem with them. \" The checks and balances of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches safeguard our freedoms by preventing any single branch from becoming too powerful. This is noted in Articles I, II and III of the U.S. constitution but this does not have much to do with the topic we are debating. \"You bring up how these laws will be stood in front of the courts and denied...\" If using religion as a way to determine law was allowed, that is very well a possibility. The system cannot fully protect these laws from being denied or passed if the majority of Senate representatives simultaneously agree to reject it based on religious reasons, before it's even sent to the House of Representatives for consideration. \"I would also like to point out that you're right about representatives needing reasoning behind their stance. That's why they get elected. They're able to convince enough people to stand with them on their issues based on their reasoning.\" Yes, but are those reasons coherent with law and policy? If not then their reasoning is invalid and unconstitutional. If enough people were pro-slavery, should we just override the 13th Amendment because of it? No, because that would be unconstitutional, the same goes for religion in government as well. \"If they get up for a speech in the house and sound stupid because they quoted a religious document and no body listens to them, then where was the harm? Maybe a few minutes were wasted, but that's it. If someone provides reasoning to back their belief and people listen, then where's the harm in that? There is none.\" Is there no harm? What if their belief was to propose and establish a law that banned the practice of praying in school despite the fact that personal prayer in school is protected by the First Amendment and they listened? Is this not harmful despite the fact that it clearly violates the Constitution and infringes the rights of certain group of citizens who's religious rights are protected? This is harmful. \"Concerning your next point about representing within the constitution, I feel it's necessary to point out that the Constitution starts with \"We the people of the United States of America.\"Yes it does. We the people. Not we the Christians of America. Not we the Muslims of America. Not we the Atheists of America. The people, meaning everyone who has every right to practice whatever religious convictions we choose without any governmental restrictions on our religious and personal freedoms. \"Now, I would like to point out that when representing the people, if the representatives argue for a religion or try to establish a religious preference they get shut down. \" This claim directly proves my point. That is what should happen. Your job as my opponent is to argue against this point, not support it. The overall purpose of my side in this debate was to argue for the topic regarding the separation of religion and government. \"I still have not seen an example where a religion was preferred in legislation.\" That's because this wasn't really required in the first place. As I stated before, it's not about whether or not it has happened, I am arguing against it happening. But if you feel that whether or not it has happened is of importance I will provide examples of politicians using religion to dictate legislation. http://www.forbes.com...http://www.huffingtonpost.com...http://smmercury.com...Feel free to research more on the topic if you want. \"I've seen your assertions that the religious use their religion as a shield for their stance, but these people generally use secular arguments for their reasoning. The fact that secular arguments are used means that our government is still secular even with people arguing for their personal beliefs.\" You cannot speak on the behalf of politicians who use religion for political gain. More often than not, the basis of the stance is based on religious ideologies, and they use this to appeal to the public. Regardless, of what their personal beliefs are, many of them tend to ignore secular based arguments. For example, When asked about gay marriage, Texas governor Rick Perry stated\"The people of the state of Texas, myself included, believe marriage is between one man and one woman,\u201d and then proceeded to go on and on about his religious faith and what the Bible says. He then stated in an interview \"Freedom of religion does not mean freedom from religion\" http://www.huffingtonpost.com...Don't even get me started on the \"Strong\" video, that was pretty clear as well. And it also caused major controversy because it clearly displayed his unconstitutional, un-American attitude towards social issues. He is clearly inconsiderate of minorities and other groups and uses his political power and religious views to persuade voters and dictate legislation with no respect for the First Amendment. That is not very secular. And he is not the only politician to have done this. Michele Bachmann, who is a representative of the U.S. House of Representatives and former Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and former Republican Party nominee for Vice President Paul Ryan are also guilty of this. These are just a few of countless occurrences of politicians using religion to reject or pass laws. I also don't recall ever ignoring or avoiding any previous arguments. However I tried my best to only address the most important points of each of your arguments. I also never said that it wasn't permissible for a person to vote based on their religious convictions, I was simply attacking the actions of the people they voted for. If I took your previous claims out of context, I apologize however you did not clarify that to me.To conclude, there is nothing secular about passing laws restricting the rights and freedoms of others based on your personal religious convictions. No matter how one rephrases it, religion and government are meant to remain separate and this is supported by constitutional law. There is a difference between inclusivity, inclusion, diversity and religious oppression. I await your final response and thank you for debating with me. This was quite a pleasure.",

            "premise": "INTRO: Yes rich churches have overall a lot of money and are using it wrong I agree that is a problem that must be fixed but there is one thing this resolution forgets to back up and why judge it can\"t be passed. The reason I am going neg today is because I believe the tax exemptions should only be removed from churches that are rich not the poor churches that actually need it. 1.Poor churches need the money \"Not enough to pay off tax emptions \"A lot of smaller churches start out in poorer areas 2.Huge churches don\"t need/ the money use it wrong etc. \"Only 3% to 10% of tax emptions used for charity \"In addition to the lack of transparency, it is vital to consider whether any multi-billion dollar operation, religious or otherwise, should enjoy sweeping tax exemptions on their assets or actually needs it. What exactly does the tax exemption promote if an organization already has more than enough money to run its activities from individual contributions? \"Religious organizations with large entertainment venues. There are churches with pools, skating rinks, bowling alleys, huge gyms, etc. Such things are not required in order to practice your \"faith\". It gives religious groups a very unfair advantage over businesses offering the same services, but which have to pay taxes. \" Also just a little joke thing some of these same tax exempt huge churches claim \"god can pay our taxes\" so if they believe in this they don\"t need these tax exemptions in the first place not to mention they have millions or billions of dollars and they seem to maintain their buildings rather well. 3. Tax exemptions are not justified and poorly monitored There are millions of dollars of undocumented, unclaimed, untaxed church income each year. The figures cannot be accurately calculated by the IRS since most churches do not file the \"voluntary\" paperwork. Preachers are living in million dollar \"church funded\" homes, driving \"church gifted\" Jaguars, and wearing \"church donated\" Rolexes. Whilst enjoying a lavish lifestyle, many are not paying the myriad of taxes that the rest of US citizens are required to pay because church-based money is virtually untouchable, untraceable, and unaccountable. What becomes of the rest of the unaccounted cash millions that filter through the tithing trays? A local church, said to be the largest growing church in America, recently spent $1.2M on Harley Davidson motorcycles as gifts to the top 11 leaders. It is also claimed that they have used over $1M bailing out church members from jail. We are helping to pay for them! You pay for them indirectly, the same way local, state, and federal governments in the United States subsidize religion \" to the tune of about $71 billion every year. The current laws allow for open money-laundering and tax evasion without the likelihood for consequence or penalty.They have no safeguards to determine how many untaxed dollars are passing though the church doors and officials hands. Once a group claims to be a church, the IRS has no enforcement to determine if any illegal activity occurs unless the evidence is gathered and handed to them first. Although it states that all non-profits must not benefit any individuals, and must not spend a significant amount of time or money lobbying lawmakers, there is currently NO WAY TO DETERMINE, REGULATE, OR PUNISH these illegal behaviors. Major example: Some church leaders have even managed to use the church to hide their assets. For instance, Rev. John Hagee reorganized his TV station (Global Evangelism Television) as a church (Grace Church of San Antonio Churches) to shelter those records, after the San AntonioExpress-News revealed his income exceeded $1 million in 2001. All of his assets, including an 8,000-or-so acre ranch, are now sheltered in the Cornerstone Church. In other words, Hagee hides his millions in assets in his church and escapes taxation on his own personal wealth and property. So yes I agree that rich churches shouldn't have this money but what you have to understand is their are poor churches that doe. I personaly go to one that has about 10 members without tax emptions we wouldn't survive. NOt all churches are good big buildings in fact a lot of Baptist or apostolic or those religions have buildings in poorer areas.",

            "premise": "Preface: I would ask Pro if the next round, or perhaps the round after, be made the concluding round. This debate will devolve into repetition and nonsense if we go all 5 rounds. Proposition: My Opponent challenged my view that Tax Exemption is natural. However, he does not elaborate further. Therefore, he has effectively left the matter in my favour. What we earn is naturally ours, ergo, to have what is ours taken is not natural, even if necessary. I will follow up later. Counter-Case I: Corporate Tax Summarization: My opponent claims that we will simply label churches as Corporations. Counter: Churches are not Corporations. This is simple, objective fact. Pro can no more relabel them then he could relabel me rich. Pro claims that Churches seek to make money. This means nothing. All charities seek to acquire revenue. What matters is the use of this money. A Corporation will make money to benefit its leaders/shareholders through financial profit. A church seeks to gain revenue in order to benefit everyone else, through charitable means. Ergo, the Churches are in fact Charities, and cannot be labeled as anything else, any more then he can relabel the Salvation Army. To do so in order to expand tax revenue would be a grievous abuse of power, and a sign of a Government that is falling beyond the threshold. No, Churches will be labeled as what they are, Charitable organizations.Pro says Tithes are mandatory, I ask for sources. Social Pressures are also given when charities stand outside walmart, or when we are asked to donate at the register. But this doesn\u2019t change the nature of the charities responsible. No, Pro may be too weak to resist social pressure, but he cannot redefine \u201cVoluntary\u201d. No matter how much pressure is applied, the fact that you can say no (Often times without people knowing) means it is completely voluntary. I, for example, did not give tithe in church today. Conclusion: Pro failed to prove that Churches are Corporations, and merely declared them to be so. Or rather, declared that he would label them Corporations, regardless of what they actually are. Counter-Case II: \u201cCounter-Cases\u201d / \u201cCases\u201d Summarization: Pro has attempted to attack my Counters, while presented a new case that Churches aren\u2019t Charities. Counter: \u201cWhen these groups enter society, they give up the right to not be taxed.\u201d This is one of the most philosophically bankrupt views I have seen in awhile. Again, to keep what we earn is the natural way, and to be taxed is unnatural, if necessary. To act as though taxation is inherent until otherwise said shows a lack of understanding of the nature of taxation. Saying that government withholding tax is a sign of support further shows his flawed philosophy toward taxation. The inability to distinguish between not having our income stolen, and being money suggests he views our money as Government Property, with the money we have left being our allowance. I will allow the Voters to make of this philosophy what they will. Once the smaller Churches begin going under, Pro will then give them a stimulus. This means taking money from wealthier churches, and giving it to smaller churches, to make up for the tax that is now implemented. This is the endorsement of religion the First Amendment is against. This means benefiting the smaller churches at the expense of the large ones (ironically, more so than Pro\u2019s claim that exemption benefits larger churches more). Or perhaps we not tax them at all, and not need to give taxpayer money to Churches. Or they collapse. Then tax revenue is lost. Now no one gets Social Aid. My opponent declares SCOTUS to be the final authority, yet again committing the Appeal to Authority, without giving evidence that they are right. SCOTUS has been wrong before. They are largely an opinion with authority, whereas my sources are academic. I have shown the flaw in their reasoning, Pro has not shown flaw in my sources.Pro says that our education system is underfunded, without source. I have sourced that it is among the most well-funded in the world. All other problems are in administration, and therefore extra funding won\u2019t help. Our SS problems are derived from a broken system. Money will be wasted without change. Pro fails to express how taking the money from a charity, and wasting half of it will benefit us more than just letting the Charity use the money. Paying the debt is no better than war. It is taking more money to pay for the government's own inefficiencies, rather than trying to fix it from the government\u2019s (expenditure) end. Pro fails to show how these churches are not charitable. Rather, he makes the unsubstantiated claim that they \u201ckeep a cut for themselves\u201d. What he is referring to is unknown, and thus irrelevant. Any administrative/maintenance/debt costs are normal for charities. They are still Charities.Scientology has a controversial tax status. It has even been revoked because it didn\u2019t meet the requirements to be a non-for-profit Church. {1} Thus Churches can lose status. Pro also mentions that bureaucracy won\u2019t waste the money. I sourced that there was waste. Here is another {2} Conclusion: Pro\u2019s Counters fail to dispel my arguments, and he fails to revive his own. As it stands, his logic is shown to be faulty. Pro says my argument relies on Churches being Charity, but as this is the established fact about Churches, it is actually Pro\u2019s job to show they are not Charities. He has failed in this endeavor, as his statements, when looked at carefully, can be seen to apply to any Charity.His failure to show that churches can even be taxes further defies his claim that taxing them will benefit social programs. He further continues making unsubstantiated claims that adding money to these programs will help, when I have shown the problems are often not financial. Sources: 1} Wikipedia: http://bit.ly... 2} Slate: http://slate.me... Case: Long-Term Loss Thesis: I will show here that increasing taxation will only lead to a less successful future, with a dangerous precedent in place, and decreased taxation is prefered. Rationalization: A fact that many people seem not to realize is that taxation harms long term economic growth {3}. With less capital, business/people have less spare income for expansion. This will not change for churches. Their decreased growth will lead to the revenue from them dropping overtime relative to inflation and government spending. Eventually, the Social assistance gained from this tax (which is already less than lost by taxing charities) will further decline relative to had the Churches been able to simply invest the money into expension (something Charities are allowed to do). But worse, is the precedence. After taxing the Churches, the Government will find that it is not enough. Because 71 Billion won\u2019t fix the anything. Instead of fixing their fiscal incompetence, they simply added a tax, on a 501c3 eligible group with strong legal defenses. The precedence is almost certainly set. If it has already been set (very likely given increasing tax/GDP ratio {4}), it will be further enforced. New taxes, expanded taxes. This will lead to slowed economic growth, and cause long-term harm to revenue. If taxes are lowered instead, the economy will grow from increased investment/ease-of-business. The increase in economy will eventually reach a point will more revenue can be brought in with lower and less taxes. A long-term solution, along with fixing the bureaucratic mess, and destroying waste. Far better and more efficient than the short-term solution of taxing more, which will only necessitate (and precedate) further taxation increases. Conclusion: Pro\u2019s economic policies would see decreased economic/church growth, leading to a situation where tax revenues will be lower (relative to inflation) in spite of higher tax rates. Lower taxes and smaller/efficient government is best. Sources: 3} TPC: http://tpc.io... 4} http://bit.ly... Closing Statement: Pro fails to resuscitate his arguments, often merely repeating them without further elaboration. He fails to realize that simply referring to SCOTUS\u2019 position doesn\u2019t justify their claims. Pro doesn\u2019t really make any headway against my claims, beyond relying on the notion that he can tax them as something they aren\u2019t (Corporations). And if they don\u2019t fit the classification, he\u2019ll tax them as such anyhow. This doesn\u2019t work, and Pro failed to show Churches to be anything but Charities, as his descriptions of the churches are little different than other Charities once analyzed.Perhaps most crippling is Pro revealing his faulty philosophy toward taxation, implying that theft of our earned money is natural, and to be allowed to keep all of our earned income is a gift from government. This is a dangerous notion. Pro may not have stated this philosophy word-for-word, but the implication is there. Especially, when he says not having our money taken is the same as being given money. This is a stockholmesque view.Taxation is Theft. Taxation is necessary, but it is theft. It must be done carefully, and every single effort must be made to keep it as low as possible. If government fails in this endeavour, and choses to keep raising tax, then it must be seen as an aggressive parasite to our economic system, taking more, and giving less. Pro would prefer this parasite, because his disdain for religion justifies expanded taxation on charities simply due to their religious nature. {5/6} Sources: 5} http://bit.ly... 6} Mises: http://bit.ly...

            "premise": "\"I would like to point out your comment concerning the way \"elected officials use religious based propaganda,\" is irrelevant to policy itself. Your quarrel should be with the politicians and voters themselves. The politicians get power because voters give them that power. It's the power of citizenship. If you have a problem with them electing a devout religious person then take it up with the voting body, but I'd imagine telling them how to vote wouldn't be looked at as constitutional.\" The first and main obligation of an elected official is to abide by state and federal law. Following the United States Constitution is the main job requirements of politicians, laws makers, members of congress etc because that is the foundation of law in the U.S. While it would make more sense to blame the voters, who elected the officials in the first place, it still doesn't prevent them from doing their job while in office. Unfortunately, that is one of the many flaws of our government. U.S. citizens are free vote for the candidate who they feel best represents their religious ideologies and this is protected by law, but when in office, it is against the law to use religion to determine policy. However, we are not discussing the voters. We are discussing those in charge, specifically those who make laws. Who voted for them is irrelevant. \"I would also like to ask for examples for your second argument concerning oppression. None are provided so I have nothing to respond to.\" There are various social issues that have been debated for quite some time. More specifically laws pertaining to gay rights such as legalizing same-sex marriage, adoption rights for gay couples and anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals, abortion (pro-choice) and birth control, drug legalization (cannabis) and laws regarding stem cell research and vaccinations. \"I disagree with your statement, \"you must first specify which of the million deities in the thousands of belief systems you are specifically arguing for.\" Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't use a religious argument in my first post at all.I'm not arguing for a religion or theocracy.\" I really didn't say that you were arguing on behalf of religion but in my defense you did say \"Honestly, here's the truth, when a god is not involved there is no such thing as moral truth or universal morality.\" which automatically led me to that conclusion. \"I bear small disagreement to your response to my point on the first amendment.\" What exactly do you disagree with? Please specify. I don't really understand the context of this statement. \"You claim there is a universal morality or process of determining morality.\" Not quite. Morals vary upon the individual, however, as a society, there are various ways of implementing the concept of moral universalism that applies to everyone and respects the moral views of every person living in said society. For example, the First Amendment grants freedom of religion. With the establishment of this amendment, a person who believes in Christianity is free to practice their religion without government interference. The government is not allowed to prevent that person from practicing their faith, going to church, preaching in public etc... However, in respect, that person is also not allowed to use their religion and governmental authority to make political decisions for everyone else in society, regardless of whether or not that person was elected for mainly religious reasons. \"However, you've ignored part of my argument concerning purpose.\"I did not ignore that aspect of your argument. When you claim there is a \"purpose\" you are referring to an \"afterlife\" which implies that you are arguing on behalf of a \"higher power\", which brings me back to my original point regarding religion. \"If there is no purpose or ultimate positive (the world will collapse eventually due to the second law of thermodynamics), then there's no lasting point to what we do.\" Please explain this further. Thermodynamics is the science concerned with the relations between heat and mechanical energy or work and the conversion of one into the other. This has absolutely nothing to do with the topic of the argument. I don't think you really know what thermodynamics are. http://dictionary.reference.com... The Second Law of Thermodynamics refers to a general principle which places constraints upon the direction of the transfer of heat and the attainable efficiencies of heat engines. What does this have to do with politics?http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu... \"You also seem to be throwing in a personal bias when you state that morality shouldn't be made because of the fear in an afterlife. Shouldn't it be? The way I support my claim logically is that morals need to have some sort of grounding in something universally proven and something lasting.\" There statement is contradicting. First you imply that believing in an afterlife is a logical basis for having morals, then you claim, by logic, morals need to be based on something universally proven. The concept of 'afterlife' is not necessarily logical nor has it been proven. This isn't \"personal bias\", this is FACT. Those who believe in afterlife, do so based on FAITH and that alone. Faith is not fact. \"Everything in this world is dying, and nothing can be done about it. Nothing is ultimately lasting. What then is the point of morality?\" The point of morality is to regulate a civilized society. That is pretty self-explanatory. \"Morality, where God is not concerned, is created based on perception. Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong because of science and your personal convictions, but other people have different personal convictions (radical nihilism), so how do you ultimately prove who's right?\"Again, which of the millions of gods, in the hundreds of thousands of religions and thousands of denominations are you referring to? When using \"god\" to determine what is and what is not \"right\" or \"wrong\" there are endless amounts of definitions and different perspectives on the subject. That's why using religion to determine the moral code of a SECULAR society like the U.S. cannot work. \"Science doesn't work because the morals derived don't ultimately have a purpose. In the end, if there is no God, then it doesn't matter.\" This is where you seem to be throwing \"personal bias\" on the subject. Science is the only inherent way to make logical decisions that benefit society. To avoid catching disease, you rely on SCIENCE to get vaccinated. When you need to get somewhere, you use SCIENCE to provide transportation. What emotions you feel, the decisions you make and how you react to things are all determined biologically and psychologically meaning SCIENCE is responsible for explaining these things. SCIENCE is also mainly responsible for determining moral code. Science is essential to the survival of the human species, there is only so much a \"god\" can do (especially when you don't even know which god is the \"right\" one). Every organism is fueled on the basic need to survive. Theocracy is not justified because then all scientific ideologies are DENIED and people would be forced to abide by one specific set of morals regardless of whether or not they disagree or whether or not those \"morals\" are harmful to others or themselves. This is not the way to run a SECULAR society. And this is why it is wrong to force people to abide by one particular set of religious views. With secularism, comes coexistence. This is the overall purpose of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and whether or not they agree, politicians must respect and abide by this law for it sets the foundation of American society.

            "premise": "I agree with my opponent\"s definitions. I disagree with their proposition II which states that the natural state is not being taxed. Rather, churches are corporations, not charities, which are subject to tax. This is how I plan to implement the resolution, by changing churches\" status to that of a corporation. First, let\"s look at what a corporation is through looking at what it attempts to do. A corporation\"s goal is to make money [1]. This is exactly what religion has done since the dawn of time. Since ancient Mesopotamia and before, religions have required sacrifices of property to be part of said religion, sometimes enforced at gunpoint. This isn\"t the case now in most of the world, but let\"s take churches in America as an example. The collection box, basket, etc. is passed around in front of sometimes the entire town. This incredible social pressure combined with the fact that many religions command a tithe make it so that \"donation\" is not truly voluntary. You pay for the service of religion. This is how religion has been viewed by the cynical upper class for millennia, and why the cynical upper class proselytizes. Thus, the burden of proof is on both of us. I must prove that churches are corporations (see above) and my opponent must either prove they are not or that churches must be an exception to other corporations. 1-http://www.investopedia.com... Counter-Case I My opponent makes the point that allowing groups to keep money doesn\"t count as an endorsement. That is EXACTLY what it is. When these groups enter society, they give up the right to not be taxed. When the government chooses not to act on this, it shows the government is in support of the group. Thus, the government is neutral towards the private citizen and the corporation, but not to the charity. My opponent called my use of the SCOTUS an appeal to authority, but if that\"s an appeal to authority, so is every source we both used. The SCOTUS decides what the Constitution means. They decided that the government giving money to a lobbying church is no different from tax exemption [2]. I take that line of reasoning to its inevitable conclusion and say that the government giving money to a church is no different than a tax exemption. My opponent claims that our money doesn\"t start as the government\"s to take. Rather, when a group such as a church enters a democratic government, they give the government permission to tax them, as I note above. My opponent also makes the claim that small churches could fall under and fail. So what? The government can then provide an economic stimulus as it would to any other business, or let it file for bankruptcy or die. The government is in no position to keep a failing business afloat. If so many would go under, though, churches can utilize tax credits given to small businesses once classified as them. My opponent then points out that we shouldn\"t take money from the rich simply because they are rich. That\"s not what I\"m saying. I\"m saying that 30% of a million is more than 30% of a thousand. We are allowing these large, predatory churches to grow exponentially, leaving the smaller churches (often the ones doing the charity work my opponent references) in the dust, thus incentivizing churches to adopt this model. 2-https://en.wikipedia.org... Counter-case II First, Con discounts my source because it\"s a blog. Well, the Washington Post puts the number possibly higher while referencing the same study. [3] Con talks about bureaucratic waste and how funneling more money in to programs doesn\"t solve that. First, our education system is worse than others not because of bureaucracy but because of a lack of funding for poor schools and because our focus on testing and curriculum sucks. However, college is a different sort of thing. Our universities are some of the best in the world. [4] More money helps more people access them. On social security, Con points out it is well funded by the payroll tax. I don\"t dispute that. But Con\"s source points out that some people may be entitled to as few as around 10,000 dollars per year. That\"s less than the poverty line, which is already too low. This money could be used to increase their benefits. On the Vietnam War, that comes from the standpoint of the Ford or Carter administration which wants to offset the damage done. The examples Pro gives of bureaucracy gone awry aren\"t where the money will go, and so the bureaucracy isn\"t the problem here. Hell, the money could simply be used to pay off the debt! 3- https://www.washingtonpost.com... 4- https://www.timeshighereducation.com... Case The Con\"s case rests on the church being a charity. A church\"s motivation is not to be a charity, nor does being a church necessitate charitability. Take Scientology. Not exactly a charity. It exists to make money. Even the smaller churches which may be genuine in their efforts to be charitable take a cut for themselves, and the charity is merely an additional \"product\" they sell to their members who want to be charitable. Join the church, pay a tithe, and you can be charitable. When something exists to make money, and second help their consumers, it is no longer a charity; it is a corporation, and ought to be treated as such. Conclusion We need to implement this resolution through making churches considered corporations because that\"s what they are, not charities. We can use this money to fund things listed above, or countless others.",

I too had to deal with preposterous taxes when I earned my inheritance. It is a despicable practize to take ones hard earned inheritance is it not?\"Indeed, back in medieval times, the paupers in rural England used to pay the nobility handsome sums for the privilege of farming the common land that used to collectively belong to them before the ruling classes annexed it all and forced the snivelling little peasants into serfdom.\"Ze paupers of England had ze v'ight idea too. \" One of my Victorian ancestors: Lord Montmorency Wright-Farquhar Saveloy Eggleston d'Eggleston von Gobbscheit, famously said \"The idea that the upper classes should be asked to make a financial contribution to the Government just so filthy commoners can educate their children, have access to medication and enjoy the protection of the law is as ludicrous as the idea that they should be allowed to vote.\" \"Zis man Montmormency vas a man ahead of his time, I applaud him for his boldness. \"Sadly, these days working class scum not only enjoy free education and health care, paid for through taxation, but also the 'right' to elect wishy-washy, namby-pamby, bleeding-heart lefties as Members of Parliament - and this country is going to hell in a hand-cart as a result.\"Ze same thing is happening in my beloved Deutschland and it sickens me more zhan vatching a jew be able to work while good blooded Germans languish in unemployment....\"Like most financially privileged toffs, I have an enormous sense of self-entitlement, and that's why I affirm that income tax should remain in place, but only the lower classes should pay it, and that the revenue raised from income tax should not be wasted on publicly-funded schools and hospitals but, rather, be used to replace the capital gains and inheritance taxes.\"I must disagree with you on zhis one. I vill explain my position on zhis issue later in zhis debate, but virst I vould like to address your other points. \"As my friends in the Conservative Party point out, taxing high net worth individuals drives wealth creators out of the country and into low tax regimes overseas, and..... this exodus of prosperous people actually damages some of the poorest members of society.\"Ze conservative party have good intention vith zhere ideas, but zhey vail to distinguish between taxing ze high income individuals too much and taxing ze high income individuals at all. I have problems with ze former, but not ze ladder. I believe zat ze wealthiest 10% should not face incredibly high taxation vates, but zhay should not be exempted from it. I vill explain why in a moment. \"The fact is, if the richest ten per cent of citizens were exempted from tax, not only would all those servants keep their jobs but rich people from abroad would be tempted to move to Britain to take advantage of our low tax policies, and employ domestic staff of their own here - which would be a fantastic boost to the economy.\"Zis is vhat I vas vearing. You mistake that ze top 10% of citizens are ze best people to create jobs and lower unemployment, and zhat ze only vay they can do this iz if ve give them no taxes. In glorious Nazi Germany, ze country under Hitlers rule faced the fastest drop in unemployment ever recorded by drastically increasing military production vich created thousands of jobs very vast. Zhey also annexed numerous industries and suspended ze rights for common workers to protest or unionize, and ze country flourished. However, tax vates never climbed more zhan 14% the entire time, as you can see from zhis article I vound on zis website called \"Vikipedia\". http://en.wikipedia.org...My point iz, you dont need to abolish taxes only on ze top 10% to spur job creation, because in Nazi Germany the economy vlourished simply vrom taking control of major industries to decrease unemployment. In today's day and age though, zis cannot be done because ze people vill protest too much and vote you out of power, so governments can only try to spur job growth in vays that ze public will not protest, and your plan of cutting services to ze lower 90% and eliminating taxes of ze upper 10% vill anger zhem. Lets look at ze idea zhat lowering taxes on ze top earners leads to a drop in unemployment though. In capitalist America for example, ze government gives billions and billions of dollars to oil companies like Exxon-Mobil and their owners in ze hopes zhat zhey vill use zese zubsidies to hire more workers. Zhis hasnt happened though because vhen you look at how many people zhey have employed from 1999 to 2007, you can see zhat Exxon has actually DECREASED the number of people vorking for zhem from 107,000 in 1999, to 80,800 in 2007. Currently in 2012 zhey only employ 82,000 people vich is a decrease of 25,000 jobs despite receiving billions in funding from ze government. http://fightforbetterus.blogspot.com...http://en.wikipedia.org...Ze point iz, eliminating taxes vor ze top 10% doesnt necessarily mean that unemployment will drop because eliminating taxes for ze companies and going even further by actually giving zhem more money when they are making record profits also does not reduce unemployment. to reduce unemployment, numerous other measures must be utilized to try to drive down unemployment as vell. You mentioned that cutting spending can also be utilized to encourage unemployment, however the zervices zhat ze government funds also emplys and influences countless numbers of people. Public education and hospitals and defense all employ thousands and thousands of people all across Europe and America as vell, so if ve cut services too much, jobs vill be lost, and if zhat same money instead goes to high income earners it vill not encourage zhem to create as many jobs as those that vere lost. That is vhy your proposal vill not work. Cutting funding to schools and hospitals vill increase unemployment since people vork in zhose industries, but giving more money to high income earners and corporations vill not create as many jobs as was lost, as you can zee from my Exxon-Mobil analysis. Zhere are better vays to reduce unemployment besides giving tax breaks to the wealthy and cutting services to the middle class scum to pay for it. 1) Zhe government can ease up on regulations in key areas to help new industries be born or flourish 2) Zhe government can run up massive spending deficits for people to consume more goods and allow industries to expand to meet the demand (like vhat happened in America under Reagan) 3) Zhe government can lower zhe benefits people can receive from things like Zocial Zecurity and allocate those funds elsewhere in the economy to spur job growth4) Ze government can tinker vith their monetary policy to increase job creation 5) Ze government can invest in programs to help ze unemployed find and occupy jobs that are available. 6) Ze government can also heavily invest in military production to icnrease jobs (Something I am in favor of)http://useconomy.about.com...Zhese are a few ways the government can decrease unemployment and are ze veason vhy ve dont need to exempt ze upper 10% vrom taxes vile ze middle class is forced to suffer for it.",

            "premise": "You mustn't wait long. I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy this debate a lot. Well on the effort to keep within the formalities of rebuttal I shall be attacking your points and rebuilding my own. I would like to point out your comment concerning the way \"elected officials use religious based propaganda,\" is irrelevant to policy itself. Your quarrel should be with the politicians and voters themselves. The politicians get power because voters give them that power. It's the power of citizenship. If you have a problem with them electing a devout religious person then take it up with the voting body, but I'd imagine telling them how to vote wouldn't be looked at as constitutional. I would also like to ask for examples for your second argument concerning oppression. None are provided so I have nothing to respond to. Now onto my own case and your attacks thereof, I suppose I'll start at the top and go to the bottom. I feel it's unnecessary to dispute the definition of religion since mine is a summarized version of yours. If you don't feel that true then just take this as concession of your definition. However, I disagree with your statement, \"you must first specify which of the million deities in the thousands of belief systems you are specifically arguing for.\" Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't use a religious argument in my first post at all. I'm not arguing for a religion or theocracy. I'm arguing the the elected ought to vote on the basis of what they believe, because that's what they were elected for. I bear small disagreement to your response to my point on the first amendment. It's more of a disagreement on the way we should take it, not the literal wording. I won't spend time on that right now, as that will be included in my later arguments. You claim there is a universal morality or process of determining morality. However, you've ignored part of my argument concerning purpose. If there is no purpose or ultimate positive (the world will collapse eventually due to the second law of thermodynamics), then there's no lasting point to what we do. There's no ultimate way to determine whether or not life is even good if there's no point in life anyway. You also seem to be throwing in a personal bias when you state that morality shouldn't be made because of the fear in an afterlife. Shouldn't it be? The way I support my claim logically is that morals need to have some sort of grounding in something universally proven and something lasting. Everything in this world is dying, and nothing can be done about it. Nothing is ultimately lasting. What then is the point of morality? Morality, where God is not concerned, is created based on perception. Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong because of science and your personal convictions, but other people have different personal convictions (radical nihilism), so how do you ultimately prove who's right? Science doesn't work because the morals derived don't ultimately have a purpose. In the end, if there is no God, then it doesn't matter. Your point about arguing about a God's existence is irrelevant, especially to you. You wouldn't want a God to exist in any scenario on your side because then theocracy is justified. Yes you have to prove which one it is, but that still undermines your entire point. However, I'm arguing under the premise that God does not exist therefore rendering any sort of universal morality pointless. Concerning your last argument about my argument concerning the constitution, I feel it should be addressed that we have a representative government. We elect representatives from the start of our country and hold elections every two years for a majority of them. So this means that if the citizens aren't pleased with the representatives then they can be voted out. This means that the citizens are voting for these people. So why would you restrict what the citizens want? You're missing the point of my statement. Also I would like to thank you for this statement, \"There is no specific set of beliefs that atheists follow, only a lack thereof.\" That statement is awfully helpful to my side (see above arguments concerning moral relativism). I was however making the point in my last post that when one is an atheist there is a premise, which is that religion shouldn't be included in the decisions. Therefore the premise is forced under your standard for the elected. In conclusion to this rebuttal: Your statements on morality aren't justified, as they don't account for the fact that without God we and our actions have no ultimate purpose. It's contradictory to allow citizens to vote a religious man into office then say he's not allowed to vote on certain issues the way he and his body of electors believes. Finally your original points so far do not stand. Thank you, and I'll be waiting for your response in the next round.",

            "premise": "\"this creates disincentives to own excessive property, when property should be promoted to be freely distributed as much as possible.\" - You're correct, placing a heavier tax burden on individuals with 'excessive' property would be a disincentive to owning large amounts of land. I don't think, however, that this disincentive would help to freely distribute property. The people with the money will still buy land because they can afford it. And the people that do not have money will still not be able to afford it. \"we should not get rid of property tax...\" - I agree. \"it should be our main focus...\" - I disagree. A major part of our nations wealth is collected at the top: \"The top 1% took heavy hits from the dot-com crash and the Great Recession but recovered fairly quickly: Saez\"s preliminary estimates for 2012 (which will be updated next month) have that group receiving nearly 22.5% of all pretax income, while the bottom 90%\"s share is below 50% for the first time ever (49.6%, to be precise).\" http://www.pewresearch.org... Land distribution favoring the wealthy is not a result of having low tax rates on property, it is an effect of wealth distribution itself. Why focus on taxing land (at the state level) which has be purchased, when taxing income (state and federal) targets the source? That's like collecting water from a leak into a bucket instead of patching the leak, it may somewhat work but it doesn't fix the actual problem. \"last in line, so as to encourage commercial activity, sales tax. which would have to focus on those with more income, perhaps.\" - What?! A hirer sales tax rate (again, municipal and not federal) for those with more income? Uhhhhh, income tax? Which is my argument altogether, that property taxes as well as sales taxes are and should remain secondary to income taxes. Property taxes are a result of income and therefore cannot be our nations primary focus on tax revenue. What would happen if we did tax much more heavily the individuals with massive amounts of land? Perhaps they would parcel it out and sell it and retain their wealth, thus creating many more \"small\" landowners relying on government incentives and homestead exemptions, thus lowering the amount of overall revenue collected through property taxes. The wealthy would remain wealthy and our government would lose money. \"why couldn't it balance the scales between the wealthy and non wealthy just as much as income tax? there is no difference where the revenue comes from...\" - Wrong. There is a major difference where the revenue is generated. It's the difference between being taxed on income or property, one of which is purchased with the other. Heavily tax the top on their incomes, redistribute to the impoverished, and push for regulations and reform that keep those at the top from manipulating the system and finding loopholes to unfairly maintain their wealth, such as putting it in land.",

First off, I feel some things need to be defined before we can start arguing so we have a more specific premise of debate. If you disagree with my definitions then feel free to post your own. I will be defining religion as a set of morals or belief system that involves a deity (god to enforce or create such beliefs). I feel philosophy should also be defined, which is, in general, a set of morals or truths or process for determining morals or truths. First I would like to point out you're right about the 1st amendment, but what does it mean? Does it mean that religious people can't vote based on personal conviction? When it comes down to it that's the way everyone votes, but if there's a god involved then is it not okay? Honestly, here's the truth, when a god is not involved there is no such thing as moral truth or universal morality. There's no way to put one philosophy on top of the other because there's no ultimate justice. Just as Immanuel Kant said, there must be an afterlife for justice, otherwise things we see as immoral can be left unpunished. So if there isn't an afterlife there is no passing of judgement for actions. This is important because now we are left with a lot of beliefs and no way to prove any of them are right. What then is the best way to determine policy? The best way to do that is voting your belief and seeing which one comes out on top at the polls. If someone votes a Christian into office or a Muslim into office, then that's the decision of the body of voters. Under the representative system, this person is chosen to represent a body of people who share similar beliefs or desires as him or her. It would actually be a political atrocity for him or her to vote in a way other than his or her personal beliefs about a situation, because the people who elected him share those beliefs. I'm going to argue under the premise that God doesn't exist. Now I argue moral relativism, which I define simply being that morality is relative to the individual. Essentially, since there is no point in anything we do, whatever one feels to be right is what's right. Therefore, the only immorality is that which you do and feel to be wrong. So if someone votes in a way they don't feel is right just because they're forced to then that is a moral atrocity. For my final point, I would like to point out the logical contradiction in the policy. If we take away any religion, we are left with an atheist government. What's the problem with that? We are not establishing a religion, but we are establishing a belief system, which clearly contradicts the first amendment. When it comes down to moral issues, representatives and voters will have no choice but to vote within the debatable premise of atheism alone, and they will be restricted to that belief whether they like it or not. It would be a constitutional atrocity.",

You, my friend, are awesome-sauce! _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Prequel arguments: Q-\"well, looking purely from a legal stand-point, organizations can only receive tax exemptions if they are productive enough and meet the requirements, and I am certain that no homeless person meets the same criteria.\" From a certain perspective, it could be argued that a homeless individual doesn't really meet the requirements for productivity. Certainly, it's extremely difficult to meet such productivity and requirements, when one has lost so much, and must now redirect concern toward survival itself. However, as my drill sergeants were quick to remind us, you can't help anybody else, until you get the help you need for yourself. In other words, the argument could likewise be made that, in attempting to become a productive member of society, the person in question is, in fact, becoming productive; and the issue really centers around whether or not the person in question will continue to endeavor toward meeting the requirements, or not. There are special cases, in which the I.R.S. will allow an organization a sort of \"grace period\", to meet requirements. It may be that such a grace period could be extended to individuals. \"Bible reference: the bible, however, does not advocate your stance on how to use the govt in any way shape or form. don't you remember? Jesus said \"give unto Caesar what's Caesar's...\" (Luke 20:20-26)\" While I respect my opponent's research, I must disagree on the point about the Bible's perspective on taxation and government. Firstly, the remainder of the text reads, \"Give unto God what's God's\", thereby reminding us to give what is owed to those to whom we owe it. However, in ancient Israel, the Law of Moses demanded charity from the people; both in the form of personal charity, and in a form of taxation we know today as \"tithing\". If necessary, I can provide specific references; however, there are many references throughout the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. My opponent takes a difficult position, in arguing for the necessity of evil. However, when considered in it's totality, it is a noble argument. My opponent claims that, without suffering, there is no use for us; however, I do not support that concept. In a biblical sense, suffering is an unintended result of sin; which is an attempt to perform in a manner uncommon to the intention of the Creator. The connotation of Genesis 1 and 2, is that an individual's meaning is in how well suffering is averted, by proper stewardship of those creations put under his or her charge. It is when sin enters the picture, that suffering becomes apparent. Even the Buddha recognized the fact that suffering is undesirable (while perhaps the wrong term to use, I trust the reader will understand the intention of the term), and a better goal is to attain the alleviation of suffering. While it is suffering that provides some measure of activity and excitement, suffering is both subjective (to an extent), and undesirable to every living creature. Whether suffering is living on the streets, or living in a penthouse because of a lie, it's still undesirable; and that is what makes it suffering. I~ My opponent makes a good philosophical point: \"without suffering, they have nothing to compare life as a whole to.\" However, returning to the philosophy of the Buddha, and perhaps of Lao Tzu, it is this competition that causes unease and unrest. Suffering causes us to feel impending doom. While useful, it is useful as far as the compulsion to alleviate suffering. One may wonder if it's suffering that is necessary, or effort. II~ Firstly, while homeless people would have no tax, such a predicament would only last until they were no longer homeless. It would be temporary, and achieve the higher goal of personal and social improvement. Secondly, I must again disagree with my opponent; It's a generalization to claim that the lethargy of individuals is indicative of the entire group. Some people just can't catch a break, mainly because of circumstances making such efforts necessary. III~ My opponent claims that the government needs taxation to operate, and this is somewhat true. However, taxation was originally enforced in WWII to fund the war effort. 1. My opponent claims that, if tax exemption spreads beyond the poor, it would alleviate the suffering of a larger group. That's only true of unmonitored systems . 2. I must disagree that people are lazy: the very attempt to survive is a testament to natural human diligence. IV~ I don't argue in favour of a Canadian system of healthcare; rather, I argue that people who can, would provide as they can, of their own free will. This would still be a totally privatized system. V~Likewise, I am not arguing for government support. I'm arguing for dismantling government support, by using the legal tools available, to allow and encourage personal charity. VI~The reason the government has power, in our nation, is because people are convinced to will it. If tyranny is exposed, the people will rebel. If the government wants control, they placate the people. VII~By alleviating suffering, a new purpose develops: to ensure the prevention of suffering. Further, what's to stop someone from saying that causing suffering (evil,) is good? VIII~One can only guess as to why people become \"poor\": the average person lives a couple paychecks away from homelessness. IX~The main reasons for government \"bankruptcy\" are centered around two facts: that politicians, who have private incomes greater than their government salaries, take tax money for their own useless profits; and that too much money is used in pork-spending. -------------------------------------- While homeless people don't pay taxes, the reason is because they have no such opportunity yet. ------------------------------------- My opponent and I obviously have different perspectives, taken from different experiences. I don't know my opponent's experiences, or how he endured suffering; however, I do know the suffering of losing all one's money, losing a job, losing a place to live, and struggling to survive in a world that only pretends to care by pouring money into greedy, elitist systems that subsist solely on the lie that they use their donations for the sakes of others. My proposal may be drastic - I'm usually the first person to admit that I'm insane, - but, \"Drastic times call for drastic measures\"... and really, does my opponent's perspective really sound like Kant's concept of utilitarianism? -------------------------------------------------- ***Impact calc*** ============ 1. My proposed system would end frivolous government spending, with the private manipulation of legal loopholes. With government waste and oppression rendered impotent, the private individual would have a chance to prosper. While it would alleviate suffering, my opponent's arugment centers on the idea that undue suffering is somehow \"good\", while the alleviation thereof is somehow \"evil\". 2. My opponent may be considering greater good; but he still proposes sacrificing some for others; when we don't know it's necessary, or who deserves to flourish, while others flounder. My proposal: \"Government isn't the solution... government is the problem\". To answer: 1. Eliminating government waste and politicans' pay the GDP would remain largely unaffected, 2. Once afforded the earliest opportunity, these poor and homeless people pay taxes on their earnings, like everyone else, 3. My point would necessitate the bill be proposed, & 4. Both Ezra's story, and Rehoboam's story oppose overtaxation; and Lev. 25:10 supports deductibility for the poor. 5. Charity engenders compassion, and alleviates excuses for crime. 5.5. Consider America, pre-WWII: There was no income tax... 6. I know what it's like to be homeless.",

I set this resolution like this on purpose (its based off a congress bill) but anyway all con has to do is show why not ALL churches should lose tax exemptions. In other words I can just say only rich churches should have tax exemptions removed but not poor churches or vice-versa. So yeah I agree with pro that rich churches shouldn't have tax exemptions, but I believe poor churches should so they can become a bigger church. As I pointed out a lot of these poor churches are also in poor communities so cannot receive as much of a offering and not donations. As I pointed out I go to one of these churches and we survive due to tax exemptions which is why I believe on RICH CHURCHES SHOULD HAVE TAX EMPTIONS REMOVED. Rich churches only use 3% to 10% of tax exemptions for charity anyway and they use the rest to get things like pools and basketball goals that other business have to pay taxes for but poor churches don't so I belive they should be allowed to have tax exemptions.",

            "premise": "We don't need a new tax code. We need to abolish the federal income tax. Point #1: Our most prosperous years as a nation were when we had a gold- and silver-backed monetary system, and no income tax. The first income tax was instituted to pay for the Civil War. The second income tax was essentially put in place for World War I. Any income taxation leads almost inevitably to war. Point #2: There's nothing, short of a constitutional amendment, that would ensure that a flat tax remained truly flat and remained low. Exemptions would make their way into the code. They always do. Even proposals I've seen for the flat tax would exempt various forms of income. What is \"income\" anyway? The very question of the definition leads to exemptions and loopholes that would constantly be lobbied for and fought over. In the end, the idle rich would still pay very little tax by shifting their \"income\" to non-taxable or tax-advantaged forms of income, while the hard-working productive class would face higher and higher taxes. Oh, and by the way: If we are going to have a constitutional amendment, it should be to repeal the 16th! Point #3: Any income taxation is immoral and establishes the notion that the government owns our labor, and \"generously\" allows us to keep a portion of it. It is, thus, akin to slavery. Why was our Constitution written in a manner in which income taxation was not permitted at the federal level? It took the 16th amendment to make income taxation legal. The founders knew that the income tax gave the government too much authority. For one, it empowers the federal government to manage a fiat-money currency, since our dollars have value (despite not being backed by gold or silver) because they are accepted as payment for taxes. Point #4: Why does there have to be just one taxation solution? If we accept that the federal government needs a source of income to fund its limited but necessary functions, then why can't it assess a population-based tax to the states (as the Constitution suggests), and then allow the states to determine their own methods of taxation? Some states may try a flat tax. Others, a progressive tax. Others, a sales tax or property tax, or combination of any or all. Even user fees and tolls could be tried out. The point is that if each state were allowed to raise its revenue its own way, this would increase the happiness of U.S. citizens, since they would be free to move to the state that had the most favorable tax system for their needs -- if their home-state's system was bad enough to justify the move. Furthermore, the \"best\" tax systems would win out, as businesses and productive citizens would move to the \"best\" states -- thereby encouraging other states to adopt the same tax program. A flat tax MIGHT be the best system -- I'm inclined to agree that it probably is -- but we should NOT have a national flat tax because we cannot know. This is the folly of central planning. For these reasons, I am against the flat tax.",

            "premise": "Thank you for that last post, I'm going to go down your last post to attack which simultaneously will rebuild my own case. Your first point makes a point of saying that the law restricts representatives from using their religion. I'm sorry, but I beg to differ. Here's the amendment regarding religion (I will post only the part pertaining to religion): \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" I will define establish according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: to institute (as a law) permanently by enactment or agreement. Therefore, so long as representatives are voting and debating (just a vote and some argumentation that doesn't infringe on anyone) instead of creating a theocracy, they're perfectly justified in exercising their religion. The point of a representative government is to represent the people. If the representatives don't represent, then they were elected in vain creating an oppressive government who allows people to elect people who want to vote the same way as them, but they're not allowed to because people that don't like religion said so. No law has created an official religion for the nation. People may use it as part of their personal belief system when voting, but no religion has been established. We still have a secular government. This swiftly moves into your examples. I noticed almost all of them were debate (not establishment) concerning the LGBT community, although I would disagree that this is uniquely religious. If you'd like some examples of secular arguments I can recommend a few articles. The debate concerning abortion and birth control is a scientific debate (if you disagree with me, you can challenge me to a secular debate on abortion another time). Drug legalization is a scientific and philosophical debate. Stem cell research and vaccinations are scientific debates. In the end, you're committing hasty generalizations concerning the arguments on these. To clarify my clarification, that's the small disagreement I have with you concerning the first amendment. I'm sorry for the confusion, but when I say \"when a god is not involved\" I mean to imply I'm actually debating under the premise that no god exists. It's the basis for my argument of metaethical moral relativism (considering the only universe where MMR can be true is the universe god does not exist in). I'd like to bring up a few logical fallacies in your paragraph attempting to justify your claim on science and morality. One is a false analogy that turns into a red herring and finishes in hasty generalization. The false analogy is your comparing a scientific method of morality to the first amendment regarding religion. There's no tie without some sort of scientific connection, which you did not provide and is not obvious. The red herring comes in when you start ranting about religion in government. The hasty generalization is that people voting their beliefs at the polls oppresses everyone else. I'm sorry, but that entire paragraph doesn't logically stand. I think you're still missing the point regarding purpose in your next attack against my arguments. I'm saying there is no god. Go ahead and check my profile, and you'll see I'm a Christian. I'm sorry if it's throwing you off that I'm using an argument which has the prerequisite that god does not exist, but that's the argument I'm using. You might not want to debate me in that, because you don't want to argue that god exists because if god exists then denying him the control of government is rebellion against him and therefore heretical. Either way my argument stands. If there's no purpose or ultimate consequence to anything we do, then morality is strictly subject to the individual. This makes it wrong for someone to vote any way other than what they believe is right. Regarding the second law of thermodynamics, I'd like to post something for a good understanding. \"The Second Law. Three popular formulations of this law are: \"Clausius: No process is possible, the sole result of which is that heat is trans- ferred from a body to a hotter one. \"Kelvin (and Planck): No process is pos- sible, the sole result of which is that a body is cooled and work is done. \"Carath\"odory: In any neighborhood of any state there are states that cannot be reached from it by an adiabatic process. \"All three formulations are supposed to lead to the entropy principle.\" http://www.ams.org... My point I this is a philosophical argument. According to the theory if entropy, all matter and energy is running down. This means eventually the world will end. That also means trying to further society into some sort of preferable humanity is illogical and pointless. Therefore a universal morality has no point. It has nothing to do with politics, it was related to my arguments concerning MMR. Your next argument asserts that belief in an afterlife is a faith. I believe you need to be made aware of something called the law of non-contradiction. You're arguing that god and an afterlife are not fact. This only helps my point regarding MMR. You're asserting that there's no ultimate judgement for actions or that there's no universal entity creating a standard. Thank you for understanding my point, but unfortunately you've just lifted up one of my points. I feel as if you're assuming I'm arguing for the existence of a deity, which I specifically said in my first post I wasn't going to do. \"The point of morality is to regulate a civilized society.\" Thank you for stating the purpose of law. Morality is a judgement of right and wrong, and without a universal judge, there are only individual judges. Those individual judges perceive morality, but it is not universal. You make more false analogies in your last argument. What does biology have to do with morality? How do chemical reactions in the brain cause morality? I think you're missing the psychology of personal experience and observation which then uses philosophy to determine morals. Science can't create morals, it can only help explain the chemical reactions that allows psychology to explain why each person has the morals they do. The point of my argument is that there is no universal morality, which then again, ties back into my MMR argument. Now in conclusion, there's still no reason that the elected shouldn't be allowed to represent the electors precisely the way a representative system is designed to. Thank you, and I can't wait for the next few rounds.",

If a religion is taxed less than another than that could be viewed as respecting an religion over another, which is against the first amendment. Also churches use the tithes as ways to build churches, temples, and/or meeting houses to areas that don't have such buildings. With taxes that could be prohibiting someone from worshiping by taking the money that could go toward building a church house and giving it to the government.

            "premise": "I would like to express my sincere thanks to frappe for accepting this challenge and for responding in such a eloquent and informed manner. I would also politely request the voters to acknowledge that my opponent extended me the courtesy of \"home ground\" in basing his rebuttals on the British, rather than the American, model of society: I certainly didn't anticipate this but I am very grateful. With regard to the role of churches in society, and the alleged benefits my opponent contends they provide, I would like to respond as follows: Con acknowledges that church attendance in Britain has decreased to a point whereby only a tiny fraction of citizens regularly attend church services, and those that do are mainly elderly which means that attendances is in terminal decline. Indeed, far more people obtain their spiritual sustenance from psychics, astrologers and fortune-tellers. These mystics and soothsayers provide spiritual comfort to their impressionable clients in exchange for money -they earn a living by giving their customers emotional support in exchange for cash, a bit like churches do, but unlike churches they pay tax on their income: when a punter crosses Rosie Lee's palm with silver, the crystal ball-gazing gypsy will dutifully record this financial transaction and scrupulously declare her full earnings when she diligently files her tax returns (gypsies are notoriously honest people) - and these taxes are used to benefit wider societies by paying for teachers, nurses, police officers and so on. Despite the lack of spiritual adherents though, the churches are making money hand over fist, mainly through their property investment portfolios: the Church of England alone netted a cool 19.1% on their \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd4.3 billion / $6.9 billion investments last year (1) - tax free, of course - but these windfalls do not benefit wider society at all because they either reinvest the money or spend it on providing themselves with munificent stipends and lavish, grace-in-favour accommodation. With reference to preserving historic buildings, the churches certainly have a moral responsibility to do this, but it is a responsibility they continually fail to discharge. The Church of England is one of the largest land-owners in Britain but if a parish church becomes uneconomic due to falling attendances, they will ruthlessly sell it off to the highest bidder. In rural areas, churches tend to be converted into luxury apartments (2) for affluent commuters while churches in urban areas are often converted into pubs: my old local pub in Muswell Hill, North London and also my old local pub when I lived in Aberdeen, Scotland were both formerly churches (3,4) - whereas in times gone by the vicar would have dispensed blessings the bartenders now dispense beers, wines and spirits from the same spot. Some parishioners may feel this is sacrilege, but the churches don't care about that: for them religion is all about one thing and one thing alone; cold, hard cash The poor and needy? Their welfare is the responsibility of the state and charities, not the churches, at least not as fare as they are concerned. Which brings me neatly to the issue of their charitable status. Charities are typically run by volunteers, with a small number of paid staff on modest incomes: and these employees certainly do not live in grand houses and drive flash cars like so many vicars and priests do. Indeed, in America where televangelism is a $2-3 billion, unregulated, untaxed industry, pastors are even more extravagant. For example, preacher Kenneth Copeland \"lives in an 18,000 square foot home outside Ft. Worth, Texas worth $6 million. It has beautiful water views that comes complete with a boat house. But that's not all. Copeland is an avid pilot, and his pride and joy is a $20 million Cessna Citation jet. It's the fastest private jet money can buy. He said he needed it to better serve the Lord, and proudly did a fly by for his followers after the church bought it.\" (5) If it was revealed that donations to a charity were being used to fund lavish lifestyles of charity workers rather than being spent on good causes, there would, quite rightly, be a public outcry and the organisation would, in all probability, loose it's charitable status. So what's so special about the church? Why are they allowed to use their income to feather their nests tax-free? The answer is undue reverence for an ancient institution that no longer has any relevance to the vast majority of people in 21st Century Britain. To conclude, I am not arguing that there is no place in society for religious organisations, merely that they should pay their way like any other for-profit organisation and that the should be subject to tax.

            "premise": "With thanks to AncientWisdom for his reply, I did, of course, realise that the numbers my opponent gave in his opening argument were merely arbitrary but, nevertheless, the formula remains the same whatever figures are used. The net result of a flat tax is that middle income earners remain largely unaffected while the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Let's say my opponent suggested that if a pack of braying toffs (a group of exuberant aristocrats) were to walk into a three Michelin star restaurant and order plateaux de fruits de mer, Chateau Briand steaks, fois gras salads, white truffle risottos and a jeroboam of vintage Champagne, and that the restaurant owner should give them their meals for free and take the cost of them out of the waitress' wages because it is only right and proper that the rich should be subsidised by the poor, I think (and sincerely hope) that you'd say that was immoral. However, my opponent didn't suggest that, but he did argue in favour of flat taxes, which amounts to the very same thing. You see, the reality on the ground with flat taxes is that the wealthy pay less tax while the poor have the essential public services that they rely upon withdrawn - so the rich are better off and the underprivileged are the ones that suffer as a result. Now, to say that money could be saved by axing the IRS doesn't begin to address the resulting shortfall in tax receipts that would result from the introduction of a flat tax. Indeed, since rich people really, really hate paying taxes and can afford to hire expert accountants to help them avoid paying them, the IRS is the one department that needs to be expanded not downsized: after all, it is the only major department that fills the government's coffers rather than depletes them. To address the distinction between income and property taxes, they exist in Europe as well as America and are often much hated by posh people because they argue that one person living in a large house has to pay the same tax as a whole family living in the same sized house next door. In my opinion, if the posh don't like it, they can always move to a smaller property, but of course they don't see it that way. Finally, the minimum wage was introduced to defend vulnerable workers from greedy, exploitative employers and should be kept. At the end of the day, the US or the UK could abolish the minimum wage but, in the global economy in which we all now operate, American or British factory workers couldn't possibly compete with workers doing the same jobs in China or India. I mean, could you bring up a family on a dollar a day if you live in Europe or America? I don't think so. For these reasons, the flat tax system should remain the ideal preserve of the privileged few and should not be implemented in democratic capitalist countries. Thank you.",

            "premise": "Thank you YYW for your prompt response last round. I'm going to attempt to quote portions of my opponent's arguments which are representative I larger portions of his argument. I'll elaborate on the quote when necessary. Impact to Individuals \"It would go equally to those with zero income and those who buy nothing in the course of a month, as well as to billionaires like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.\" By implication, the \"prebate\" proposed to correct for FT's inherent regressiveness amounts to the creation of a \"national welfare program\" \" It's funny that Warren Buffett is brought up here. Warren Buffett is commonly quoted as saying it's unfair his secretary pays a higher tax rate than him. This plan would actually fix those loopholes Buffett uses to avoid paying as much as his secretary. The prebate wouldn't amount to a national welfare. One of the reasons for the rebate ( besides providing a progressive tax element) is to insure nobody pays taxes on basic necessities. It doesn't matter if it's Bill Gates or a family living below the poverty level. Nobody should have to pay the government for the most basic stuff they need to survive. The prebate just happens to be the fairest and most economical way to insure nobody has to pay to live. Right now a family living at the poverty level pays 22 cents on every dollar they spend on imbedded taxes. This isn't even taking into account FICA social security etc. coming out of their payroll check. Under the FT plan, they would pay Zero percent. I repeat. Exempting people from paying taxes on basic necessities isn't welfare. It's just good policy. \"there is essentially no relationship between the rebate and the cost of living\" Actually there is. The prebate is based off of what somebody spends at poverty level. Poverty level spending is a cost of living index. The prebate does more than the current tax system to make sure families don't get taxed on basic necessities. The 22 percent imbedded tax is no longer there for poverty level spending. \"Even still, FT's revenue neutrality rests on the erroneous assumption that \"no matter how large a family's income, 100% of it is consumed every year,\" which is not the case. In reality, the percentage of a person's income being consumed by expenses falls as income rates rise.\" The FT revenue neutrality uses no such assumption. The plan exempts used goods from being taxed. Which is a key indicator that it isn't assuming 100% of income is taxed. Not to mention 100% of income not being used for tax exempt things, such as used cars, used houses, thrift shop purchases etc.. One of the attributes of the plan often promoted by FT proponents, is the fact that savings and investments will be untaxed. These are things not included in the calculations used to determine if it was revenue neutral. Even if we forget about what I just stated, money earned is typically spent at some point. If the millionaire doesn't spend his money then his unappreciative children or grandchildren will blow his money after he dies. Hell Paris Hilton isn't even waiting for her dad to die to blow his money. \"By implication, were FT was implemented, however, retirees who supplement their income with savings accumulated during a time when personal income was taxed would in effect be subject to double taxation\" This is only during the adjustment phase, and remember the prices already include an imbedded tax, so they are double taxed anyway. If you take away that 22% imbedded tax, add in the 23% fair tax and take into consideration the prebate than retirees are actually coming out ahead. Let's not forget retirees actually are triple taxed in the current system anyway. They get the tax on investments, typically taken out immediately or upon withdrawing. They also are responsible for corporate taxes because they're share holders, plus they pay that imbedded tax. I'll take double taxation over triple taxation any day. \"the FT's implementation would disproportionally harm young workers in the process of establishing their livelihoods as they purchase first cars, homes and pay for childcare.\" Most young workers just starting out would buy used homes and cars. These are things exempt from the fair tax. As far as child care is concerned, the imbedded taxes would be removed from that and a lot of subsidies already in place to help families afford child care would remain in place. There would be minimal to no impact on these individuals. \"an enormous shift in the tax burden from the wealthy to those with lower and middle incomes.\" Nope, even if Uncle Sam isn't taxing your paycheck, you still pay that 22% imbedded tax and with the prebate that would kill any taxes you paid on products up to the poverty level. So in reality poor people would pay zero taxes as opposed to the 22% imbedded tax and the payroll tax. Faulty Economic Logic \". The reality is that you can't have both gains in post-tax income and depreciating prices once embedded taxes are vacated,\" That's just a misunderstanding of what FT proponents are saying. Once the FT is implemented prices would immediately increase by the 30%. Obviously companies will try not to reduce prices once the tax is implemented, so they can easily keep their profit margin. However once their competitors start making market share grabs, the price will settle back to what it originally was before the FT was implemented. Incomes should remain the same. However the prebate when factored in would mean that less of your money will go to pay taxes. The FT is dangerous \"what is there to prevent a [federal] income tax from being from being imposed after a national sales tax has been enacted?\" Nothing! There is actually systems in place to insure this doesn't happen here is a quote from the following website.http://www.fairtax.org... \"No current supporter of the FairTax would support the FairTax unless the entire income tax is repealed. Moreover, concurrent with the repeal of the income tax, a constitutional amendment repealing the 16th Amendment and prohibiting an income tax will be pushed through Congress for ratification by the states (filed as HJR 16 in the 110th Congress).\" So this the FT has a companion bill that always goes to vote with it. If a fairtax got implemented, we wouldn't end up with some 2 headed snake. \"Similarly, due to the increased transactional costs the FT would impose on state and local government, it is entirely foreseeable that the FT would actually necessitate states increasing their income tax rates just to achieve revenue neutrality. \" This isn't true either. The fairtax actually doesn't require states to collect it on the federal governments behalf. If states do collect it they will be paid a portion of the taxes collected to make up for the cost of collecting it. http://www.fairtax.org... I actually did this argument at the last minute. I hope this rushed first draft is easy to read and comprehend.",

            "premise": "1) The US government is not the end all of what is and isn't a religion. In fact, for the very reason that the first amendment keeps them neutral on the issue they should be the last place to go to determine what is and isn't a religion. The tax exempt status of churches, in general, is a complete farce. Scientology does have tax exempt status as a religious organization, however, this is due to a massive illegal operation on their part. http://www.cs.cmu.edu... \"Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig into the private lives of IRS officials and to conduct surveillance operations to uncover potential vulnerabilities, according to interviews and documents. One investigator said he had interviewed tenants in buildings owned by three IRS officials, looking for housing code violations. He also said he had taken documents from an IRS conference and sent them to church officials and created a phony news bureau in Washington to gather information on church critics. The church also financed an organization of IRS whistle-blowers that attacked the agency publicly.\" Scientology had something in the range of 200 suits against the IRS and personnel. Many believe that the impromptu meeting between the leader of Scientology and the head of the IRS to drop the suits (which probably would have cost a lot to deal with) in exchange for tax exempt status was the pivotal reason they have tax exempt status today; not because they are a religion. So we see, not only is the government a bad arbiter. Their decision on the issue had more to do with not wanting to be constantly attacked by Scientologists than it did with the merits. 2. Just having a bevy of B actors doesn't make a religion popular. Scientology treats the actors differently than the standard minions, so in a fairly technical sense, the famous people have a different religion where everybody treats them like deities as they lure in others. The actors are exposed more gingerly to the activities, beliefs, programs, and treated far better. >>\"the premise I'm trying to prove here is that they 1. Are not a religion. and 2.The people who get lured into it destroy their lives.\" I concede the first point, which contradicts the topic and clearly concedes the argument. The second point is a little more nuanced. Most people leave within a year after one or two sessions and thousands more don't actually have their lives destroyed and live happily as Scientologists. Certainly they have managed to kill people like Lisa McPherson, but how are you judging the impact? Christianity has lead to the death of millions. Islam has lead to a fair number of deaths as well. Catholic priests get juggled about by the Church when they get a bit too touchy with the kids (ruining thousands of lives in the process). You need to establish that they are a religion, they are popular, and not simple \"bad\", but the \"worst\".* * I concede that they exist so \"existence\" is not required.",
